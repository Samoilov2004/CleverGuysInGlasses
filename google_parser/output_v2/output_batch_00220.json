Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \n1. Field of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides drug conjugates in which an antibody or other targeting agent (e.g. a targeting moiety) is linked to a drug through a linker (e.g. a non-cleavable linker). In one embodiment, the drug acts on an extracellular target. These conjugates are useful in the treatment of disease and/or as a tool in the evaluation of biological systems. The invention relates to the fields of biology, chemistry, medicinal chemistry, medicine, molecular biology, and pharmacology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Description of Related Disclosures\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll fundamental biological processes, including development, immunity, and tumorigenesis, are related to the selective and differential expression of genes in different tissues and cell types. For example, the formation of many malignant tumors has been shown to be associated with the production and/or expression of certain specific cell surface signaling molecules. One of the goals of modern molecular medicine is to find ways to target drugs selectively to reduce or eliminate the drug's off target toxic effects. Delivering drugs to a specific target that is unique to or expressed at higher levels in diseased cells types using targeting moieties such as antibodies, peptides or aptamers has been tried. Attaching these targeting moieties directly to the drug through linkers or to nanoparticles has also been tried.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne such drug targeting system is termed, “antibody drug conjugates” or ADC for short has been studied intensively since 1985 (see, for example, U.S. patent publication No. 2009/0220529, incorporated herein by reference). Members of this class of targeted therapeutics are composed of an antibody specific to an antigen, a drug or drugs that act intracellularly, and a linker that connects the antibody to the drug(s). To make ADCs, a wide array of antibodies, linkers, and drugs have been combined and tested in a continuing effort to identify antibodies that specifically target certain cell types and release active drug only upon binding and internalization. Unfortunately, a number of technical difficulties have been encountered with the ADC approach, including the difficulty of finding a means to link the antibody and drug where the linker is stable in the circulatory structure but “unstable” once the ADC has bound to its target or has been internalized into the target cell. Drug release in the circulatory structure before the antibody binds its target or is internalized can lead to undesired toxicity or off target effects. Failure to release the drug after the antibody-target binding or internalization can lead to reduced efficacy. In addition, the linkage must be such that the drug is in an active form when released. Together, these requirements impose considerable design constraints. So it is not surprising that, in all examples to date, ADCs require some sort of separation of the drug from the antibody. In addition, there have been no cases to date where the target for the drug is in close enough proximity to the antibody's target where both the linked drug and antibody act simultaneously. In all cases, acceptable cytotoxicity of an ADC was realized only if some sort of membrane penetration by the drug occurred. In these cases the drug was either released from the conjugate at the target site outside of the cell (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,475,092) or after the complete conjugate was internalized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother difficulty encountered with the approach relates to how much active drug can be delivered to a target inside the cell by the ADC. Generally, there are only a small number of copies of each different disease-specific antigen binding site at the cell surface, and the number of drug molecules that can be linked to a single antibody without interfering with antigen (target) binding is relatively low (between 5 to 10 per antibody). These two factors in combination have made the ADC approach practical only when very potent (typically very toxic) drugs are used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother difficulty encountered with the approach relates to multidrug resistance mechanisms of internalized drugs. For example, cancer cells have the ability to become resistant to multiple different drugs, and share many of the same mechanisms, which include increased efflux of drug (as by P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated protein, lung resistance-related protein, and breast cancer resistance protein and reproductive cancer resistance protein; enzymatic deactivation (i.e., glutathione conjugation); and decreased permeability (drugs cannot enter the cell). Because efflux is a significant contributor for multidrug resistance in cancer cells, current research is aimed at blocking specific efflux mechanisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another drawback with the ADC approach is that the targets have been limited to targets that internalize upon ADC binding. In some cases, even though the target for the ADC exists on the cell surface, internalization does not occur. This makes the ADC approach cell type specific and target specific. Complicating this even further are the cases where the target is expressed and internalization occurs, but the internalization is within compartments where drug antibody dissociation does not occur, leaving the drug ineffective.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGiven all these constraints, it is not surprising that Mylotarg [the only ADC approved by the FDA for human therapeutic use (see Hamann, Bioconjug Chem, 13: 40-46, 2002)] was recently removed from the market due to limited efficacy, and no other ADC has been approved to date. Therefore, there continues to be a need for improved ADCs that circumvent these requirements and/or overcome the difficulties and drawbacks of existing methods. The present invention meets that need.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, the present invention relates to a new technology to deliver therapeutic agents selectively (e.g. to antigens) and provides a new class of antibody drug conjugate (ADC) as well as other drug conjugates using targeting agents, which may be termed Extracellular-targeted Drug Conjugates (EDCs). In various embodiments, the present invention provides these EDCs, which are a new type of drug conjugate, as well as other compositions and drug delivery systems. In various embodiments, 1) the EDC of the invention remains intact or non-dissociated to be most effective, 2) the EDC of the invention works extracellularly, and 3) the agent and the targeting moiety bind to two or more targets or the same target. Thus, in one embodiment, to obtain maximal therapeutic effect, the linker of the EDC remains intact, internalization does not occur, and the targeting moiety and the agent work in concert together to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a first aspect, the invention provides an EDC in which the therapeutic agent is covalently linked to a targeting moiety (e.g. an antibody) through a stable (and, in some embodiments, non-cleavable) linker that remains intact and uncleaved for the EDC to exert its maximal therapeutic effect. In one embodiment, the targeting moiety of the EDC targets an extracellular target, and the target of the agent of the EDC is extracellular. In another embodiment, the target targeted by the targeting moiety of the ADC is also the target of the therapeutic agent. In another embodiment, the target for the targeting moiety resides within a complex that includes the target for the agent. In other embodiments, the targets of the therapeutic agent and targeting moiety are different and not associated in a macromolecular complex but are located on the cell surface in close proximity to one another. Thus, in various embodiments, the targeting moiety's target is distinct from the target of the therapeutic agent, but the two targets exist within close proximity such that the targeting moiety and agent act in concert or even synergistically with one another. Thus, the EDC of the invention is generally only therapeutically effective when both the targeting moiety's and agent's targets are in close proximity to one another. In one embodiment, the linker in an EDC of the invention is a non-cleavable polyethylene glycol linker. In one embodiment of an EDC of the invention, a single agent is attached to a single targeting moiety through a stable or non-cleavable linker, and the targeting moiety and drug bind to their targets and/or act simultaneously or substantially simultaneously. In one embodiment, the activity of the EDC can be regulated by the length of the non-cleavable linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a second aspect, the invention provides a composition that comprises, or alternatively consists or consists essentially of, as an active ingredient, an EDC of the invention. In one embodiment, the composition is a pharmaceutical formulation suitable for parenteral, including but not limited to intravenous, administration. In one embodiment, the invention provides pharmaceutical formulations that comprise, or alternatively consist or consist essentially of, an EDC of the invention in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, vector, diluent, and/or excipient. In other embodiments, the invention provides compositions that contain, in addition to an EDC of the invention, at least one other active pharmaceutical ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical formulations of the invention can be used in vivo for preventive, ameliorative, and/or curative purposes for diseases or disorders. Non-limiting examples of diseases or disorders for which the pharmaceutical formulations according to the invention may be used include cancers, metastases, cellular apoptosis disorders, degenerative diseases, tissue ischemia, infectious diseases of a viral, bacterial or fungal nature, inflammation disorders, diabetes and pathological neo-angiogenesis. Thus, in accordance with the methods of the invention, a subject can be treated with a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound or composition according to the invention. In one embodiment of the invention, the subject is a human subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in a third aspect, the invention provides methods for treating a disease or other medical condition by administering to a patient in need of treatment a therapeutically effective dose of an EDC or other compound or pharmaceutical composition of the invention. The methods, compounds, and compositions of the invention are generally useful for the treatments of medical conditions where therapeutic agents specific to extracellular targets are administered. In various embodiments, the invention provides methods for treating or preventing a disorder selected from the group consisting of cellular proliferative and/or differentiative disorders, disorders associated with bone metabolism, immune disorders, hematopoietic disorders, cardiovascular disorders, liver disorders, kidney disorders, muscular disorders, neurological disorders, hematological disorders, viral infections, pain, and metabolic disorders. In one embodiment, the invention provides methods for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a fourth aspect, the invention provides novel cardiac glycosides (e.g. CEN09-106 or CEN10-110) that are anti-cancer agents, and the invention also provides EDCs comprising these cardiac glycosides, pharmaceutical compositions comprising these cardiac glycosides or EDCs comprising them, and methods for their manufacture and use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a fifth aspect, the invention provides methods for the manufacture of the compounds, EDCs, and compositions of the invention, including the use of the EDC compounds and compositions for the formulation and preparation of biological, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and agricultural products. In one embodiment, the invention pertains to uses of the compounds of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for treating a disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a sixth aspect, the invention provides methods of treating a disease with an EDC of the invention in combination with one or more other therapeutics such that the combination acts to enhance or magnify one or more therapeutic effects, as compared to the use of either therapeutic alone.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n shows antibody-linker-biotin binding to peptide of sequence 24-39 of \nSEQ ID NO\n 1 after the addition of the antibody-linker-biotin conjugates at the indicated concentrations.

To facilitate an understanding of the invention, this detailed description is divided into sections. Section I provides definitions of terms used in this disclosure. Section II describes targeting moieties useful in the EDCs of the invention. Section III describes linkers useful in the EDCs of the invention. Section IV describes therapeutic agents useful in the invention. Section V describes particular embodiments of the EDCs of the invention. Section VI describes pharmaceutical formulations of the inventions and methods for administering them to treat disease and other medical conditions. The detailed description of the invention is followed by a set of examples that illustrate useful methods and EDCs of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Provisional Application Nos. 61/240,775, 61/289,811, and 61/345,820, and all other patents, patent applications, and references from the scientific literature cited herein, are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.\n\n\n \nI. Definitions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe term “aldehyde tag” or “ald-tag” is a peptide or peptidomimetic that contains an amino acid sequence derived from a sulfatase motif that is capable of being converted, or which has been converted, by action of a formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) to contain a 2-formylglycine residue (referred to herein as “FGly”). The FGly residue generated by an FGE is often referred to in the literature as a “formylglycine”, although this is technically incorrect. Thus, “aldehyde tag”, as used herein, can refer to an amino acid sequence comprising an “unconverted” sulfatase motif (i.e., a sulfatase motif in which the cysteine or serine residues has not been converted to FGly by an FGE, but is capable of being converted) or to an amino acid sequence comprising a “converted” sulfatase motif (i.e., a sulfatase motif in which the cysteine or serine residues have been converted to FGly by action of an FGE).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “amino acid” refers to naturally occurring and non-natural amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are not encoded by the genetic code and those that are modified form of encoded amino acids, e.g., beta-alanine, D-serine, hydroxyproline, .gamma.-carboxygluta mate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs are compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., a carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, or various R groups making non-naturally occurring amino acids (e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium). Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified backbones, but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, e.g. beta amino acids, amino acids in D conformation. Amino acid mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid, but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antibody” refers to a protein or mixture of proteins that comprise one or more peptidic chains encoded by immunoglobulin genes or fragments thereof that specifically bind and recognize an epitope of an antigen. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. Typically, the antigen-binding region of an antibody will be most critical in specificity and affinity of binding. The antibodies comprise IgG (including IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, and IgG\n4\n), IgA (including IgA\n1 \nand IgA\n2\n), IgD, IgE, or IgM, and IgY. As used herein, the term “antibody” is meant to include whole antibodies, including single-chain antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments thereof. Antibodies can also be antigen binding antibody fragments and include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab′ and F(ab′)\n2\n, Fd, single-chain Fvs (scFv), single-chain antibodies, disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv), diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, minibodies, and fragments comprising either a V\nL \nor V\nH \ndomain, and Nanobodies (see PCT publication number WO 94/04678 and Nature Medicine, V9 (1) pp 129-134, 2003). An antibody can be from any animal origin including birds and mammals. Typically, antibodies in commercial or research use are human, murine, rabbit, goat, guinea pig, camelidae (e.g., camel, llamas) horse, or chicken antibodies. “Antibodies”, as used herein, includes monoclonal, immunoadsorbed polyclonal, chimeric, and humanized antibodies, as well as intact antibodies and isolated antibodies. Antibodies can be monospecific, bispecific, trispecific or greater multispecificity.\n\n\n \n \nThe term “antibody drug conjugate” or “ADC” refers to an antibody linked to a therapeutic agent (sometimes referred to herein as agent, drug, or active pharmaceutical ingredient) or agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “extracellular-targeted drug conjugate” or “EDC” refers to a drug conjugate of the invention in which an antibody or other targeting moiety that targets an extracellular target is linked via a stable or non-cleavable linker to a drug that binds to an extracellular target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antigen” refers to the substance or target that an antibody or targeting moiety binds. An antigen is characterized by its ability to be “bound” by the antibody or targeting moiety. Antigen can also mean the substance used to elicit the production of targeting moieties, such as the production of antigen specific antibodies through immunizing with the antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antigen binding site” or “epitope” refers to the portion of the antigen to which a targeting moiety, such as an antibody, binds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “aptamer” refers to a DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotide mimetic that is a targeting moiety and can be the functional equivalent of an antibody and specifically binds and recognizes an epitope of an antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “binding affinity” refers to the strength of interaction between an antibody (or other targeting moiety or drug or other agent) and its antigen (or target) as a function of its association and dissociation constants. Higher affinities typically mean that the targeting moiety has a fast on rate (association) and a slow off rate (dissociation). Binding affinities can change under various physiological conditions and changes that occur to the antigen or antibody/targeting moiety under those conditions. Binding affinities of the targeting moiety can also change when therapeutic agents and/or linkers are attached. Binding affinities can also change when slight changes occur to the antigen, such as changes in the amino acid or glycosylation of the antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cancer” refers to any of a number of diseases characterized by uncontrolled, abnormal proliferation of cells, the ability of affected cells to spread locally or through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body (i.e., metastasize), as well as any of a number of characteristic structural and/or molecular features. A “cancerous cell” or “cancer cell” is understood as a cell having specific structural properties, which can lack differentiation and be capable of invasion and metastasis. Examples of cancers are, breast, lung, brain, bone, liver, kidney, colon, and prostate cancer (see DeVita, V. et al. (eds.), 2005, Cancer Principles and Practice of Oncology, 6th. Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa., incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “chimeric antibodies” refers to antibodies in which the Fc constant region of a monoclonal antibody from one species (typically a mouse) is replaced, using recombinant DNA techniques, with an Fc region from an antibody of another species (typically a human). For example, a cDNA encoding a murine monoclonal antibody is digested with a restriction enzyme selected specifically to remove the sequence encoding the Fc constant region, and the equivalent portion of a cDNA encoding a human Fc constant region is substituted. A CDR-grafted antibody is an antibody in which at least one CDR of a so-called “acceptor” antibody is replaced by a CDR “graft” from a so-called “donor” antibody possessing desirable antigen specificity. Generally the donor and acceptor antibodies are monoclonal antibodies from different species; typically the acceptor antibody is a human antibody (to minimize its antigenicity in a human), in which case the resulting CDR-grafted antibody is termed a “humanized” antibody. The graft may be of a single CDR (or even a portion of a single CDR) within a single V\nH \nor V\nL \nof the acceptor antibody, or can be of multiple CDRs (or portions thereof) within one or both of the V\nH \nand V\nL\n. Methods for generating CDR--grafted and humanized antibodies are taught by Queen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089, U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,761 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762; and Winter U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539, which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “close proximity” refers to two targets X and Y that are in physical proximity such that when a targeting moiety (to X) and therapeutic agent (to Y) are conjugated through a linker, the conjugate induces a desired biological or medical response. In one embodiment, the biological or medical response achieved is greater than that observed by either the targeting moiety or therapeutic agent alone. In another embodiment, the biological or medical response achieved is greater than that observed by the additive effects of the targeting moiety and therapeutic agent. In another embodiment, where X and Y are on the same molecule, the targets are in “close proximity” to each other. In one embodiment, when X and Y are located on different molecules, but the molecules are present in the same multi-molecular complex, the targets are in “close proximity” as defined herein. In another embodiment, when X and Y are on the same cell within 200 or fewer Angstroms from one another, the targets are in “close proximity” to one another. When X and Y are on different cells (that are not within 200 Angstroms or less apart from one another), they are not in “close proximity”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “circulatory structure” refers to body fluids, interstitial fluid, lymph and blood of a mammal, including tissues of the circulatory system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “FXYDS”, “dysadherin”, “ATPase subunit gamma 5”, or “gamma 5” are used interchangeably herein and refer to the gamma subunit 5 of the Na,K-ATPase ion pump complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “epitope” refers to groupings of molecules such as amino acid residues or sugar side chains at the surface of antigens that usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics, and that are capable of specific binding by a monoclonal antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “extracellular” refers to proteins, antigens, or epitopes located on the external portion of a cell membrane or are in the fluids of the circulatory structure (for example, angiotensin converting enzyme is an extracellular protein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “intact antibody” comprises at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as HCVR or V\nH\n) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH\n1\n, CH\n2 \nand CH\n3\n. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as LCVR\nX \nor V\nL\n) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, C\nL\n. The V\nH \nand V\nL \nregions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each V\nH \nand V\nL \nis composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxyl-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR\n1\n, FR\n2\n, CDR\n2\n, FR\n3\n, CDR\n3\n, FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies can mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system. Examples of binding fragments include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the V\nL\n, V\nH\n, CL and CH\n1 \ndomains; (ii) a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the V\nH \nand CH\n1 \ndomains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., Nature 341: 544-546, 1989), which consists of a V\nH \ndomain; and (vi) an isolated complementarily determining region (CDR).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “hetereobifunctional linker” refers to a linker with different reactive groups at either end, enabling sequential conjugation between two different functional groups in proteins and other molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “extracellular target” refers to a target, such as a protein, antigen, and/or epitope located on the cell membrane. For example and without limitation, the following are extracellular targets: cell surface receptors, cell surface ion channels, CD (cluster of differentiation or designation) abbreviated proteins. More specifically, and again without limitation, the following are extracellular targets: transmembrane protein gp41, angiotensin converting enzyme, Apo2L/TRAIL, podoplanin, Eag1, MCT1, integrin, and gangliosides. Generally, the targets for the targeting moiety and therapeutic agents of the EDCs of the invention are both extracellular targets on the outer surface of the cell membrane. However, in some embodiments the therapeutic may bind to a target embedded in (for example an ion-channel blocker) the cell membrane. Targets that are not generally considered extracellular targets include, for example, chromosomal DNA, mRNA, tRNA, mTOR kinase, DNA and RNA polymerases, transcription factors, tubulin, and actin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “linker” refers to a chemical moiety or bond that covalently attaches two or more molecules, such as a targeting moiety and a drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “linker spacer group” refers to atoms in the linker that provide space between the two molecules joined by the linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody” refers to a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition. A monoclonal antibody composition displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope. The term “human monoclonal antibody” refers to antibodies displaying a single binding specificity which have variable and constant regions (if present) derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. Human monoclonal antibodies can be produced by a hybridoma which includes a B cell obtained from a transgenic non-human animal, e.g., a transgenic mouse, having a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene and a light chain transgene fused to an immortalized cell, although the term “monoclonal antibody” is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term “monoclonal antibody” refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced. Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma, recombinant, and phage display technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “modified antibodies” refers to antibodies, such as monoclonal antibodies, chimeric antibodies, and humanized antibodies, which have been modified by, e.g., deleting, adding, or substituting portions of the antibody. For example, an antibody can be modified by deleting the constant region and replacing it with a constant region meant to increase half-life, e.g., serum half-life, stability or affinity of the antibody. Multiple molecules of a therapeutic agent or multiple different agents can be coupled to one antibody molecule. For example, different moieties can be coupled to an antibody molecule via the same linker, or multiple linkers that provide multiple sites for attachment (e.g., dendrimers) can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “non-cleaved” and “uncleaved” refer to an EDC composition at any point in time in which the majority (for example, >50%, >60%, >70% or >80%) of EDC components present are intact, i.e., the linker used to attach the agent to the targeting moieties has not been cleaved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “non-cleavable linker” refers to a stable linker that has the property of being more stable in vivo than either the therapeutic or the targeting moiety under the same physiological conditions. Examples of non-cleavable linkers include linkers that contain polyethylene glycol chains or polyethylene chains that are not acid or base sensitive (such as hydrazone containing linkers), are not sensitive to reducing or oxidizing agents (such as those containing disulfide linkages), and are not sensitive to enzymes that may be found in cells or circulatory system. Specific examples of non-cleavable linkers include SMCC linker (US Patent Application 20090202536). For illustrative purposes, examples of cleavable linkers include linkers that contain non-hindered glutathione sensitive disulfides, esters, peptide sequences sensitive to the peptidases such as cathepsin or plasmin, pH sensitive hydrazones [see \nBioconjugate Chem., \n2010, 21 (1), pp 5-13]. Specific examples of cleavable linkers include non-hindered disulfide linker SPP (US Patent Application 20090202536). In various embodiments, a non-cleavable linker has one or more of the following properties that can be readily characterized experimentally: 1) the non-cleavable linker remains relatively intact keeping the therapeutic agent attached to the targeting moiety for extended periods of time (e.g., between at least about 2 to 8 hours, or at least 1 to 5 days, or at least 5 to about 30 days) under physiological conditions; 2) the non-cleavable linker is stable to enzymes, e.g. in the circulatory structure; 3) the non-cleavable linker allows the EDC to maintain activity even after it has acted on a target on a cell; 4) the non-cleavable linker does not negatively interfere with the binding activity or specificity of the targeting moiety; and/or 5) the non-cleavable linker does not negatively interfere with the activity of the therapeutic agent. Attachment of a stable or non-cleavable linker may have an effect on a therapeutic agent; for example, the cytotoxicity of a cytoxic agent may be decreased (but, in the EDCs of the invention, is not eliminated) by linker attachment. Any decrease in activity caused by linker attachment, however, is more than offset by an increased therapeutic efficacy of the EDC comprising the linker and agent. Thus, the agent attached to the targeting moiety via the non-cleavable or stable linker displays benefits over the agent alone. Such benefits may include solubility, lower toxicity, improved pharmacokinetics, and/or increased therapeutic efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “non-internalizing targeting moiety” or “non-internalizing antibody” refer to a targeting moiety or antibody, respectively, that has the property of reacting (binding) under physiological conditions (at 37° C. and pH 7) in vivo or in vitro, to antigens outside of a cell, within the circulatory structure, or on a cell surface, and that, when bound to its target antigen, does not enter the cell and become degraded in the lysosome (see Cancer Res 2009;69(6) 2358-64). In one embodiment, the targeting moiety or antibody, when bound to its target antigen, does not enter the cell and become internalized in an endosome. The target of a “non-internalizing targeting moiety” or “non-internalizing antibody” is referred to herein as a “non-internalizing target,” which is a target that does not get internalized into the lysosome as a result of binding to a targeting moiety or antibody. Non-internalizing targets may, however, become internalized into the cell in other biological processes. Examples of non-internalizing targets include, but are not limited to CD20, CD21, and CD72. For illustrative purposes, “internalizing targets” include, for example and without limitation, CD79, and CD22.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “non-internalizing therapeutic agent” refers to a therapeutic agent (drug) that has the property of reacting in physiological conditions (at 37° C. and pH 7) in vivo or in vitro, with its target (typically, via binding to its receptor) without being internalized into cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polyclonal antibody” refers to a preparation of more than one (two or more) different antibodies to an antigen. Such a preparation includes antibodies binding to a range of different antigen binding sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “pharmaceutically effective amount” and “effective amount” in the context of an amount of drug delivered refer to an amount of a drug that can induce a desired biological or medical response in a tissue, system, animal, or human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “peptide”, “polypeptide”, peptidomimetic and “protein” are used, somewhat interchangeably, to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residues is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers. These terms also encompass the term “antibody”. “Peptide” is often used to refer to polymers of fewer amino acid residues than “polypeptides” or “proteins”. A protein can contain two or more polypeptides, which may be the same or different from one another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “receptor” refers to an extracellular target protein molecule, embedded in either the plasma membrane or the cytoplasm of a cell, to which one or more specific kinds of signaling molecules may bind. Each cell typically has many receptors, of many different kinds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “substantially simultaneously” refers to two or more events that occur at the same time or within a relatively narrow time frame. In various embodiments, substantially simultaneously refers to two or more events that occur within about 60, about 40, about 30, about 20, about 10, about 5, about 2 or about 1 second of each other. For example, EDCs of the invention have properties such that targeting moiety binding and agent (drug) action happen substantially simultaneously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “stable in the circulatory structure” refers to the property of a compound, such as an EDC, to resist degradation and means that, for example, less than about 50%, or less than about 20%, or typically less than about 2%, of the compound is degraded or cleaved in the circulating blood at about 37° C. for at least about 2 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “stable linker” refers to a linker that remains stable and intact until the conjugate has been delivered or transported to the target site—a stable linker remains covalently attached to the two molecules it links—in physiological conditions (at 37° C. and pH 7) in vivo or in vitro for a period of time sufficient to allow the EDC to reach the target(s) and bind to the target(s). Thus, a stable linker is generally stable within the circulatory structure (generally means below 5% degradation after at least a 2 hour period and, in some embodiments, at least 4, 8, 16, or 24 hour periods). A stable linker maybe cleaved by enzymes or physiological conditions (such as differing pH's) inside a cell, tissue, or organ. Examples of “stable” linkers include non-cleavable linkers, but stable linkers can be cleavable, so long as they generally aren't cleaved in vivo prior to the EDC reaching and binding to its target(s). For example, stable linkers can contain hindered glutathione sensitive disulfides, peptide sequences sensitive to the peptidases such as cathepsin, or pH sensitive hydrazones [see \nBioconjugate Chem., \n2010, 21 (1), pp 5-13 and Clin. Cancer Res. 2005 11(2 Pt 1):843-52]. Thus a stable linker can be a cleavable linker but only if the linker is not cleaved prior to the EDC that contains such linker reaching its target(s). For example, a cathepsin cleavable linker is a stable linker, because cathepsin is only found in the lysosome which is intracellular. Examples of unstable linkers are linkers that contain ester or acyl hydrazone linkages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “synergistically” refers to an effect of two or more agents when used in combination that is greater than the sum of the effects of both agents when used alone. For example, in the EDCs of the invention, the combined therapeutic effects of the interaction of the targeting moiety and the agent (drug) when linked through a linker are greater than the combined individual effects of the targeting moiety and agent when used alone. “Effects” can refer either to binding, therapeutic effect, and/or specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “target” refers to the protein, glycoprotein, antigen, carbohydrate or nucleic acid to which a targeting moiety binds and also refers to the protein, glycoprotein, antigen, carbohydrate or nucleic acid to which a therapeutic agent binds. The agent and targeting moiety may bind to different targets in a “target complex”, where “target complex” refers to two or more molecules, such as the different subunits of a multi-subunit protein or two different proteins in a multi-protein complex, that are in close physical proximity with one another in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “target cells” refers to the cells that are involved in a pathology and so are preferred targets for therapeutic activity. Target cells can be, for example and without limitation, one or more of the cells of the following groups: primary or secondary tumor cells (the metastases), stromal cells of primary or secondary tumors, neoangiogenic endothelial cells of tumors or tumor metastases, macrophages, monocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes, and polynuclear agents infiltrating the tumors and the tumor metastases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe interchangeable terms “targeting moiety” and “targeting agent” refer to an antibody, aptamer, peptide, or other substance that binds specifically to a target. A targeting moiety may be an antibody targeting moiety (e.g. antibodies or fragments thereof) or a non-antibody targeting moiety (e.g. aptamers, peptides, or other substances that bind specifically to a target).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “target tissue” refers to target cells (e.g., tumor cells) and cells in the environment of the target cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “therapeutic agent” and “drug” and “agent” are used herein to refer to a compound that, when present in a therapeutically effective amount, upon binding to a site of action, produces a therapeutic effect, and whose site of action is located or whose effect will be exerted on the surface or inside target cells. By way of example, a therapeutic agent may be a chemical agent, such as an antibiotic or anti-cancer agent, a polypeptide, a protein, or a nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “therapeutic effect” refers to the reduction, elimination, and/or prevention of a disease, symptoms of the disease, or side effects of a disease in a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “to increase the half-life time” means to increase the mean residence time of a compound, typically a therapeutic agent, in the blood or to reduce the blood or plasmatic clearance compared to a reference compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “treating” and “treatment” are used interchangeably to refer to the administration of a therapeutic agent or composition to a patient who has a disease or disorder (e.g., cancer or metastatic cancer), a symptom of disease or disorder or a predisposition toward a disease or disorder, with the purpose to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve or affect the disease or disorder, the symptoms of the disease or disorder, or the predisposition toward disease. “Treating” or “treatment” of cancer or metastatic cancer refers to the treatment or amelioration or prevention of a cancer, including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement; remission; diminishing of symptoms or making the disease condition more tolerable to the patient; slowing in the rate of degeneration or decline; or making the final point of degeneration less debilitating. The treatment or amelioration of symptoms can be based on objective or subjective parameters, including the results of an examination by a physician. Accordingly, the term “treating” includes the administration of a therapeutic agent to prevent or delay, to alleviate, or to arrest or inhibit development of the symptoms or conditions associated with a disease, including but not limited to neoplastic disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “tumor specific antigen” refers to proteins or other molecules that are unique to a tumor or is at least more abundant on tumor cells, relative to normal cells.\n\n\n \n \nII. Antibodies and other Targeting Moieties\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides EDCs comprising a targeting moiety linked to a therapeutic agent via a stable or non-cleavable linker (i.e., a linker that has to be intact or non-cleaved for the EDC to exert its maximal therapeutic effect) and methods employing these EDCs to deliver therapeutic agents more selectively to target cells or a target tissue. Thus, in all embodiments, the EDC contains a targeting moiety that binds to an extracellular target, and while attached to a therapeutic agent via a stable or non-cleavable linker, exerts a therapeutic effect. In some embodiments, the targeting moiety and therapeutic agent bind to or act on different extracellular targets. In other embodiments, the targeting moiety and the therapeutic agent bind to or act on the same target and are attached to each other via a stable or non-cleavable linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe targeting moiety of the EDCs of the invention directs the EDC to the target cell or target tissue that contains the target of the targeting moiety and the target of the therapeutic agent. Thus in some embodiments, the therapeutic agent produces the desired therapeutic effect but can also enhance the targeting properties of the EDC. In some embodiments, the targeting moiety and the agent work synergistically at directing the EDC to the target or targets. In some embodiments, the targeting moiety also has a therapeutic effect. In all embodiments, the stable or non-cleavable linker maintains the attachment of the targeting moiety to the therapeutic agent under physiological conditions for a sufficient period of time for the EDC to bind and exert a therapeutic effect. The three portions of the EDC of the invention thus comprise, consist essentially of or consist of: (1) a targeting moiety that binds to an extracellular target; (2) a stable or non-cleavable linker or a linker that remains intact or uncleaved for the EDC to exert a therapeutic effect; and (3) a therapeutic agent that binds to an extracellular target. Each of these key components is discussed in this and the immediate following sections of this detailed description.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn many embodiments of the EDCs of the invention, the targeting moiety is a human sequence antibody that does not induce internalization and thus is typically not internalized into the lysosome once bound to its target. Substantial efforts have been made to exploit antibodies to carry highly toxic payloads to infected or cancerous cells to bring and release drugs inside of cells, the “antibody-drug conjugate” or “ADC” approach.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA first difficulty associated with this approach, is that the ADC had to enter the cell to exert a therapeutic effect. Approaches to allow the ADC to enter the cell intact include targeting receptors that internalize the ADC or using peptide-mediated membrane penetration to deliver antibodies to their intracellular target proteins (see US Pat. App. 20080063633). Many such receptors that have been found to become internalized upon antibody binding in one cell type may not be internalized in another, limiting the generality of the approach [see Cancer Res 2009; 69(6):2358-64]. In addition, as discussed below, internalization is typically intended to release the agent from the antibody. This release then allows free agent to traffic out of the cell and to interact with normal cells that neighbor the diseased cells, resulting in undesired toxicity. The EDCs of the invention do not require internalization and in most cases are typically not internalized, which alleviates many of the problems associated with ADC approaches that require internalization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA second difficulty associated with prior ADC approaches is that the drug of the ADC had to be released from the antibody before or after entering the cell to activate the drug or allow it entry into the cell. Approaches to allow selective release have included incorporating specific peptide sequences that are cleaved by cell specific peptidases (see US Pat. App. 20090220529) or contain environmentally sensitive linkages such that release or activation occurs near the cell membrane, within the cell membrane, or inside the cell cytosol or endosomal compartments. Certain cell types have been found to internalize the ADC into compartments which may not release the drug in active form, thus limiting the scope of the particular ADC [Cancer Res 2009; 69(6):2358-64]. The EDCs of the invention do not require internalization and in most cases are not internalized, which alleviates many of the problems associated with ADC approaches that require internalization dependent drug-antibody separation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA third difficulty associated with prior ADC approaches is that the drug of the ADC had to be generally stable and not activated until entering or coming into close proximity with the cell. This requirement was important to ensure that release of the therapeutic agent from the antibody did not occur prior to the interaction of the antibodies with their targets, which could lead to increased toxicity. Keeping the drug conjugated to the antibody was also important to maintain the efficacy of the ADC when not bound to its target cell and to keep unconjugated antibody from masking the target site from the active ADCs. The majority of publications on the ADC approach discuss methods to solve these problems. The EDCs of the invention do not require the agent release from the EDC to be effective, which alleviates many of the problems associated with ADC approaches that require drug-antibody separation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast to prior approaches, the present invention provides highly specific EDCs that do not require cellular internalization and do not impose technically difficult constraints on the linker. The EDCs of the invention therefore do not require that the targeting moiety facilitate internalization; thus, the EDCs of the invention can utilize targeting moieties other than antibodies, including but not limited to aptamers. The EDCs of the invention also require that the agent and the antibody remain intact for maximal specificity and activity. Because the antibodies or targeting moieties of the invention target extracellular antigens and internalization is not required for efficacy, lysosomal enzymatic degradation is neither required nor beneficial. Because the linkers used in the EDCs of the invention are stable or even non-cleavable, premature release of the drug from the EDC is minimized and linker design is more flexible and is less complicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe EDCs of the invention are more selective and/or less toxic than the drug they contain. In the EDCs of the invention, the targeting moiety and/or linker can effectively prevent or dramatically reduce the therapeutic effect of the drug until the targeting moiety binds to its target. Thus the EDCs of the invention are primarily active only when the targeting moiety is bound to its target and in close proximity to the therapeutic agent's target and when the EDC is intact. Taken together, these characteristics allow for more specific and less toxic EDCs. The EDCs of the invention are more selective because both agent and antibody target sites need to be not only present, but also present in close proximity to one another. The EDCs of the invention are less toxic because the agent is linked through a stable linker and only fully active when attached to the targeting moiety. Thus, the EDCs of the invention are largely inactive when the targeting moiety is not bound to its target. The EDCs of the invention are also largely inactive when the targeting moiety is bound to its target but the targeting moiety's target is not in close proximity to the agent's target. In this case, the linker is not long enough to allow the drug to reach its target while attached to the targeting moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe targeting moieties of the invention target extracellular antigens (targets). There are numerous extracellular antigens known to be accessible to antibodies. Many of these are disease cell selective, can be activated by therapeutic agents, and/or are in close proximity to targets of therapeutic agents. Some of these extracellular antigens are found on cell surfaces. Over 60% of all approved drugs act on extracellular targets and/or targets on the cell surface. Illustrative examples of such targets, which may be exploited by the invention either as targets for targeting moieties or as targets for therapeutic agents include: (1) G-protein associated cell surface receptors (i.e., PAR, EP receptors, CXCR receptors, smoothened, LH receptor, TSH receptor, LPA receptors, secretin family of receptors, and rhodopsin family of receptors); (2) ion channels, most of which have multiple sub-families (i.e., the sodium channels, calcium channels, potassium channels, voltage-gated anion channels, and TRP family of ion channels); (3) nutrient transporters, most of which have multiple sub-families (i.e., glucose transporters, monocarboxylate transporters, and amino acid transporters); (4) receptor tyrosine kinases; (5) glutamate receptors; (6) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; (7) toll like-receptors; (8) killer receptors; (9) CD molecules; (10) enzyme-linked receptors (i.e. receptor tyrosine kinases, tyrosine-kinase-associated receptors, receptor like tyrosine phosphatases, receptor serine/threonine kinases, receptor guanylyl cyclases and histidine-kinase-associated receptors) and (10) integrins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies in the EDCs of the invention typically retain the antigen binding capability of their native, unconjugated counterparts. Thus, antibodies useful in the EDCs of the invention are capable of binding, preferably specifically, to antigens. Such antigens include, for example, tumor-associated antigens, cell surface receptor proteins and other cell surface molecules, cell survival regulatory factors, cell proliferation regulatory factors, molecules associated with (for e.g., known or suspected to contribute functionally to) tissue development or differentiation, lymphokines, cytokines, molecules involved in cell cycle regulation, molecules involved in vasculogenesis and molecules associated with (for e.g., known or suspected to contribute functionally to) angiogenesis. The tumor-associated antigen may be a cluster differentiation factor (i.e., a CD protein). An antigen to which an antibody in an EDC of the invention is capable of binding may be a member of a subset of one of the above-mentioned categories, wherein the other subset(s) of said category comprise other molecules/antigens that have a distinct characteristic (with respect to the antigen of interest).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the antibody in the EDC specifically binds to a dysadherin encoded by the FXYD5 gene and/or to the extracellular domain of dysadherin. In another embodiment, the antibody in the EDC binds to the extracellular domain of dysadherin and inhibits growth of tumor cells which overexpress dysadherin. In another embodiment, the antibody of the EDC may be a monoclonal antibody, e.g. a murine monoclonal antibody, a chimeric antibody, a human antibody or a humanized antibody. In another embodiment, the humanized antibody may be, for example, a humanized form of M53. In another embodiment, the antibody may be an antibody fragment, e.g. a Fab fragment. In another embodiment, the antibody of the EDC binds specifically to FXYD5. In another embodiment, the antibody of the EDC binds to or selectively binds to an epitope within the polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NO: 1. In another embodiment, the antibody of the EDC binds to a polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NO: 1. In another embodiment, the antibody of the EDC binds to FXYD5 or to an epitope within SEQ ID NO: 1 of FXYD5 and inhibits binding of FXYD5 to its receptor. In another embodiment, the antibody of the EDC binds to the antigen recognized by the M53 antibody. In another embodiment, the antibody of the EDC binds to the epitope on FXYD5 recognized by the M53 antibody. In another embodiment, the antibody of the EDC binds to the antigen recognized by the M53 antibody and competes for binding with the M53 antibody. In another embodiment, the antibody of the EDC binds selectively to cancer cells (e.g. lung cancer cells), but not to normal cells (e.g. normal lung cells).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the EDCs of the invention useful in the treatment of cancer include, but are not limited to, antibodies against cell surface receptors and tumor-associated antigens. Such tumor-associated antigens are known in the art, and can be prepared for use in generating antibodies using methods and information which are well known in the art. In attempts to discover effective cellular targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy, researchers have sought to identify transmembrane or otherwise tumor-associated polypeptides that are specifically expressed on the surface of one or more particular type(s) of cancer cell as compared to on one or more normal non-cancerous cell(s). Often, such tumor-associated polypeptides are more abundantly expressed on the surface of the cancer cells as compared to on the surface of the non-cancerous cells. The identification of such tumor-associated cell surface antigen polypeptides has given rise to the ability to specifically target cancer cells for destruction via antibody-based therapies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious methods have been employed to produce monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), and these methods are applicable to the production of antibodies for use in the EDCs of the invention and so are briefly reviewed below. Hybridoma technology, which refers to a cloned cell line that produces a single type of antibody, uses the cells of various species, including mice (murine), hamsters, rats, and humans. Other methods to prepare MAbs, including chimeric and humanized antibodies, employ genetic engineering, i.e. recombinant DNA techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolyclonal antibodies may be raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal (ip) injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. Monoclonal antibodies are obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, (1984) J. Immunol., 133:3001, and Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)). Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells may be determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al (1980) Anal. Biochem. 107:220.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as \nE. coli \ncells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells (US 2005/0048572; US 2004/0229310). Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al (1993) Curr. Opinion in Immunol. 5:256-262 and Pluckthun (1992) Immunol. Revs. 130:151-188.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al (1990) Nature 348:552-554; Clackson et al (1991) Nature 352:624-628; and Marks et al (1991) J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies, respectively, using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity (nM range) human antibodies by chain shuffling (Marks et al (1992) Bio/Technology 10:779-783), as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries (Waterhouse et al (1993) Nuc. Acids. Res. 21:2265-2266). Thus, these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy chain and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567); and Morrison et al (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851), or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically such non-immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant domains of an antibody, or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen-combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen-combining site having specificity for a different antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA description follows as to exemplary techniques for the production of the antibodies (Ab), which can be used as the extracellular targeting moiety in the EDCs of the present invention. The production of antibodies will be illustrated with reference to anti-FXYD5 antibodies, but it will be apparent by those skilled in the art in view of the present disclosure that antibodies to other targets can be produced and modified in a similar manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe FXYD5 antigen to be used for production of antibodies may be, e.g., a soluble form of the extracellular domain of FXYD5 or a portion thereof, containing the desired epitope. Alternatively, cells expressing FXYD5 at their cell surface, e.g. NIH-3T3 cells transformed to overexpress FXYD5; or a carcinoma cell line such as A549 cells can be used to generate antibodies. Other forms of FXYD5 useful for generating antibodies will be apparent to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs an alternative to humanization, human antibodies can be generated. For example, it is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production (Jakobovits et al (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:2551; Jakobovits et al (1993) Nature 362:255-258; Bruggermann et al (1993) Year in Immuno. 7:33; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,669; U.S. Pat. No. 5,589,369; U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,807).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, phage display technology (McCafferty et al (1990) Nature 348:552-553) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors (Johnson, Kevin S. and Chiswell, David J. (1993) Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3:564-571). A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially (Marks et al (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597; Griffith et at (1993) EMBO J. 12:725-734; U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332; U.S. Pat. No. 5,573,905). Human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells (U.S. Pat. No. 5,567,610; U.S. Pat. No. 5,229,275). Human anti-ErbB2 antibodies are described (U.S. Pat. No. 5,772,997 and WO 97/00271.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see Morimoto et al (1992) Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24:107-117; and Brennan et al (1985) Science 229:81). Antibody fragments can also be produced directly by recombinant host cells and the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Fab′-SH fragments can be directly recovered from \nE. coli \nand chemically coupled to form F(ab')\n2 \nfragments (Carter et al (1992) Bio/Technology 10:163-167). According to another approach, F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See WO 93/16185; U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,894; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,458. The antibody fragment may also be a “linear antibody”, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies with binding specificities for at least two different epitopes (Millstein et al (1983), Nature 305:537-539) may bind to two different epitopes of the FXYD5 protein or other antigens in close proximity. Purification methods for bispecific antibodies have been disclosed (WO 93/08829; Traunecker et al (1991) EMBO J. 10:3655-3659; WO 94/04690; Suresh et at (1986) Methods in Enzymology 121:210; U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168). Bispecific antibodies can be produced using leucine zippers (Kostelny et al (1992) J. Immunol. 148(5):1547-1553), and single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers (Gruber et al (1994) J. Immunol. 152:5368). Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described, such as using chemical linkage wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab')\n2 \nfragments (Brennan et at (1985) Science 229:81). Fab'-SH fragments can be recovered from \nE. coli \nand chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies (Shalaby et al (1992) J. Exp. Med. 175:217-225. The “diabody” technology provides an alternative method for making bispecific antibody fragments (Hollinger et al (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies with more than two valencies can be employed in various embodiments of the EDCs of the invention. Multivalent, “Octopus” antibodies with three or more antigen binding sites and two or more variable domains can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody (US 2002/0004586; WO 01/77342). For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared (Tutt et al (1991) J. Immunol. 147:60).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence modification(s) of antibodies are contemplated by the invention. For example, mutants and various isoforms of antibodies which bind to tumor-associated antigens are contemplated to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of an antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the nucleic acid encoding the antibody, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of the antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is “alanine scanning mutagenesis” (Cunningham and Wells (1989) Science 244:1081-1085) where an amino acid residue, or group of target residues, are identified (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid, such as alanine or polyalanine, to optimize the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an anti-FXYD5 antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the anti-FXYD5 antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the anti-FXYD5 antibody to an enzyme (e.g. for ADEPT: Tietze et al (2003) Current Pharm. Design 9:2155-2175) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody, such as an albumin-binding peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma-protein binding can be an effective means of improving the pharmacokinetic properties of short lived molecules. Albumin is the most abundant protein in plasma. Serum albumin binding peptides (ABP) can alter the pharmacodynamics of fused active domain proteins, including alteration of tissue uptake, penetration, and diffusion. These pharmacodynamic parameters can be modulated by specific selection of the appropriate serum albumin binding peptide sequence (US 20040001827). A series of albumin binding peptides were identified by phage display screening (Dennis et al (2002) “Albumin Binding As A General Strategy For Improving The Pharmacokinetics Of Proteins” J Biol. Chem. 277:35035-35043; WO 01/45746). Compounds useful in the EDCs of the invention include ABP sequences taught by: (i) Dennis et al (2002) J Biol. Chem. 277:35035-35043 at Tables III and IV, page 35038; and (ii) US 20040001827 at [0076] SEQ ID NOS: 9-22; and (iii) WO 01/45746 at pages 12-13, SEQ ID NOS: z1-z14, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequence is usually altered by altering the underlying nucleic acid sequence. Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the antibody. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties: (1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile; (2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr; (3) acidic: asp, glu; (4) basic: asn, gln, his, lys, arg; (5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and (6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe. Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo increase the serum half life of the antibody, one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody (especially an antibody fragment) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277, for example. As used herein, the term “salvage receptor binding epitope” refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, or IgG\n4\n) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the IgG molecule (US 2003/0190311, U.S. Pat. No. 6,821,505; U.S. Pat. No. 6,165,745; U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821; U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,260; U.S. Pat. No. 6,165,745; U.S. Pat. No. 5,834,597).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycosylation variants of antibodies are variants in which the glycosylation pattern of an antibody is altered. By altering is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, adding one or more carbohydrate moieties to the antibody, changing the composition of glycosylation (glycosylation pattern), or the extent of glycosylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies may be glycosylated at conserved positions (N-linked or O-linked) in their constant regions (Hse et al (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272:9062-9070; Jefferis and Lund, (1997) Chem. Immunol. 65:111-128; Wright and Morrison, (1997) TibTECH 15:26-32). The oligosaccharide side chains of the immunoglobulins affect the protein's function (Boyd et al (1996) Mol. Immunol. 32:1311-1318; Wittwe and Howard, (1990) Biochem. 29:4175-4180), and the intramolecular interaction between portions of the glycoprotein which can affect the conformation and presented three-dimensional surface of the glycoprotein (Hefferis and Lund, supra; Wyss and Wagner (1996) Current Opin. Biotech. 7:409-416). Oligosaccharides may also serve to target a given glycoprotein to certain molecules based upon specific recognition structures (Malhotra et al (1995) Nature Med. 1:237-243; Umana et al (1999) Nature Biotech. 17:176-180). Removal of the oligosaccharides may optimize antigen binding and other properties of the antibody (Boyd et al (1996) Mol. Immunol. 32:1311-1318).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactors which affect glycosylation during recombinant production of antibodies include growth mode, media formulation, culture density, oxygenation, pH, purification schemes and the like (U.S. Pat. No. 5,047,335; U.S. Pat. No. 5,510,261; U.S. Pat. No. 5,278,299). Glycosylation, or certain types of glycosylation, can be enzymatically removed from the glycoprotein, for example using endoglycosidase H (Endo H). In addition, the recombinant host cell can be genetically engineered, e.g. make defective in processing certain types of polysaccharides. These and similar techniques are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glycosylation structure of antibodies can be readily analyzed by conventional techniques of carbohydrate analysis, including lectin chromatography, NMR, Mass spectrometry, HPLC, GPC, monosaccharide compositional analysis, sequential enzymatic digestion, and HPAEC-PAD, which uses high pH anion exchange chromatography to separate oligosaccharides based on charge. Methods for releasing oligosaccharides for analytical purposes are also known, and include, without limitation, enzymatic treatment (commonly performed using peptide-N-glycosidase F/endo-.beta.-galactosidase), elimination using harsh alkaline environment to release mainly O-linked structures, and chemical methods using anhydrous hydrazine to release both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of these targets of antibodies or other targeting moieties of the EDCs of the invention have multiple subunits, isoforms and/or glycosylation patterns which determine their location in or on cells. Their presentation can depend on cell type, location on the cell, location of the cell, and/or physiological and pathological conditions. For example, the type of beta subunit (1 vs. 2) found in the Na/K-ATPase complex and its glycosylation pattern differ from cell type to cell type (see Proteomics 2008; 8(16):3236-56, and Am J Physiol 1997;272(1 Pt 1):L85-94, incorporated herein by reference). In addition, many extracellular targets are slightly different or over expressed in diseased tissues or in the circulatory structure surrounding diseased tissue. For example, aberrant glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer and includes alterations in the carbohydrate content of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and glycosaminoglycans (see Anticancer Agents Med Chem 2008; 8(1):2-21, incorporated herein by reference). Specifically, there is an abundance of evidence that beta-1,6-GlcNAc-branching of N-glycans contributes directly to cancer progression (see Biochim Biophys Acta 1999; 1473(1):21-34, incorporated herein by reference). The glycosylation patterns of the Na/K-ATPase membrane bound ion pump are believed to have evolved to serve cell specific regulatory requirements and are aberrantly glycosylated in a number of cancer cells. Gamma subunit isoform 5 of the Na/K-ATPase membrane bound ion pump complex is a glycosylated membrane protein (also called dysadherin or FXYD5) that has been shown to promote experimental cancer metastasis and is an independent prognostic indicator of metastasis and survival for many different types of human cancer [see Nam et. al. Cancer Lett. 255(2) 161-9 (2007)]. Accordingly, each of these targets present antigens that can be targeted by the targeting moiety of the EDCs of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA somatic mutation in the chaperone Cosmc can lead to the creation of new glycopeptide epitopes to which cancer specific antibodies for use in the EDCs of the invention can be raised (see Schietinger, A. et. al. Science 314(5797) 304-8 (2006), incorporated herein by reference). Antibodies have been generated that recognize these differences in glycosylation. Two papers describe how to produce specific antibodies to aberrantly glycosylated cell surface glycans (see Cancer Immunol Immunother 2006; 55(11):1337-47, and Cancer Res 2009; 69(5):2018-25). However, generating high affinity antibodies to sugars alone can be difficult. To overcome the problem of immune tolerance to tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens, non-naturally occurring antigenic sugars can be fed to cells, creating new glycosylation motifs to which high affinity antibodies can be generated (see Bioorg. Med. Chem. 15 (2007) 7561-7567). Antibodies generated to these non-naturally occurring sugars in conjunction with the proteins they decorate lead to very specific disease targeting antibodies and are useful in various embodiments of the EDCs of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies have also been generated to targets that are over-expressed in diseased tissue, and such antibodies are useful in the EDCs of the invention. For cancer, these antigens are typically named tumor-associated antigens and represent a group of normal non-mutant molecules. Illustrative examples include the EGFR receptor (Clin Cancer Res 2001; 7: 2958-70, incorporated herein by reference), the gamma 5 subunit of the Na/K-ATPase (Cancer Lett. 2007 Oct. 8; 255(2): 161-169, incorporated herein by reference), and MUCIN (Cancer Immunol Immunother 2006; 55(11): 1337-47, incorporated herein by reference). Therefore, in one embodiment, the antibody in the EDC of the invention is an antibody that binds to an extracellular target and has been approved for human administration by the FDA, including but not limited to Erbitux.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies have also been generated to targets that are over-expressed on cancer cells that metastasize, and such antibodies are useful in the EDCs of the invention. Metastatic cells have the ability to migrate to other tissues or organs thus spreading the cancer. Such an example of antibodies that target metastasizing cancer cell types is the antibody NCC-M53 (M53), which recognizes the extracellular target called dysadherin or FXYD5 [Cancer Lett. 2007 Oct. 8; 255(2): 161-169]. Studies suggest a role for dysadherin specifically in the metastatic process, and this extracellular target tends to be expressed where the cell-cell contact is loose, or in dissociated cells. Over-expression of dysadherin has been found to be significantly associated with metastasis and/or poor prognosis. It is thought that some primary tumors can regress completely, but leave their metastases behind. Currently, if a cancer is found to have spread to other tissues and organs, the patient's likelihood of survival significantly decreases. The treatment options currently available are rarely able to cure metastatic cancers. Thus, in one embodiment the EDCs of the invention comprise the antibody NCC-M53 or any other antibody that binds specifically to dysadherin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies have also been generated to gangliosides, located in lipid rafts and on certain diseased cell types, and such antibodies are useful in the EDCs of the invention. Specifically antibodies raised to gangliosides have shown the ability to kill cancer cells [see Oncology Research, Vol. 12, pp. 173-179, 2000; J Biol. Chem. Vol. 280, No. 33, Issue of August 19, pp. 29828-29836, 2005; and Cancer Letters 281 (2009) 171-182]. Because certain gangliosides are abundantly expressed on the surface of tumor cells and are found in certain cell surface compartments, like lipid rafts, drugs can be attached to ganglioside specific antibodies to make EDCs of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the antigen target changes or over-expressed targets that occur in diseased tissues, there exist tumor specific antigens, and antibodies to these antigens can be used in the EDCs of the invention. These molecules are usually found on the cell membrane, and can be targets for antitumor agents. Many such antigens are mutants of a corresponding protein found on normal cells/tissue. Many of these types of antigens are unique to the individual or small subsets of tumors and thus require personalized therapy. The EDCs of the invention include EDCs made with personalized antibodies to these types of antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe EDCs of the invention include EDCs in which, unlike the embodiments discussed immediately above, the targeting moiety does not target mutant proteins, over-expressed targets, tumor-associated antigens, or tumor specific antigens but targets that are present on normal cells of specific types. Here, the increased specificity of the targeting moiety alone suffices to create advantages. For example, there are drugs that act on many or all GLUT-transporters, yet are non-specific with regards to cell type or GLUT-transporter type. Because of this, GLUT-transporter specific drugs that target one cell type over another have been difficult to create. The present invention provides EDCs in which the targeting moiety recognizes a specific GLUT transporter(s) that exists only on the targeted cell type while the drug attached acts more universally (i.e., the same agent then could be attached to different antibodies making different EDCs with different therapeutic effects). This allows the same agent (drug) to be linked to various antibodies each with varying specificity to provide EDCs of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBeyond the targeting aspect, the targeting moiety portion of the EDC of the invention can bring other advantages. For example, the targeting moiety can facilitate transport across the blood brain barrier (for example, antibodies that target transferring receptor can facilitate this transport); the targeting moiety can increase the in vivo half-life of a therapeutic agent (three IgG subclasses have half-lives of about 20 days in humans); and/or the targeting moiety can increase the solubility of the agent in aqueous solutions such as the circulatory structure or pharmaceutical diluents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments of the EDC of the invention, the targeting moiety on the EDC of the invention can act to: (i) keep the agents of the invention near or on the target for a prolonged period of time (depending on its binding affinity), (ii) prevent or retard degradation by lysosomal enzymes, because a non-internalizing targeting moiety is not internalized into the cells by a receptor/antigen type of endocytosis and so does not reach the lysosomal system, and (iii) prevent uptake intracellularly by fluid phase endocytosis in a manner dependent linearly on its extracellular concentration. A non-internalizing characteristic of a targeting moiety can be determined experimentally by one skilled in the art. By way of example, non-internalizing antibodies are those that interact with antigens and epitopes present at the surface of target tissue extracellular constituents such as those of the extracellular matrix and do not enter the lysosome where they can become degraded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies in the EDCs of the invention can include various monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, modified antibodies, chimeric antibodies or improved antibodies within the scope of the definitions provided above. For example, modern alternative strategies now allow for the production of fully humanized antibodies to reduce the immunogenicity of the antibody. In addition, smaller antibody fragments can be engineered, including antigen binding Fabs, Fvs, scFv, and minibodies, and the antibody can also be enhanced to increase the antibody's affinity, stability, and expression level (see Nat Med. 2003 January; 9(1):129-34).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative embodiment of the invention, the targeting moiety of the EDC of the invention is not an antibody but is instead a peptide or protein or peptidomimetic that is the functional equivalent, in terms of targeting, of an antibody. For example and without limitation, the antibody can be replaced by any of a number of small and robust non-immunoglobulin “scaffolds” that can be equipped with prescribed binding functions using the methods of combinatorial protein design. Such scaffolds are described in various reviews (see, e.g. “Engineered protein scaffolds as next-generation antibody therapeutics” in Curr Opin Chem Biol. 2009 June; 13(3):245-55 and “Engineered affinity proteins for tumour-targeting applications” in Biotechnol Appl Biochem. 2009 May; 53(Pt 1):1-29).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another alternative embodiment of the invention, the targeting moiety of the EDC of the invention is not an antibody but is instead a DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotide mimetic that is the functional equivalent, in terms of targeting, of an antibody. For example, SELEX methods can be used to identify DNA or RNA or modifications thereof with prescribed binding functions. Aptamers are polymers of RNA or DNA oligonucleotides or modifications thereof that are isolated by the systematic evolution of ligands like the exponential enrichment SELEX process (see Hicke and Stephens, 2000, “Escort Aptamers: A Delivery Service for Diagnosis and Therapy,” J. Clin. Invest., 106(8), pp. 923-928).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another alternative embodiment of the invention, the targeting moiety of the EDC of the invention is not an antibody but is instead ganglioside, which acts as the functional equivalent, in terms of targeting, of an antibody in this embodiment. Gangliosides comprise a family of amphipathic molecules that contain a ceramide moiety as a lipophilic anchor embedded in the outer leaflet of plasma membranes and a sialo-oligosaccharide residue exposed towards the extracellular space. Gangliosides can thus be used to target drugs to the cell surface and, particularly, to lipid rafts where important drug targets are located. Molecules such as biotin and digitoxigenin have been attached to gangliosides to observe the distribution of gangliosides [see J Histochemistry & Cytochemistry 47(8): 1005-1014, 1999; and Chemistry and Physics of Lipids 86 (1997) 37-50].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, the targeting moiety (or other binding or targeting moiety) will be purified to greater than 95% by weight (as determined, for example, by the Lowry method), and often to more than 99% by weight prior to use in forming an EDC of the invention. Ordinarily, the targeting moiety will be prepared by at least one purification step. Once a targeting moiety of interest is available, it can be linked to a therapeutic agent by any of a variety of linkers and linker technologies, as discussed in the following section.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIllustrative targeting moieties for EDCs of the invention include antibodies to FXYD5 such as NCC-M53 or a humanized form of M53. Additional targeting moieties for EDCs of the invention include antibodies specific to CD147 such as EMMPRIN or basigin, antibodies specific to integrins such as MEDI-522 also known as Vitaxin, ReoPro, Tysabri, and Ambegrin, and antibodies that have high affinities to extracellular epitopes of extracellular targets. Thus, there is a wide variety of targets and targeting moieties that can be used to make EDCs of the invention. Targeting moieties of particular interest are those that target disease specific extracellular targets that are located in close proximity to agent targets. The EDCs of the present invention include EDCs comprising agents that are not specific enough, as single or stand-alone agents, to be used for therapeutic purposes. Such agents now find therapeutic application as agents in EDCs of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTargets of the targeting moieties include, without limitation, tumor-associated antigens, including but not limited to BMPR1B (bone morphogenetic protein receptor-type IB, Genbank accession no.

October 15; 94(2):178-84.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, there are a wide variety of targets suitable for targeting by the targeting moieties of the EDCs of the invention. Antibody targeting moieties for many of these targets already exist or can be made by one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein.\n\n\n \nIII. Linkers\n\n\n \n \n \nTo form an EDC of the invention, a therapeutic agent is coupled to the targeting moiety via a stable linker. The linker attaches the targeting moiety to an agent through one or more covalent bond(s), and, because stable linkers are required, the linker typically does not include a disulfide group or ester group. The linker is a bifunctional or multifunctional moiety which can be used to link one or more agents and a targeting moiety to form an EDC of the invention. EDCs can be conveniently prepared using a linker having reactive functionality for binding to the agent and to the targeting moiety. For example, a cysteine thiol, or an amine, e.g. N-terminus or amino acid side chain such as lysine, of an antibody type targeting moiety can form a bond with a functional group of a linker reagent, drug moiety or drug-linker reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe linkers employed in the EDCs of the invention are stable. After administration, the EDC is stable and remains intact, i.e. the targeting moiety remains linked to the agent via the linker. The linkers are stable outside the target cell and remain uncleaved for efficacy. An effective linker will: (i) maintain the specific binding properties of the antibody; (ii) allow delivery of the conjugate or agent; (iii) remain stable and intact, i.e. not cleaved, for as long as the antibody and/or agent remains stable and intact; and (iv) maintain a cytotoxic, cell-killing effect or a cytostatic effect of the agent while the EDC is intact. Stability of the EDC may be measured by standard analytical techniques such as mass spectroscopy, HPLC, and the separation/analysis technique LC/MS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCovalent attachment of the antibody and the drug moiety requires the linker to have two reactive functional groups, i.e. bivalency in a reactive sense. Bivalent linker reagents which are useful to attach two or more functional or biologically active moieties, such as peptides, nucleic acids, drugs, toxins, antibodies, haptens, and reporter groups are known, and methods have been described their resulting conjugates (Hermanson, G. T. (1996) Bioconjugate Techniques; Academic Press: New York, p234-242).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA stable linker forms a covalent bond between the therapeutic agent and a targeting moiety such that, when attached, the agent and targeting moiety can bind and act on their respective targets. While a stable linker can simply be a covalent bond formed between reactive sites on the targeting moiety and the agent, the stable linkers of the invention typically include a linker spacer group. To attach a targeting moiety to an agent through a linker, one utilizes complementary reactive groups. For example, accessible sulfhydryl groups on a targeting moiety, can react with active maleimide groups to form stable thioether linkages. An additional example is accessible amines on an agent can react with succinimide esters to form stable amide bonds. Bifunctional linkers which have maleimides on one end and succinimide esters on the other can be used in the invention to link the agent to the targeting moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, distinct chemical linkers (as opposed to a single covalent bond) are typically used in the EDCs of the invention. Linkers of this type are typically linear chains of atoms or polymers consisting of one or more “linker spacer groups” with two “ends” that contain functional groups that can serve as linking reagents to connect the targeting moiety and/or therapeutic agent to the linker covalently. Suitable linkers can include a wide variety of functional groups and moieties, including but not limited to substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, aldehydes, acids, esters and anhydrides, sulfydryl or carboxyl groups, such as maleimido benzoic acid derivatives, maleimidocaproic acid derivatives, and succinimido derivatives, or may be derived from cyano bromide or chloride, succinimidyl esters or sulphonic halides and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe functional groups on the linker ends that are used to form covalent bonds between the linker and therapeutic agent on one end and the linker and targeting moiety on the other end, may be different types of functional groups and include but not limited to amino, hydrazino, hydroxyl, thiol, maleimido, carbonyl, and carboxyl groups, making the linker bifunctional. A linker may also be polyfunctional. It will be evident to those skilled in the art upon review of this disclosure that a variety of bifunctional or polyfunctional reagents, both homo- and hetero-functional (such as those described in the catalog of the Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill.), can be employed as a linker group. Coupling can occur, for example, through amino groups, carboxyl groups, sulfhydryl groups or oxidized carbohydrate residues (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,671,958). Cyanogen bromide or chloride derivative groups; carbonyldiimidazole, thiocarbonyldiimidazole of succinimide esters or sulfonic halides; phosgene, thiophosgene; or self-rearrangeable (or “self-immolative”) spacers can also be used. In one embodiment, the linker is a heterobifunctional linker such that one of the two ends reacts with the targeting moiety while the other end reacts with the drug, thus forming covalent attachments between the three portions. Heterobifunctional coupling reagents can be prepared by matching the above chemically compatible reactive groups. Some common examples are 4-fluoro-3-nitrophenylazide (FNPA), N-succinimidyl-6-(4′-azido-2′-nitrophenylamino)hexanoate (SANPAH), m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS), and succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate ester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical linking reagents include those that are commercially available from Thermo Scientific and listed in the Cross linking Handbook (accessible on the world wide web at piercentet.com/Files/1601673_Crosslink_HB_Intl.pdf) as well as those from Thermo Scientific P.O. Box 117, Rockford, Ill. 61105 U.S.A, U.S.A 1-800-874-3723, International +815-968-0747. Typical linking reagents can also include amine-to-amine coupling reagents, e.g., dimethyl imidates, such as dimethyl adipimidate, dimethyl malonimidate, and dimethyl suberimidate; bis-N-oxysuccinimidyl esters, such as disuccinimidyl suberate (DS) and disuccinimidyl tartarate; and bis-nitrofluorobenzenes, such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 4,4′-difluoro-3,3′-dinitrophenylsulfone; sulfhydryl coupling reagents, e.g., bis-maleimido reagents, such as 1,2-phenylenedimaleimide and 1,4-phenylenedimaleimide; bis-iodoacetamides such as N,N-ethylene-bis-iodoacetamide; and bis-organomercury reagents such as 3,6-bis-(mercurimethyl)-dioxan; and the highly reactive diisothiocyanates such as 4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′-disulfonic acid and p-phenylene-diisothiocyanate (DTIC) and aryl azides such as 4,4′-dithio-bis-phenylazide. In one embodiment, a bifunctional linker consists of a N-hydroxysuccinimide ester on one end (amine reactive) and a maleimide group (sulfhydryl reactive) on the other. N-hydroxysuccinimde (NHS) esters react with primary amines at pH 7-9 to form amide bonds, while maleimides react with sulfhydryl groups at pH 6.5-7.5 to form stable thioether bonds. Several primary amine and sulfhydryl groups are present on antibodies, and additional groups can be designed into recombinant antibody molecules. Agents can be synthesized to contain a variety of functional groups used to link them to the linkers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe linker can impart beneficial properties to an EDC of the invention in addition to physically linking the targeting moiety and the drug. The linker can be used to minimize agent self-association or aggregation of the EDC caused by the agent (for example, by introducing a hydrophilic methoxytriethylene glycol chain onto the doxorubicin portion of the branched peptide linkers, aggregation was greatly reduced in the immunoconjugate products). The linker may also improve the therapeutic efficacy of the EDC (for example, increased linker stability between doxorubicin and BR64 monoclonal antibody resulted in increased efficacy and potency). The linker may also improve the pharmacokinetics of the EDC (for example, poly-ethylene glycol can increase serum half-life of antibodies and other molecules). A linker can also serve to increase the chemical reactivity of the agent or targeting moiety, and thus increase the coupling efficiency to the targeting moiety or agent. An increase in chemical reactivity can also facilitate the use of moieties, or functional groups on moieties, which otherwise would not be feasible to use. When the targeting moiety is linked to the therapeutic agent, the linker group may have several other functions, such as making the compound of the invention more bio-resistant, more bio-compatible, less immunogenic, less toxic, and/or more stable while in the circulatory structure or more stable to other types of destruction or elimination or to make it non-cleavable. Thus in certain embodiments, the stable or non-cleavable linker maintains the attachment of the targeting moiety to the therapeutic agent under physiological conditions, but may also have therapeutic effects as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe linkers used in the EDCs of the invention are stable, and in various embodiments non-cleavable. In all embodiments, for the EDC of the invention to exert it's maximal therapeutic effect, the linker must remains intact, which requires the following: (i) the linkage between the targeting moiety and the therapeutic agent of the compound of the invention remains stable for a prolonged period of time in the circulatory structure, sufficient to allow the EDC to find and bind its target(s); (ii) the linkage remains stable while the EDC of the invention is stored under various conditions and temperatures for a prolonged period of time; and (iii) the stable characteristics of the EDC of the invention can be determined experimentally by one skilled in the art. By way of example, stable linkers are those that, when in an EDC of the invention, show minimal (i.e., less than 10%) cleavage while present in the circulatory structure, at the surface of target tissue, at the surface of target cell, or in the extracellular matrix for a period of at least 4 to 8 hours or longer, such as 8 to 24 hours, or 1 to 10 days or longer; non-cleavable linkers are stable in these conditions for longer periods, including periods as long as 20 days or longer (Durcy, L. et. al. Bioconjugate Chem. 2010, 21, 5-13).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn example of a stable, non-cleavable linker is the polyalkylene glycol linker. Polyalkyleneglycol linkers are linear chains that have at least two, and typically more than two, alkylene moieties linked together by oxygen in the form of an ether linkage. The alkylene groups can be substituted, but typically are unsubstituted, and can comprise any desired number of alkylene units, but typically at least 2 and no more than 5, or no more than 10, or no more than 25 or no more than 50, or no more than 100 such units, e.g., ethylene, propylene, hexylene, and the like. In one embodiment, the linker is composed of 24 repeating ethyleneglycol units making a PEG24-type linker. This linker would be approximately 90-100 angstoms long depending on the reactive groups attached to either end. In one embodiment, the linker is composed of a sugar. In one embodiment, the linker is composed of an amino sugar. The polyalkyleneglycol residue can comprise repeating alkylene units which are all the same or which vary in length and/or substitution. In various embodiments, the linker of the EDC of the invention is constructed using a (PEG)36 bifunctional linker. In a particular embodiment, the linker of the EDC of the invention is constructed using SM(PEG)24 from Thermo Scientific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny substituent of one or more alkylene units will of course be selected such that the advantageous properties of the present invention are not substantially compromised. One skilled in the art will be able to make appropriate selections in view of the disclosure herein. Typically such substituents, if present, are hydroxyl, alkoxyl, or disubstituted amino moieties. When polyethyleneglycol (PEG) is used to link the targeting moiety to the drug, the EDC may be capable of withstanding attacks by the immune system. Adding PEG to proteins or small molecules has been shown to improve therapeutic efficacy of some protein or small molecule therapeutics (see PEGylated Protein Drugs: Basic Science and Clinical; Applications Series: Milestones in Drug Therapy Veronese, Francesco M. (Ed.)2009 and Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews Volume 55, \nIssue\n 10, 26 Sep. 2003, Pages 1261-1277, incorporated herein by reference). PEG can therefore increase the half-life, reduce the requirement for frequent dosing, and reduce antigenicity as well. In one embodiment, the bifunctional linker succinimidyl-[(N-maleimidopropionamido)-tetracosaethyleneglycol]ester is used to couple the targeting moiety to the drug. In one embodiment, the bifunctional linker succinimidyl-[(N-maleimidopropionamido)-dodecaethyleneglycol]ester is used to couple the targeting moiety to the drug. In one embodiment, the bifunctional linker succinimidyl-[(N-maleimidopropionamido)-octaethyleneglycol]ester is used to couple the targeting moiety to the drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrugs may be coupled through linkers to site-specific locations engineered onto antibodies to make an EDC of the invention. For example, aldehyde tags can be made through the use of the formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) which performs posttranslational modification converting cysteines within amino acid consensus sequences, also termed “sulfatase motifs” to the aldehyde-bearing residue formylglycine (FGly). The motifs can be installed within heterologous proteins as a genetically encoded “aldehyde tag” for site-specific labeling with aminooxy- or hydrazide-functionalized probes (see Cell. 2003 May 16; 113(4):435-44;1 Am Chem Soc. 2008 Sep. 17; 130(37): 12240-12241). Another example of modifying antibodies site selectively also is accomplished through cysteines and involves first identifying reactive thiol groups on the antibody surface using a Phage ELISA selction (see J Immunol Methods. 2008 Mar. 20; 332(1-2):41-52, and US Patent Application 20080305044). Yet another method to site specifically label antibodies is through the use of unnatural amino acids incorporated into the antibody polypeptide chain (see Annu Rev Biophys Biomol Struct. 2006; 35:225-49).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolyfunctional linkers or dendrimers can be used in accordance with the methods of the invention so that multiple agents are attached to a single attachment site on the targeting moiety. In this way, multiple agents could be attached to a single specific site on the targeting moiety, which may be engineered as discussed above, or to multiple sites where reactive side chains are located. The number of drugs and linkers will be, in any event, at least one and an upper limit can be determined experimentally by one skilled in the art. An optimal number of linkers and drugs can be determined but this is not required. For example, one linker could have multiple therapeutic agents attached (dendrimer), and an EDC with multiple linkers could have a fraction of linkers free of therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn optimal linker length may be determined by experimental measurements, for example by testing multiple linker lengths in the assay used to determine activity of the resulting EDC of the invention. For example, if linker length is too short (not allowing the drug and targeting moiety to reach their binding sites simultaneously), one can readily identify and correct the problem to provide an EDC of the invention. Typically, the linker length will be in the range of about 50 to about 500 Angstroms or about 50 to about 200 Angstroms. The linker length and composition is selected to ensure that the EDC remains stable in the circulatory structure where enzymes and other environmental substances may otherwise break it down and to reflect the distance from where the targeting moiety binds to its antigen and where the agent acts on its target. A wide variety of linkers that comply with these requirements are available or can be synthesized, which creates a very large class of EDCs provided by the invention, particularly when one considers the wide variety of linkers, therapeutic agents and targeting moieties that can be employed in the EDCs of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgent loading refers to the average number of agents per targeting moiety (i.e., antibody). Where each linker is linked to one agent, the average number of agents will equal the average number of linkers on the targeting moiety. Agent loading typically ranges from 1 to 8 agents per targeting moiety, if the targeting moiety is an antibody (Ab), i.e. where 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 agents are covalently attached to the antibody. Thus, compositions of EDCs include collections of antibodies conjugated with a range of drugs, from 1 to 8. The average number of drugs per antibody in preparations of EDC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, electrophoresis, and HPLC. By ELISA, the averaged value of agents in a particular preparation of EDC may be determined (Hamblett et al (2004) Clinical Cancer Res. 10:7063-7070; Sanderson et al (2005) Clinical Cancer Res. 11:843-852). However, the distribution of agents and/or linkers are not discernible by the antibody-antigen binding and detection limitation of ELISA. Also, ELISA assay for detection of antibody-drug conjugates does not determine where the drugs are attached to the antibody, such as the heavy chain or light chain fragments, or the particular amino acid residues. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous EDC where the number of agents is a certain value from EDC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some EDCs, the number of agents and/or linkers may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the targeting moiety. For example, where the attachment is a cysteine thiol, as in certain illustrative embodiments herein, an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. Higher drug loading, e.g. p>5, may cause aggregation, insolubility, toxicity, or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody-drug conjugates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, many lysine residues that do not react with a drug-linker intermediate (D-L) or linker reagent. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine-reactive linker reagent. Also, only the most reactive cysteine thiol groups may react with a thiol-reactive linker reagent. Generally, antibodies do not contain many, if any, free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or TCEP, under partial or total reducing conditions. Additionally, the antibody must be subjected to denaturing conditions to reveal reactive nucleophilic groups such as lysine or cysteine. The loading (drug/antibody ratio) of an EDC may be controlled in several different manners, including: (i) limiting the molar excess of drug-linker intermediate (D-L) or linker reagent relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, and (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere more than one nucleophilic or electrophilic group of the antibody reacts with a drug-linker intermediate, or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of EDC compounds with a distribution of drug moieties attached to an antibody, e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc. Liquid chromatography methods such as polymeric reverse phase (PLRP) and hydrophobic interaction (HIC) may separate compounds in the mixture by drug loading value. Preparations of EDC with a single agent loading value may be isolated (“Effect of drug loading on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of an anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate”, Hamblett, K. J., et al, Abstract No. 624, American Association for Cancer Research; 2004 Annual Meeting, Mar. 27-31, 2004, Proceedings of the AACR, Volume 45, March 2004; “Controlling the Location of Drug Attachment in Antibody-Drug Conjugates”, Alley, S. C., et al, Abstract No. 627, American Association for Cancer Research; 2004 Annual Meeting, Mar. 27-31, 2004, Proceedings of the AACR, Volume 45, March 2004). However, these single loading value EDCs may still be heterogeneous mixtures because the drug moieties may be attached, via the linker, at different sites on the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the EDCs of the invention can utilize any of a wide variety of stable or non-cleavable linkers.\n\n\n \nIV. Therapeutic Agents (Drugs)\n\n\n \n \n \nA wide variety of therapeutic agents are suitable for use in the EDCs of the invention. For example and without limitation, the therapeutic agent can be an agent with anti-tumor, anti-angiogenic, or anti-inflammatory therapeutic activity. Preferably, the site where the drug is attached to the linker is at a position where the linker attachment only minimally interferes or does not interfere at all with the drug's activity. The drugs used in the EDCs of the invention bind extracellular targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the agent is a “non-internalizing therapeutic agent”. In various embodiments of the invention, the targeting moiety's target is a cell membrane receptor, and the agent it acts on is a site that is on the extracellular portion of and in close proximity to the targeting moiety target. Advantageous properties of agents that do not require cellular internalization include: (i) increased potency because the process of cellular uptake of certain therapeutic agents is not efficient; (ii) endocytosis does not occur and therefore the agent remains near or on the target for a prolonged period of time depending on its binding affinity; (iii) endocytosis does not occur and therefore the agent does not reach the lysosomal system and is not degraded to a significant extent by lysosomal enzymes; and/or (iv) cellular uptake can require special physiological properties and thus the EDC is easier to construct. The non-internalizing characteristic of a therapeutic agent can be determined experimentally by one skilled in the art. In various embodiments, the non-internalizing therapeutic agent of the invention interacts with a target present at the surface of target cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the therapeutic agent is not a microtubule inhibitor, a DNA alkylating agent or an inducer of DNA double strand breaks. In another embodiment, the therapeutic agent is not an auristatin, maytasinoid, duocarmycin, or calicheamicin. In another embodiment, the therapeutic agent has an IC\n50 \n(in vitro) not less than 10 picomolar (pM), 20 pM, 30 pM, 40 pM, 50 pM, 60 pM, 70 pM, 80 pM, 90 pM or 100 pM. In another embodiment, where the therapeutic agent is a glycoside or cardiac glycoside, the glycoside or cardiac glycoside does not have an IC\n50 \nless than about 1 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn many cases, therapeutic agents have side effects not related to the target of activation specified to the specific indication. Such side effects are complex phenomenological observations that have been attributed to a number of molecular scenarios including direct interaction with off-target binding [see Keiser, M J, et. al. Nature 462, 175 (2009), Blagg, Annu. Rep. Med. Chem. 41, 353 (2006), Toxicity and Drug Discov. \nToday\n 10, 1421 (2005)]. Subsequent activation of other targets can lead to harmful side effects, and several lines of evidence suggest that drugs may have multiple physiological targets [see Campillos et al. Drug target identification using side-effect similarity. Science 321, 263-266 (2008)]. For example, anti-Parkinsonian drugs such as Permax and Dostinex activate not only dopamine receptors but also 5-HT\n2B \nserotonin receptors, thereby causing valvular heart disease and severely restricting their use (see Roth, Drugs and valvular heart disease. N. Engl. J. Med. 356, 6-9 (2007)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor anticancer (and other) agents, the term therapeutic index is used, in many cases to compare actual antitumor (or other therapeutic) effects to off-target toxic effects. An example of a potential anticancer drug is digitoxin, which has strong antitumor activities but high cardiotoxicity (see, Goldin. Digitalis and cancer. \nLancet \n1984; 1:1134). Therefore the drug alone has not been found effective as an anticancer agent in humans. Various cardiac glycoside agents such as digitoxin or proscillaridin are useful in various embodiments of the invention even though they have been reported to exhibit cytotoxic activity against several different cancer types but at concentrations not achievable in patient plasma due to their cardiotoxic effects at such concentrations [see Felth, J. et. al. J. Nat. Prod. 72, 1969 (2009)]. Cardiac glycosides are a class of drugs derived from plants of the genera \nDigitalis, Strophanthus, \nand others, which have been prescribed for centuries to treat congestive heart failure and arrhythmias. In these conditions, cardiac glycosides bind to the Na\n+\n/K\n+\n ATPase and inhibit its pumping activity. Studies performed over the last decade show that cardiac glycosides have activity as anti-cancer agents [Mijatovic et al. (2007) Biochim Biophys Acta 1776:32-57 and PCT Pub. No. 2010/017480].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the therapeutic agent in the EDC is a cardiac glycoside. In one embodiment of the invention, the agent is proscillaridin. In another embodiment of the invention, the agent is composed of a novel sugar enhanced proscillaridin. In another embodiment of the invention, the agent is composed from a cardiac glycoside which is void a sugar. In various embodiments of the invention, the cardiac glycoside is a compound identified in PCT Pub. No. WO 2010/017480 (PCT/US2009/053159).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-limiting examples of suitable cardiac glycoside compounds of Formula I as well as pharmaceutically acceptable esters, derivatives, conjugates, hydrates, solvates, prodrugs and salts thereof, or mixtures of any of the foregoing:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwhere the steroidal rings are either saturated, unsaturated or a combination thereof,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\na \nis CH\n3\n;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\nb \nis CH\n3\n, CH\n2\nOH, or CHO;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\nc \nis H, OH or CH\n3\nCOO;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\nd \nis H, OH or CH\n3\nCOO;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\ne \nis H or no group;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\nf \nis H, OH or, when R\ne \nis H or a C═C exists between the atoms joined to R\ne\n, R\nf \nand R\ng\n, R\nf \nis no group;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\ng \nis H or, when R\ne \nis H or a C═C exists between the atoms joined to R\ne\n, R\nf \nand R\ng\n, R\ng \nis no group;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\nh \nis H or OH;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nX is O or N(OR′);\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR′ is an alkyl or aryl group; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSugar is D or L of hexose, pentose, deoxyhexose, deoxypentose, deoxy-halohexose, deoxy-halopentose, deoxy-aminopentose, deoxy-aminohexose, tetrose, heterosugar, carboxysugar, a derivative of the aforementioned sugars, a disaccharide derived from at least one of the aforementioned sugars, or a polysaccharide derived from at least one of the aforementioned sugars.

In various embodiments, the agent is a channel blocker; in other embodiments, the agent is not a channel blocker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, a wide variety of therapeutic agents can be employed in the EDCs of the invention.\n\n\n \nV. EDC Construction, Screening, and Specific Embodiments\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides EDCs that comprise a targeting moiety linked to a therapeutic agent via a stable (and, in some embodiments, non-cleavable) linker and where drug and targeting moiety dissociation is not required for efficacy. Thus, the EDCs of the invention comprise (i) a targeting moiety targeting an extracellular target, (ii) a stable or non-cleavable linker, and (iii) a therapeutic agent that targets an extracellular target. The EDC can be represented as follows: (targeting moiety)-(linker)-(therapeutic agent).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn EDC of the invention may be prepared by any of several routes, employing organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of a targeting moiety with a bivalent linker reagent, to form antibody-linker intermediate, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with an activated agent; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of an agent with a linker reagent, to form drug-linker intermediate, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of a targeting moiety. Conjugation methods (1) and (2) may be employed with a variety of targeting moieties, agents, and linkers to prepare an EDC of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleophilic groups on antibodies for example include, but are not limited to: (i) N-terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (Cleland's reagent, dithiothreitol) or TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; Getz et al (1999) Anal. Biochem. Vol 273:73-80; Soltec Ventures, Beverly, Mass.). Each cysteine disulfide bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody-drug conjugates may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties, which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, G. T. (1996) Bioconjugate Techniques; Academic Press: New York, p 234-242). In another embodiment, proteins containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (Geoghegan & Stroh, (1992) Bioconjugate Chem. 3:138-146; U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,852). Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol, hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, EDCs of the invention are constructed by combinatorial synthesis and screening. Libraries or combinations of targeting moieties and agents linked through non-cleavable or stable linkers can be constructed and screened to identify specific EDCs of the invention. In one embodiment, a single non-internalizing agent is linked to a library of targeting moieties and screened for a particular therapeutic effect to identify EDCs of the invention. In one embodiment, a single non-internalizing targeting moiety is linked to a library of agents and screened for a particular therapeutic effect to identify EDCs of the invention. In one embodiment, a a library of non-internalizing agents is linked to a library of targeting moieties and screened for a particular therapeutic effect to identify EDCs of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of skill in the art will appreciate that EDCs can be prepared by any of several routes, employing well known organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of a targeting moiety with a bivalent linker reagent to form targeting moiety-linker intermediate via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with an activated drug moiety; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of a drug moiety with a linker reagent, to form drug-linker intermediate, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of a targeting moiety. Conjugation methods (1) and (2) may be employed with a variety of targeting moieties, drug moieties, and stable or non-cleavable linkers to prepare the EDC of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleophilic groups on targeting moieties include, but are not limited to: (i) N-terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain targeting moieties like antibodies may have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (Cleland's reagent, dithiothreitol) or TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; Getz et al (1999) Anal. Biochem. Vol 273:73-80; Soltec Ventures, Beverly, Mass.). Each cysteine disulfide bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into protein targeting moieties through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEDC's may also be produced by modification of the targeting moiety to introduce electrophilic moieties, which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. For example, sugars of glycosylated proteins may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated protein with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, G. T. (1996) Bioconjugate Techniques; Academic Press: New York, p234-242). In another embodiment, proteins containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (Geoghegan & Stroh, (1992) Bioconjugate Chem. 3:138-146; U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,852). Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol, hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClose proximity targets may be chosen in a number of methods. One such method will be to search literature references for targets that are important to a disease or indication of interest. Drugs relevant to these targets can then be identified either by searching for pre-existing drugs (e.g. FDA approved drugs) or by screening drug libraries. If drugs exist, one would search for epitopes near the drugs' target to which targeting moieties would bind yet not interefere with the drugs binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, the epitopes may be on the same protein. Finding close proximity epitopes on the same protein may be accomplished through known molecular structures such as co-crystal structures where the drug and target are shown at the molecular level. Epitopes near the drugs' binding site can then be assessed, selected, mimics produced and screened for binding targeting moieties. One examples of this would be to produce peptides identical to the epitope whereby antibodies could be produced and screened. Another method would be to produce the entire protein or over-express the protein on the surface of cells and produce antibodies which would subsequently be screened for specific epitope binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, the epitopes may be on a protein that forms a complex with the drug's target or on different proteins that may merely be in close proximity. In many of these cases, the complex or the two proteins will be located on the cell surface membrane. Interactions between membrane-bound proteins play a significant role in a variety of cellular phenomena, including the transduction of signals across membranes, the transfer of membrane proteins between the plasma membrane and internal organelles, and the assembly of oligomeric protein structures. In some cases, close proximity proteins may be known. In other cases, known close proximity proteins that form complexes have been tested by crosslinking studies or by testing their interactions in model systems or by removing one of the proteins in a model cell and running tests to analyze the outcome. When specific antibodies are available, immunoprecipitation of the target protein along with its noncovalent binding protein partners, i.e., coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP), has been a commonly used technique for identifying potential interacting proteins surrounding the target proteins. Co-IP methods have generated large-scale protein interaction data in yeast, mammalian, and many other organisma, and the validation of many of these results with orthogonal methods confirms the utility of these methods. Chemical cross-linking coupled with immunoprecipitation provides an alternative strategy for in vivo identification of protein-protein interactions which has been extensively reviewed. Cross-linking reactions can be carried out with intact cells and chemically “freeze” protein-protein interactions with stable covalent bonds that allow subsequent purification steps to be carried out under much harsher or more stringent conditions. Consequently, nonspecific binding can be reduced considerably. In addition, immunoprecipitation in conjunction with cross-linking is well suited for investigating the interactions of membrane proteins. Isolation and purification of membrane proteins usually requires use of detergents that can sometimes disrupt interactions among membrane proteins. Thus, stabilization of the complexes with cross-linkers prior to immunoprecipitation of membrane proteins significantly increases the chances of identification of the proteins bound to the antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this case, one skilled in the art would know how to crosslink associated or complex targets chemically. For example, protein-protein contacts can be revealed by incubating samples with cross-linking reagents. Complexes can be detected and isolated either by SDS-PAGE or by HPLC. Once isolated the targets can be digested and analyzed by mass spectroscopy to determine the fragments molecular mass and entered into databases or through computer algorithms, such as Mink (Lee Y J. et al. \nJ Proteome Res. \n2007 October; 6(10):3908-17) to determine the actual proteins that form the close proximity targets. Employing chemical cross-linkers with added hydrophobicity coupled with immunoprecipitation is a more recent finding and a practical strategy for mapping protein-protein interactions in cell membranes (Tang, X. et al. \nMol. BioSyst., \n2010, 6, 939-947). Once close proximity targets of this type are beleived to exist, antibodies labeled with fluorescent dye pairs to both proteins can be used to confirm close proximity. The process of finding drugs and targeting moieties in close proximity to targets of this type would be as described above for targets that exist on the same protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn EDC of the invention would then be prepared as described above by attaching the drug and the targeting moiety which both interacts with targets suspected of or confirmed as being in close proximity via a stable and/or non-cleavable linker. Generally speaking, the linker should be no less than 50 angstoms in length but could be as long as 500 angstroms in length. The EDC consisting of a drug, a linker and a targeting moeiety all attached covalently would then be purified away from uncoupled drug, linker and targeting moiety using standard affinity, size exclusion, filtration, or other methods known to one skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce a particular EDC is constructed, it may be screened using any of various methods known to those skilled in the art. It should be noted that in cases where the targets of the drug and targeting moiety are found on different proteins, these targets may only be in close proximity on certain cell types and thus multiple screens should be conducted in order to better understand the specificity and what cell types may have the targets in close proximity. These include but are not limited to various in vitro and in vivo methods known in the art. Candidate EDCs may be screened serially and individually, or in parallel under medium or high-throughput screening formats. The rate at which EDC may be screened for utility for prophylactic or therapeutic treatments of diseases or disorders is limited only by the rate of synthesis or screening methodology, including detecting/measuring/analysis of data.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, in vitro screening is conducted first. For example, the cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of an EDC is first measured by: exposing test cells, e.g. mammalian cells having tumor-associated antigens or receptor proteins to the antibody of the EDC, in a cell culture medium; culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days; and measuring cell viability (or other property). Cell-based in vitro assays are used to measure viability, i.e. proliferation (IC\n50\n), cytotoxicity (\nEC50\n), and induction of apoptosis (caspase activation) of the EDC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor in vivo testing, transgenic animals and cell lines are particularly useful in screening antibody-drug conjugates (EDC) that have potential as prophylactic or therapeutic treatments of diseases or disorders involving overexpression of tumor-associated antigens and cell surface receptors, e.g. HER2 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,632,979). Screening for a useful EDC may involve administering candidate EDC over a range of doses to the transgenic animal, and assaying at various time points for the effect(s) of the EDC on the disease or disorder being evaluated. Alternatively, or additionally, the drug can be administered prior to or simultaneously with exposure to an inducer of the disease, if applicable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEDCs of the invention are provided in a variety of embodiments. In one embodiment, the target of the targeting moiety and the target of the agent are the same. In one embodiment, the target of the targeting moiety and the target of the agent are part of the same multi-target complex. In one embodiment, the targeting moiety and the therapeutic agent, when linked together, act on the same target, and targeting moiety binding does not prevent the agent's effect or binding. In one embodiment, the targeting moiety and the therapeutic agent, when linked together, act on the same target where targeting moiety binding occurs simultaneously with agent binding and effect. In one embodiment, the targeting moiety and the therapeutic agent, when linked together, act synergistically. In all embodiments, the target of the targeting moiety and the target of the agent are both extracellular. In one embodiment, the target of the targeting moiety forms a complex with the target of the agent. In one embodiment, the invention provides an EDC that comprises a non-internalizing targeting moiety linked through a stable or non-cleavable linker to an agent. In all embodiments, the invention provides an EDC that does not require internalization to cause a therapeutic effect. In all embodiments, the invention provides an EDC that is composed of a non-internalizing targeting moiety and a therapeutic agent that acts on an extracellular target. In all embodiments, the linker of the invention is selected to allow both the targeting moiety and the agent to bind or act on their targets without requiring linker cleavage. In all embodiments, the targeting moiety and the therapeutic agent bind simultaneously to create a desired therapeutic effect. In all embodiments, the linker is long enough to allow simultaneous binding of the targeting moiety and the agent. In various embodiments, the targeting moiety and the therapeutic agent, linked by a stable or non-cleavable linker, act on different targets. In the latter embodiments, the targeting moiety and the therapeutic agent are linked by a stable or non-cleavable linker that is long enough to allow the targeting moiety and agent to act on or bind simultaneously to different targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, the target antigens are on tumor cells, stromal cells, endothelial cells of tumors, cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes, or are otherwise antigens associated with cancer, inflammatory reactions, diabetes, or pain. The compounds of the invention are administered to the patient, carried through the blood stream, and, when in the vicinity of a target cell or antigen, bind to a target antigen via the targeting moiety and simultaneously or contemporaneously bind to the target of the drug to create a desired therapeutic effect. In another embodiment, EDCs of the invention comprise a targeting moiety that recognizes targets associated with metastatic diseased cells. Targets such as dysadherin have been found associated with metastatic diseased cells. Thus, in some embodiments, EDCs of the invention comprise a targeting moiety that binds to dysadherin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention provides an EDC that comprises an agent, a stable or non-cleavable linker, and a targeting moiety that recognizes an isoform of a subunit of the Na,K-ATPase ion transporter complex. The Na,K-ATPase is characterized by a complex molecular heterogeneity that results from the expression and differential association of multiple isoforms of its alpha-, beta- and gamma-subunits (see review in \nAm. J. Physiol. \n275 (\nRenal Physiol. \n44): F633-F650, 1998). The Na,K-ATPase belongs to a widely distributed class of P-type ATPases that are responsible for the active transport of a variety of cations across cell membranes. At present, as many as four different alpha-isoforms, three distinct beta-isoforms, and nine distinct gamma-isoforms have been identified in mammalian cells. The stringent constraints on the structure of the complex's isoforms during evolution and their tissue specific and developmental pattern of expression suggests that different Na,K-ATPase complexes have evolved distinct properties to respond to cellular requirements. Different isoforms of the alpha-subunit are expressed at different levels on different cell types and behave differently. Therefore, EDCs of the invention include those targeting the various different Na,K-ATPase complexes. The alpha-subunit contains the binding sites for cations, ATP, Src kinase, and various therapeutic agents. Some of the agents are derived from the cardiac glysoside class of molecules. Therefore in one embodiment of the invention, the alpha-subunit can act as the target for the agent of EDCs of the invention and the agent is a cardiac glycoside. In another embodiment, the invention provides an EDC that comprises a targeting moiety that recognizes a subunit isoform of the Na,K-ATPase complex, a stable or non-cleavable linker, and a therapeutic agent which acts on the alpha-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase. Specifically, the cardiac glycoside class of molecules has been mainly used therapeutically in the treatment of cardiac failure, due to their anti-arrhythmic effects. Recently it was determined that this class of drugs also has anti-cancer activities, yet use as an anti-cancer drug has not yet been approved due to cardiotoxicity at levels required. Targeting this class of molecules away from the heart and toward cancer cells would thus be beneficial. Therefore, in one embodiment of the invention, cardiac glycoside derivatives can act as the agent of the EDC of the invention. In one embodiment, these EDCs comprise a therapeutic agent that is a member of the cardiac glycoside class of small molecules. In various embodiments of the invention, cardiac glycosides and related agents are attached through a stable linker to antibodies that target the drugs to cancerous tissue providing therapeutically useful EDCs of the invention for treating cancer [(Johansson, et al, Anti-Cancer Drugs (2001) 12; 475-483) and (Prassas and Diamandis, Nature Drug Discovery (2008) 7; 926-932) and (Mijatovic et al. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets (2008) 12 (11) 1403-1417).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe beta-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase complex is believed to act as a chaperone for the alpha-subunit, directing its location on the cell membrane and can be aberrantly glycosylated on certain diseased cells. Targeting moieties that differentially bind to certain glycosylated forms of proteins have been generated. Therefore, in one embodiment of the invention, aberrantly glycosylated targets can act as a target for the targeting moiety of EDCs of the invention. The different isoforms of the beta-subunit are found on different cells and expressed at different levels. Therefore, in one embodiment of the invention, EDCs of the invention comprise targeting moieties that specifically recognize an isoform of the target complex. More specifically, in another embodiment of the invention, EDCs of the invention comprise targeting moieties that specifically recognize a beta-subunit isoform of the target complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gamma-subunit's specific role is thought to regulate the activity of ion transport and has been shown to modify voltage dependence of the complex. The gamma-subunit is thought not to be required for ATPase activity (Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1981 102:250-257). Specifically, the gamma subunit isoform 5 is over-expressed on certain cancer cell types and appears to be a sole prognosticator of metastasis (Nam, J. et. al Cencer Lett. 255(2): 161-169). Gamma-subunits are constructed from a FXYD peptide span that is universal. There are multiple FXYD or gamma-subunit isoforms and expression differs by cell type and cell environment. This subunit also has been shown to complex with other proteins besides the Na,K-ATPase ion pump. Tissue/cell-specific expression of the regulatory FXYD subunits of Na-K-ATPase is not static, and may be changed to adapt to a given physiological or pathological situation. It is believed that a complex that includes an FXYD subunit will do so base on expression levels of the various isoforms and competition with the complexes it associates with. Therefore, expression of FXYD and specifically FXYD5, does not always indicate that it will be associated with the Na,K-ATPase ion channel. Thus in another embodiment of the invention, gamma-subunit 5 (also known as dysadherin and FXYD5) can act as a target for the targeting moiety of EDCs of the invention. In particular, one embodiment of an EDC of the invention comprises an agent that acts on the Na,K-ATPase ion pump, a non-cleavable linker and an antibody which binds to the gamma 5 subunit FXYD5. In another embodiment of the invention, a cardiac glycoside is attached through a non-cleavable or stable linker to a targeting moiety which binds to FXYD5. In another embodiment of the invention, a cardiac glycoside is attached through a non-cleavable or stable linker to an targeting moiety which is an antibody that binds to FXYD5. In another embodiment of the invention, an cardiac glycoside is attached through a non-cleavable or stable linker to the antibody M53. In another embodiment of the invention, the cardiac glycoside CEN-09-106 is attached through a non-cleavable or stable linker to the antibody M53. In another embodiment of the invention, the cardiac glycoside CEN-09-106 is attached through a PEG linker to the antibody M53. In another embodiment of the invention, the cardiac glycoside CEN-09-106 is attached through a PEG24 linker to the antibody M53.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides EDCs that comprise a targeting moiety linked to a cardiac glycoside that can be used as anti-inflammatory agent or to treat other diseases. Studies suggest the Na,K-ATPase subunit isoform/modulator distribution and levels in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients are distinct from those of a normal lung, and so are a target for therapeutic agents against cystic fibrosis hyperinflammation. Studies reveal that cardiac glycosides that bind to the Na,K-ATPase can suppress hypersecretion of IL-8 from cultured CF epithelial cells via specific inhibition phosphorylation of a NF-kappa B inhibitor (see Srivastava, M., et.al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2004, 101, 7693-7698, incorporated herein by reference). A review of the potential therapeutic uses of cardiac glycosides discusses obesity, kidney disease, migraines, epilepsy, dystonia, Parkinsonism (2007 Journal of Internal Medicine 261; 44-52).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention provides an EDC that comprises an agent, a stable or non-cleavable linker, and a targeting moiety that recognizes the monocarboxilate transporter (MCT) or an a protein complexed with MCT protein. MCT1 and MCT4 (known as SLC16A1 and SLC16A3, respectively) key lactate membrane importer (MCT1) and exporter (MCT4) are overexpressed in various cancers to compensate for altered lactate production (a basic signature of cancer). The glycoprotein CD147 (also known as basigin, EMMPRIN, OX-47 and HT7—overexpressed in many cancers and used as a prognostic marker) is required for functional assembly of MCT1 and MCT4 and exists in the functional transporter complex. Therefore, EDCs of the invention include those targeting various monocarboxilate transporter proteins or proteins that are complexed with MCT proteins. While small molecule inhibition of MCT, CD147 silencing and CD147-targeted mAbs display anticancer properties, most MCT inhibitors to date lack specificity and/or sufficient potentency. Conjugation of MCT inhibitors to anti-CD147 mAbs (as described in this application) is anticipated to overcome these limitations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention provides an EDC that comprises an agent, a stable or non-cleavable linker, and a targeting moiety that recognizes the facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs). The facilitative transporter GLUT1 is overexpressed and confers poor prognosis in a wide range of solid tumors, the role of which is to compensate for altered metabolism (glucose metabolism widely recognized as the Warburg effect) in cancer cells. GLUT1 overexpression is believed to also contribute non-metabolic protumorgenic effects and inhibition of GLUT1 (siRNA, mAbs or small molecule inhibitors) reduce tumorgenicity. Additionally GLUT1 is a receptor for the human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) associated with leukemia and neurological syndromes. Notably, GLUT inhibitors to date have moderate affinity at best and display fairly broad specificity. Therefore, EDCs of the invention include those targeting various monocarboxilate transporter proteins or proteins that are complexed with GLUT transporter proteins. Conjugation of GLUT inhibitors to anti-GLUT mAbs (as described in this application) is anticipated to overcome these limitations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention provides an EDC that comprises an agent, a stable or non-cleavable linker, and a targeting moiety that recognizes the Sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs) or proteins associated with SGLTs. In the kidney tubule, the bulk of the filtered glucose is reabsorbed by the low-affinity sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)2, with the residue being reabsorbed by the high affinity SGLT1. SGLT2 plays a dominant role in the control of glucose transport in the kidney, with SGLT1 having a supporting role. SGLT2 inhibitors cause excess glucose energy to be discarded in the urine by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, and consequently shift the energy balance in a negative direction. This renal glucose excretion has the potential to lower the plasma glucose level, abolish glucose toxicity and thereby achieve an improvement in the pathogenesis associated with diabetes. Therefore, EDCs of the invention include those targeting various monocarboxilate transporter proteins or proteins that are complexed with SGLTs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention provides an EDC that comprises an agent, a stable or non-cleavable linker, and a targeting moiety that recognizes proteins associated with the Hedgehog pathway. In the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, the 12 transmembrane receptor patched (PTCH) is a negative regulator of the seven transmembrane receptor smoothened (SMO). PTCH is the receptor for the Hh ligand and inhibits SMO until the Hh ligand binds, allowing SMO to signal. Through an intracellular pathway that is still incompletely understood, this signaling event results in the nuclear translocation of the Hh transcription factors Gli1 and Gli2, which initiate transcription of Hh responsive genes. During development, this pathway is responsible for embryonic patterning in a variety of tissues. There is also strong evidence linking alterations in the Hh pathway (leading to uncontrolled SMO signaling) in a number of cancers. Therefore, EDCs of the invention include those targeting various proteins of the Hedgehog pathway. Specifically conjugation of small molecule effectors of the Hedgehop pathway to anti-SMO or anti-Patch mAbs (as described in this application) are embodiments of EDCs of this invention. More specifically conjugation cyclopamine deriviatives to anti-SMO or anti-Patch mAbs (as described in this application) are further embodiments of EDCs of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention provides an EDC that comprises an agent, a stable or non-cleavable linker, and a targeting moiety that recognizes the V-ATPase or a protein complexed with V-ATPase protein. The V-ATPase is the primary regulator of the tumor microenvironment, by means of proton extrusion to the extracellular medium. The decrease in extracellular pH confers the cells a resistant, highly invasive and metastatic phenotype. However, the acid medium confers an optimum pH to the degradative enzymes (such as proteases and MMPs) for their proper functioning. Aberant and/or over-expression of V-ATPases and/or specific V-ATPase subunits is a signature of many cancers. In normal cells, V-ATPases are found within intracellular plasma membranes however, there is some evidence to suggest aberrant display of these proton pumps within the extracellular membrane, thereby providing an alteration of extracellular pH. Therefore, EDCs of the invention include those targeting various V-ATPase proteins or proteins that are complexed with V-ATPases associated proteins. V-ATPase small molecule inhibitors are known to provide both anticancer effects and resensitize cancer cells to classical chemotherapeutics. However, existing V-ATPase inhibitors can not discriminate between extracellular versus intracellular V-ATPases and therefore remain highly toxic non-specific agents. Conjugation of V-ATPases inhibitors to V-ATPases mAbs or mAbs to V-ATPase associated proteins (as described in this application) is anticipated to overcome these limitations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention provides an EDC that comprises an agent, a stable or non-cleavable linker, and a targeting moiety that recognizes CD44/MDR. A correlation between the expression of MDR proteins (such as Pgp or BCRP) and CD44 has been found in various cancer cell lines and these studies also revealed that the two proteins co-localize within the cell membrane. One protein directly influences the expression of the other and disruption of this interaction has profound effects on drug resistance, cell migration, and in vitro invasion. Therefore, EDCs of the invention include those targeting various CD44/MDR proteins or proteins that are complexed with CD44/MDR proteins. It is anticipated that this invention could be used significantly improve existing small molecule MDR reversal agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention provides an EDC that comprises an agent, a stable or non-cleavable linker, and a targeting moiety that recognizes the GPCR thyrotropin receptor. Antibodies to the activated state of the thyrotropin receptor coupled to a small molecule agonist through a a stable or non-cleavable linker could be produced to treat hypothyroidism. Monoclonal antibodies have already been generated that function as thyrotropin receptor agonists and small molecule drug (N-(4-(5-(3-(furan-2-ylmethyl)-4-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazolin-2-yl)-2-methoxybenzyloxy)phenyl)acetamide) has been determined as a lead for activation of the receptor. The combination of a targeting moiety and agent that both activate heteromers of the thyrotropin receptor complex may lead to a novel method of dual activation using an EDC of the invention. Since the targeting moiety can lock the receptor into a conformation allowing for better binding and activity of the agent. GPCR heteromerization has been found to alter the properties of individual receptors where multiple forms of related receptors exist in a complexes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following two tables provide an illustrative list of EDCs of the invention. The first table shows illustrative EDCs (agent and targeting moiety's target) of the invention where the target for both the targeting moiety and agent are on the same molecule and thus, the sites for binding are in close proximity. The second table shows illustrative EDCs (agent, agent's target and targeting moiety's target) of the invention where the target for the targeting moiety and agent are not on the same molecule but in close proximity. The tables also show possible disease indications for which they can be employed.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDCs for which the targets of the targeting moiety and the agent are the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIllustrative\n\n\nTherapeutic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTargets\n\n\nAgents\n\n\nAntibodies\n\n\nIndications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmoothen (SMO)\n\n\ncyclopamine analogs, statins, itraconazole,\n\n\n \n\n\ncancer, tissue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLDE225, BMS 833923, GDC-0449, purmorphamine,\n\n\n \n\n\nregeneration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSANT1, Cur-61414, SAG, IPI-926, 1-amino-4-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\narylphthalazines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCT1\n\n\nAR-C117977, ARC155858, DIDS, luteolin, phloretin,\n\n\n \n\n\narthritis, tissue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nquercetin, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, alpha-cyano-4-\n\n\n \n\n\ntransplantation,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhydroxycinnamic acid, lonidamide\n\n\n \n\n\ncancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrins (alphaV-\n\n\nintegrin inhibitors, RGD peptides, EMD 121974\n\n\nReoPro, Tysabri,\n\n\nOsteoporosis,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeta3, alpha5-\n\n\n(Cilengitide), S36578, S247, S137, PSK1404\n\n\nAmbegrin,\n\n\ncancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbete1, alpha6-\n\n\n \n\n\nVitaxin (anti-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeta4, alpha4-\n\n\n \n\n\nalphaVbeta3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbete1, alpha5-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeta6, alphaV-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeta5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEph receptors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS1P Receptors 1-5\n\n\nSEW 2871-agonist\n\n\nCancer\n\n\nCancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nW146 antagonist\n\n\nGraft Rejection\n\n\nImmunosuppreion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFTY720-P\n\n\n \n\n\nGraft Rejection and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nmultiple sclerosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlexins\n\n\nsemaphorins\n\n\n \n\n\nCancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnAChR\n\n\nalpha-Cobratoxin\n\n\n \n\n\nCancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEag-1\n\n\nquinidine\n\n\n \n\n\nCancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCXCR4/fusin\n\n\nAMD3100\n\n\n \n\n\nStem Cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMobilization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCK-2 Receptor\n\n\nL365-260\n\n\nsc-16177\n\n\nCancer/Diabetes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSGLT-2\n\n\nDapagliflozin (BMS-512148), 189075 (GW-189075),\n\n\n \n\n\nDiabetes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n869682 (GW-869682), AVE-2268, KGT-1681, KGT-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1251, TS-033, YM-543, T-1095 (see Isaji, M.

Pharmaceutical Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \nThe administration of the compounds according to the invention can be done by any of the administration methods accepted for the therapeutic agents and generally known in the art. These processes include, but are not limited to, systemic administration, for example by parenteral, oral, nasal, or topical administration. Parenteral administration is done generally by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection, or by perfusion. In general, antibody based therapeutics are typically administered intravenously. The injectable compositions can be prepared in standard forms, either in suspension or liquid solution or in solid form that is suitable for an extemporaneous dissolution in a liquid. In one embodiment, parenteral administration uses the installation of a system with slow release or extended release that ensures the maintenance of a constant dose level. For intranasal administration, it is possible to use suitable intranasal vehicles that are well known to those skilled in the art. The oral administration can be done by means of tablets, capsules, soft capsules (including formulations with delayed release or extended release), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, dyes, suspensions, syrups and emulsions. This form of presentation is more particularly suited for the passage of the intestinal barrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage for the administration of compounds according to the invention is selected according to a variety of factors including the type, strain, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the subject; the severity of the condition to be treated; the method of administration; the condition of the renal and hepatic functions of the subject and the nature of the particular compound or salt that is used. A normally experienced doctor will easily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the desired compound to prevent, disrupt or stop the progress of the medical condition that is to be treated. By way of examples, when given parenterally, the effective levels of the compounds according to the invention will be in the range of from about 0.002 to about 500 mg per kg of body weight, more particularly from about 0.02 mg to about 50 mg per kg of body weight and administered daily, weekly, or biweekly. The compounds according to the invention can be administered in the form of single daily doses, or the total daily dosage can be administered in two, three, four or more doses per day. More specifically, the dosage can in some embodiments be similar in the range of 1-20 mgs/meter squared (mgs/m\n2\n) body surface area (bsa), and the doses can be administered weekly or every two weeks. For solid tumors the dosage may in some embodiments be higher, e.g., an initial dose in the range of 200 to 600 mgs/m\n2 \nbsa or ˜1 to 20 mgs/kg (given, e.g., through a 120-minute intravenous infusion) and 150-350 mgs/m\n2 \nor 1-10 mgs/kg (given through 60-minute intravenous infusion). Therefore the dosing range of the compounds according to the invention can be daily to weekly dosages of 1 mgs/m\n2 \nto 500 mgs/m\n2 \nbsa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions according to the invention can be sterilized and/or can contain one or more of: non-toxic adjuvants and auxiliary substances such as agents for preservation, stabilization, wetting or emulsification; agents that promote dissolution; and salts to regulate osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they can also contain other substances that offer a therapeutic advantage. The compositions are prepared, respectively, by standard processes of mixing, granulation or coating well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention herein can be administered concurrently, sequentially, or alternating with the second drug or upon non-responsiveness with other therapy. Thus, the combined administration of a second drug includes co-administration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) therapies simultaneously exert their biological activities. Multiple second drugs may be used in combination the compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the invention, articles of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above are provided. In one aspect, the article of manufacture comprises (a) a container comprising the compounds herein (preferably the container comprises the EDC and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent within the container); and (b) a package insert with instructions for treating the disorder in a patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided herein are methods for assessing the activity of an EDC of the invention. In one method, a targeting moiety can be used to recognize the target of the targeting moiety of the invention, but most preferably it is one of those disclosed herein. One of these methods is a method of assessing the presence of the antibody's target of the invention comprising subjecting patient tissue from tumors (such as lung cancer, but including all tumor types) to the targeting moiety alone of the EDC and analyzing binding by immunohistological methods which are known in the art. One method for assessing the activity of an EDC of the invention in tumor tissue comprises subjecting patient tissue from a tumor to fluorescent resonance transfer to determine whether the agent's and targeting moiety's targets are within close proximity. In this method the targeting moiety is labeled with one fluorophore and an agent target specific antibody (or similar) labeled with another fluorophore can absorb energy of a specific wavelength and re-emit energy at a different (but equally specific) wavelength. Another method for assessing the activity of the EDC in tumor tissue comprising subjecting patient tissue from tumors (such as lung cancer, but including all tumor types) treated with the EDC to FDG-PET imaging and then determining if the targeting moiety alone inhibits FDG uptake into the tissue. Inhibition of FDG uptake correlates with delayed tumor growth in this method by the EDC of the invention. Methods for carrying out the imaging and determining if FDG uptake is inhibited are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic EDCs of the invention may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. The EDC will typically be administered parenterally, i.e. infusion, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal, bolus, intratumor injection or epidural (Shire et al (2004) J. Pharm. Sciences 93(6):1390-1402). Pharmaceutical formulations of EDCs are typically prepared for parenteral administration with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form. An EDC having the desired degree of purity is optionally mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients or stabilizers, in the form of a lyophilized formulation or an aqueous solution (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980) 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcceptable parenteral vehicles, diluents, carriers, excipients, and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN.™., PLURONICS.™. or polyethylene glycol (PEG). For example, lyophilized anti-ErbB2 antibody formulations are described in WO 97/04801, expressly incorporated herein by reference. An exemplary formulation of an EDC contains about 100 mg/ml of trehalose (2-(hydroxymethyl)-6-[3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydropyran-2-yl]oxy-tetrahydropyran-3,4,5-triol; C\n12\nH\n22\nO\n11\n; CAS Number 99-20-7) and about 0.1% TWEEN.™. 20 (\npolysorbate\n 20; dodecanoic acid 2-[2-[3,4-bis(2-hydroxyethoxy)tetrahydrofuran-2-yl]-2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)et-hoxy]ethyl ester; C\n25\nH\n50\nO\n10\n; CAS Number 9005-64-5) at approximately pH 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations of a therapeutic EDC may contain certain amounts of unreacted drug moiety (D), antibody (or other targeting moiety)-linker intermediate (Ab-L), and/or drug-linker intermediate (D-L), as a consequence of incomplete purification and separation of excess reagents, impurities, and by-products, in the process of making the EDC; or time/temperature hydrolysis or degradation upon storage of the bulk EDC or formulated EDC composition. For example, it may contain a detectable amount of drug-linker or various intermediates. Alternatively, or in addition to, it may contain a detectable amount of the un-linked free targeting moiety. An exemplary formulation may contain up to 10% molar equivalent of the agent of agent linker as it was determined by the in vitro cellular proliferation assays that in some cases the drug-linker conjugate less potent in cell killing than free drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active pharmaceutical ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semi permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the EDC, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT.™. (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile, which is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration routes. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions contain the active materials (EDC) in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcelluose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxy-benzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of EDC may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butane-diol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 .mu.g of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL/hr can occur. Subcutaneous (bolus) administration may be effected with about 1.5 ml or less of total volume and a concentration of about 100 mg EDC per ml. For EDC that require frequent and chronic administration, the subcutaneous route may be employed, such as by pre-filled syringe or autoinjector device technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a general proposition, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of EDC administered per dose will be in the range of about 0.01-100 mg/kg, namely about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg/kg/day. For example, human patients may be initially dosed at about 1.0 mg EDC per kg patient body weight. The dose may be escalated to the maximally tolerated dose (MTD). The dosing schedule may be about every 3 weeks, but according to diagnosed condition or response, the schedule may be more or less frequent. The dose may be further adjusted during the course of treatment to be at or below MTD which can be safely administered for multiple cycles, such as about 4 or more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough oral administration of protein therapeutics are generally disfavored due to poor bioavailability due to limited absorption, hydrolysis or denaturation in the gut, formulations of EDC suitable for oral administration may be prepared as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the EDC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations may be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water, for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Exemplary unit dosage formulations contain a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefore. Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered parenterally, orally or by any other desired route.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is contemplated that the EDCs of the present invention may be used to treat various diseases or disorders, such as cancer and autoimmune conditions in human or animal subjects. In one embodiment, the subject is a human. In another embodiment, the subject is a non-human animal (e.g dog, cat, horse, bird, etc.) Exemplary conditions or disorders include benign or malignant tumors; leukemia and lymphoid malignancies; other disorders such as neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic, glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal, blastocoelic, inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe EDC compounds which are identified in the animal models and cell-based assays can be further tested in tumor-bearing higher primates and human clinical trials. Human clinical trials can be designed similar to the clinical trials testing efficacy. The clinical trial may be designed to evaluate the efficacy of an EDC in combination with known therapeutic regimens, such as radiation and/or chemotherapy involving known chemotherapeutic and/or cytotoxic agents (Pegram et al (1999) Oncogene 18:2241-2251). In one embodiment, the combination therapeutic agent is selected from Bevacizumab; Carboplatin; Cisplatin; Cyclophosphamide; Docetaxel injection; Doxorubicin; Etoposide; Etoposide Phosphate; Gemzar (gemcitabine HCL); Hycamtin (topotecan hydrochloride); Ifosfamide; Iressa (gefitinib); Irinotecan injection; Methotrexate injection; Mitomycin; Paclitaxel; Photofrin, QLT; Premetrexed; Procarbazine; Streptozocin; Tarceva (erlotinib); Vinblasine; Vincristine; and Vinorelbine tartrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of cancer to be treated herein include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, as well as head and neck cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an EDC will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 .mu.g/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1-20 mg/kg) of molecule is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 .mu.g/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary, dosage of EDC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg of patient weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn EDC of the invention may be combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second compound having anti-cancer properties. The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the EDC of the combination such that they do not adversely affect each other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe second compound may be a chemotherapeutic agent, cytotoxic agent, cytokine, growth inhibitory agent, anti-hormonal agent, aromatase inhibitor, protein kinase inhibitor, lipid kinase inhibitor, anti-androgen, antisense oligonucleotide, ribozyme, gene therapy vaccine, anti-angiogenic agent and/or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. A pharmaceutical composition containing an EDC may also have a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent such as a tubulin-forming inhibitor, a topoisomerase inhibitor, or a DNA binder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther therapeutic regimens may be combined with the administration of an anticancer agent identified in accordance with this invention. The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, treatment with an EDC of the present invention involves the combined administration of an anticancer agent identified herein, and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents, including coadministration of cocktails of different chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapeutic agents include taxanes (such as paclitaxel and doxetaxel) and/or anthracycline antibiotics. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers's instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Chemotherapy Service Ed., M. C. Perry, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md. (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anticancer agent may be combined with an anti-hormonal compound; e.g., an anti-estrogen compound such as tamoxifen; an anti-progesterone such as onapristone (EP 616812); or an anti-androgen such as flutamide, in dosages known for such molecules. Where the cancer to be treated is hormone independent cancer, the patient may previously have been subjected to anti-hormonal therapy and, after the cancer becomes hormone independent, the anti-ErbB2 antibody (and optionally other agents as described herein) may be administered to the patient. It may be beneficial to also coadminister a cardioprotectant (to prevent or reduce myocardial dysfunction associated with the therapy) or one or more cytokines to the patient. In addition to the above therapeutic regimes, the patient may be subjected to surgical removal of cancer cells and/or radiation therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combination therapy may provide an effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. The effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, an effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e. serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of the EDC compounds described herein, to the extent such products are novel and unobvious over the prior art. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes novel and unobvious compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolite products may be identified by preparing a radiolabelled EDC, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g. by MS, LC/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well-known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the EDC compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolites include the products of in vivo cleavage of the EDC where cleavage of any bond occurs that links the drug moiety to the antibody. Metabolic cleavage may thus result in the naked antibody, or an antibody fragment. The antibody metabolite may be linked to a part, or all, of the linker. Metabolic cleavage may also result in the production a drug moiety or part thereof. The drug moiety metabolite may be linked to a part, or all, of the linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, an article of manufacture, or “kit”, containing EDC and materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, or blister pack. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds an EDC composition which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is an EDC. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice, such as cancer. For example, the cancer may be one which overexpresses one of the targets of the EDC of the invention. The label or package insert may also indicate that the composition can be used to treat cancer, wherein the cancer is not characterized by overexpression of one of the targets of the EDC of the invention. In other embodiments, the package insert may indicate that the EDC composition can be used also to treat hormone independent cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer or colorectal cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe article of manufacture may comprise a container with a compound contained therein, wherein the compound comprises an EDC of the present invention. The article of manufacture in this embodiment may further comprise a package insert indicating that the EDC can be used to treat cancer. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of manufacture may further comprise a second (or third) container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.\n\n\n \nExamples \n\n\n \n \n \nFurther advantages and characteristics of the invention will emerge from the following Examples, given by way of illustration and which are not to be construed as limiting, and in which reference will be made to the accompanying drawings. It will be clear that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as particularly described in the foregoing Examples. Numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and, therefore, are within the scope of the appended claims following these Examples. The Examples are divided into an Agent Synthesis section, an Antibody section and an EDC section.\n\n\n \nAgent Synthesis\n\n\nExample 1 \n\n\nSynthesis of Linker Ready Therapeutic Agents and Biotin\n\n\n \n \n \nTo show that illustrative compounds of the invention are useful at targeting and killing tumor cells, therapeutic agents with activity toward the Na,K-ATPase were synthesized and then coupled to Na,K-ATPase specific antibodies via non-cleavable linkers. The agents were synthesized with active groups which could be coupled to non-cleavable linkers. The agents can also be used as controls to test agent activity when not coupled to antibodies via the linkers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycinyl hydrazone of scillarenone (CEN09-104) was prepared as follows and used in Example 3.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n[(tert-Butyloxycarbonyl)amino]acetyl-hydrazine.

Clinical Oncology \n21(4) 659-667 (2003)), Erb (Erbitux from Imclone Systems, Inc.), and α-FL (31242 from Thermo Scientific). Antibodies L15, N20 and M53 all recognize and bind human FXYD5, Erb recognizes and binds human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) found on the surface of many tumor cell lines, and α-FL recognizes and binds fluorescein. M53 and α-FL are of mouse origin and monoclonal. Erb is a chimeric mouse/human antibody and monoclonal. L15 and N20 are of goat origin and are polyclonal.\n\n\n \nExample 2 \n\n\nMapping of the Epitope to which Antibody M53 Binds\n\n\n \n \n \nTo better understand the recognition of antibodies used for the illustrative compounds of the invention, epitope mapping was conducted. If the genetic sequence or protein sequence is known or determined for the EDC's antibody's target, epitope mapping may allow the pre-use determination of EDC activity. Therefore, where not previously determined, linear epitope recognition of the antibodies used in examples 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, was determined. Overlapping peptide sequences were synthesized that represent positions 24 through 145 of the extracellular domain of human FXYD5, each peptide was synthesized with a cysteine at its amino terminus to facilitate conjugation to maleimide activated BSA (cat. number: 77116, Pierce Biotechnology). Peptides were coupled to BSA per the manufactures protocol, and any unreacted maleimide groups of the BSA were capped by the addition of L-cysteine. ELISA plates (cat. number: 9017, Corning) were coated with 250 ng of each BSA-peptide in 100 ×l of 200 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 overnight at 4° C. Coated ELISA plates were washed 3× with \nPBS pH\n 7, blocked 30 min with in \nPBS pH\n 7 +1% non-fat dry milk (PBS+NFDM), then washed 3× with \nPBS pH\n 7. 100 uL of NCC-M53 diluted to 1 ug/mL in PBS+NFDM was added to all wells, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, then washed 3× with \nPBS pH\n 7. Goat anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase (cat. number: A1418, Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted 1:15,000 in PBS+NFDM then added in 100 uL to each well, incubated 30 min at room temperature, then washed 3× with PBS pH7. PNPP (cat. number:, Pierce Biotechnology) at 1 mg/mL in 1M DEA with 50 mM MgCl2, pH 9.8 added to each well at 100 μL per well, incubated 30 minutes at room temperature and the absorbance at 450 nm was read for each well. Results showed that M53 binds an epitope contained within \nSeq ID\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ96DB9[22-145], FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 5, \nHomo \nsapiens\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeq ID\n \n \n \n 1 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        10         20         30         40         50         60\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSPSGRLCLL TIVGLILPTR G\nQTLKDTTSS SSADSTIMDI QVPTRAPDAV YTELQPTSPT\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        70         80         90        100        110        120\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPTWPADETPQ PQTQTQQLEG TDGPLVTDPE THKSTKAAHP TDDTTTLSER PSPSTDVQTD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n       130        140        150        160        170\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPQTLKPSGFH EDDPFFYDEH TLRKR\nGLLVA AVLFITGIII LTSGKCRQLS RLCRNHCR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparing Targeting Moieties for conjugation. Selective conjugation of antibodies through sulfhydryl residues first requires antibody disulfide reduction. This was carried out using one of two methods. In one method, termed BME, 2-Mercaptoethanol was used, and for the second method, termed TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was used. Each is described below and was used in various examples to prepare antibodies for coupling. The TCEP method is generally the preferred method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor antibody reduction using the BME method, 1 mg β-ME is added to 1 mg of antibody and mixed in 500 ul 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and incubated at 37° C. for 1.5 hr. Excess β-ME is removed by gel filtration using Sephadex G-25 or similar. The final solution is brought to 1 ml in PBS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor antibody reduction using the TCEP method, each antibody was treated with 8 molar equivalents of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (cat. number: HR2-651, Hampton Research) in 20 mM \nsodium phosphate pH\n 7, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) (MP Biomedical LLC) for 2 h at 37° C. Reactions were placed in an ice bath and once cooled; linker-agents were added as discussed.\n\n\n \nTargeting Moiety Linker Agent Conjugation and Screening\n\n\n \n \n \nIn this section, all EDCs were constructed using PEG24 linker SM(PEG)24—[Part number 22114 Thermo Scientific] unless otherwise noted. Multiple linkers were not used in any of the examples to link agents or biotin. Sometimes linkers are depicted as dashed lines between the antibody designation and the agent or biotin.\n\n\n \nExample 3 \n\n\nProduction and Testing of Antibody-Linker-Biotin Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nTo demonstrate that the agent linking chemistry performs and does not interfere with antibody binding, biotin was first coupled to antibodies via the same conditions and non-cleavable bifunctional PEG24 linker employed to couple the agents used in Example 4 to show EDC activity. First, linker SM(PEG)24 [Thermo Scientific product number 22114] was attached to EZ-Link Amine-PEG2-Biotin [Thermo Scientific—product number 21346] followed by coupling to BME reduced antibodies. The antibody-biotin conjugates were then tested for binding to cells and peptide of sequence 24-39 of \nSeq ID\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCoupling linker to biotin. 1.9 mg of EZ-Link Amine-PEG2-Biotin were dissolved in 100 μl of DMSO to obtain a 50 mM solution. 2 μl of a 250 mM stock of linker SM(PEG)24 was added to 98 μl of DMSO to obtain a 5 mM solution. 50 μl of the 5 mM linker solution were added to 50 μl of the 50 mM Biotin-NH2 solution and di-isopropyl ethylamine (final 58 mM) and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to produce a 2.5 mM solution of the linker-biotin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCoupling linker-biotin to antibody. 5 μl of the 2.5 mM linker-biotin solution were added to 100 μg of the BME reduced antibody in 100 μl PBS and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Non-reacted CG-NH2 (biotin-NH2) and uncoupled linker-biotin was removed from coupled antibody-linker-biotin by gel filtration using Sephadex G-25 or similar.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTesting antibody-linker-biotin binding to peptide. The synthetic peptide representing amino acids 24 through 39 of FXYD5 (Seq ID No. 1) was coupled to maleimide activated BSA (cat. number: 77116, Pierce Biotechnology). Wells of white opaque 96 well tissue culture treated plates (cat. number: 3917, Corning) were coated at 0.5 ng per well of this conjugate in 200 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 overnight at 4° C. An ELISA plate (as prepared above) was washed 3× with \nPBS pH\n 7, then blocked 30 min with 1% BSA in \nPBS pH\n 7. Dilution curves of the biotinylated forms of antibodies L15, N20 and anti-Fl (negative control) were prepared in 1% BSA in \nPBS pH\n 7; then, 100 μL of each were applied to the washed and blocked ELISA plate. After a 30 min incubation at room temperature (RT) the plate was washed 3× with \nPBS pH\n 7; then, 100 uL of a 55 ng/mL solution of streptavidin-HRP conjugate (cat. number: 21130, Pierce Biotechnology) in 1% BSA in \nPBS pH\n 7 were added to each well and allowed to incubate 30 min at RT. Following incubation, the plate was washed 4× with \nPBS pH\n 7, then 100 uL of chemiluminescent substrate (cat. number: 37075, Pierce Biotechnology) were added to each well, the plate shaken 60 seconds, and then read immediately for luminescence using a Wallac Victor II 1420-041 multi-label plate reader. \nFIG. 1\n shows the results of the relative binding experiment. The relative binding affinity, defined as the concentration giving the half-maximal RLU, was calculated as 38.2 nM and 3.75 nM for biotinylated L15 and N20 (respectively).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results in \nFIG. 1\n show that antibodies L15 and N20, when coupled to biotin via the same linker and coupling conditions used to make the EDCs in Example 4, bind to FXYD5 peptide sequence, indicating that conjugation does not interfere with antibody binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTesting antibody-linker-biotin binding to cells. 5000 A549 cells per well of a 96-well tissue culture plate were grown at 37 degrees Celsius at 7% CO2 for 24 hours in growth media RPMI with 10% FCS to exponential growth. Growth media was removed and the cells washed 1× with 200 uL PBS, pH 7.4, then fixed in 100 uL methanol (−10° C.). The methanol was removed and the cells allowed to dry at room temperature. The dried cells were then incubated with 100 uL PBS pH 7.4 +1% BSA for 20 min at RT, and PBS removed by aspiration. To the wells, 100 ul of antibody-linker-biotin was added at the following concentrations; 100 pM=0.75 ngs Ab, 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM. The wells were then washed 3 times with PBS pH 7.4+1% BSA and 100 uL of a 1:20,000 dilution of High Sensitivity Streptavidin-HRP (Pierce) in PBS pH 7.4+1% BSA was added, and incubated 30 min at RT. Wells were washed again 3 times with PBS pH 7.4+1% BSA and 100 μL of SuperSignal ELISA Femto Maximum Sensitivity Chemiluminescent Substrate was added and mixed 1 min on microplate shaker. Luminescence of each well was measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results, shown in \nFIG. 2\n, demonstrate that antibodies M53, L15, N20 and Erbitux, when coupled to biotin via the same linker and coupling conditions used to make the EDCs in Example 4, bind to the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549, indicating that conjugation does not interfere with binding of the antibody to the cells expressing surface antigen targets. Taken together, the results of this example show that coupling antibodies to the PEG24 linker and a small molecule does not interfere with antibody specific recognition.\n\n\n \nExample 4 \n\n\nProduction and Testing of Antibody-Linker-Agent Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nIn this example, polyclonal antibody mixtures were used to demonstrate that illustrative compounds of the invention are useful at targeting and killing tumor cells. To produce EDCs of the invention, therapeutic agents with expected activity toward the Na,K-ATPase were covalently attached to polyclonal antibody mixtures with specificity to FXYD5 through non-cleavable PEG24 linkers and compared to ADCs containing antibodies to targets not in close proximity to the agents' target. The agents alone, the polyclonal antibodies with linker only (no agent), and the antibody-linker-agent conjugates were tested for their ability to disrupt the viability of A549 cells in culture. The results shown in \nFIGS. 3 through 6\n demonstrate that the EDCs are active at disrupting cell viability at various concentrations. The results also show that the reduced antibodies with attached linker without agent, are inactive at the concentrations tested, thus demonstrating that the antibodies require the agent to show activity. The results also show that different agents with different structures and activities can be used and that different polyclonal antibodies raised to different epitopes of the same target can be used in accordance with the invention. The results also show that antibodies to targets on the cells but not within close proximity to the agent's target are not active, indicating simultaneous binding of the antibody and agent is required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCoupling linker to agent. 10 ul of 60 mM stocks of agent were added to 2 ul of a 250 mM stock of linker in DMSO and 10 ul of a 100 mM stock of diisopropylethylamine in DMSO were brought to a volume of 100 ul and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to produce a 5 mM solution of linker coupled agent. To produce antibodies with linkers and no agent, ethanolamine a capping agent was used in place of agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCoupling linker-agent to antibody. 14 μl of the linker-agent solution was added to 500 ug of the BME reduced antibody and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Non-reacted linker-agent and was removed from coupled antibody-linker-agent by gel filtration using Sephadex G-25 or similar.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vitro cell proliferation assays. EDCs of the invention and comparative compounds were assayed in three cancer cell lines to confirm cytotoxic activity. All cell lines were maintained in complete media [RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% (wt/vol) fetal bovine serum and Gentamycin (50 μg/ml)]. Cells were plated at a density of 5,000 cells per well of each 96-well black tissue culture treated microtiter plate in 95 ul complete media, then were grown for 24 hour at 37° C. with 7% CO\n2 \nin a humidified incubator before agent/conjugate addition. In a separate 96-well plate, agent (in DMSO) and antibody conjugate (in PBS) stocks were serially diluted in complete media at 20× final working concentrations, and 5 ul added to the cells used in the assay. Doxorubicin was used as the control to monitor the behavior of the cell lines used. Cells were incubated with the agent/conjugate for 2 days before luminescence reading. Cell viability testing used the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experiments which produced the results shown in \nFIG. 3\n through \nFIG. 6\n were run to test whether a polyclonal antibody mixture (prepared by immunizing animals with a FXYD5 specific peptide) would show cytotoxicity on its own and/or when coupled to an agent specific to a target in close proximity to FXYD5. The data in \nFIG. 3\n show that within the testing concentration range, only when the agent CEN09-104 attached through the non-cleavable linker to FXYD5 specific antibodies (L15-CEN09-104) and not when attached to an antibody specific to a target not in close proximity (Erb-EGFR specific antibodies), does the conjugate show A549 cell cytotoxicity. The data also shows that the free agent (CEN09-104) and the FXYD5 specific EDC (L15-CEN09-104) have similar IC50s. The conjugate with Erb antibody shows no detectable cytotoxicity within the testing range. This demonstrates that for any given EDC, the target of the antibody should be within close proximity of the target of the agent. EGFR (a target shown to be on the cells) is not within close proximity of the agent target and thus Erb-CEN09-104 is not active while L15-CEN09-104 is active.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data in \nFIG. 4\n show that within the testing concentration range, L15 alone (open squares) displayed no A549 cytotoxic activity, while L15 linked to CEN08-243 through the PEG24 linker (L15-PEG24-CEN08-243) and the agent alone do display cytotoxic activity. The data also show that the IC50s of the EDC and agent alone are similar, which indicates that the agent is still active when conjugated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data in \nFIG. 5\n shows that within the testing concentration range, FXYD5 specific antibody L15 (open circle) has no effect at killing the A549 cells, yet when the agent CEN09-107 is attached to FXYD5 specific antibody via the non-cleavable linker (closed square), the EDC L15-PEG24-CEN09-107 shows the ability to kill the A549 cells. The data also shows that, unlike the agent (CEN08-243) used to generate the data in \nFIG. 4\n, the free agent CEN09-107 is more active when not conjugated to L15. This is similar to the data shown in \nFIG. 6\n when CEN09-107 is linked to different polyclonal antibody mixture (raised to another peptide region on the FXYD5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data in \nFIG. 6\n show that within the testing concentration range, FXYD5 specific polyclonal antibody N20 has no effect at killing the A549 cells, yet when the agent CEN09-107 is attached to FXYD5 specific antibody via the non-cleavable linker, the EDC produced, L15-PEG24-CEN09-107, shows the ability to kill the A549 cells. The data is similar to that shown in \nFIG. 5\n, where the free agent CEN09-107 is more active when not conjugated to a FXYD5 specific polyclonal antibody mixture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together, the results of Example 4 shown in \nFIGS. 3-6\n demonstrate that, to observe cytotoxic activity of the EDC of the invention, its antibody's target and its agent's target need to be in close proximity, as is the case for FXYD5 and the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit respectively. The data also demonstrates that therapeutic agents with expected activity toward the Na,K-ATPase show little to no activity when covalently attached to antibodies that bind targets that are not within close proximity to the agents target. These results then indicate simultaneous binding of the antibody and the agent to their respective targets to achieve cytotoxic effects. The example also demonstrates that different agents perform differently when attached to antibodies through the non-cleavable PEG24 linker.\n\n\n \nExample 5 \n\n\nProduction and Testing of Antibody-Linker-Agent Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nIn this example, monoclonal antibody mixtures were used to demonstrate that illustrative compounds of the invention are useful at targeting and killing tumor cells. For this EDC example, the Na,K-ATPase is the target for the agent and FXYD5 is the target for the antibody. Specifically for this example, the EDC was constructed from therapeutic agent CEN09-106, monoclonal antibodies M53 with specificity to FXYD5 (a close proximity target) and the non-cleavable PEG24 linker to produce M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 (sometimes referred to as M53-106). M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 was compared in cytotoxicity assays to 1) ADCs containing the agent CEN09-106 covalently attached with a PEG24 linker to monoclonal antibodies Erbitux-106 (EGFR is on the cell surface but not complexed to the Na,K-ATPase complex) or α-FI-106 (fluorescein is not on the cell surface and not in close proximity to the Na,K-ATPase complex), 2) monoclonal antibodies with specificity to FXYD5 (M53) and 3) the therapeutic agent CEN09-106 covalently attached to the non-cleavable PEG24 linker. The experimental results for this example are shown in \nFIGS. 7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n and \n10\n. The results shown in these figures demonstrate that the conjugates of the invention are active at disrupting cell viability at picomolar to low nanomolar concentrations when the agent and antibody's target are in close proximity on the cell surface. The results also show that, agents attached only to the non-cleavable linker (i.e. not attached to an anti-FXYD5 antibody), are at least 100-fold less active when compared to the EDC constructed for the example. The results also show that the antibodies alone are inactive at the concentrations tested, thus demonstrating that the antibodies require the agent to show activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCoupling linker-agent to antibody. Agent CEN09-106 linked to a bifunctional PEG24 linker to produce CEN10-105 was used throughout this Example. To cold TCEP reduced antibody, 9.6 molar equivalents CEN10-105 per equivalent antibody were added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min on ice. L-Cysteine was then added at a 2-fold excess to CEN10-105 to quench any unreacted maleimide groups. To achieve sample concentration and removal of excess linker-agent that was not coupled to antibody, the conjugation reactions were concentrated then buffer exchanged 3× for 20 mM \nsodium phosphate pH\n 7 and 150 mM NaCl using Microcon Ultracel YM-30 (Millipore) 30K cutoff spin concentration devices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of Drug Loading. Purified antibody concentration was determined using an absorbance value of 1.36 for a 1.0 mg/mL at 260nm. CEN10-105 (PEG24-CEN09-106) concentration was determined using the extinction co-efficient of 5623 M\n−1 \ncm\n−1 \nat 299 nm. EDC loading was determined by first measuring the antibody protein concentration at 260 nm and then measuring the CEN10-105 concentration using extinction co-efficient of 5623 M\n−1 \ncm\n−1 \n@ 299 nm and after subtracting the contribution of the antibody absorbance at 299 nm. CEN10-105 loading determined for each antibody-agent conjugate of this example equaled 4.6 for M53, 6.0 for Erb and 6.6 for α-FI.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vitro cell proliferation assays. Agents tested in these assays included the antibody drug conjugates, M53-PEG24-CEN09106, Erb-PEG24-CEN09-106, anti-FI-PEG24-CEN09-106, unconjugated M53, agent with attached linker CEN10-105 (PEG24-CEN09-106) and free agent CEN09-106. Agents were tested on four cancer cell lines to confirm cytotoxic activity. All cell lines were maintained in complete media [RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% (wt/vol) fetal bovine serum and Gentamycin (50 μg/ml)]. Cells were plated at a density of 1250 (H460 and A549) or 1825 (HCT15 and MCF7) cells per well of each 384-well white tissue culture treated microtiter plate in 20 uls complete media, and then were grown for 24 hour at 37° C. with 7% CO\n2 \nin a humidified incubator before agent/conjugate addition. In a separate 96-well plate, agent and antibody conjugate (in PBS) stocks were serially diluted in complete media at 5× final working concentrations, and 5 ul added to the cells used in the assay. Cells were incubated with the agent/conjugate for 3 days before cell viability testing. Cell viability testing used the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.). IC50 values of the agents to each cell line were determined using GraphPad Prism 5 software.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH460\n\n\nA549\n\n\nHCT15\n\n\nMCF7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM53-PEG24-\n\n\n6.10E−10\n\n\n3.41E−10\n\n\n>1.00e−8\n\n\nNot detected\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCEN09-106\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErb-PEG24-\n\n\n2.42E−07\n\n\n4.95E−08\n\n\n3.88E−07\n\n\n7.185E−07\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCEN09-106\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-Fl-\n\n\n2.71E−07\n\n\n1.13E−07\n\n\n3.81E−07\n\n\n9.531E−07\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCEN09-106\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPEG24-\n\n\n1.61E−07\n\n\n7.46E−08\n\n\n2.08E−07\n\n\n3.619E−07\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCEN09-106\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCEN09-\n\n\n1.31E−09\n\n\n5.60E−10\n\n\n2.35E−09\n\n\n1.883E−09\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCEN09-106\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM53\n\n\nNot detected\n\n\nNot detected\n\n\nNot detected\n\n\nNot detected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Table above shows IC50 values in Molar of drug antibody conjugates and linker-agent conjugates. “Not detected” indicates IC50 values could not be assigned within the given concentration ranges tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data above shows that the strongest cytotoxic agent for these cancer cells lines is the EDC, M53-PEG24-CEN09-106. In cases where the target FXYD5 was determined to be expressed on the cell's surface by immunohistochemistry staining (H460, A549, and HC15 shown in Example 6), data shows that M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 is up to 1000 times more potent then ADCs possessing antibodies to other targets which are on the cell surface (EGFR in the case of Erb-106) but not in close proximity to the agent's target or not on the cell surface at all (Fluorescein in the case of α-FI). The data also shows that M53-PEG24-CEN09-106is almost 1000 times more potent then the most likely breakdown product PEG24-106. The data also shows that when FXYD5 is not present on the cell surface, as evidenced by immunohistochemistry staining (H460, A549, and HC15 shown in Example 6, below), M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 activity was not detectable. This demonstrates that the target needs to be present on the cell and in close proximity to the agent's target for the EDC to be active.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the experiments of this example, the EDC produced was compared to the cysteine capped agent linker PEG24-106 instead of the free active agent CEN09-106. The reason for this is that the main (and perhaps only) breakdown product for the EDC constructed from an antibody, a non-cleavable PEG24 linker and CEN09-106, would be PEG24-106. Other breakdown products could include PEG24-106 with cysteine and other amino acids from the antibody (via protease degradation). Cysteine capped agent linker PEG24-106 could also be a contaminant in the preparation of the EDC described if CEN10-105 is not completely removed during work-up. CEN09-106 is not a likely breakdown product and so is a less preferred control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experiments which produced the results in \nFIG. 7\n through \nFIG. 10\n were run to test whether a monoclonal antibody would show cytotoxicity on its own and/or when coupled to an agent specific to a target in close proximity to FXYD5. The data, shown in \nFIG. 7\n, demonstrates that within the testing concentration range, FXYD5 specific antibody M53 has no effect at killing the H460 cells. When agent CEN09-106 was attached through a noncleavable linker to produce M53-106, the EDC produced displayed cytotoxic activity against H460 cells in the picomolar range (IC50 6.10E-10 molar). The data also shows that the free agent when conjugated to the non-cleavable linker has similar IC50s to the ADCs produced using antibodies to the extracellular target EGFR (Erbitux-106) or antibodies to fluorescein (α-FI-106), activity is close to 1000× less active at killing the H460 cells than the M53-PEG24-CEN09-106EDC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data in \nFIG. 8\n shows that within the testing concentration range, the FXYD5 specific antibody M53 alone does not affect A549 cell growth, yet when M53 is attached to CEN09-106 via the non-cleavable linker to produce M53-PEG24-CEN09-106, strong cytotoxicity activity to kill the A549 cells is observed (IC50 3.41E-10 molar). The data also shows that the free agent when conjugated to the non-cleavable linker has similar IC50s to the ADCs produced using antibodies to the extracellular target EGFR (Erbitux-106) or antibodies to fluorescein (α-FI-106) activity is close to 1000× less active at killing the A549 cells than the M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 EDC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data in \nFIG. 9\n shows that, within the testing concentration range, the FXYD5 specific antibody M53 alone does not affect HCT15 cell growth, yet when M53 is attached to CEN09-106 via the non-cleavable linker to produce M53-PEG24-CEN09-106, stronger cytotoxicity activity sufficient to kill the HCT15 cells is observed (IC50 >1.00e-8 molar). In this experiment, M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 was not tested above 1.00e-8 molar and thus an exact IC50 could not be calculated. The data also shows that when the agent CEN09-106 is conjugated to the non-cleavable linker to generate PEG24-106, or when the agent is conjugated through the non-cleavable linker to anti-EGFR antibodies to generate Erbitux-106, or when the agent is conjugated through the non-cleavable linker to anti-fluorescein antibodies to generate α-FI-106, similar IC50 values (IC50 >1.00e-6 molar) are observed, all of which are close to 100× less active at killing the HCT15 cells than the M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 EDC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data in \nFIG. 10\n shows that within the testing concentration range, the FXYD5 specific antibody M53 alone does not affect MCF7 cell growth. The data also shows that for this cell line, which does not express the FXYD5 target (see Example 6, below), EDC M53-PEG24-CEN09-106, ADC Erbitux-106 and ADC α-FI-106 show similar cell cytotoxicity, as does the agent-linker alone. This indicates that the FXYD5 antibody M53 is not directing the agent to a target (because the target is not present) and that cytotoxicity is dependent on the agent-linker alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together, the results in this Example 5 demonstrate that to observe the strongest cytotoxic activity with M53-PEG24-CEN09-106, the antibody and the agent's target need to be present and need to be present in high levels and in close proximity. If the antibody's target is not present on the cell surface the synergistic effect of the antibody with the agent is not observed. \nFIG. 10\n shows that, because MCF7 does not express the FXYD5 target of M53, activity of M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 is no better than the α-FI-106 activity. The proximity of the antibody's target is also important, because Erb-106 is also not any more effective than α-FI-106, even though EGFR is present on A549 cells (\nFIG. 2\n). In accordance with the invention, these results indicate simultaneous binding of the antibody and the agent to their respective targets are required to achieve maximum cytotoxic effects.\n\n\n \nExample 6 \n\n\nImmunohistochemistry of Anti-FXYD5 M53 Antibodies and EDC M53-PEG24-CEN09-106\n\n\n \n \n \nAll cell lines were maintained in complete media [RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% (wt/vol) fetal bovine serum and Gentamycin (50 μg/ml)]. Cells were plated at a density of 5000 (H460 and A549) or 7500 (HCT15 and MCF7) cells per well of each 96-well clear bottom tissue culture treated microtiter plate in 100 ul complete media, then were grown for 72 hour at 37° C. with 7% CO\n2 \nin a humidified incubator before antibody staining. To stain, the media was removed and 100 ng/100 uL of M53 or M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 in PBS with 0.9 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 1.5% FBS were added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Wells were washed 2× with 100 uL of the antibody diluent; then, 100 uL of a 5 ug/mL solution of goat anti mouse IgG, DyLight 488 (cat. number: 35503, Pierce Biotechnology) in the antibody dilution buffer were added to each well and allowed to incubate 30 min at room temperature. Wells were washed 1× with 100 uL of the antibody diluent, and cells were imaged using a Nikon Diaphot-TMD inverted fluorescence microscope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData showed that the M53 antibody stained all cell lines tested in Example 5 with the exception of MCF7 cells, where no detectable staining above background was observed. Data also showed that the M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 antibody drug conjugate strongly stained the H460 cell, which was comparable to the unconjugated M53 staining.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together and specific to the synergy embodiment, the results of Examples 5 and 6 demonstrate that not all cells express FXYD5 on their surface and, when FXYD5 is not expressed, synergy of the antibody to FXYD5 in these EDCs and agent does not occur.\n\n\n \nExample 7 \n\n\nEDC Cell Internalization Study\n\n\n \n \n \nTo demonstrate that illustrative compounds of the invention are not internalized, the purpose of this experiment was to observe whether an EDC (M53-PEG24-CEN09-106) or parent monoclonal antibody (M53) are internalized within cells after binding to its cell-surface antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis experiment was modeled after the internalization study performed by Polson et al. (Antibody-Drug Conjugates for the Treatment of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Target and Linker-Drug Selection. Cancer Res 2009; 69: (6): 2358-64). Briefly, H460 cells (large cell lung cancer) were seeded into 96-well, clear bottom, tissue culture treated plates at a density of 10,000 cells/well in 100 uL media (RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 ug/mL Gentamicin)/well. Cells were incubated at 37° C. and 7% CO\n2 \nfor 24 hrs. M53 and M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 were diluted in media, with and without protease inhibitors (10 ug/mL leupeptin, and 5 uM pepstatin), to a final concentration of 2 ug/mL. Media was then aspirated from specified wells and replaced with media containing M53 or M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 (100 uL/well) at time points −21.5 hrs or −3 hrs. At \ntime\n 0 hrs, media was removed by aspiration and the wells were washed 1× with DPBS+1.5% FBS. Cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temp and permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temp. Cells that did not receive antibody during culture were stained with M53 or M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 after fixation and permeabilization. Cells were then washed ×2 with DPBS+1.5% FBS. Goat anti-mouse IgG Dylight® 488 conjugate (Thermo) secondary was diluted to 5 μg/mL in DPBS+1.5% FBS and added to all wells at 100 uL/well and incubated for 30 min at room temp. Cells were again washed, and then viewed with Nikon Diaphot TMD inverted trinocular fluorescence phase contrast microscope with \nPh2\n 20× DL objective. Pictures were captured using an Olympus E-450 Digital SLR camera, and the brightness of fluorescence images were adjusted using GIMP 2.6 software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells stained with M53 and M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 exhibited a fluorescence staining pattern typical of surface staining (bright staining seen along boarders and junctions of cells) after 21.5 hrs, and 3 hrs or stained post fixation. Polson et al. (supra) concluded that Ab-surface receptor complexes were poorly internalized if cells exhibited a staining pattern around the cell periphery after incubating with Ab for 20 hrs. However, internalized Ab-receptors yield a punctate staining pattern located within the cells characteristic of being confined to endosomal compartments. Because the mAb and EDC both exhibit a staining pattern characteristic of surface staining at all time points, the results support the conclusion that this EDC is not internalized within cells upon binding of cell surface antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together, the results of Example 7 and \nFIG. 7\n demonstrate that internalization is not required for EDC activity.\n\n\n \nExample 8 \n\n\nM53 Competition Study of M53-PEG24-CEN09-106\n\n\n \n \n \nTo illustrate that compounds of the invention require binding of the antibody used in the EDC of the invention, therapeutic agents with activity toward the Na,K-ATPase were attached to FXYD5 specific antibodies through the PEG24 non-cleavable linkers and activity abolished with excess free anti-FXYD5 antibody which competes for the FXYD5 target. For the experiment below, α-FI-CEN10-105 (also termed α-FI-106), CEN10-105-Cys (also termed PEG24-106) and M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 were varied as indicated in \nFIG. 11\n. For the competition experiment (M53 Comp), M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 was added at 1 nM to all reactions and varying amounts of unconjugated antibody M53 were added. All were assayed in the A549 cell proliferation assay. Cells were maintained in complete media [RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% (wt/vol) fetal bovine serum and Gentamycin (50 μg/ml)]. Cells were plated at a density of 1250 per well of a 384-well white tissue culture treated microtiter plate in 20 uls complete media, then were grown for 24 hour at 37° C. with 7% CO\n2 \nin a humidified incubator before agent/conjugate addition. In a separate 96-well plate, agent and antibody conjugate (in PBS) stocks were serially diluted in complete media at 5× final working concentrations, and 5 uls added to the cells used in the assay. For the competition assay (M53 Comp) M53 was serially diluted from 500 to 0.11 nM in the presence of 5 nM PEG24-106, and 5 ul of these dilutions were added to cells used in this assay. Cells were incubated with the agent/conjugate for 3 days before cell viability testing. Cell viability testing used the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data in \nFIG. 11\n shows that when the concentration of M53 antibody is approximately 5 times above that of the M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 conjugate, it can compete and remove the activity of the M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 conjugate. The figure demonstrates that 5.5 nM is the level at which NCC-53 can half maximally competes the cytotoxic effect of 1 nM M53-106. Again, the EDC M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 shows the strong ability to kill the A549 cells (IC50 1.983e-10 molar). The data also shows that the free agent when conjugated to the non-cleavable linker and capped with cysteine to mimic a possible breakdown product (PEG24-CEN09-106) has a similar IC50 to the ADCs produced using the antibody to fluorescein to produce ADC \nnti-FI-CEN10-105, which is close to 1000× less active at killing the A549 cells than the M53-16 EDC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of Example 8 demonstrates that, when antibody binding no longer exists, EDC activity is lost.\n\n\n \nExample 9 \n\n\nIC50 of M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 (M53-106) on Various Cell Lines with Both Targets not in Close Proximity\n\n\n \n \n \nAlso as stated in the antibody section, the EDCs of the invention are primarily active only when the antibody is bound to its target and that target is in close proximity to the therapeutic agent's target. This, in effect, increases selectivity, because both target sites need to be not only present, but also present in close proximity to one another.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCell Line\n\n\nM53-106\n\n\nα-FI-106\n\n\nPEG24-106\n\n\nCEN09-106\n\n\nM53 TARGET\n\n\nOrigen\n\n\nDisease\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA549\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n180\n\n\n120\n\n\n0.7\n\n\nYES\n\n\nLUNG\n\n\ncarcinoma (squamous)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH460\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n320\n\n\n240\n\n\n1.6\n\n\nYES\n\n\nLUNG\n\n\ncarcinoma (large cell)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSKOV3\n\n\n1.1\n\n\nND\n\n\n310\n\n\n5.3\n\n\nYES\n\n\nOVARY\n\n\nadenocarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA431\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n380\n\n\n360\n\n\n2.0\n\n\nYES\n\n\nSKIN\n\n\nepidermoid carcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA375\n\n\n0.6\n\n\nND\n\n\n360\n\n\n3.2\n\n\nYES\n\n\nSKIN\n\n\nMalignant melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMALME-3M\n\n\n2.8\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n5.4\n\n\nYES\n\n\nSKIN\n\n\nmalignant melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEL2\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n4.3\n\n\nYES\n\n\nSKIN\n\n\nmalignant melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHT29\n\n\nND\n\n\n220\n\n\n210\n\n\n3.1\n\n\nYES\n\n\nCOLON\n\n\ncolorectal adenocarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCT15\n\n\nND\n\n\n380\n\n\n210\n\n\n2.3\n\n\nYES\n\n\nCOLON\n\n\ncolorectal adenocarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMB-231\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n7.0\n\n\nYES\n\n\nBREAST\n\n\nadenocarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCF10a\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n6.6\n\n\nYES\n\n\nBREAST\n\n\nfibrocystic disease\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCF7\n\n\nND\n\n\n900\n\n\n380\n\n\n2.6\n\n\nNO\n\n\nBREAST\n\n\nadenocarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe table above shows the IC50 data (in nanomolar) of the EDC M53-PEG24-CEN09-106 (M53-106), ADC α-FI-106, agent with attached linker PEG24-106 and free drug CEN09-106 when added to various human cell lines. ND indicates IC50 values that could not be determined at the concentrations tested. The presence of the antibody M53's target on the cell surface as determined by M53 cell staining is indicated as Yes/No. The origin of the cell line and disease type for each cell line is also indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe table above shows various cell line sensitivities to the EDC of the invention where the antibody is M53 (specific to human FXYD5), the linker is a polyethylene glycol linker and the agent is a cardiac glycoside. The data shows that this EDC of the invention displays strong cytotoxic activity (<3 nM) on cell types where the antibody's target and the agent's target are in close proximity (A549, H460, SKOV3, A431, A375, and MALME-3M) and poor activity on cell types where the antibody's target is not present (MCF7) or where the targets are present but not in close proximity (MEL2, HT29, HCT15, MB-231 and MCF10a). Strong activity of the free agent indicates that the agent's target is present and cell staining of the M53 antibody indicates that the antibody's target is present. The table above also shows various cell line sensitivities to the ADC where the antibody is a-Fl (specific to Flourescein which is not a target on the cell surface), the linker is a polyethylene glycol linker and the agent is a cardiac glycoside. The data shows that this EDC displays weak cytotoxic activity (>100 nM IC50) on cell types tested even when the cells displayed strong sensitivity to the agent alone. Thus, the EDCs of the invention are largely inactive when the antibody or other targeting moiety is not bound to a target on the cell surface. The EDCs of the invention are also largely inactive when the antibody is bound to its target when the drug's target is not in close proximity. In this case, the linker is not long enough to allow the drug to reach its target while attached to the antibody.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nSynthesis and Cytotoxicity Testing of a Therapeutic Agent to Smoothened\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example illustrates a drug-conjugate of the invention in which the target of the targeting moiety is smoothened and the drug is a cyclopamine derivative. In this example, the target for the agent and the antibody is the same, and the antibody's epitope binding does not interfere with simultaneous binding of the agent. The agent can be synthesized as follows. Cyclopamine (1), a natural product isolated from \nVeratrum californicum, \n(\n \nPhytochemistry\n \n1968, 7, 303-306 and \n \nPhytochemistry\n \n1969, 8, 223-225 and \n \nTeratology\n \n1968, 1, 5-10) inhibits hedgehog signaling by binding to surface protein smoothen (SMO) (\nGenes Dev. \n2002, 16, 2743-2748). Its analog KAAD-cyclopamine (2) is more potent than 1 (\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n2002, 99, 14071-14076). Synthesis of an analog of 2 (i.e. 7) that is suitable for conjugation to and antibody is shown in \nscheme\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsidering the acid sensitivity of 1, exposure of all intermediates to strong acid is avoided throughout the synthesis (see \nTeratology \n1970, 3, 169-173). Thus aldehyde 4 is readily prepared by oxidation of the commercially available Fmoc-6-aminohexanol (3) (see \nJ. Med. Chem. \n2007, 50, 6133-6143 and \nJ. Org. Chem. \n2007, 72, 7222-7228 and \nJ.

Different drugs with differing cytotoxic activities (all specific to the alpha subunit of the Na,K-ATPase) were coupled to a PEG24 linker and also coupled to M53 antibody mixtures through the same PEG24 linker, tested and compared. The data (when CEN09-106 was used as the drug) shows that this drug produces the most potent EDC of the series. The data (when CEN09-104 was used as the drug) also shows that this drug produced a less potent EDC. The data (when CEN10-126 was used as the drug) also shows that this drug produced the least potent EDC of the series. Taken together, these data suggest that more potent drugs can produce optimal EDCs yet the attachment site of the drug to the linker-antibody can greatly affect potency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParent CEN09-106, CEN09-104 and CEN10-126 drugs were all linked to antibody M53 via the PEG24 linker as described in Example 5.

Cytotoxicity of the EDC's and the drug-PEG24 linkers were evaluated in vitro on the NSCLC line A549 and malignant melanoma cell line A375 as described in Example 5.

Furthermore, when this potent agent is coupled to the highly specific targeting moiety (M53), the activity increases. On the other hand, when the less potent agent CEN09-104 was attached to the PEG24 linker and capped, the activity decreases yet not significantly (˜5-fold) when compared to the free uncoupled agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data also show that when this agent is coupled to the highly specific targeting moiety (M53), the activity increases but not to the level of the CEN09-106 derived EDC. This indicates that for optimal EDC production, it is preferred to link a potent agent to a high affinity targeting moiety through a stable or non-cleavable linker. Furthermore, when the potent agent CEN10-126 is attached to the PEG24 linker and capped, the activity decreases significantly (almost 300-fold) when compared to the free uncoupled agent. When CEN10-126 is coupled to the highly specific targeting moiety (M53), the activity decreases significantly to the point where activity cannot be determined. This indicates that for optimal EDC production, a potent agent should be linked to a high affinity targeting moiety through a stable or non-cleavable linker where the linkage to the agent does not interfere with agent binding to its target. In the case of CEN10-126, the amine which links the agent to the linker is at a position that detrimentally interferes with agent activity and thus EDC activity."

The provided methods include, for example, methods of making, identifying, or isolating molecules that bind to IGF-1R, such as anti-IGF-1R antibodies, methods of determining whether a molecule binds to IGF-1R, methods of determining whether a molecule agonizes or antagonizes IGF-1R, methods of making compositions, such as pharmaceutical compositions, comprising a molecule that binds to IGF-1R, and methods for administering a molecule that binds IGF-1R to a subject, for example, methods for treating a condition mediated by IGF-1R, and for agonizing or antagonizing a biological activity of IGF-1R, IGF-1, and/or IGF-2 in vivo or in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolynucleotide and polypeptide sequences are indicated using standard one- or three-letter abbreviations. Unless otherwise indicated, polypeptide sequences have their amino termini at the left and their carboxy termini at the right and single-stranded nucleic acid sequences, and the top strand of double-stranded nucleic acid sequences, have their 5′ termini at the left and their 3′ termini at the right. A particular polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence also can be described by explaining how it differs from a reference sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolynucleotide and polypeptide sequences of particular light and heavy chain variable domains are shown in \nFIGS. 1\n, \n2\n and \n3\n, where they are labeled, for example, L1 (“light \nchain variable domain\n 1”), H1 (“heavy chain \nvariable domain\n 1”), etc. Antibodies comprising a light chain and heavy chain from \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n are indicated by combining the name of the light chain and the name of the heavy chain variable domains. For example, “L4H7,” indicates an antibody comprising the light chain variable domain of L4 and the heavy chain variable domain of H7.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise defined herein, scientific and technical terms used in connection with the present invention shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. Generally, nomenclatures used in connection with, and techniques of, cell and tissue culture, molecular biology, immunology, microbiology, genetics and protein and nucleic acid chemistry and hybridization described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. The methods and techniques of the present invention are generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification unless otherwise indicated. See, e.g., Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989) and Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates (1992), and Harlow and Lane Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1990), which are incorporated herein by reference. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are performed according to manufacturer's specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The terminology used in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “isolated molecule” (where the molecule is, for example, a polypeptide, a polynucleotide, or an antibody) is a molecule that by virtue of its origin or source of derivation (1) is not associated with naturally associated components that accompany it in its native state, (2) is substantially free of other molecules from the same species (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, or (4) does not occur in nature. Thus, a molecule that is chemically synthesized, or synthesized in a cellular system different from the cell from which it naturally originates, will be “isolated” from its naturally associated components. A molecule also may be rendered substantially free of naturally associated components by isolation, using purification techniques well known in the art. Molecule purity or homogeneity may be assayed by a number of means well known in the art. For example, the purity of a polypeptide sample may be assayed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining of the gel to visualize the polypeptide using techniques well known in the art. For certain purposes, higher resolution may be provided by using HPLC or other means well known in the art for purification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “IGF-1R inhibitor” and “IGF-1R antagonist” are used interchangeably. Each is a molecule that detectably inhibits at least one function of IGF-1R. Conversely, an “IGF-1R agonist” is a molecule that detectably increases at least one function of IGF-1R. The inhibition caused by an IGF-1R inhibitor need not be complete so long as it is detectable using an assay. Any assay of a function of IGF-1R can be used, examples of which are provided herein. Examples of functions of IGF-1R that can be inhibited by an IGF-1R inhibitor, or increased by an IGF-1R agonist, include binding to IGF-1, IGF-12, and/or another IGF-1R-activating molecule, kinase activity, downstream signaling, and so on. Examples of types of IGF-1R inhibitors and IGF-1R agonists include, but are not limited to, IGF-1R binding polypeptides such as antigen binding proteins (e.g., IGF-1R inhibiting antiben binding proteins), antibodies, antibody fragments, and antibody derivatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “peptide,” “polypeptide” and “protein” each refers to a molecule comprising two or more amino acid residues joined to each other by peptide bonds. These terms encompass, e.g., native and artificial proteins, protein fragments and polypeptide analogs (such as muteins, variants, and fusion proteins) of a protein sequence as well as post-translationally, or otherwise covalently or non-covalently, modified proteins. A peptide, polypeptide, or protein may be monomeric or polymeric.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polypeptide fragment” as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion as compared to a corresponding full-length protein. Fragments can be, for example, at least 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 50, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150 or 200 amino acids in length. Fragments can also be, for example, at most 1,000, 750, 500, 250, 200, 175, 150, 125, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, or 10 amino acids in length. A fragment can further comprise, at either or both of its ends, one or more additional amino acids, for example, a sequence of amino acids from a different naturally-occurring protein (e.g., an Fc or leucine zipper domain) or an artificial amino acid sequence (e.g., an artificial linker sequence).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides of the invention include polypeptides that have been modified in any way and for any reason, for example, to: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and (4) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties. Analogs include muteins of a polypeptide. For example, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (e.g., conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally occurring sequence (e.g., in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts. A “conservative amino acid substitution” is one that does not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterize the parent sequence or are necessary for its functionality). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984)); Introduction to Protein Structure (C. Branden and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton et at. Nature 354:105 (1991), which are each incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides non-peptide analogs of IGF-1R binding polypeptides. Non-peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed “peptide mimetics” or “peptidomimetics”. Fauchere, J. Adv. Drug Res. 15:29 (1986); Veber and Freidinger TINS p. 392 (1985); and Evans et al. J. Med. Chem. 30:1229 (1987), which are incorporated herein by reference. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a desired biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such as a human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of: —CH\n2\nNH—, —CH\n2\nS—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH=CH-(cis and trans), —COCH\n2\n—, —CH(OH)CH\n2\n—, and —CH\n2\nSO—, by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may also be used to generate more stable peptides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch Ann. Rev. Biochem. 61:387 (1992), incorporated herein by reference), for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “variant” of a polypeptide (e.g., an antibody) comprises an amino acid sequence wherein one or more amino acid residues are inserted into, deleted from and/or substituted into the amino acid sequence relative to another polypeptide sequence. Variants of the invention include fusion proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “derivative” of a polypeptide is a polypeptide (e.g., an antibody) that has been chemically modified, e.g., via conjugation to another chemical moiety such as, for example, polyethylene glycol, albumin (e.g., human serum albumin), phosphorylation, and glycosylation. Unless otherwise indicated, the term “antibody” includes, in addition to antibodies comprising two full-length heavy chains and two full-length light chains, derivatives, variants, fragments, and muteins thereof, examples of which are described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “antigen binding protein” is a protein comprising a portion that binds to an antigen and, optionally, a scaffold or framework portion that allows the antigen binding portion to adopt a conformation that promotes binding of the antigen binding protein to the antigen. Examples of antigen binding proteins include antibodies, antibody fragments (e.g., an antigen binding portion of an antibody), antibody derivatives, and antibody analogs. The antigen binding protein can comprise, for example, an alternative protein scaffold or artificial scaffold with grafted CDRs or CDR derivatives. Such scaffolds include, but are not limited to, antibody-derived scaffolds comprising mutations introduced to, for example, stabilize the three-dimensional structure of the antigen binding protein as well as wholly synthetic scaffolds comprising, for example, a biocompatible polymer. See, for example, Korndorfer et al., 2003, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, \nVolume\n 53, Issue 1:121-129; Roque et al., 2004, Biotechnol. Prog. 20:639-654. In addition, peptide antibody mimetics (“PAMs”) can be used, as well as scaffolds based on antibody mimetics utilizing fibronection components as a scaffold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antigen binding protein can have, for example, the structure of a naturally occurring immunoglobulin. An “immunoglobulin” is a tetrameric molecule. In a naturally occurring immunoglobulin, each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one “light” (about 25 kDa) and one “heavy” chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a “J” region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a “D” region of about 10 more amino acids. See generally, Fundamental Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site such that an intact immunoglobulin has two binding sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNaturally occurring immunoglobulin chains exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. From N-terminus to C-terminus, both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat et al. in \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5\nth \nEd., US Dept. of Health and Human Services, PHS, NIH, NIH Publication no. 91-3242, 1991.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “antibody” refers to an intact immunoglobulin or to an antigen binding portion thereof that competes with the intact antibody for specific binding, unless otherwise specified. Antigen binding portions may be produced by recombinant DNA techniques or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Antigen binding portions include, inter alia, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv, domain antibodies (dAbs), and complementarity determining region (CDR) fragments, single-chain antibodies (scFv), chimeric antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, and polypeptides that contain at least a portion of an immunoglobulin that is sufficient to confer specific antigen binding to the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Fab fragment is a monovalent fragment having the V\nL\n, V\nH\n, C\nL \nand \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domains; a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment is a bivalent fragment having two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; a Fd fragment has the V\nH \nand \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domains; an Fv fragment has the V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains of a single arm of an antibody; and a dAb fragment has a V\nH \ndomain, a V\nL \ndomain, or an antigen-binding fragment of a V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomain (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,846,634, 6,696,245, US App. Pub. No. 05/0202512, 04/0202995, 04/0038291, 04/0009507, 03/0039958, Ward et al., Nature 341:544-546, 1989).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA single-chain antibody (scFv) is an antibody in which a V\nL \nand a V\nH \nregion are joined via a linker (e.g., a synthetic sequence of amino acid residues) to form a continuous protein chain wherein the linker is long enough to allow the protein chain to fold back on itself and form a monovalent antigen binding site (see, e.g., Bird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-26 and Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-83). Diabodies are bivalent antibodies comprising two polypeptide chains, wherein each polypeptide chain comprises V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains joined by a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between two domains on the same chain, thus allowing each domain to pair with a complementary domain on another polypeptide chain (see, e.g., Holliger et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-48, and Poljak et al., 1994, Structure 2:1121-23). If the two polypeptide chains of a diabody are identical, then a diabody resulting from their pairing will have two identical antigen binding sites. Polypeptide chains having different sequences can be used to make a diabody with two different antigen binding sites Similarly, tribodies and tetrabodies are antibodies comprising three and four polypeptide chains, respectively, and forming three and four antigen binding sites, respectively, which can be the same or different.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComplementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FR) of a given antibody may be identified using the system described by Kabat et al. in Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., US Dept. of Health and Human Services, PHS, NIH, NIH Publication no. 91-3242, 1991. One or more CDRs may be incorporated into a molecule either covalently or noncovalently to make it an antigen binding protein. An antigen binding protein may incorporate the CDR(s) as part of a larger polypeptide chain, may covalently link the CDR(s) to another polypeptide chain, or may incorporate the CDR(s) noncovalently. The CDRs permit the antigen binding protein to specifically bind to a particular antigen of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antigen binding protein may have one or more binding sites. If there is more than one binding site, the binding sites may be identical to one another or may be different. For example, a naturally occurring human immunoglobulin typically has two identical binding sites, while a “bispecific” or “bifunctional” antibody has two different binding sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “human antibody” includes all antibodies that have one or more variable and constant regions derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. In one embodiment, all of the variable and constant domains are derived from human immunoglobulin sequences (a fully human antibody). These antibodies may be prepared in a variety of ways, examples of which are described below, including through the immunization with an antigen of interest of a mouse that is genetically modified to express antibodies derived from human heavy and/or light chain-encoding genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA humanized antibody has a sequence that differs from the sequence of an antibody derived from a non-human species by one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or additions, such that the humanized antibody is less likely to induce an immune response, and/or induces a less severe immune response, as compared to the non-human species antibody, when it is administered to a human subject. In one embodiment, certain amino acids in the framework and constant domains of the heavy and/or light chains of the non-human species antibody are mutated to produce the humanized antibody. In another embodiment, the constant domain(s) from a human antibody are fused to the variable domain(s) of a non-human species. In another embodiment, one or more amino acid residues in one or more CDR sequences of a non-human antibody are changed to reduce the likely immunogenicity of the non-human antibody when it is administered to a human subject, wherein the changed amino acid residues either are not critical for immunospecific binding of the antibody to its antigen, or the changes to the amino acid sequence that are made are conservative changes, such that the binding of the humanized antibody to the antigen is not significantly worse than the binding of the non-human antibody to the antigen. Examples of how to make humanized antibodies may be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,054,297, 5,886,152 and 5,877,293.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “chimeric antibody” refers to an antibody that contains one or more regions from one antibody and one or more regions from one or more other antibodies. In one embodiment, one or more of the CDRs are derived from a human anti-IGF-1R antibody. In another embodiment, all of the CDRs are derived from a human anti-IGF-1R antibody. In another embodiment, the CDRs from more than one human anti-IGF-1R antibodies are mixed and matched in a chimeric antibody. For instance, a chimeric antibody may comprise a CDR1 from the light chain of a first human anti-IGF-1R antibody, a CDR2 and a CDR3 from the light chain of a second human anti-IGF-1R antibody, and the CDRs from the heavy chain from a third anti-IGF-1R antibody. Further, the framework regions may be derived from one of the same anti-IGF-1R antibodies, from one or more different antibodies, such as a human antibody, or from a humanized antibody. In one example of a chimeric antibody, a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with, homologous to, or derived from an antibody from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is/are identical with, homologous to, or derived from an antibody (-ies) from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. Also included are fragments of such antibodies that exhibit the desired biological activity (i.e., the ability to specifically bind IGF-1R). See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 and Morrison, 1985, Science 229:1202-07.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “neutralizing antibody” or “an inhibitory antibody” is an antibody that inhibits the binding of IGF-1R to IGF-I and/or IGF-2 when an excess of the anti-IGF-1R antibody reduces the amount of IGF-I and/or IGF-2 bound to IGF-1R by at least about 20% using the assay described in Example 9. In various embodiments, the antibody reduces the amount of IGF-I and/or IGF-2 bound to IGF-1R by at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 99%, and 99.9%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “activating antibody” is an antibody that activates IGF-1R by at least about 20% when added to a cell, tissue or organism expressing IGF-1R, where “100% activation” is the level of activation achieved under physiological conditions by the same molar amount of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2. In various embodiments, the antibody activates IGF-1R activity by at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 350%, 400%, 450%, 500%, 750%, or 1000%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFragments or analogs of antibodies can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art following the teachings of this specification and using techniques well-known in the art. Preferred amino- and carboxy-termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional domains. Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence databases. Computerized comparison methods can be used to identify sequence motifs or predicted protein conformation domains that occur in other proteins of known structure and/or function. Methods to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure are known. See, e.g., Bowie et al., 1991, Science 253:164.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “CDR grafted antibody” is an antibody comprising one or more CDRs derived from an antibody of a particular species or isotype and the framework of another antibody of the same or different species or isotype.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “multi-specific antibody” is an antibody that recognizes more than one epitope on one or more antigens. A subclass of this type of antibody is a “bi-specific antibody” which recognizes two distinct epitopes on the same or different antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antigen binding protein “specifically binds” to an antigen (e.g., human IGF-1R) if it binds to the antigen with a dissociation constant of 1 nanomolar or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “antigen binding domain,” “antigen binding region,” or “antigen binding site” is a portion of an antigen binding protein that contains amino acid residues (or other moieties) that interact with an antigen and contribute to the antigen binding protein's specificity and affinity for the antigen. For an antibody that specifically binds to its antigen, this will include at least part of at least one of its CDR domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “epitope” is the portion of a molecule that is bound by an antigen binding protein (e.g., by an antibody). An epitope can comprise non-contiguous portions of the molecule (e.g., in a polypeptide, amino acid residues that are not contiguous in the polypeptide's primary sequence but that, in the context of the polypeptide's tertiary and quaternary structure, are near enough to each other to be bound by an antigen binding protein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “percent identity” of two polynucleotide or two polypeptide sequences is determined by comparing the sequences using the GAP computer program (a part of the GCG Wisconsin Package, version 10.3 (Accelrys, San Diego, Calif.)) using its default parameters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “polynucleotide,” “oligonucleotide” and “nucleic acid” are used interchangeably throughout and include DNA molecules (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA), RNA molecules (e.g., mRNA), analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs (e.g., peptide nucleic acids and non-naturally occurring nucleotide analogs), and hybrids thereof. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules of the invention comprise a contiguous open reading frame encoding an antibody, or a fragment, derivative, mutein, or variant thereof, of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo single-stranded polynucleotides are “the complement” of each other if their sequences can be aligned in an anti-parallel orientiation such that every nucleotide in one polynucleotide is opposite its complementary nucleotide in the other polynucleotide, without the introduction of gaps, and without unpaired nucleotides at the 5′ or the 3′ end of either sequence. A polynucleotide is “complementary” to another polynucleotide if the two polynucleotides can hybridize to one another under moderately stringent conditions. Thus, a polynucleotide can be complementary to another polynucleotide without being its complement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “vector” is a nucleic acid that can be used to introduce another nucleic acid linked to it into a cell. One type of vector is a “plasmid,” which refers to a linear or circular double stranded DNA molecule into which additional nucleic acid segments can be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector (e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), wherein additional DNA segments can be introduced into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors comprising a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. An “expression vector” is a type of vector that can direct the expression of a chosen polynucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleotide sequence is “operably linked” to a regulatory sequence if the regulatory sequence affects the expression (e.g., the level, timing, or location of expression) of the nucleotide sequence. A “regulatory sequence” is a nucleic acid that affects the expression (e.g., the level, timing, or location of expression) of a nucleic acid to which it is operably linked. The regulatory sequence can, for example, exert its effects directly on the regulated nucleic acid, or through the action of one or more other molecules (e.g., polypeptides that bind to the regulatory sequence and/or the nucleic acid). Examples of regulatory sequences include promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements (e.g., polyadenylation signals). Further examples of regulatory sequences are described in, for example, Goeddel, 1990, Gene Expression Technology: Methods in \nEnzymology\n 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. and Baron et al., 1995, Nucleic Acids Res. 23:3605-06.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “host cell” is a cell that can be used to express a nucleic acid, e.g., a nucleic acid of the invention. A host cell can be a prokaryote, for example, \nE. coli, \nor it can be a eukaryote, for example, a single-celled eukaryote (e.g., a yeast or other fungus), a plant cell (e.g., a tobacco or tomato plant cell), an animal cell (e.g., a human cell, a monkey cell, a hamster cell, a rat cell, a mouse cell, or an insect cell) or a hybridoma. Examples of host cells include the COS-7 line of monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL 1651) (see Gluzman et al., 1981, Cell 23:175), L cells, C127 cells, 3T3 cells (ATCC CCL 163), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells or their derivatives such as Veggie CHO and related cell lines which grow in serum-free media (see Rasmussen et al., 1998, Cytotechnology 28:31) or CHO strain DX-B11, which is deficient in DHFR (see Urlaub et al., 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216-20), HeLa cells, BHK (ATCC CRL 10) cell lines, the CV1/EBNA cell line derived from the African green monkey kidney cell line CV1 (ATCC CCL 70) (see McMahan et al., 1991, EMBO J. 10:2821), human embryonic kidney cells such as 293, 293 EBNA or MSR 293, human epidermal A431 cells, human Colo205 cells, other transformed primate cell lines, normal diploid cells, cell strains derived from in vitro culture of primary tissue, primary explants, HL-60, U937, HaK or Jurkat cells. Typically, a host cell is a cultured cell that can be transformed or transfected with a polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid, which can then be expressed in the host cell. The phrase “recombinant host cell” can be used to denote a host cell that has been transformed or transfected with a nucleic acid to be expressed. A host cell also can be a cell that comprises the nucleic acid but does not express it at a desired level unless a regulatory sequence is introduced into the host cell such that it becomes operably linked with the nucleic acid. It is understood that the term host cell refers not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to, e.g., mutation or environmental influence, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term as used herein.\n\n\n \nIGF-1R\n\n\n \n \n \nIGF-1R is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (Blume-Jensen et al., 2001, Nature 411:355-65). The human IGF-1R is synthesized as a 1367 amino acid precursor polypeptide that includes a 30 amino acid signal peptide removed during translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (Swiss-Prot: P08069). The IGF-1R proreceptor is glycosylated and cleaved by a protease at positions 708-711 (counting from the first amino acid following the signal peptide sequence) during maturation in the ER-golgi resulting in the formation of an α-chain (1-707) and a β-chain (712-1337) that remain linked by disulfide bonds (Bhaumick et al., 1981, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 78:4279-83, Chernausek et al., 1981, Biochemistry 20:7345-50, Jacobs et al., 1983, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 80:1228-31, LeBon et al., 1986, J Biol Chem 261:7685-89, Elleman, et al., 2000, Biochem J 347:771-79). The predominant form of the IGF-1R (and INSR) that exists on the cell-surface is a proteolytically processed and glycosylated (αβ)\n2 \ndimer joined covalently by one or more disulfide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe extracellular portion of the IGF-1R consists of the a-chain and 191 amino acids of the β-chain (712-905). The receptor contains a single transmembrane spanning sequence (906-929) and a 408-residue cytoplasmic domain that includes a functional tyrosine kinase (Rubin et al., 1983, Nature 305:438-440). Comparative sequence analysis has revealed that the IGF-1R is composed of 11 distinct structural motifs (reviewed by Adams et al., 2000, Cell Mol Life Sci 57:1050-93, Marino-Buslje et al., 1998, FEBS Ltrs 441:331-36, Ward et al., 2001, BMC Bioinformatics 2:4). The N-terminal half of the extracellular domain contains two homologous domains referred to as L1 (1-151) and L2 (299-461) (Ward et al., 2001, supra) separated by a cysteine-rich (CR) region (152-298) consisting of several structural modules with disulfide linkages that align with repeating units present in the TNF receptor and laminin (Ward et al., 1995, Proteins 22:141-53). The crystal structure of the L1-CR-L2 domain has been solved (Garrett et al., 1998, Nature 394:395-99). The L2 domain is followed by three fibronectin type III domains (Marino-Buslje et al., 1998, supra, Mulhern et al., 1998, Trends Biochem Sci 23:465-66, Ward et al., 1999, Growth Factors 16:315-22). The first FnIII domain (FnIII-1, 461-579) is 118 amino acids in length. The second FnIII domain (FnIII-2, 580-798) is disrupted by a major insert sequence (ID) of about 120 amino acids in length. The ID domain includes a furin protease cleavage site that separates the α and β chains of the mature receptor. The third FnIII domain (FnIII-3) is located entirely in the β-chain (799-901) terminating several residues before the transmembrane sequence. The catalytic domain of the IGF-1R tyrosine kinase is located between amino acids positions 973-1229, and its structure has been solved (Favelyukis et al., 2001, Nature Structural Biol 8:1058-63, Pautsch et al., 2001, Structure 9:955-65). The kinase is flanked by two regulatory regions, the juxtamembrane region (930-972) and a 108 amino acid C-terminal tail (1220-1337) (Surmacz et al., 1995, Experimental Cell Res 218:370-80, Hongo et al., 1996, Oncogene 12:1231-38). The two regulatory regions contain tyrosine residues that serve as docking sites for signal transducing proteins when phosphorylated by the activated IGF-1R tyrosine kinase (reviewed by Baserga (ed.), 1998 \nThe IGF\n-1 \nReceptor in Normal and Abnormal Growth, \nHormones and Growth Factors in Development and Neoplasia, Wiley-Liss, Inc., Adams et al., 2000, Cell Mol Life Sci 57:1050-93).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IGF-1R amino acid sequence is about 70% identical to the insulin receptor (INSR; Swiss-Prot: P06213). The highest homology between the receptors is located in the tyrosine kinase domain (84%); the lowest identity is in the CR region and the C-terminus. The IGF-1R is also highly related (˜55% identical) to the insulin related receptor (IRR; Swiss-Prot: P14616).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman IGF-1R can be activated by the insulin-like growth factors, IGF-1 and IGF-2 and insulin (INS) (Hill et al., 1985, Pediatric Research 19:879-86). IGF-1 and IGF-2 are encoded nonallelic genes (Brissenden et al., 1984, Nature 310: 781-8, Bell et al., 1985, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 82: 6450-54), and both genes express alternative proteins related by differential RNA splicing and protein processing. The most common and well-studied mature forms of IGF-1 and IGF-2 are respectively 70 and 67 amino acids in length (Jansen et al., 1983, Nature 306:609-11, Dull et al., 1984, Nature 310: 777-81). These proteins (and their isoforms) are identical at 11/21 positions to the insulin A-peptide, and identical at 12/30 positions with the insulin B-peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIGF-1R is expressed in all cells types in the normal adult animal except for liver hepatocytes and mature B-cells. Human blood plasma contains high concentrations of IGF-1 and IGF-2, and IGF-1 can be detected in most tissues. The receptor is an integral component of the physiological mechanism controlling organ size and homeostasis. Without being bound to a particular theory, the “Somatomedin Hypothesis” states that Growth Hormone (GH) mediated somatic growth that occurs during childhood and adolescence is dependent on the endocrine form of IGF-1 that is mainly produced and secreted by the liver (Daughaday, 2000, Pediatric Nephrology 14: 537-40). The synthesis of hepatic IGF-1 is stimulated by GH release in the pituitary in response to hypothalamic GHRH (GH releasing hormone). The serum concentration of IGF-1 increases over 100 fold between ages 5-15 in humans. The bioavailability of IGF-1 is regulated by IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) with approximately 99% of the growth factor compartmentalized in the bound state. Primary IGF-1 deficiency arising form partial gene deletions, and secondary IGF-1 deficiency resulting from defects in GH production or signaling are not lethal (Woods, 1999, \nIGF Deficiency \nin Contemporary Endocrinology: The IGF System, R. a. R. Rosenfeld, C. Jr. Totowa, ed.s, Humana Press, NJ: 651-74). The affected individuals exhibit growth retardation at birth, grow slowly and can face certain CNS abnormalities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIGF-1R signaling promotes cell growth and survival through the IRS adapter protein-dependent activation of the PI3Kinase/Akt pathway. IGF-1R transmits a signal to its major substrates, IRS-1 through IRS-4 and the Shc proteins (Blakesley et al., 1999, \nIGF\n-1 \nreceptor function: transducing the IGF\n-1 \nsignal into intracellular events \nin The IGF System, R. G. a. R. Rosenfeld, Jr. C. T. Totowa, ed.s, Humana Press, NJ: 143-63). This results in activation of the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase and PI3 Kinase/Akt signaling pathways. However, induction of Akt-mediated cell survival via IRS is the dominant pathway response upon IGF stimulation of most cells. See \nFIG. 10\n.\n\n\n \nAntigen Binding Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides antigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies, antibody fragments, antibody derivatives, antibody muteins, and antibody variants), that bind to IGF-1R, e.g., human IGF-1R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen binding proteins in accordance with the present invention include antigen binding proteins that inhibit a biological activity of IGF-1R. Examples of such biological activities include binding a signaling molecule (e.g. IGF-1 and/or IGF-2), and transducing a signal in response to binding a signaling molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferent antigen binding proteins may bind to different domains or epitopes of IGF-1R or act by different mechanisms of action. Examples include but are not limited to antigen binding proteins that interfere with binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R or that inhibit signal transduction. The site of action may be, for example, intracellular (e.g., by interfering with an intracellular signaling cascade) or extracellular. An antigen binding protein need not completely inhibit an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 induced activity to find use in the present invention; rather, antigen binding proteins that reduce a particular activity of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 are contemplated for use as well. (Discussions herein of particular mechanisms of action for IGF-1R-binding antigen binding proteins in treating particular diseases are illustrative only, and the methods presented herein are not bound thereby.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been observed that IGF-1 and IGF-2 each exhibits biphasic binding to IGF-1R. High affinity binding has been reported to have a K\nD \nin the range of 0.2 nM; high affinity binding, about ten fold higher. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides an IGF-1R inhibitor that inhibits both the high and low affinity binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-R. It has been suggested that the high affinity binding, rather than the low affinity binding, of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R is required for the conformation change that activates the tyrosine kinase activity of IGF-1R. Thus, in another embodiment, the IGF-1R inhibitor preferentially inhibits the high affinity binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R as compared to the low affinity binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides antigen binding proteins that comprise a light chain variable region selected from the group consisting of L1 through L52 and/or a heavy chain variable region selected from the group consisting of H1 through H52, and fragments, derivatives, muteins, and variants thereof (see \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n). Such an antigen binding protein can be denoted using the nomenclature “LxHy”, wherein “x” corresponds to the number of the light chain variable region and “y” corresponds to the number of the heavy chain variable region as they are labeled in \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n. For example, L2H1 refers to an antigen binding protein with a light chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of L2 and a heavy chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of H1, as shown in \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n. \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n also indicate the location of the CDR and framework regions of each of these variable domain sequences. The CDR regions of each light and heavy chain also are grouped by type and by sequence similarity in \nFIGS. 4 through 9\n. Antigen binding proteins of the invention include, for example, antigen binding proteins having a combination of light chain and heavy chain variable domains selected from the group of combinations consisting of L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50HSO, L51H51, and L52H52.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein comprising a light chain variable domain comprising a sequence of amino acids that differs from the sequence of a light chain variable domain selected from the group consisting of L1 through L52 only at 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 residues, wherein each such sequence difference is independently either a deletion, insertion, or substitution of one amino acid residue.

Examples of techniques for making such alterations are described in Walder et al., 1986,Gene 42:133; Bauer et al.1985, Gene 37:73; Craik, BioTechniques, January 1985, 12-19; Smith et al., 1981, \nGenetic Engineering: Principles and Methods, \nPlenum Press; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,518,584 and 4,737,462. These and other methods can be used to make, for example, derivatives of anti-IGF-1R antibodies that have a desired property, for example, increased affinity, avidity, or specificity for IGF-1R, increased activity or stability in vivo or in vitro, or reduced in vivo side-effects as compared to the underivatized antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther derivatives of anti-IGF-1R antibodies within the scope of this invention include covalent or aggregative conjugates of anti-IGF-1R antibodies, or fragments thereof, with other proteins or polypeptides, such as by expression of recombinant fusion proteins comprising heterologous polypeptides fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of an anti-IGF-1R antibody polypeptide. For example, the conjugated peptide may be a heterologous signal (or leader) polypeptide, e.g., the yeast alpha-factor leader, or a peptide such as an epitope tag. Antigen binding protein-containing fusion proteins can comprise peptides added to facilitate purification or identification of antigen binding protein (e.g., poly-His). An antigen binding protein also can be linked to the FLAG peptide Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys (DYKDDDDK) (SEQ ID NO:255) as described in Hopp et al., \nBio/Technology \n6:1204, 1988, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,912. The FLAG peptide is highly antigenic and provides an epitope reversibly bound by a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), enabling rapid assay and facile purification of expressed recombinant protein. Reagents useful for preparing fusion proteins in which the FLAG peptide is fused to a given polypeptide are commercially available (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOligomers that contain one or more antigen binding proteins may be employed as IGF-1R antagonists. Oligomers may be in the form of covalently-linked or non-covalently-linked dimers, trimers, or higher oligomers. Oligomers comprising two or more antigen binding protein are contemplated for use, with one example being a homodimer. Other oligomers include heterodimers, homotrimers, heterotrimers, homotetramers, heterotetramers, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment is directed to oligomers comprising multiple antigen binding proteins joined via covalent or non-covalent interactions between peptide moieties fused to theantigen binding proteins. Such peptides may be peptide linkers (spacers), or peptides that have the property of promoting oligomerization. Leucine zippers and certain polypeptides derived from antibodies are among the peptides that can promote oligomerization of antigen binding proteins attached thereto, as described in more detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, the oligomers comprise from two to four antigen binding proteins. The antigen binding proteins of the oligomer may be in any form, such as any of the forms described above, e.g., variants or fragments. Preferably, the oligomers comprise antigen binding proteins that have IGF-1R binding activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, an oligomer is prepared using polypeptides derived from immunoglobulins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of fusion proteins comprising certain heterologous polypeptides fused to various portions of antibody-derived polypeptides (including the Fc domain) has been described, e.g., by Ashkenazi et al., 1991, PNAS USA 88:10535; Byrn et al., 1990, Nature 344:677; and Hollenbaugh et al., 1992 “Construction of Immunoglobulin Fusion Proteins”, in \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology, \nSuppl. 4, pages 10.19.1-10.19.11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is directed to a dimer comprising two fusion proteins created by fusing an IGF-1R binding fragment of an anti-IGF-1R antibody to the Fc region of an antibody. The dimer can be made by, for example, inserting a gene fusion encoding the fusion protein into an appropriate expression vector, expressing the gene fusion in host cells transformed with the recombinant expression vector, and allowing the expressed fusion protein to assemble much like antibody molecules, whereupon interchain disulfide bonds form between the Fc moieties to yield the dimer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “Fc polypeptide” as used herein includes native and mutein forms of polypeptides derived from the Fc region of an antibody. Truncated forms of such polypeptides containing the hinge region that promotes dimerization also are included. Fusion proteins comprising Fc moieties (and oligomers formed therefrom) offer the advantage of facile purification by affinity chromatography over Protein A or Protein G columns.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne suitable Fc polypeptide, described in PCT application WO 93/10151 (hereby incorporated by reference), is a single chain polypeptide extending from the N-terminal hinge region to the native C-terminus of the Fc region of a human IgG1 antibody. Another useful Fc polypeptide is the Fc mutein described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,457,035 and in Baum et al., 1994, EMBO J. 13:3992-4001. The amino acid sequence of this mutein is identical to that of the native Fc sequence presented in WO 93/10151, except that \namino acid\n 19 has been changed from Leu to Ala, \namino acid\n 20 has been changed from Leu to Glu, and \namino acid\n 22 has been changed from Gly to Ala. The mutein exhibits reduced affinity for Fc receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the variable portion of the heavy and/or light chains of an anti-IGF-1R antibody may be substituted for the variable portion of an antibody heavy and/or light chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the oligomer is a fusion protein comprising multiple antigen binding proteins, with or without peptide linkers (spacer peptides). Among the suitable peptide linkers are those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,751,180 and 4,935,233.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother method for preparing oligomeric antigen binding proteins involves use of a leucine zipper. Leucine zipper domains are peptides that promote oligomerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA-binding proteins (Landschulz et al., 1988, Science 240:1759), and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble oligomeric proteins are described in PCT application WO 94/10308, and the leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D (SPD) described in Hoppe et al., 1994, FEBS Letters 344:191, hereby incorporated by reference. The use of a modified leucine zipper that allows for stable trimerization of a heterologous protein fused thereto is described in Fanslow et al., 1994, Semin. Immunol 6:267-78. In one approach, recombinant fusion proteins comprising an anti-IGF-1R antibody fragment or derivative fused to a leucine zipper peptide are expressed in suitable host cells, and the soluble oligomeric anti-IGF-1R antibody fragments or derivatives that form are recovered from the culture supernatant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides antigen binding proteins that interfere with the binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to an IGF-1R. Such antigen binding proteins can be made against IGF-1R, or a fragment, variant or derivative thereof, and screened in conventional assays for the ability to interfere with binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R. Examples of suitable assays are assays that test the antigen binding proteins for the ability to inhibit binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to cells expressing IGF-1R, or that test antigen binding proteins for the ability to reduce a biological or cellular response that results from the binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to cell surface IGF-1R receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that blocks the binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R but does not significantly block the binding of insulin to insulin receptor (INS-R). In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not bind to INS-R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to the INS-R with such a low affinity that it does not effectively block the binding of insulin to INS-R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to INS-R, but antigen binding protein-bound INS-R can still bind to insulin. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein's selectivity for IGF-1R is at least 50 times greater than its selectivity for insulin receptor. In another embodiment, the selectivity of the antigen binding protein is more than 100 times greater than its selectivity for insulin receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that demonstrates species selectivity. In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to one or more mammalian IGF-1R, for example, to human IGF-1R and one or more of mouse, rat, guinea pig, hamster, gerbil, cat, rabbit, dog, goat, sheep, cow, horse, camel, and non-human primate IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to one or more primate IGF-1R, for example, to human IGF-1R and one or more of cynomologous, marmoset, rhesus, and chimpanzee IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds specifically to human, cynomologous, marmoset, rhesus, or chimpanzee IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not bind to one or more of mouse, rat, guinea pig, hamster, gerbil, cat, rabbit, dog, goat, sheep, cow, horse, camel, and non-human primate IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not bind to a New World monkey species such as a marmoset. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not exhibit specific binding to any naturally occurring protein other than IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not exhibit specific binding to any naturally occurring protein other than mammalian IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not exhibit specific binding to any naturally occurring protein other than primate IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not exhibit specific binding to any naturally occurring protein other than human IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein specifically binds to mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein specifically binds to mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-1R with a similar binding affinity. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein blocks binding of human IGF-1 and IGF-2 with mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-1R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein blocks binding of human IGF-1 and IGF-2 with mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-1R with similar K\ni\n. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein blocks binding of human IGF-1 and IGF-2 with mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-1R with a K\ni \nof between about 0.57 and about 0.61 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne may determine the selectivity of an antigen binding protein for an IGF-1R using methods well known in the art and following the teachings of the specification. For example, one may determine the selectivity using Western blot, FACS, ELISA or RIA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein (for example, an anti-IGF-1R antibody), that has one or more of the following characteristics: binds to both human and murine IGF-1R, inhibits the binding of both IGF-1 and IGF-2 to human IGF-1R, inhibits the binding of both IGF-1 and IGF-2 to murine IGF-1R, preferentially inhibits the high affinity binding of IGF-1 and/or of IGF-2 to IGF-1R, binds to the L2 domain of IGF-1R, causes relatively little down-regulation of cell-surface expressed IGF-1R after 17 hours of exposure (as compared to MAB391 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, Minn.); e.g., amount of IGF-1R is reduced by less than 20%), causes a level of down-regulation of cell-surface expressed IGF-1R on Colo-205 or MiaPaCa-2 xenograft tumor cells in mice as MAB391 after four weeks of once weekly doses of 200 micrograms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen-binding fragments of antigen binding proteins of the invention may be produced by conventional techniques. Examples of such fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab and F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments. Antibody fragments and derivatives produced by genetic engineering techniques also are contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional embodiments include chimeric antibodies, e.g., humanized versions of non-human (e.g., murine) monoclonal antibodies. Such humanized antibodies may be prepared by known techniques, and offer the advantage of reduced immunogenicity when the antibodies are administered to humans. In one embodiment, a humanized monoclonal antibody comprises the variable domain of a murine antibody (or all or part of the antigen binding site thereof) and a constant domain derived from a human antibody. Alternatively, a humanized antibody fragment may comprise the antigen binding site of a murine monoclonal antibody and a variable domain fragment (lacking the antigen-binding site) derived from a human antibody. Procedures for the production of chimeric and further engineered monoclonal antibodies include those described in Riechmann et al., 1988, Nature 332:323, Liu et al., 1987, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 84:3439, Larrick et al., 1989, Bio/Technology 7:934, and Winter et al., 1993, TIPS 14:139. In one embodiment, the chimeric antibody is a CDR grafted antibody. Techniques for humanizing antibodies are discussed in, e.g., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/194,975 (published Feb. 27, 2003), U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,869,619, 5,225,539, 5,821,337, 5,859,205, Padlan et al., 1995, FASEB J. 9:133-39, and Tamura et al., 2000, J. Immunol 164:1432-41.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProcedures have been developed for generating human or partially human antibodies in non-human animals. For example, mice in which one or more endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been inactivated by various means have been prepared. Human immunoglobulin genes have been introduced into the mice to replace the inactivated mouse genes. Antibodies produced in the animal incorporate human immunoglobulin polypeptide chains encoded by the human genetic material introduced into the animal. In one embodiment, a non-human animal, such as a transgenic mouse, is immunized with an IGF-1R polypeptide, such that antibodies directed against the IGF-1R polypeptide are generated in the animal. One example of a suitable immunogen is a soluble human IGF-1R, such as a polypeptide comprising the extracellular domain of the protein of \nFIG. 10\n, or other immunogenic fragment of the protein of \nFIG. 10\n. Examples of techniques for production and use of transgenic animals for the production of human or partially human antibodies are described in U.S. Pat.

Monoclonal antibodies may be produced using any technique known in the art, e.g., by immortalizing spleen cells harvested from the transgenic animal after completion of the immunization schedule. The spleen cells can be immortalized using any technique known in the art, e.g., by fusing them with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas. Myeloma cells for use in hybridoma-producing fusion procedures preferably are non-antibody-producing, have high fusion efficiency, and enzyme deficiencies that render them incapable of growing in certain selective media which support the growth of only the desired fused cells (hybridomas). Examples of suitable cell lines for use in mouse fusions include Sp-20, P3-X63/Ag8, P3-X63-Ag8.653, NS1/1.Ag41, Sp210-Ag14, FO, NSO/U, MPC-11, MPC11-X45-GTG 1.7 and S194/5XX0 Bul; examples of cell lines used in rat fusions include R210.RCY3, Y3-Ag 1.2.3, IR983F and 4B210. Other cell lines useful for cell fusions are U-266, GM1500-GRG2, LICR-LON-HMy2 and UC729-6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a hybridoma cell line is produced by immunizing an animal (e.g., a transgenic animal having human immunoglobulin sequences) with an IGF-1R immunogen; harvesting spleen cells from the immunized animal; fusing the harvested spleen cells to a myeloma cell line, thereby generating hybridoma cells; establishing hybridoma cell lines from the hybridoma cells, and identifying a hybridoma cell line that produces an antibody that binds an IGF-1R polypeptide. Such hybridoma cell lines, and anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies produced by them, are encompassed by the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies secreted by a hybridoma cell line can be purified using any technique known in the art. Hybridomas or mAbs may be further screened to identify mAbs with particular properties, such as the ability to block an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 induced activity. Examples of such screens are provided in the examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMolecular evolution of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in the center of the antibody binding site also has been used to isolate antibodies with increased affinity, for example, antibodies having increased affinity for c-erbB-2, as described by Schier et al., 1996, J. Mol. Biol. 263:551. Accordingly, such techniques are useful in preparing antibodies to IGF-1R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen binding proteins directed against an IGF-1R can be used, for example, in assays to detect the presence of IGF-1R polypeptides, either in vitro or in vivo. The antigen binding proteins also may be employed in purifying IGF-1R proteins by immunoaffinity chromatography. Those antigen binding proteins that additionally can block binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R may be used to inhibit a biological activity that results from such binding. Blocking antigen binding proteins can be used in the methods of the present invention. Such antigen binding proteins that function as IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 antagonists may be employed in treating any IGF-1 and/or IGF-2-induced condition, including but not limited to cancer. In one embodiment, a human anti-IGF -1R monoclonal antibody generated by procedures involving immunization of transgenic mice is employed in treating such conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen binding proteins may be employed in an in vitro procedure, or administered in vivo to inhibit an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2-induced biological activity. Disorders caused or exacerbated (directly or indirectly) by the interaction of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 with cell surface IGF-1R, examples of which are provided above, thus may be treated. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a therapeutic method comprising in vivo administration of an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 blocking antigen binding protein to a mammal in need thereof in an amount effective for reducing an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2-induced biological activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen binding proteins of the invention include partially human and fully human monoclonal antibodies that inhibit a biological activity of IGF-1 and also inhibit a biological activity of IGF-2. One embodiment is directed to a human monoclonal antibody that at least partially blocks binding of IGF-1 and of IGF-2 to a cell that expresses human IGF-1R. In one embodiment, the antibodies are generated by immunizing a transgenic mouse with an IGF-1R immunogen. In another embodiment, the immunogen is a human IGF-1R polypeptide (e.g., a soluble fragment comprising all or part of the IGF-1R extracellular domain). Hybridoma cell lines derived from such immunized mice, wherein the hybridoma secretes a monoclonal antibody that binds IGF-1R, also are provided herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough human, partially human, or humanized antibodies will be suitable for many applications, particularly those involving administration of the antibody to a human subject, other types of antigen binding proteins will be suitable for certain applications. The non-human antibodies of the invention can be, for example, derived from any antibody-producing animal, such as mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, donkey, or non-human primate (such as monkey (e.g., cynomologous or rhesus monkey) or ape (e.g., chimpanzee)). Non-human antibodies of the invention can be used, for example, in in vitro and cell-culture based applications, or any other application where an immune response to the antibody of the invention does not occur, is insignificant, can be prevented, is not a concern, or is desired. In one embodiment, a non-human antibody of the invention is administered to a non-human subject. In another embodiment, the non-human antibody does not elicit an immune response in the non-human subject. In another embodiment, the non-human antibody is from the same species as the non-human subject, e.g., a mouse antibody of the invention is administered to a mouse. An antibody from a particular species can be made by, for example, immunizing an animal of that species with the desired immunogen (e.g., a soluble IGF-1R polypeptide) or using an artificial system for generating antibodies of that species (e.g., a bacterial or phage display-based system for generating antibodies of a particular species), or by converting an antibody from one species into an antibody from another species by replacing, e.g., the constant region of the antibody with a constant region from the other species, or by replacing one or more amino acid residues of the antibody so that it more closely resembles the sequence of an antibody from the other species. In one embodiment, the antibody is a chimeric antibody comprising amino acid sequences derived from antibodies from two or more different species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen binding proteins may be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. For example, they may be purified from cells that naturally express them (e.g., an antibody can be purified from a hybridoma that produces it), or produced in recombinant expression systems, using any technique known in the art. See, for example, \nMonoclonal Antibodies, Hybridomas: A New Dimension in Biological Analyses, \nKennet et al. (eds.), Plenum Press, New York (1980); and \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual, \nHarlow and Land (eds.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny expression system known in the art can be used to make the recombinant polypeptides of the invention. In general, host cells are transformed with a recombinant expression vector that comprises DNA encoding a desired polypeptide. Among the host cells that may be employed are prokaryotes, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes include gram negative or gram positive organisms, for example \nE. coli \nor bacilli. Higher eukaryotic cells include insect cells and established cell lines of mammalian origin. Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include the COS-7 line of monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL 1651) (Gluzman et al., 1981, Cell 23:175), L cells, 293 cells, C127 cells, 3T3 cells (ATCC CCL 163), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, BHK (ATCC CRL 10) cell lines, and the CVI/EBNA cell line derived from the African green monkey kidney cell line CVI (ATCC CCL 70) as described by McMahan et al., 1991, EMBO J. 10: 2821. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian cellular hosts are described by Pouwels et al. (\nCloning Vectors: A Laboratory Manual, \nElsevier, N.Y., 1985).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe transformed cells can be cultured under conditions that promote expression of the polypeptide, and the polypeptide recovered by conventional protein purification procedures. One such purification procedure includes the use of affinity chromatography, e.g., over a matrix having all or a portion (e.g., the extracellular domain) of IGF-1R bound thereto. Polypeptides contemplated for use herein include substantially homogeneous recombinant mammalian anti-IGF-1R antibody polypeptides substantially free of contaminating endogenous materials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen binding proteins may be prepared, and screened for desired properties, by any of a number of known techniques. Certain of the techniques involve isolating a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide chain (or portion thereof) of an antigen binding protein of interest (e.g., an anti-IGF-1R antibody), and manipulating the nucleic acid through recombinant DNA technology. The nucleic acid may be fused to another nucleic acid of interest, or altered (e.g., by mutagenesis or other conventional techniques) to add, delete, or substitute one or more amino acid residues, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides antigen-binding fragments of an anti-IGF-1R antibody of the invention. Such fragments can consist entirely of antibody-derived sequences or can comprise additional sequences. Examples of antigen-binding fragments include Fab, F(ab′)2, single chain antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, and domain antibodies. Other examples are provided in Lunde et al., 2002, Biochem. Soc. Trans. 30:500-06.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle chain antibodies may be formed by linking heavy and light chain variable domain (Fv region) fragments via an amino acid bridge (short peptide linker), resulting in a single polypeptide chain. Such single-chain Fvs (scFvs) have been prepared by fusing DNA encoding a peptide linker between DNAs encoding the two variable domain polypeptides (V\nL \nand V\nH\n). The resulting polypeptides can fold back on themselves to form antigen-binding monomers, or they can form multimers (e.g., dimers, trimers, or tetramers), depending on the length of a flexible linker between the two variable domains (Kortt et al., 1997, Prot. Eng. 10:423; Kortt et al., 2001, Biomol. Eng. 18:95-108). By combining different V\nL \nand V\nH\n-comprising polypeptides, one can form multimeric scFvs that bind to different epitopes (Kriangkum et al., 2001, Biomol. Eng. 18:31-40). Techniques developed for the production of single chain antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird, 1988, Science 242:423; Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879; Ward et al., 1989, Nature 334:544, de Graaf et al., 2002, Methods Mol Biol. 178:379-87. Single chain antibodies derived from antibodies provided herein include, but are not limited to, scFvs comprising the variable domain combinations L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50H50, L51H51, and L52H52) are encompassed by the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen binding proteins (e.g., antibodies, antibody fragments, and antibody derivatives) of the invention can comprise any constant region known in the art. The light chain constant region can be, for example, a kappa- or lambda-type light chain constant region, e.g., a human kappa- or lambda-type light chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region can be, for example, an alpha-, delta-, epsilon-, gamma-, or mu-type heavy chain constant regions, e.g., a human alpha-, delta-, epsilon-, gamma-, or mu-type heavy chain constant region. In one embodiment, the light or heavy chain constant region is a fragment, derivative, variant, or mutein of a naturally occurring constant region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques are known for deriving an antibody of a different subclass or isotype from an antibody of interest, i.e., subclass switching Thus, IgG antibodies may be derived from an IgM antibody, for example, and vice versa. Such techniques allow the preparation of new antibodies that possess the antigen-binding properties of a given antibody (the parent antibody), but also exhibit biological properties associated with an antibody isotype or subclass different from that of the parent antibody. Recombinant DNA techniques may be employed. Cloned DNA encoding particular antibody polypeptides may be employed in such procedures, e.g., DNA encoding the constant domain of an antibody of the desired isotype. See also Lantto et al., 2002, Methods Mol. Biol. 178:303-16.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, an antigen binding protein of the invention comprises the IgG1 heavy chain domain of \nFIG. 13\n or a fragment of the IgG1 heavy chain domain of \nFIG. 13\n. In another embodiment, an antigen binding protein of the invention comprises the kappa light chain constant chain region of \nFIG. 13\n or a fragment of the kappa light chain constant region of \nFIG. 13\n. In another embodiment, an antigen binding protein of the invention comprises both the IgG1 heavy chain domain, or a fragment thereof, of \nFIG. 13\n and the kappa light chain domain, or a fragment thereof, of \nFIG. 13\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the antigen binding proteins of the present invention include those comprising, for example, the variable domain combinations L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50H50, L51H51, and L52H52, having a desired isotype (for example, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgM, IgE, and IgD) as well as Fab or F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments thereof. Moreover, if an IgG4 is desired, it may also be desired to introduce a point mutation (CPSCP→CPPCP) in the hinge region as described in Bloom et al., 1997, Protein Science 6:407, incorporated by reference herein) to alleviate a tendency to form intra-H chain disulfide bonds that can lead to heterogeneity in the IgG4 antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, techniques for deriving antigen binding proteins having different properties (i.e., varying affinities for the antigen to which they bind) are also known. One such technique, referred to as chain shuffling, involves displaying immunoglobulin variable domain gene repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, often referred to as phage display. Chain shuffling has been used to prepare high affinity antibodies to the hapten 2-phenyloxazol-5-one, as described by Marks et al., 1992, BioTechnology, 10:779.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, antigen binding proteins of the present invention have a binding affinity (K\na\n) for IGF-1R of at least 10\n6\n, measured as described in the Examples. In other embodiments, the antigen binding proteins exhibit a K\na \nof at least 10\n7\n, at least 10\n8\n, at least 10\n9\n, or at least 10\n10\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that has a low dissociation rate from IGF-1R. In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein has a K\noff \nof 1×10\n−4 \ns\n−1 \nor lower. In another embodiment, the K\noff \nis 5×10\n−5 \ns\n−1 \nor lower. In another embodiment, the K\noff \nis substantially the same as an antibody having a combination of light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequences selected from the group of combinations consisting of L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50H50, L51H51, and L52H52. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to IGF-1R with substantially the same K\noff \nas an antibody that comprises one or more CDRs from an antibody having a combination of light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequences selected from the group of combinations consisting of L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50H50, L51H51, and L52H52. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to IGF-1R with substantially the same K\noff \nas an antibody that comprises one of the amino acid sequences illustrated in \nFIGS. 2 through 9\n. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to IGF-1R with substantially the same K\noff \nas an antibody that comprises one or more CDRs from an antibody that comprises one of the amino acid sequences illustrated in \nFIGS. 2 through 9\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that binds to the L2 domain of human IGF-1R. Antigen binding proteins that bind to the L2 domain can be made using any technique known in the art. For example, such antigen binding proteins can be isolated using the full-length IGF-1R polypeptide (e.g., in a membrane-bound preparation), a soluble extracellular domain fragment of IGF-1R (an example of which is provided in Example 1), or a smaller fragment of the IGF-1R extracellular domain comprising or consisting of the L2 domain (examples of which are provided in Example 10). Antigen binding proteins so isolated can be screened to determine their binding specificity using any method known in the art (an example of which is provided in Example 10).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that binds to human IGF-1R expressed on the surface of a cell and, when so bound, inhibits IGF-1R signaling activity in the cell without causing a significant reduction in the amount of IGF-1R on the surface of the cell. Any method for determining or estimating the amount of IGF -1R on the surface and/or in the interior of the cell can be used. In one embodiment, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that binds to the L2 domain of a human IGF-1R expressed on the surface of a cell and, when so bound, inhibits IGF-1R signaling activity in the cell without significantly increasing the rate of internalization of the IGF-1R from the surface of the cell. In other embodiments, binding of the antigen binding protein to the IGF-1R-expressing cell causes less than about 75%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 1%, or 0.1% of the cell-surface IGF-1R to be internalized. In another aspect, binding of the antigen binding protein to the IGF-1R-expressing cell causes a gradual reduction in the amount of IGF-1R on the cell surface such that within a few hours of contacting the cell with the antigen binding protein, little or no decrease in cell surface IGF-1R is detected, but, after several days or weeks of exposure of the cell to the antigen binding protein, a marked decrease in cell surface IGF-1R is detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides an antigen binding protein having a half-life of at least one day in vitro or in vivo (e.g., when administered to a human subject). In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein has a half-life of at least three days. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein has a half-life of four days or longer. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein has a half-life of eight days or longer. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein is derivatized or modified such that it has a longer half-life as compared to the underivatized or unmodified antigen binding protein. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein contains one or more point mutations to increase serum half life, such as described in WO 00/09560, published Feb. 24, 2000, incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides multi-specific antigen binding proteins, for example, bispecific antigen binding protein, e.g., antigen binding protein that bind to two different epitopes of IGF-1R, or to an epitope of IGF-1R and an epitope of another molecule, via two different antigen binding sites or regions. Moreover, bispecific antigen binding protein as disclosed herein can comprise an IGF-1R binding site from one of the herein-described antibodies and a second IGF-1R binding region from another of the herein-described antibodies, including those described herein by reference to other publications. Alternatively, a bispecific antigen binding protein may comprise an antigen binding site from one of the herein described antibodies and a second antigen binding site from another IGF-1R antibody that is known in the art, or from an antibody that is prepared by known methods or the methods described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous methods of preparing bispecific antibodies are known in the art, and discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/839,632, filed Apr. 20, 2001 (incorporated by reference herein). Such methods include the use of hybrid-hybridomas as described by Milstein et al., 1983, Nature 305:537, and others (U.S. Pat. No. 4,474,893, U.S. Pat. No. 6,106,833), and chemical coupling of antibody fragments (Brennan et al., 1985, Science 229:81; Glennie et al., 1987, J. Immunol 139:2367; U.S. Pat. No. 6,010,902). Moreover, bispecific antibodies can be produced via recombinant means, for example by using leucine zipper moieties (i.e., from the Fos and Jun proteins, which preferentially form heterodimers; Kostelny et al., 1992, J. Immnol 148:1547) or other lock and key interactive domain structures as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,582,996. Additional useful techniques include those described in Kortt et al., 1997, supra; U.S. Pat. No. 5,959,083; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,706.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the antigen binding protein of the present invention comprises a derivative of an antibody. The derivatized antibody can comprise any molecule or substance that imparts a desired property to the antibody, such as increased half-life in a particular use. The derivatized antibody can comprise, for example, a detectable (or labeling) moiety (e.g., a radioactive, colorimetric, antigenic or enzymatic molecule, a detecable bead (such as a magnetic or electrodense (e.g., gold) bead), or a molecule that binds to another molecule (e.g., biotin or streptavidin)), a therapeutic or diagnostic moiety (e.g., a radioactive, cytotoxic, or pharmaceutically active moiety), or a molecule that increases the suitability of the antibody for a particular use (e.g., administration to a subject, such as a human subject, or other in vivo or in vitro uses). Examples of molecules that can be used to derivatize an antibody include albumin (e.g., human serum albumin) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Albumin-linked and PEGylated derivatives of antibodies can be prepared using techniques well known in the art. In one embodiment, the antibody is conjugated or otherwise linked to transthyretin (TTR) or a TTR variant. The TTR or TTR variant can be chemically modified with, for example, a chemical selected from the group consisting of dextran, poly(n-vinyl pyurrolidone), polyethylene glycols, propropylene glycol homopolymers, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols and polyvinyl alcohols. US Pat. App. No. 20030195154.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides methods of screening for a molecule that binds to IGF-1R using the antigen binding proteins of the present invention. Any suitable screening technique can be used. In one embodiment, an IGF-1R molecule, or a fragment thereof to which an antigen binding protein of the present invention binds, is contacted with the antigen binding protein of the invention and with another molecule, wherein the other molecule binds to IGF-1R if it reduces the binding of the antigen binding protein to IGF-1R. Binding of the antigen binding protein can be detected using any suitable method, e.g., an ELISA. Detection of binding of the antigen binding protein to IGF-1R can be simplified by detectably labeling the antigen binding protein, as discussed above. In another embodiment, the IGF-1R-binding molecule is further analyzed to determine whether it inhibits IGF-1R, IGF-1, and/or IGF-2-mediated signaling.\n\n\n \nNucleic Acids\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules. The nucleic acids comprise, for example, polynucleotides that encode all or part of an antigen binding protein, for example, one or both chains of an antibody of the invention, or a fragment, derivative, mutein, or variant thereof, polynucleotides sufficient for use as hybridization probes, PCR primers or sequencing primers for identifying, analyzing, mutating or amplifying a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide, anti-sense nucleic acids for inhibiting expression of a polynucleotide, and complementary sequences of the foregoing. The nucleic acids can be any length. They can be, for example, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,500, 3,000, 5,000 or more nucleotides in length, and/or can comprise one or more additional sequences, for example, regulatory sequences, and/or be part of a larger nucleic acid, for example, a vector. The nucleic acids can be single-stranded or double-stranded and can comprise RNA and/or DNA nucleotides, and artificial variants thereof (e.g., peptide nucleic acids).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acids encoding antibody polypeptides (e.g., heavy or light chain, variable domain only, or full length) may be isolated from B-cells of mice that have been immunized with IGF-1R. The nucleic acid may be isolated by conventional procedures such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n provides nucleic acid sequences encoding the variable regions of the heavy and light chain variable regions shown in \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n. The skilled artisan will appreciate that, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, each of the polypeptide sequences in \nFIGS. 2 through 9\n also is encoded by a large number of other nucleic acid sequences. The present invention provides each degenerate nucleotide sequence encoding each antigen binding protein of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides nucleic acids that hybridize to other nucleic acids (e.g., nucleic acids comprising a nucleotide sequence of \nFIG. 1\n) under particular hybridization conditions. Methods for hybridizing nucleic acids are well-known in the art. See, e.g., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6. As defined herein, a moderately stringent hybridization condition uses a prewashing solution containing 5× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), hybridization buffer of about 50% formamide, 6×SSC, and a hybridization temperature of 55° C. (or other similar hybridization solutions, such as one containing about 50% formamide, with a hybridization temperature of 42° C.), and washing conditions of 60° C., in 0.5×SSC, 0.1% SDS. A stringent hybridization condition hybridizes in 6×SSC at 45° C., followed by one or more washes in 0.1×SSC, 0.2% SDS at 68° C. Furthermore, one of skill in the art can manipulate the hybridization and/or washing conditions to increase or decrease the stringency of hybridization such that nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences that are at least 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98 or 99% identical to each other typically remain hybridized to each other. The basic parameters affecting the choice of hybridization conditions and guidance for devising suitable conditions are set forth by, for example, Sambrook, Fritsch, and Maniatis (1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., \n \nchapters\n \n 9 and 11; and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1995, Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., sections 2.10 and 6.3-6.4), and can be readily determined by those having ordinary skill in the art based on, for example, the length and/or base composition of the DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChanges can be introduced by mutation into a nucleic acid, thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide (e.g., an antigen binding protein) that it encodes. Mutations can be introduced using any technique known in the art. In one embodiment, one or more particular amino acid residues are changed using, for example, a site-directed mutagenesis protocol. In another embodiment, one or more randomly selected residues is changed using, for example, a random mutagenesis protocol. However it is made, a mutant polypeptide can be expressed and screened for a desired property (e.g., binding to IGF-1R or blocking the binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutations can be introduced into a nucleic acid without significantly altering the biological activity of a polypeptide that it encodes. For example, one can make nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at non-essential amino acid residues. In one embodiment, a nucleotide sequence provided in \nFIG. 1\n, or a desired fragment, variant, or derivative thereof, is mutated such that it encodes an amino acid sequence comprising one or more deletions or substitutions of amino acid residues that are shown in \nFIGS. 2 through 9\n to be residues where two or more sequences differ. In another embodiment, the mutagenesis inserts an amino acid adjacent to one or more amino acid residues shown in \nFIGS. 2 through 9\n to be residues where two or more sequences differ. Alternatively, one or more mutations can be introduced into a nucleic acid that selectively change the biological activity (e.g., binding of IGF-1R, inhibiting IGF-1 and/or IGF-2, etc.) of a polypeptide that it encodes. For example, the mutation can quantitatively or qualitatively change the biological activity. Examples of quantitative changes include increasing, reducing or eliminating the activity. Examples of qualitative changes include changing the antigen specificity of an antigen binding protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides nucleic acid molecules that are suitable for use as primers or hybridization probes for the detection of nucleic acid sequences of the invention. A nucleic acid molecule of the invention can comprise only a portion of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a full-length polypeptide of the invention, for example, a fragment that can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment encoding an active portion (e.g., an IGF-1R binding portion) of a polypeptide of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProbes based on the sequence of a nucleic acid of the invention can be used to detect the nucleic acid or similar nucleic acids, for example, transcripts encoding a polypeptide of the invention. The probe can comprise a label group, e.g., a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. Such probes can be used to identify a cell that expresses the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides vectors comprising a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the invention or a portion thereof. Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to, plasmids, viral vectors, non-episomal mammalian vectors and expression vectors, for example, recombinant expression vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recombinant expression vectors of the invention can comprise a nucleic acid of the invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell. The recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory sequences, selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, which is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Regulatory sequences include those that direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in many types of host cells (e.g., SV40 early gene enhancer, Rous sarcoma virus promoter and cytomegalovirus promoter), those that direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only in certain host cells (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory sequences, see Voss et al., 1986, Trends Biochem. Sci. 11:287, Maniatis et al., 1987, Science 236:1237, incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), and those that direct inducible expression of a nucleotide sequence in response to particular treatment or condition (e.g., the metallothionin promoter in mammalian cells and the tet-responsive and/or streptomycin responsive promoter in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems (see id.). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired, etc. The expression vectors of the invention can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce proteins or peptides, including fusion proteins or peptides, encoded by nucleic acids as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides host cells into which a recombinant expression vector of the invention has been introduced. A host cell can be any prokaryotic cell (for example, \nE. coli\n) or eukaryotic cell (for example, yeast, insect, or mammalian cells (e.g., CHO cells)). Vector DNA can be introduced into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells via conventional transformation or transfection techniques. For stable transfection of mammalian cells, it is known that, depending upon the expression vector and transfection technique used, only a small fraction of cells may integrate the foreign DNA into their genome. In order to identify and select these integrants, a gene that encodes a selectable marker (e.g., for resistance to antibiotics) is generally introduced into the host cells along with the gene of interest. Preferred selectable markers include those which confer resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin and methotrexate. Cells stably transfected with the introduced nucleic acid can be identified by drug selection (e.g., cells that have incorporated the selectable marker gene will survive, while the other cells die), among other methods.\n\n\n \nIndications\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides methods of treating a subject. The method can, for example, have a generally salubrious effect on the subject, e.g., it can increase the subject's expected longevity. Alternatively, the method can, for example, treat, prevent, cure, relieve, or ameliorate (“treat”) a disease, disorder, condition, or illness (“a condition”). Among the conditions to be treated in accordance with the present invention are conditions characterized by inappropriate expression or activity of IGF-1, IGF-2, and/or IGF-1R. In some such conditions, the expression or activity level is too high, and the treatment comprises administering an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein. In other such conditions, the expression or activity level is too low, and the treatment comprises administering an IGF-1R agonist as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne example of a type of condition that can be treated using the methods and compositions of the present invention is a condition that involves cell growth, for example, a cancerous condition. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides compositions and methods for treating a cancerous condition. The cancerous condition can be any cancerous condition that can be treated using the compositions comprised herein, for example, IGF-1R antagonizing antigen binding proteins such as anti-IGF-1R antibodies, antibody fragments, or antibody derivatives. Examples of cancerous conditions include, for example, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Adrenocortical Carcinoma, AIDS-Related Cancers, AIDS-Related Lymphoma, Anal Cancer, Childhood Cerebellar Astrocytoma, Childhood Cerebral Astrocytoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Extrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer, Bladder Cancer, Osteosarcoma/Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma Bone Cancer, Brain Tumors (e.g., Brain Stem Glioma, Cerebellar Astrocytoma, Cerebral Astrocytoma/Malignant Glioma, Ependymoma, Medulloblastoma, Supratentorial Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors, Visual Pathway and Hypothalamic Glioma), Breast Cancer, Bronchial Adenomas/Carcinoids, Burkitt's Lymphoma, Carcinoid Tumor, Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumor, Carcinoma of Unknown Primary, Primary Central Nervous System, Cerebellar Astrocytoma, Cerebral Astrocytoma/Malignant Glioma, Cervical Cancer, Childhood Cancers, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders, Colon Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma, Endometrial Cancer, Ependymoma, Esophageal Cancer, Ewing's Family of Tumors, Extracranial Germ Cell Tumor, Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumor, Extrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer, Intraocular Melanoma Eye Cancer, Retinoblastoma Eye Cancer, Gallbladder Cancer, Gastric (Stomach) Cancer, Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumor, Germ Cell Tumors (e.g., Extracranial, Extragonadal, and Ovarian), Gestational Trophoblastic Tumor, Glioma (e.g., Adult, Childhood Brain Stem, Childhood Cerebral Astrocytoma, Childhood Visual Pathway and Hypothalamic), Hairy Cell Leukemia, Head and Neck Cancer, Hepatocellular (Liver) Cancer, Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Hypopharyngeal Cancer, Hypothalamic and Visual Pathway Glioma, Intraocular Melanoma, Islet Cell Carcinoma (Endocrine Pancreas), Kaposi's Sarcoma, Kidney (Renal Cell) Cancer, Laryngeal Cancer, Leukemia (e.g., Acute Lymphoblastic, Acute Myeloid, Chronic Lymphocytic, Chronic Myelogenous, and Hairy Cell), Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer, Liver Cancer, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Small Cell Lung Cancer, Lymphoma (e.g., AIDS-Related, Burkitt's, Cutaneous T-Cell, Hodgkin's, Non-Hodgkin's, and Primary Central Nervous System), Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone/Osteosarcoma, Medulloblastoma, Melanoma, Intraocular (Eye) Melanoma, Merkel Cell Carcinoma, Mesothelioma, Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult Primary, Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndrome, Multiple Myeloma/Plasma Cell Neoplasm, Mycosis Fungoides, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Diseases, Myelogenous Leukemia, Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Multiple Myeloma, Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorders, Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinus Cancer, Nasopharyngeal Cancer, Neuroblastoma, Oral Cancer, Oropharyngeal Cancer, Osteosarcoma/Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone, Ovarian Cancer, Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Ovarian Germ Cell Tumor, Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumor, Pancreatic Cancer, Islet Cell Pancreatic Cancer, Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer, Parathyroid Cancer, Penile Cancer, Pheochromocytoma, Pineoblastoma, Pituitary Tumor, Plasma Cell Neoplasm/Multiple Myeloma, Pleuropulmonary Blastoma, Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma, Prostate Cancer, Rectal Cancer, Renal Cell (Kidney) Cancer, Renal Pelvis and Ureter Transitional Cell Cancer, Retinoblastoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma, Salivary Gland Cancer, Soft Tissue Sarcoma, Uterine Sarcoma, Sezary Syndrome, non-Melanoma Skin Cancer, Merkel Cell Skin Carcinoma, Small Intestine Cancer, Soft Tissue Sarcoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma, Testicular Cancer, Thymoma, Thymic Carcinoma, Thyroid Cancer, Gestational Trophoblastic Tumor, Carcinoma of Unknown Primary Site, Cancer of Unknown Primary Site, Urethral Cancer, Endometrial Uterine Cancer, Uterine Sarcoma, Vaginal Cancer, Visual Pathway and Hypothalamic Glioma, Vulvar Cancer, Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, and Wilms' Tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour different groups have studied a total of 425 breast cancers, mostly ductal in origin, and 48 normal tissues or benign specimens by radioimmunoassay (“RIA”) or immunohistochemistry (“IHC”) (Papa et al., 1993, Cancer Research 53: 3736-40, Happerfield et al., 1997, Journal of Pathology 183: 412-17; Ellis et al., 1998, Breast Cancer Research & Treatment 52: 175-84, Lee et al., 1998, Breast Cancer Research & Treatment 47: 295-302, Schnarr et al., 2000, International Journal of Cancer 89: 506-13). These studies suggest that elevated IGF-1R expression, on the order of 5-10 fold, is associated with favorable prognosis and biomarkers (ER+PR+), suggesting that estrogen and IGF cooperate in the maintenance or progression of well differentiated tumor Similarly, estrogen has been shown to be essential for the growth and survival of the ER+MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, and in this context IGF-1R is up-regulated by estrogen treatment (reviewed in Ellis et al., 1998, Breast Cancer Research & Treatment 52: 175-84). Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating breast cancer in a subject in need of such treatment, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein. In another embodiment, the method further comprises administering a hormone inhibitor, e.g., an estrogen inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA retrospective IGF-1R IHC analysis has been reported for a collection of 12 colonic adenomas, 36 primary colorectal adenocarcinomas and 27 corresponding metastases, and 34 adjacent normal tissues (Hakam et al., 1999, Human Pathology. 30: 1128-33). The frequency of moderate to strong IHC staining appeared to dramatically increase with higher stage and tumor grade (0% normal vs. 93% metastases). The results are consistent with RNA analysis by RNAse protection assay (“RPA”) (Freier et al., 1999, Gut 44: 704-08). Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating colon cancer in a subject in need of such treatment, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh plasma IGF-1 and reduced IGFbp3 in men 40-80 years old is associated with increased prostate cancer risk (Chan et al., 1998, Science 279: 563-6). High IGF-1 is associated with a risk of other cancers including breast (Hankinson et al., 1998, Lancet 351: 1393-96), colon (Ma et al., 1999, Journal of the National Cancer Institute 91: 620-25) and lung (Yu et al., 1999, Journal of the National Cancer Institute 91: 151-56). In transgenic mouse models, tumor incidence is increased by IGF-1 overexpression in diverse locations (Bol et al., 1997, Oncogene 14: 1725-34; DiGiovanni et al., 2000, Cancer Research 60: 1561-70; DiGiovanni et al., 2000, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 97: 3455-60, Hadsell et al., 2000, Oncogene 19: 889-98). These mouse studies point to a role for both serum and stromal produced IGF-1. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject in need of such treatment, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an antagonist of IGF-1R as described herein, wherein the antagonist inhibits the activation of IGF-1R by IGF-1. In another embodiment, the subject has cancer. In another embodiment, the subject has a tumor. In another embodiment, the cancer is prostate, breast, colon or lung cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been observed that bone is the major source of IGF-1 in the body. Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides compositions and methods for inhibiting IGF-1R in a bone of a subject. In one embodiment, an IGF-1R inhibitor of the present invention is administered to a subject that has, or is at risk for developing, a tumor in a bone. The tumor can be, for example, a primary tumor or a metastatic tumor. The treatment optionally further comprises administering to the subject one or more additional therapeutic and/or palliative treatments, for example, an anti-tumor treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or anti-hormone therapy) or a treatment that inhibits bone turnover (e.g., denosumab (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif.)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIGF-2 is overexpressed in a variety of tumors and stromal tissues. IGF-2 levels appear especially high (as much as 40 fold) in primary liver cancers (Cariani et al., 1988, Cancer Research 48: 6844-49) and adenocarcinoma of the colon (Freier et al., 1999, Gut 44: 704-08). Many of the overgrowth disorders are associated with an increased incidence of childhood tumors. Five to ten percent of individuals with either the prenatal growth disorder Beckwith-Weidmann Syndrome (BWS) or hemihyperplasia develop tumors such as nephroblastoma, adrenal carcinoma, and neuroblastoma (reviewed by Morison et al., 1998, Molecular Medicine Today 4: 110-05). The tumor-predisposing factor in these children appears to be the mosaic loss of maternal IGF-2 gene imprinting, or duplication of the paternal chromosomal arm (11p) that carries IGF-2. Both alterations would increase the level of IGF-2 expression. IGF-2 overexpression as a result of mosaic uniparental disomy or loss of IGF-2 imprinting has also been detected in Wilms tumors. Growth disorders are not observed in these children even though the IGF-2 gene alterations also occur in some normal tissues, perhaps reflecting the tissue distribution of the affected cells. Imprinting of the maternal IGF-2 gene also occurs in mice, and the effects of IGF-2 overexpression are consistent with the human situation (Cariani et al., 1991, Journal of Hepatology 13: 220-26, Schirmacher et al., 1992, Cancer Research 52: 2549-56; Harris et al., 1998, Oncogene 16: 203-09). The incidence of tumors and organomegaly increases in mice that transgenically express excess IGF-2 (Christofori et al., 1994, Nature 369: 414-18, Ward et al., 1994, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 91: 10365-9, Wolf et al., 1994, Endocrinology 135: 1877-86, Bates et al., 1995, British Journal of Cancer 72: 1189-93, Hassan et al., 2000, Cancer Research 60: 1070-76). Local IGF-2 overexpression increases the spontaneous appearance of prostate, mammary, intestinal, liver and epidermal tumors. Plasma specific expression using liver promoters elevate hepatocellular carcinomas and lymphoma. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject in need of such treatment, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an antagonist of IGF-1R as described herein, wherein the antagonist inhibits the activation of IGF-1R by IGF-2. In another embodiment, the subject has cancer. In another embodiment, the subject has a tumor. In another embodiment, the subject has liver cancer, adenocarcinoma of the colon, Beckwith-Weidmann Syndrome, hemihyperplasia, nephroblastoma, adrenal carcinoma, neuroblastoma, mosaic loss of maternal IGF-2 gene imprinting, duplication of the paternal chromosomal arm (11p), increased IGF-2 expression, a tumor (e.g., a prostate, mammary, intestinal, liver, epidermal, or Wilms tumor), organomegaly, hepatocellular carcinoma, or lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods of preventing or inhibiting a cancer from spreading to another part of the body, or of treating a cancer that has spread to another part of the body. In one embodiment, the cancer has spread to a regional lymph node. In another embodiment, the cancer is metastatic. The primary tumor can be any kind of tumor, for example, an adenocarcinoma tumor (e.g., a prostate adenocarcinoma tumor, a breast carcinoma tumor, or a renal cell carcinoma tumor), a non-small cell or small cell lung cancer tumor, a thyroid cancer tumor, etc. The site of the metastatic tumor can be anywhere in the body. It can be, for example, in bone, the lymph system, lung, brain, eye, skin, pancrease, or liver. In one particular embodiment, a subject having a tumor disease is treated with an effective amount of an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention such that the primary tumor is prevented from metastasizing. In another particular embodiment, a subject having a primary tumor is treated with an effective amount of an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention such that the primary tumor is inhibited from metastasizing. In another particular embodiment, a subject having a metastatic tumor is treated with an effective amount of an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention such that growth or spreading of the secondary tumor is inhibited. In another particular embodiment, a subject having a metastatic tumor is treated with an effective amount of an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention such that the secondary tumor is reduced in size. In a more particular embodiment, the primary tumor is an adenocarcinoma tumor, a non-small cell lung tumor, a small cell lung tumor, or a thyroid cancer. In another more particular embodiment, the metastatic tumor is in a bone. In another more particular embodiment, a metastatic tumor is prevented or inhibited from forming in a bone. In another more particularly defined embodiment, the method comprises treating the subject with an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention and one or more other treatments (e.g., a treatment that kills or inhibits the growth of cancer cells, such as radiation, hormonal therapy, or chemotherapy, or a treatment that inhibits the turnover of bone, such as denosumab), non-limiting examples of which are provided herein. The one or more other treatments can include, for example the standard of care for the subject's particular condition and/or palliative care.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being bound to any particular theory, tumor cells appear to depend on the PI3 Kinase/Akt signaling pathway to resist the apoptosis-inducing activity of chemotherapeutics, radiation, and anti-hormone therapy. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides methods of treating a subject in need of such treatment comprising administering to the subject an IGF-1R antagonist of the present invention and a chemotherapeutic, radiation, and/or an anti-hormone therapy. This concept has been validated experimentally in cell culture models and rodent tumor models by antisense and dominant negative mutations (reviewed by Baserga et al., 1997, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1332: F105-26, Baserga, 2000, Oncogene 19: 5574-81). In one embodiment, the chemotherapeutic agents is selected from the group consisting of mitotic inhibitors, alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, intercalating antibiotics, growth factor inhibitors, cell cycle inhibitors, enzymes, topoisomerase inhibitors, anti-survival agents, biological response modifiers, anti-hormones, e.g. anti-androgens, and anti-angiogenesis agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne example of a chemotherapeutic agent that can be administered in combination with an IGF-1 receptor inhibitor of the invention is CPT-11. CPT-11 (Irinotecan hydorchloride trihydrate) is a semi synthetic, water soluble derivative of camptothecin, a plant alkaloid. CPT-11 and an associated metabolite called SN38 inhibit topoisomerase 1 (TOPO1). This enzyme introduces reversible single-strand breaks in DNA that allow unwinding and permit DNA replication to proceed Inhibition of TOPO1 prevents religation of single-strand breaks after DNA replication resulting in greatly increased chromosomal fragmentation. This DNA damage promotes cell death by apoptosis through the action of p53 and other systems that monitor genome integrity. The cytotoxic effect of CPT-11 is generally limited to cells that are replicating DNA (S-Phase). Quiescent cells are largely unaffected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides treating a subject in need thereof with an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist of the present invention and with an effective amount of an apoptosis-inducing agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, an anti-angiogenesis agent, such as an MMP-2 (matrix-metalloproteinase 2) inhibitor, an MMP-9 (matrix-metalloproteinase 9) inhibitor, and/or a COX-II (cyclooxygenase II) inhibitor, is used in conjunction with a compound of the invention. Examples of useful COX-II inhibitors include CELEBREX™ (alecoxib), BEXTRA™ (valdecoxib), and VIOXX™ (rofecoxib). Examples of useful matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors are described in WO 96/33172 (published Oct. 24, 1996), WO 96/27583 (published Mar. 7, 1996), European Patent Application No. 97304971.1 (filed Jul. 8, 1997), European Patent Application No. 99308617.2 (filed Oct. 29, 1999), WO 98/07697 (published Feb. 26, 1998), WO 98/03516 (published Jan. 29, 1998), WO 98/34918 (published Aug. 13, 1998), WO 98/34915 (published Aug. 13, 1998), WO 98/33768 (published Aug. 6, 1998), WO 98/30566 (published Jul. 16, 1998), European Patent Publication 606,046 (published Jul. 13, 1994), European Patent Publication 931,788 (published Jul. 28, 1999), WO 90/05719 (published May 31, 1990), WO 99/52910 (published Oct. 21, 1999), WO 99/52889 (published Oct. 21, 1999), WO 99/29667 (published Jun. 17, 1999), PCT International Application No. PCT/IB98/01113 (filed Jul. 21, 1998), European Patent Application No. 99302232.1 (filed Mar. 25, 1999), Great Britain patent application number 9912961.1 (filed Jun. 3, 1999), U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/148,464 (filed Aug. 12, 1999), U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,949 (issued Jan. 26, 1999), U.S. Pat. No. 5,861,510 (issued Jan. 19, 1999), and European Patent Publication 780,386 (published Jun. 25, 1997), all of which are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference. In one embodiment, the MMP inhibitor is one that does not demonstrate arthralgia. In another embodiment, the MMP inhibitor selectively inhibits MMP-2 and/or MMP-9 relative to other matrix-metalloproteinases (i.e., MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-4, MMP-5, MMP-6, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-10, MMP-11, MMP-12, and MMP-13). Some specific examples of MMP inhibitors useful in the present invention are AG-3340, RO 32-3555, RS 13-0830, and the compounds recited in the following list: 3-[[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzene-sulfonyl]-(1-hydroxycarbamoyl-cyclopentyl)-amino]-propionic acid; 3-exo-3-[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonylamino]-8-oxa-bicyclo[3.2.1]o-ctane-3-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; (2R, 3R) 1-[4-(2-chloro-4-fluoro-ben- zyloxy)-benzenesulfonyl]-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-piperidine-2-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; 4-[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonylamino]-tetrahydro-py-ran-4-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; 3-[[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfon-yl]-(1-hydroxycarbamoyl-cyclobutyl)-amino]-propionic acid; 4-[4-(4-chloro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonylamino]-tetrahydro-pyran-4-carboxyl- is acid hydroxyamide; (R) 3-[4-(4-chloro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonylamino]-te-trahydro-pyran-3-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; (2R, 3R) 1-[4-(4-fluoro-2-methyl-benzyloxy)-benzenesulfonyl]-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-pi-peridine-2-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; 3-[[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenes-ulfonyl]-(1-hydroxycarbamoyl-1-methyl-ethyl)-amino]-propionic acid; 3-[[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonyl]-(4-hydroxycarbamoyl-tetrahydro-- pyran-4-yl)-amino]-propionic acid; 3-exo-3-[4-(4-chloro-phenoxy)-benzenesu- lfonylamino]-8-oxa-icyclo[3.2.1]octane-3-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; 3-endo-3-[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-benzenesulfonylamino]-8-oxa-icyclo[3.2.1 ]octane-3-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; and (R) 3-[4-(4-fluoro-phenoxy)-b-enzenesulfonylamino]-tetrahydro-furan-3-carboxylic acid hydroxyamide; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, derivatives, and other preparations of the compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSporadic mutations that inactivate the PETN gene product occur relatively frequently in most human cancers (Yamada et al., 2001, J Cell Sci 114:2375-82, Hill et al., 2002, Pharmacol Therapeut 93:243-51). Loss of PTEN causes the Akt phosphorylated state to persist through loss of the ability to down-regulate stimulatory signals originating from IGF-1R and other sources. The status of the p53 tumor suppressor also influences the activity of the IGF-1R signaling system. In the ground state, the basal or constitutive transcription of IGF-1R is repressed by p53 via an indirect mechanism. Activation of Akt promotes the phosphorylation of mdm2, which then binds the p53 tumor suppressor and promotes its degradation (Mayo et al., 2002, TIBS 27:462-67), resulting in increased IGF-1R expression. A similar outcome is observed when p53 is inactivated by mutation. When transiently expressed in Saos-2 (a human osteosarcoma cell line) and RD (a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line), wild-type p53 is able to suppress the activity of a cotransfected IGF-1R promoter construct, whereas tumor-derived, mutant versions of p53 have no effect. It has been proposed that the increased level of IGF-1R promotes the resistance to apoptosis associated with p53 loss in malignant cells (Werner et al., 2000, Cell Mol Life Sci 57:932-42). Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a cancerous condition in a subject in need of such treatment comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein, wherein the cancerous condition is characterized by cells that have a reduced expression or activity of p53.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe WT1 (Wilms \nkidney tumor suppressor\n 1 protein) also has been shown to bind and repress the IGF-1R promoter. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a cancerous condition in a subject in need of such treatment comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein wherein the cancerous condition is characterized by a reduced expression or activity of WT1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe proliferation of normal fibroblasts has been shown to require, under defined culture conditions, the combined action of IGF and a stromal growth factor (e.g. PDGF, EGF) to ramp-up Ras/Raf/Map Kinase and promote cell cycle entry (the G0 to G1 transition). Fibroblasts derived from IGF-1R (−/−) mice do not respond to growth factor alone, or most oncogenes (e.g. oncogenic Ras) that activate the Ras/Raf/Map Kinase pathway. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject in need of such treatment comprising administering to the subject an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein and an agent that targets a growth factor and/or a growth factor receptor, such as a growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, e.g., the EGFR, HER-2, bcr-abl, VEGFR, Kit, raf, mTOR, CDK1/2, VEGFR2, PKCβ, Mek, and/or KDR. Examples of molecules that target such growth factors and/or receptors include panitumumab (Abgenix, Fremont, Calif./Amgen, Thousand Oaks, Calif.), HERCEPTIN™ (Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif.), GLEEVEC™ (Novartis, East Hanover, N.J.), IRESSA™ (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, Del.), ERBITUX™, (ImClone, New York, N.Y.), AVASTIN™, (Genentech), PTK787 (Novartis), SU11248 (Pfizer, New York, N.Y.), TARCEVA™ (OSI Pharmaceuticals, Melville, N.Y.), 43-9006 (Bayer, West Haven, Conn.), CCI-779 (Wyeth, Madison, N.J.), RAD001 (Novartis), BMS-387032 (Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, N.Y.), IMC-1C11 (ImClone), LY333531 (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, Ind.), PD 184352 (Pfizer), 2C4 (Genentech), and GW2016 (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, N.C.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe role of IGF-1R in hematological malignancies has been reviewed by (Novak et al., 2003, Insulin-Like Growth Factors and Hematological Malignancies in Insulin-Like Growth Factors, LeRoith et al., ed.s, Landes Bioscience). A functional role for the IGF-1R in hematopoietic malignancies is demonstrated by, for example, the ability of IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies to block transformed cell growth in culture. IGF-I has been found to enhance growth of freshly isolated human acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia blasts. With respect to T cell malignancies, IGF-I has been shown to influence the growth of murine lymphoma cells bearing a pre-T cell phenotype and, immature and mature primary human T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells were found to express high numbers of IGF-1R. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides methods of treating a hematological malignancy in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an antagonist of IGF-1R as described herein. In another embodiment, the malignancy is an acute myelogenous leukemia, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or a T cell malignancy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides methods of identifying subjects who are more likely to benefit from treatment using the compositions and/or methods of treatment of the present invention. Such methods can enable a caregiver to better tailor a therapeutic regimen to a particular subject's needs and reduce the likelihood of an ineffective or counterproductive course of treatment. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of determining whether a subject is a candidate for treatment using a composition or method as described herein comprising determining whether a target cell type in the subject expresses IGF-1R, wherein if the target cell type expresses IGF-1R, then the subject is a candidate for treatment. In another embodiment, the method comprises determining the approximate average number of IGF-1R molecules per target cell, wherein 10\n2\n, 10\n3\n, 10\n4\n, 10\n5\n, or 10\n6 \nIGF-1R per cell indicates that the subject is a cadidate for treatment. The approximate average number of IGF-1R molecules per target cell can be determined using any technique known in the art, for example, by staining a sample comprising cells of the target cell type with an IGF-1R binding molecule, and detecting the amount of IGF-1R binding molecule bound to the sample, where the amount of IGF-1R binding molecule detected is proportional to the average number of IGF-1R molecules in the sample. In another embodiment, the method comprises comparing the approximate average number of IGF-1R molecules per target cell to a reference standard, wherein if the approximate average number of IGF-1R molecules per target cell is greater than the reference standard, then the subject is more likely to benefit from treatment using the compositions and/or methods of treatment of the present invention. In another embodiment, the target cell type is a cancerous cell type. In another embodiment, the target cell type is a colon cancer cell type, a breast cancer cell type, an NSCLC cell type, or a leukemic cell type.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a subject who is a candidate for treatment is identified by detecting IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 in the target cell type, or in the stratum of the target cell type. In another embodiment, the target cell type is a cancerous cell type. In another embodiment, the target cell type is a colon cancer cell type, a breast cancer cell type, an NSCLC cell type, or a leukemic cell type.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a subject who is a candidate for treatment is identified by detecting activity of IGF-1R-mediated signaling in the target cell type, wherein IGF-1R-mediated signaling in the target cell type indicates that the subject is a candidate for treatment. Examples of molecules that can be monitored for IGF-1R-dependent changes are shown in \nFIG. 10\n, such as molecules in the PI3/Akt pathway, e.g., IGF-1R, IRS adapters, Akt, etc. Such molecules can be monitored for, for example, a change in phosphorylation status, e.g., an increase in phosphorylation. Phosphospecific antibodies that recognize the activated forms of these protein markers are highly developed, and these reagents have proven to be reliable for immunoblot detection in experimental systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions and/or methods of the present invention also can be used, for example, in cosmetic treatments, in veterinary treatments, to increase longevity, to treat reproductive defects, and to treat a variety of growth related disorders.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Methods and Administration of Antigen Binding Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nCertain methods provided herein comprise administering an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein to a subject, thereby reducing an IGF-1-induced biological response that plays a role in a particular condition. In particular embodiments, methods of the invention involve contacting endogenous IGF-1R with an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein, e.g., via administration to a subject or in an ex vivo procedure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “treatment” encompasses alleviation or prevention of at least one symptom or other aspect of a disorder, or reduction of disease severity, and the like. An antigen binding protein need not effect a complete cure, or eradicate every symptom or manifestation of a disease, to constitute a viable therapeutic agent. As is recognized in the pertinent field, drugs employed as therapeutic agents may reduce the severity of a given disease state, but need not abolish every manifestation of the disease to be regarded as useful therapeutic agents. Similarly, a prophylactically administered treatment need not be completely effective in preventing the onset of a condition in order to constitute a viable prophylactic agent. Simply reducing the impact of a disease (for example, by reducing the number or severity of its symptoms, or by increasing the effectiveness of another treatment, or by producing another beneficial effect), or reducing the likelihood that the disease will occur or worsen in a subject, is sufficient. One embodiment of the invention is directed to a method comprising administering to a patient an IGF-1R antagonist in an amount and for a time sufficient to induce a sustained improvement over baseline of an indicator that reflects the severity of the particular disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is understood in the pertinent field, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the molecules of the invention are administered to a subject in a manner appropriate to the indication. Pharmaceutical compositions may be administered by any suitable technique, including but not limited to parenterally, topically, or by inhalation. If injected, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered, for example, via intra-articular, intravenous, intramuscular, intralesional, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous routes, by bolus injection, or continuous infusion. Localized administration, e.g. at a site of disease or injury is contemplated, as are transdermal delivery and sustained release from implants. Delivery by inhalation includes, for example, nasal or oral inhalation, use of a nebulizer, inhalation of the antagonist in aerosol form, and the like. Other alternatives include eyedrops; oral preparations including pills, syrups, lozenges or chewing gum; and topical preparations such as lotions, gels, sprays, and ointments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUse of antigen binding proteins in ex vivo procedures also is contemplated. For example, a patient's blood or other bodily fluid may be contacted with an antigen binding protein that binds IGF-1R ex vivo. The antigen binding protein may be bound to a suitable insoluble matrix or solid support material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdvantageously, antigen binding proteins are administered in the form of a composition comprising one or more additional components such as a physiologically acceptable carrier, excipient or diluent. Optionally, the composition additionally comprises one or more physiologically active agents, for example, a second IGF-1 receptor-inhibiting substance, an anti-angiogenic substance, a chemotherapeutic substance, an analgesic substance, etc., non-exclusive examples of which are provided herein. In various particular embodiments, the composition comprises one, two, three, four, five, or six physiologically active agents in addition to an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprise an antigen binding protein of the invention together with one or more substances selected from the group consisting of a buffer, an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid, a low molecular weight polypeptide (such as those having fewer than 10 amino acids), a protein, an amino acid, a carbohydrate such as glucose, sucrose or dextrins, a chelating agent such as EDTA, glutathione, a stabilizer, and an excipient. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with conspecific serum albumin are examples of appropriate diluents. In accordance with appropriate industry standards, preservatives such as benzyl alcohol may also be added. The composition may be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipient solutions (e.g., sucrose) as diluents. Suitable components are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. Further examples of components that may be employed in pharmaceutical formulations are presented in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16\nth \nEd. (1980) and 20\nth \nEd. (2000), Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKits for use by medical practitioners include an IGF-1 receptor-inhibiting substance of the invention and a label or other instructions for use in treating any of the conditions discussed herein. In one embodiment, the kit includes a sterile preparation of one or more IGF-1R binding antigen binding proteins, which may be in the form of a composition as disclosed above, and may be in one or more vials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosages and the frequency of administration may vary according to such factors as the route of administration, the particular antigen binding proteins employed, the nature and severity of the disease to be treated, whether the condition is acute or chronic, and the size and general condition of the subject. Appropriate dosages can be determined by procedures known in the pertinent art, e.g. in clinical trials that may involve dose escalation studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn IGF-1 receptor inhibiting substance of the invention may be administered, for example, once or more than once, e.g., at regular intervals over a period of time. In particular embodiments, an antigen binding protein is administered over a period of at least a month or more, e.g., for one, two, or three months or even indefinitely. For treating chronic conditions, long-term treatment is generally most effective. However, for treating acute conditions, administration for shorter periods, e.g. from one to six weeks, may be sufficient. In general, the antigen binding protein is administered until the patient manifests a medically relevant degree of improvement over baseline for the chosen indicator or indicators.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticular embodiments of the present invention involve administering an antigen binding protein at a dosage of from about 1 ng of antigen binding protein per kg of subject's weight per day (“1 ng/kg/day”) to about 10 mg/kg/day, more preferably from about 500 ng/kg/day to about 5 mg/kg/day, and most preferably from about 5 μg/kg/day to about 2 mg/kg/day, to a subject. In additional embodiments, an antigen binding protein is administered to adults one time per week, two times per week, or three or more times per week, to treat an IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 mediated disease, condition or disorder, e.g., a medical disorder disclosed herein. If injected, the effective amount of antigen binding protein per adult dose may range from 1-20 mg/m\n2\n, and preferably is about 5-12 mg/m\n2\n. Alternatively, a flat dose may be administered; the amount may range from 5-100 mg/dose. One range for a flat dose is about 20-30 mg per dose. In one embodiment of the invention, a flat dose of 25 mg/dose is repeatedly administered by injection. If a route of administration other than injection is used, the dose is appropriately adjusted in accordance with standard medical practices. One example of a therapeutic regimen involves injecting a dose of about 20-30 mg of antigen binding protein to one to three times per week over a period of at least three weeks, though treatment for longer periods may be necessary to induce the desired degree of improvement. For pediatric subjects (age 4-17), one exemplary suitable regimen involves the subcutaneous injection of 0.4 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 25 mg of antigen binding protein administered two or three times per week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticular embodiments of the methods provided herein involve subcutaneous injection of from 0.5 mg to 10 mg, preferably from 3 to 5 mg, of an antigen binding protein, once or twice per week. Another embodiment is directed to pulmonary administration (e.g., by nebulizer) of 3 or more mg of antigen binding protein once a week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of therapeutic regimens provided herein comprise subcutaneous injection of an antigen binding protein once a week, at a dose of 1.5 to 3 mg, to treat a condition in which IGF-1R signaling plays a role. Examples of such conditions are provided herein and include, for example, cancer, acromegaly and other overgrowth disorders, diabetes, obesity, macular degeneration, and aging. Weekly administration of antigen binding protein is continued until a desired result is achieved, e.g., the subject's symptoms subside. Treatment may resume as needed, or, alternatively, maintenance doses may be administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther examples of therapeutic regimens provided herein comprise subcutaneous or intravenous administration of a dose of 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, or 20 milligrams of an IGF-1R inhibitor of the present invention per kilogram body mass of the subject (mg/kg). The dose can be administered once to the subject, or more than once at a certain interval, for example, once a day, three times a week, twice a week, once a week, three times a month, twice a month, once a month, once every two months, once every three months, once every six months, or once a year. The duration of the treatment, and any changes to the dose and/or frequency of treatment, can be altered or varied during the course of treatment in order to meet the particular needs of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, an antigen binding protein is administered to the subject in an amount and for a time sufficient to induce an improvement, preferably a sustained improvement, in at least one indicator that reflects the severity of the disorder that is being treated. Various indicators that reflect the extent of the subject's illness, disease or condition may be assessed for determining whether the amount and time of the treatment is sufficient. Such indicators include, for example, clinically recognized indicators of disease severity, symptoms, or manifestations of the disorder in question. In one embodiment, an improvement is considered to be sustained if the subject exhibits the improvement on at least two occasions separated by two to four weeks. The degree of improvement generally is determined by a physician, who may make this determination based on signs, symptoms, biopsies, or other test results, and who may also employ questionnaires that are administered to the subject, such as quality-of-life questionnaires developed for a given disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElevated levels of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 are associated with a number of disorders, including, for example, cancer (e.g., lung, prostate, breast and colon cancers), and acromegaly and other overgrowth disorders (e.g., constitutionally tall children). Subjects with a given disorder may be screened, to identify those individuals who have elevated IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels, thereby identifying the subjects who may benefit most from treatment with an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein. Thus, treatment methods provided herein optionally comprise a first step of measuring a subject's IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels. An antigen binding protein may be administered to a subject in whom IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels are elevated above normal. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating an overgrowth disorder (e.g., acromegaly) comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an antigen binding protein of the present invention and pegvisomant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA subject's levels of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 may be monitored before, during and/or after treatment with an antigen binding protein, to detect changes, if any, in their levels. For some disorders, the incidence of elevated IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels may vary according to such factors as the stage of the disease or the particular form of the disease. Known techniques may be employed for measuring IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels, e.g., in a subject's serum. IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 levels in blood samples may be measured using any suitable technique, for example, ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticular embodiments of methods and compositions of the invention involve the use of an antigen binding protein and one or more additional IGF-1R antagonists, for example, two or more antigen binding proteins of the invention, or an antigen binding protein of the invention and one or more other IGF-1R antagonists. In further embodiments, antigen binding protein are administered alone or in combination with other agents useful for treating the condition with which the patient is afflicted. Examples of such agents include both proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous drugs. When multiple therapeutics are co-administered, dosages may be adjusted accordingly, as is recognized in the pertinent art. “Co-administration” and combination therapy are not limited to simultaneous administration, but also include treatment regimens in which an antigen binding protein is administered at least once during a course of treatment that involves administering at least one other therapeutic agent to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of other agents that may be co-administered with an antigen binding protein are other antigen binding proteins or therapeutic polypeptides that are chosen according to the particular condition to be treated. Alternatively, non-proteinaceous drugs that are useful in treating one of the particular conditions discussed above may be co-administered with an IGF-1R antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombination Therapy\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject with an IGF-1R inhibiting antigen binding protein and one or more other treatments. In one embodiment, such a combination therapy achieves synergy or an additive effect by, for example, attacking multiple sites or molecular targets in a tumor. Types of combination therapies that can be used in connection with the present invention include inhibiting or activating (as appropriate) multiple nodes in a single disease-related pathway, multiple pathways in a target cell, and multiple cell types within a target tissue (e.g., within a tumor). For example, an IGF-1R inhibitor of the present invention can be combined with a treatment that inhibits IGF-1, promotes apoptosis, inhibits angiogenesis, or inhibits macrophage. In another embodiment, a targeted agent, that, when used by itself, fails to elicit a therapeutically desired effect, could be used to, for example, sensitize cancer cells or augment treatment effect of other agents. In another embodiment, an IGF-1R inhibitor according to the invention is used in combination with a cytotoxic drug or other targeted agent that induces apoptosis. In another embodiment, an IGF-1R inhibitor is used in combination with one or more agents that inhibit different targets that are involved in cell survival (e.g., PKB, mTOR), different receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., ErbB1, ErbB2, c-Met, c-kit), or different cell types (e.g., KDR inhibitors, c-fms). In another embodiment, an IGF-1R inhibitor of the invention is added to the existing standard of care for a particular condition. Examples of therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, gemcitabine, taxol, taxotere, and CPT-11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a combination therapy method comprises administering to the subject two, three, four, five, six, or more of the IGF-1R agonists or antagonists described herein. In another embodiment, the method comprises administering to the subject two or more treatments that together inhibit or activate (directly or indirectly) IGF-1R-mediated signal transduction. Examples of such methods include using combinations of two or more IGF-1R inhibiting antigen binding progeins, of an IGF-1R inhibiting antigen binding protein and one or more other IGF-1, IGF-2, and/or IGF-1R agonists or antagonists (e.g., IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 binding polypeptides, IGF-1R binding polypeptides, IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 derivatives, anti-IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 antibodies, anti-sense nucleic acids against IGF-1, IGF-2, and/or IGF-1R, or other molecules that bind to IGF-1, IGF-2, and/or IGF-1R polypeptides or nucleic acids), or of an IGF-1R inhibiting antigen binding protein and one or more other treatments (e.g., surgery, ultrasound, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or treatment with another anti-cancer agent), as described, for example, in U.S. Pat.

Furthermore, one or more anti-IGF-1R antibodies or antibody derivatives can be used in combination with one or more molecules or other treatments, wherein the other molecule(s) and/or treatment(s) do not directly bind to or affect IGF-1R, IGF-1, or IGF-2, but which combination is effective for treating or preventing a condition, such as cancer or an overgrowth disorder (e.g., acromegaly). In one embodiment, one or more of the molecule(s) and/or treatment(s) treats or prevents a condition that is caused by one or more of the other molecule(s) or treatment(s) in the course of therapy, e.g., nausea, fatigue, alopecia, cachexia, insomnia, etc. In every case where a combination of molecules and/or other treatments is used, the individual molecule(s) and/or treatment(s) can be administered in any order, over any length of time, which is effective, e.g., simultaneously, consecutively, or alternately. In one embodiment, the method of treatment comprises completing a first course of treatment with one molecule or other treatment before beginning a second course of treatment. The length of time between the end of the first course of treatment and beginning of the second course of treatment can be any length of time that allows the total course of therapy to be effective, e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or even years.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the method comprises administering one or more of the IGF-1R antagonists described herein and one or more other treatments (e.g., a therapeutic or palliative treatment), for example, anti-cancer treatments (such as surgery, ultrasound, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or treatment with another anti-cancer agent). Where a method comprises administering more than one treatment to a subject, it is to be understood that the order, timing, number, concentration, and volume of the administrations is limited only by the medical requirements and limitations of the treatment, i.e., two treatments can be administered to the subject, e.g., simultaneously, consecutively, alternately, or according to any other regimen. Examples of agents that can be administered in combination with the IGF-1R antagonists described herein include, but are not limited to, neutrophil-boosting agents, irinothecan, SN-38, gemcitabine, herstatin, or an IGF-1R-binding herstatin derivative (as described, for example, in U.S. patent Application Ser. No. 05/0272637), AVASTIN® (Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif.), HERCEPTIN® (Genentech), RITUXAN® (Genentech), ARIMIDEX® (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, Del.), IRESSA® (AstraZeneca), BEXXAR® (Corixa, Seattle, Wash.), ZEVALIN® (Biogen Idec, Cambridge, Mass.), ERBITUX® (Imclone Systems Inc., New York, N.Y.), GEMZAR® (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, Ind.), CAMPTOSAR® (Pfizer, New York, N.Y.), GLEEVEC® (Novartis), SU-11248 (Pfizer), BMS-354825 (Bristol-Myers Squibb), panitumumab (Abgenix, Fremont, Calif./Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif.), and denosumab (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples, both actual and prophetic, are provided for the purpose of illustrating specific embodiments or features of the instant invention and do not limit its scope.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nPREPARATION OF ANTIBODIES\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example demonstrates a method of preparing antibodies recognizing the IGF-1 receptor. IGF-1 receptor polypeptides may be employed as immunogens in generating monoclonal antibodies by conventional techniques. It is recognized that polypeptides in various forms may be employed as immunogens, e.g., full length proteins, fragments thereof, fusion proteins thereof such as Fc fusions, cells expressing the recombinant protein on the cell surface, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo summarize an example of such a procedure, an IGF-1R immunogen emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant is injected subcutaneously into Lewis rats, in amounts ranging from 10-1004 Three weeks later, the immunized animals are boosted with additional immunogen emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and boosted every three weeks thereafter. Serum samples are periodically taken by retro-orbital bleeding or tail-tip excision for testing by dot-blot assay, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), or inhibition of binding of \n125\nI-IGF-1 or \n125\nI-IGF-2 to extracts of IGF-1R-expressing cells. Following detection an appropriate antibody titer, positive animals are given a final intravenous injection of antigen in saline. Three to four days later, the animals are sacrificed, splenocytes harvested, and fused to the murine myeloma cell line AG8653. The resulting hybridoma cell lines are plated in multiple microtiter plates in a HAT selective medium (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine) to inhibit proliferation of non-fused cells, myeloma hybrids, and spleen cell hybrids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHybridoma clones thus generated are screened for reactivity with IGF-1R. Initial screening of hybridoma supernatants utilizes an antibody capture and binding of partially purified \n125\nI-IGF-1 receptor. Hybridomas that are positive in this screening method are tested by a modified antibody capture to detect hybridoma cells lines that are producing blocking antibody. Hybridomas that secrete a monoclonal antibody capable of inhibiting \n125\nI-IGF-1 binding to cells expressing IGF-1R are thus detected. Such hydridomas then are injected into the peritoneal cavities of nude mice to produce ascites containing high concentrations (>1 mg/ml) of anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody. The resulting monoclonal antibodies may be purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel exclusion chromatography, and/or affinity chromatography based on binding of antibody to Protein G.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar methods can be used to generate human antibodies in transgenic mice.

The primers included a Kozak translation initiation sequence (underlined above) preceding the start codon, restriction sites for subsequent subcloning, and a caspace-3 site, which is inserted next to the extracellular domain C-terminus. PCR was performed on a PerkinElmer 2400 (PerkinElmer, Torrance, Calif.) under the following conditions: 1 cycle at 95° C. for 2 min, 23 cycles at 95° C. for 30 sec, 58.5° C. for 30 sec, and 72° C., for 3 min, and 1 cycle at 72° C. for 10 min. Final reaction conditions were 1× pfu TURBO® buffer (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.), 200 μM dNTPs, 2 μM each primer, 5 U pfu TURBO® (Stratagene) and 1 ng template DNA. The PCR product was purified using a Clontech Nucleospin Column (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.) according to the manufacturers instructions, digested with Hind III and Sal I (Roche, Indianapolis, Ind.) and gel purified. The human IGF-1R insert was ligated into Hind III/Sal I digested pDSRα-muIgG1. Integrity of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The sequence of the protein encoded by the resulting open reading frame (IGF-1R-C3-muFc) is shown in \nFIG. 10\n.

pDSRα:huIGF1R(ECD)-C3-muIgG1Fc was transfected into AM-1/D CHOd- cells using LT1 lipofection reagent (PanVera Corp., Madison, Wis.), and cells cultured under conditions to allow expression and secretion of protein into the cell media. Twenty-four colonies were selected after 10-14 days on DHFR selection medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 1× penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen)) and expression levels evaluated by western blot. To perform this assay, 0.5 ml of serum free medium was added to a single well confluent cells cultured in a 24 well plate (Falcon). The conditioned medium was recovered after 48 hr. Samples for western blotting were run in 10% Tris-glycine gel (Novex), and blotted on 0.45 μm Nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen), using the Mini Trans-Blot cell (Biorad). The blotted membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG Fc antibody, conjugated with Horseradish Peroxidase (Pierce). The clone expressing the highest level of IGF-1R(ECD)-C3-muIgG1Fc was expanded in DHFR selection medium and 2×10\n7 \ncells were inoculated into 50 roller bottles each (Corning) in 250 ml of high-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen), 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen), 1× glutamine (Invitrogen), 1× Non essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1× sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Medium was gassed with 10% CO\n2\n/balance air for 5 seconds before capping the roller bottle. Roller bottles were kept at 37° C. on roller racks spinning at 0.75 rpm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen cells reached approximately 85-90% confluency (after approximately 5-6 days in culture), growth medium was discarded, cells washed with 100 ml PBS and 200 ml production medium was added (50% DMEM (Invitrogen)/50% F12 (Invitrogen), 1× glutamine (Invitrogen), 1× non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1× sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1.5% DMSO (Sigma)). The conditioned medium was harvested and replaced at one week intervals. The resulting 30 liters of conditioned medium were filtered through a 0.45 μm cellulose acetate filter (Corning, Acton, Mass.).\n\n\n \n \nPurification of hu IGF-1R(ECD)-C3-muIgG1Fc\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting filtrate from the conditioned medium was concentrated 20-fold using a spiral-wound cartridge (molecular weight cut-off=10 kDa), then diluted 1:1 with 3 M KCl, 1 M glycine, pH 9.0 to bring the final salt concentration to 1.5 M KCl, 0.5 M glycine, pH 9.0. This sample was applied to a rProtein A-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) which had been equilibrated in 1.5 M KCl, 0.5 M glycine, pH 9.0. The column was washed with 40 column volumes of the same buffer, then eluted with 20 column volumes of 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.8. Five-mL fractions were collected and immediately neutralized with 1 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Fractions containing huIGF1R(ECD)-C3-muIgGFc were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. The yield was 2.4 mg/L of conditioned medium. The major protein species detected were the mature a and 3 chains and murine Fc, each of which appeared to be properly glycosylated based on their elevated and heterogeneous molecular weights. Unprocessed IGF-1R(ECD), as well as glycosylated but not proteolytically cleaved IGF-1R(CED), was also present in the preparation. The shift in bands to higher molecular weights under non-reducing conditions indicates that disulfide linkages joined the a and 3 chains Amino-terminal sequencing of the final product indicated that 60% of the protein was correctly processed between the α- and β-chains of IGF-1R(ECD), while 40% remained unprocessed.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\nISOLATIION OF HUMAN INSR(ECD)-muIgG\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example presents a method of cloning and expressing a soluble fragment of the human insulin receptor.\n\n\n \n \nCloning of pDSRα:huINSR(ECD)-muIgG1Fc\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimers 2830-40:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 259\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′ \nAGC\nAAGCTT\nCCACCATGGGCACCGGGGGCCGG\n 3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(Hind III site underlined) and 2830-41:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO: 260\n \n \n \n \n \n5′ \nATTT\nGTCGAC\nTTTTGCAATATTTGACGGGACGTCTAA\n 3′\n \n \n \n \n \n\n(Sal I site underlined) were used to amplify the human INSR extracellular domain (1-929) from and INSR parental plamid encoding the B form of the INSR splice variant (Ullrich et al., 1985, Nature 313:756-61; Ebina et al., 1985, Cell 40:747-58). The primers included a Kozak translation initiation sequence preceding the start codon and restriction sites for subsequent sub-cloning. PCR was performed on a PerkinElmer 2400 under the following conditions: 1 cycle at 95° C. for 2 min, 32 cycles at 95° C. for 30 sec, 58.5° C. for 30 sec, and 72° C. for 3 min, and 1 cycle at 72° C. for 10 min. Final reaction conditions were 1× pfu TURBO® buffer, 200 μM dNTPs, 2 μM each primer, 5 U pfu TURBO® (Stratagene) and 10 ng template DNA. The PCR product was purified using a NUCLEOSPIN® Column (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, digested with Hind III and Sal I (Roche), and gel purified prior to ligation into Hind III/Sal I digested pDSRα-muIgG1. The integrity of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The protein sequence of the INSR-muFc is shown in \nFIG. 11\n.

The source, screening methods, and characterization of the library have been published (de Haard et al, 1999, J Biol Chem 274:18218-30). Dynabeads (200 μl) M-450 Uncoated (catalog #140.02, Dynal, Lake Success, N.Y.) were washed 3 times with PBS, resuspended in 200 μl of IGF1R(ECD)-C3-mFc to a concentration of 0.5 μM in PBS, and incubated at 4° C. on a rotator overnight. The IGF-1R(ECD)-C3-mFc coated beads were washed 3× with 1 ml of 2% non-fat dry milk (M) in PBS (2% MPBS), and then blocked with 1 ml of 2% MPBS at room temperature for 1 hour. In parallel, 750 μl of the TQ library (4×10\n12 \npfu) was preblocked by mixing with 250 \nμl\n 8% MPBS at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. 500 μl of blocked beads were transferred into another microfuge tube and separated from the blocking solution on a magnetic separator. The preblocked phage mixture was added to the blocked beads and incubated for 90 minutes on a rotator at room temperature. Bead-bound phage were separated from the unbound phage, and then washed 6× with \nlml\n 2% MPBS/0.1\n \n% Tween\n \n 20, 6× with lml PBS/0.1\n \n% Tween\n \n 20, 2× with PBS with a change of tubes between different wash solutions. Bound phage was eluted with 1 ml of 0.1M TEA (pH11) for 10 minutes, then immediately separated from the beads and neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1 M Tris.HCl. The eluted phage pool was mixed with 4 \nml\n 2× YT broth (10 g yeast extract, 16 g bacto-tryptone, 5 g NaCl per liter of water) and 5 ml of TG1 bacterial culture (O.D.\n590 \nabout 0.5) in a 50-ml conical tube. The infection mixture was incubate at 37° C. in an incubator for 30 min., then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 20 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1500 \nμl\n 2×YT-CG broth and 300 μl were spread on each of five 2×YT-CG (2× YT broth containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 2% glucose) plates. After 20 hours of incubation at 30° C., 4 ml of 2× YT-AG were added to each plate and the cells were recovered with cell scraper from the plates. This step was repeated three times. A small portion of the recovered cells was used for phage rescue (see below). The remaining cell suspension was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 20 min. The cell pellet was suspended into an amount of 50% glycerol roughly half the volume of the pellet size and stored at −80° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to rescue phage, the plated-amplified cell suspension was used to inoculate 40 ml of 2×YT-CG to an OD\n590 \nof about 0.05. The culture was incubated at 37° C. on a shaker to OD\n590 \n0.5. The log phase culture was infected with M13KO7 helper phage (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, Md., catalog #18311-019, 1.1×\n10\n \n11 \npfu/ml) at M.O.I. 20 followed by incubation at 37° C. for 30 min. The infected cells were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min. The cell pellet was re-suspended in 200 ml of 2×YT-CK (100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 40 μg/ml kanamycin) and transferred to two 250-ml flasks and incubated at 30° C. with shaking at 270 rpm for 20 hours. The over-night culture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min to removal cell debris. The centrifugation was repeated to ensure the removal of cell debris. About ⅕ volume of PEG solution (20% PEG 8000, 2.5 M NaCl) was added to the supernatant to precipitate the phage particles. The mixture was incubated on ice for at least 1 hour, followed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min to collect the precipitated phage particles. The phage pellet was re-suspended into 1 ml of PBS and transferred to a microfuge tube. The phage suspension was left on ice for 1 hour to allow complete suspension of phage particles, and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min to remove the residual cell debris. Phage precipitation step was repeated. The final phage pellet was suspended into PBS after clarification. The rescued phage suspension was used in the next round of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour rounds of selection were performed that included alterations of various standard binding parameters. The second round of selection was identical to the first round of selection. Variations in input phage number and elution reagent were introduced in rounds three and four. For the round three selection, 5×10\n11 \npfu of phages were selected and bound phages were eluted either with 1 μM IGF-1 (catalog #I3769, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) or with a 1 μM concentration of a chimeric cdR3-huFc antibody to yield two round-three pools, TQ4-3IS and TQ4-3CA. Round four selection was carried out on rescued phage pools from both round three pools. Two rounds of negative selection with mouse IgG Fc-coated DYNABEADS® (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway) were included to remove mouse Fc binders prior to actual IGF-1R selection. The incubation time for negative selection was 30 minutes each. 3.78×10\n11 \npfu of TQ4-3IS pool and 3.75×10\n12 \npfu of TQ4-3CA pool were selected separately. Bound phage were eluted with 1 μM IGF-2 (catalog #I2526, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) to yield two round-4 pools, TQ4-41512 and TQ4-4CAI2. The sequence of about 96-192 phage DNA inserts was determined at each elution step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, a secondary screen was done. Phagemid DNA mixtures of the total TQ library, and the selected phage amplified after several rounds of selection against IGF-1R, were prepared using a DNA Maxiprep kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.). All four DNA preparations were digested with Asc I and EcoR I (New England Biolab, Beverly, Mass.). The resulting two Asc I/EcoR I fragments were separated on preparative 0.5% agarose gels. The 2.1 kb fragments containing heavy chains were gel purified from the IGF-1R selected phage. The 3.9 kb fragments containing the light chains and pCES1 vector portion were gel purified from the total TQ library DNA. The 2.1 kb fragments were ligated to the 3.9 kb fragments from the DNA sample of TQ library in 3:1 ratio. The ligated DNA was precipitated and used to transform TG1 cells by electroporation. The library size of the resulted light chain shuffled secondary library was 8.8×10\n8\n. After sequencing 96 randomly picked clones, 76 unique light chain sequences were obtained, indicating that the attempt to shuffle light chains was successful.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding, washing and elution condition for screening the light chain shuffle library were essentially the same as decribed for the intial screen. However, several variations were included to increase selection pressure for amplification of IGF-1R binders with higher affinities, especially those with significantly slower off-rates. These parameters were: higher number of input phage (2-2.7×10\n13 \npfu), smaller bead volume (100 μl for round one, 50 μl for round two, and 25 μl for round three), and extended specific elution time up to 20 hours. Elution buffers were 0.1 M TEA for round one (RD1), 1 μM IGF-1 in 0.4% MPBS for RD2 and 1 μM IGF-1 or IGF-2 in 0.4% MPBS for RD3. In RD2 and RD3, binders that were eluted in 15 min or 2 hours were discarded. Elution was continued and eluted phages were collected after 8-10 hours and again after 20 hours.\n\n\n \nPhage Fab ELISA Screen\n\n\n \n \n \nIn 96-well 2-ml deep-well blocks, 480 μl/well 2×YT-CG broth was inoculated with 20 μl of overnight cultures of the individual clones, then incubated at 37° C., 300 rpm for 3 hours. To each well, 50 μl of 1:3 diluted M13KO7 helper phage were added to infect the cells. The block was incubated at 37° C. without shaking for 30 minutes, and then shaken gently for another 30 minutes at 150 rpm. The block was centrifuged at 3600 rpm for 20 minutes to pellet the infected cells. The cell pellet in each well was suspended into 480 μl of 2×YT-CK (2×YT broth containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 40 μg/ml kanamycin), and incubated at 30° C. overnight for about 20 hours. The cell debris was separated by centrifugation at 3600 rpm for 20 minutes. The rescued phage supernatant was used in the phage ELISA to check for IGF-1R-specific, INSR-cross reactive, or mouse Fc binding of individual clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree sets of Nunc MaxiSorb Immunoplates were coated with 100 μ/well of IGF-1R-C3-mFc at 5 μg/ml, INSR-mFc at 5 μg/ml, or mouse IgG1 (catalog #010-0103, Rockland, Gilbertsville, Pa.) at 2 μg/ml in PBS, respectively, at 4° C. overnight. The coated plates were washed 3× with 300 μg/well of PBS. The washed plates were blocked with 300 μl/well 2% MPBS at room temperature for one hour. Meanwhile, rescued phages of individual clones were pre-blocked by mixing 170 μof rescued phage with 170 μl of 4% MPBS. The blocked plates were washed 5× with 300 μl/well TBST (TBS: 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl; Tween-20. 0.1%). 100 μl/well of pre-blocked phage dilutions were distributed to each set of coated plate, which were incubated at room temperature on a rocker for 90 minutes. The plates were washed 5× with 300 μl/well TBST. 100 μl/well of anti-M13-HRP in 2% MPBS (1:3000 dilution, catalog number 27-9421-01, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were distributed, and plates were incubated at room temperature on rocker for one hour. The plates were washed 5× with 300 μl/well TBST. 100 μl/well of the substrate 1-Step™ ABTS (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Ill., catalog number 37615) were added. Plates were incubated for one hour. OD\n405 \nwas measured for signal detection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phage displayed antibodies exhibited essentially no crossreactivity with the insulin receptor and murine Fc domain. The signal observed in the IGF-1R ELISA is therefore specific for the IGF-1R extracellular domain. Results from similar assays for four of the phage-displayed antibodies are shown in \nFIG. 14\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA inserts of IGF-1R positive, INSR and mu IgG1 negative, clones were sequenced. Fifty-two unique Fab sequences were identified, having the following combinations of light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequences: L1H1, L2H2, L3H3, L4H4, L5H5, L6H6, L7H7, L8H8, L9H9, L10H10, L11H11, L12H12, L13H13, L14H14, L15H15, L16H16, L17H17, L18H18, L19H19, L20H20, L21H21, L22H22, L23H23, L24H24, L25H25, L26H26, L27H27, L28H28, L29H29, L30H30, L31H31, L32H32, L33H33, L34H34, L35H35, L36H36, L37H37, L38H38, L39H39, L40H40, L41H41, L42H42, L43H43, L44H44, L45H45, L46H46, L47H47, L48H48, L49H49, L50HSO, L51H51, and L52H52, wherein “Lx” indicates light chain variable domain number “x” and “Hx” indicates heavy chain variable domain number “x.” \nFIG. 1\n presents the polynucleotide sequences of each of these light and heavy variable domains. \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n present the corresponding amino acid sequences.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nSUBCLOSING OF V\nH \nand V\nL \nINTO IgG1 EXPRESSION VECTORS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example presents a method of subcloning the previously identified variable domain sequences into an IgG1 expression vector.\n\n\n \n \nConstruction of DSRα20 and DSRα20:hIG1C\nH \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pDSRα20:hIgG1C\nH \nexpression vector (WO 90/14363) was a derivative of pDSR19:hIgG1C\nH \n(see U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/370,407, filed Apr. 5, 2002, “Human Anti-OPGL Neutralizing Antibodies As Selective OPGL Pathway Inhibitors,” incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The pDSRα19:hIgG1C\nH \nplasmid encoded a rat variable region/human constant region IgG1 (rVh/hCh1). The plasmid was constructed by the three-piece ligation of Xba I and BsmB I terminated rat antibody variable region PCR product, the human IgG1 constant region (C\nH1\n, hinge, C\nH2 \nand C\nH3 \ndomains) derived by Sal I cleavage and gel isolation of the BsmB I and Sal I fragment from the linear plasmid pDSRα19:hIgG1C\nH \n(Hind III and BsmB I ends) and a linearized pDSRα19 with Xba I and Sal I ends. pDSRα20 was produced by changing nucleotide 2563 in pDSRα19 from a guanosine to an adenosine by site directed mutagenesis. The heavy chain expression vector, pDSRα20:hIgG1C\nH \nrat variable region/human constant region IgG1 (rVh/hCh1), is 6163 base pairs and contains the 7 functional regions described in Table 3.\n\n\n

All transfections were performed as 250 mL cultures. Briefly, 1.25×10\n8 \ncells (5.0×10\n5 \ncells/mL×250 mL) were centrifuged at 2,500 RPM for 10 minutes at 4° C. to remove the conditioned medium. The cells were resuspended in serum-free DMEM and centrifuged again at 2,500 RPM for 10 minutes at 4° C. After aspirating the wash solution, the cells were resuspended in growth medium [DMEM/F12 (3:1) +1× Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium Supplement+1× Pen Strep Glut+2 mM L-Glutamine+20 mM HEPES+0.01% Pluronic F68] in a 500 mL spinner flask culture. The spinner flask culture was maintained on magnetic stir plate at 125 RPM which was placed in a humidified incubator maintained at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. The plasmid DNA was incubated with the transfection reagent in a 50 mL conical tube. The DNA-transfection reagent complex was prepared in 5% of the final culture volume in serum-free DMEM. One microgram of plasmid DNA per milliliter of culture was first added to serum-free DMEM, followed by 1 μl X-TremeGene RO-1539/mL culture. The complexes were incubated at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes and then added to the cells in the spinner flask. The transfection/expression was performed for 7 days, after which the conditioned medium was harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 RPM for 60 minutes at 4° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the initial transfection failed to yield the required 100 μg purified antibody, those clones were re-expressed in roller bottles. These transfections used 293T adherent cells grown and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS+1× Non-Essential Amino Acids+1× Pen Strep Glut+1× Sodium Pyruvate. Approximately, 4-5×10\n7 \n293T cells were seeded in a 850 cm\n2 \nroller bottles overnight. The previously seeded cells were then transfected the following day using \nFUGENE™\n 6 transfection reagent. The DNA—transfection reagent mixture was prepared in approximately in 6.75 mL serum-free DMEM. 675 \nμl FUGENE™\n 6 transfection reagent was first added, followed by 112.5 μg plasmid DNA. The complex was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The entire mixture was then added to a roller bottle. The roller bottle was infused with a 5% CO\n2 \ngas mixture, capped tightly and placed in a 37° C. incubator on a roller rack rotating at 0.35 RPM. The transfection was performed for 24 hours after which the medium was replaced with 100 mL DMEM+1× Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium Supplement+1× Pen Strep Glu+1× Non-Essential Amino Acids+1× Sodium Pyruvate. Typically, 2-3 harvests (100 ml) were obtained from each roller bottle at a 48 hr interval. The harvested serum-free conditioned medium was pooled together and centrifuged at 4,000 RPM for 30 minutes at 4° C.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nANTI-IGF-1R ANTIBODY SMALL-SCALE PURIFICATION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example provides a method of purifying anti-IGF-1R antibodies on a small scale.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConditioned medium was filtered through a 0.45 μm cellulose acetate filter and concentrated approximately 8-fold using a Vivaflow 200 50 K tangential flow membrane (Vivascience, Goettingen, Germany). rProtein A SEPHAROSE™ Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.) was washed with phosphate buffered saline (2.7 mM potassium chloride, 138 mM sodium chloride, 1.5 mM potassium phosphate, and 8.1 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) (PBS) four times then directly applied to the concentrated media. The amount of resin used was based on antibody concentration determined by ELISA where 1 μl of resin was used per 5 μg antibody. The medium was incubated overnight at 4° C. with gentle agitation. The resin was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min. at 4° C. The supernatant was decanted as the unbound fraction. The resin was washed with PBS four times for one minute at room temperature with gentle agitation, each time collecting the resin by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min. at 4° C. The antibody was eluted by incubating the resin with 1.5 volumes of 0.1 M glycine pH 3.0 for 10 min. at room temperature. The resin was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min. at 4° C. and the supernatant decanted as eluted antibody. The elution step described above was repeated for a total of three elutions; each time the eluted material was neutralized with 0.04 volumes of 1.0 M tris-HCl, pH 9.2. The sample was filtered through a 0.2 μm cellulose acetate filter. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) as per the supplied instructions using Human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) as a standard. The sample was compared to a Human IgG1, K standard (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) using a 4-20% tris-glycine SDS polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) gel stained with Coomassie brilliant blue dye. No contaminating protein was visible in these preparations.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\nISOLATION OF STABLE CHO CLONES EXPRESSING ANTIBODIES\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example provides a method for isolating stable CHO cell lines expressing anti-IGF-1R antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStable expression of TQ11C, TQ25, \nTQ\n 58 and TQ59 IgG1 was achieved by co-transfection of AMI-D CHO cells (U.S. Pat. No. 6,210,924, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) with pDSRα20 heavy and light chian IgG1 expression constructs. The plasmid transfections were performed using LF2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 4×106AM1-D CHO cells were plated 24 hours prior to transfection, in 100 mm diameter FALCON™ plastic petri dishes (BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) in 10 ml of Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1× penicillin-streptomycin and glutamine (Invitrogen), non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), sodium pyruvate, and HT (0.1 mM sodiumhypoxanthine, 16 nM thymidine; Invitrogen). Approximately 15 mg of each pDSRα21—light chain and heavy chain plasmid DNA were linearized using Pvu I (New England Biolabs) and diluted in 2 ml of OPTI-MEM® (Invitrogen). The diluted plasmids were mixed with 75 μl of LIPOFECTAMINE™ 2000 (LF2000; GIBCO/BRL) diluted in 2 ml of OPTI-MEM® and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The following day fresh growth medium was added. The cells were cultured in complete growth medium for 48 hours, then plated in HT- selection medium in 1:20 and 1:50 dilutions. Approximately 2 weeks after transfection, 12-24 visible colonies were picked into 24-well plates, using the sterile cloning discs (RPI). The clones expressing the highest level of TQ11C, TQ25, TQ58 and TQ59 IgG1 were identified by western immunoblot analysis. To perform this assay, 0.5 ml of serum free medium was added to a single-well confluent cells cultured in a 24 well plate (BD Falcon). The conditioned medium was recovered after 24 hr, and 10 μl of CM was mixed with an equal volume of loading buffer to run a 10% Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide protein gel (Invitrogen). The gel was transferred to a 0.45 μm pore size nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen), and western blot analysis was done using 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-human IgG Fc ImmunoPure antibody (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, Ill.) and ECL as detection agent.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\nMID-SCALE EXPRESSION OF ANTIBODIES\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example provides a method of expressing anti IGF-1R antibodies expressed by stable CHO cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CHO cell lines made according to Example 7 were expanded to T-175 tissue culture flasks (Falcon) for scale-up expression. A confluent T175 flask (approximately 2-3×107 cells) was used to seed 3-850 cm2 roller bottles (Corning Life Sciences, Acton, Mass.), and three confluent roller bottles (approximately 1-2×108 cells per roller bottle) were used to seed 30 rollers in 250 ml of high-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen), 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen), 1× glutamine (Invitrogen), 1× non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1× sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Medium was infused with 10% CO\n2\n/balance air for 5 seconds before capping the roller bottle. Roller bottles were incubated at 37° C. on roller racks spinning at 0.75 rpm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen cells reached approximately 85-90% confluency (approximately 5-6 days in culture), the growth medium was discarded, the cells were washed with 100 ml PBS, and 200 ml production medium was added (50% DMEM (Invitrogen)/50% F12 (Invitrogen), 1× glutamine (Invitrogen), 1× non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1× sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1.5% DMSO (Sigma). Conditioned medium was harvested every seven days for a total of four harvests.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConditioned medium was filtered through a 0.45 μm cellulose acetate filter and concentrated approximately 10-fold using a Sartorius Sartocon Slice Disposable 30 K tangential flow membrane (Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany). The concentrated material was applied to a 10 ml rProtein A Sepharose column at 4° C. and the flowthrough was collected as the unbound fraction. The column was washed with four column volumes of PBS. The bound sample was eluted with approximately four column volumes of 0.1 M glycine pH 3.0. The eluate peak was collected and neutralized with 0.04 volumes of 1.0 M tris-HCl, pH 9.2. The eluate was dialyzed against 150 volumes of PBS overnight at 4° C. The sample was filtered through a 0.2 μm cellulose acetate filter and protein concentration was measured by determining the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 14,000 M-1. The sample was compared to a Human IgG1, K standard (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) using a 4-20% tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie brilliant blue stain. Endotoxin levels in each antibody prepration was determined using the Pyrotell Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Inc., Falmouth, Ma) as per the supplied instructions.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\nORIGEN® DOSE RESPONSE COMPETITION ASSAYS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example provides methods for testing the ability of an antibody to block ligand binding to IGF-1R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn ORIGEN® binding assay was used to determine whether TQ11C, TQ25, \nTQ\n 58 and TQ59 IgG1 antibodies could block ligand binding to IGF-1R using procedures provided by the manufacturer (Igen, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). To label IGF-1 and IGF-2 with ruthenium, lyophilized proteins were dissolved into PBS to give a 1.0 mg/ml solution. Label (ORI-TAG-NHS ester from Igen, Cat # 110034) was added to the protein at a molar ratio of 5:1 (label: protein) from a label stock of 5 mg/ml in DMSO. The mixture was incubated at room temperature (20-22° C.) for 1 hr in the dark then treated with 20 μl 2M glycine for 10 min at room temperature. The labeled protein was separated from the free label by application to an Amersham Biosciences NAP-5 column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.) equilibrated in PBS and 0.33 ml fractions collected. The protein concentration of the fractions was determined by Micro BCA Protein Assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, Ill.). Fractions two and three contained significant protein and were combined. The amount of incorporated ruthenium label was assessed using the following formula: ruthenium tris-bipyridyl compound (Ru(bpy)\n3\n \n2+\n) labeling of IGF-1 and IGF-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDynal M450 paramagnetic beads coated with sheep anti-mouse IgG was used as the solid support phase for the IGF-1R(ECD)-C3-muFc. The M450 beads were prepared for receptor loading by washing three times with assay buffer containing 1×PBS, 0.05% TWEEN™ 20 (ICI Americas, Inc., Wilmington Del.) 0.1% BSA, 0.01% sodium azide. The IGF-1R(ECD)-C3-muFc was bound for 1 hr at a ratio of 50 ng receptor per 1×10\n6 \nM450 beads in a volume of 25 μl assay buffer. To generate dose response data, the antibodies or unlabeled IGF-1 and IGF-2 factors were added at increasing concentrations (10\n−11\nM to 10\n−6\nM) simultaneously with 1 nM Ru-IGF-1 or 2 nM Ru-IGF-2. The final reaction volume was 100 After incubation at room temperature in the dark for 2 hr, an M8 Analyzer (Igen) was used to remove free ruthenium labeled ligand and determine the amount of ligand bound to receptor. The data were expressed as the percent of total ligand bound minus background remaining after competition with excess \nunlabeled growth IGF\n 1 or IGF-2. Competition curves were generated with GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.) using a single component equilibirium model. Essentially all (>98%) binding was competed with excess unlabeled growth factors. The positive control antibodies in the binding analysis were the murine anti-IGF-1R antibodies αIR3 (Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif.) or MAB391 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, Minn.), 24-57 (Biocarta, San Diego, Calif.) and 1H7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif.).

Receptor was loaded onto SPA PVT microspheres for 1 h at room temperature prior to assembly of the binding reactions. To generate dose response data, antibodies or unlabeled growth factors were added at increasing concentrations (10\n−11\nM to 10\n−6\nM) simultaneously with \n125\nI-labeled growth factors. Essentially all binding was competed with excess unlabeled growth factors.

BIACORE® 2000, sensor chip CMS, surfactant P20, HBS-EP (10 mM HEPES, 0.15M NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.005% P20, pH 7.4), amine coupling kit, 10 mM acetate pH 4.5 and 10 mM glycine pH 1.5 all were purchased from BIACore, Inc. (Piscataway, N.J.). Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 1×, no calcium chloride, no magnesium chloride) was from Gibco. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V, IgG free) was from Sigma. Recombinant Protein G (“rProtein G”) was from Pierce Biotechnology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmobilization of rProtein G and IGF-1R-C3-muFc to the sensor chip surface was performed according to manufacturer's instructions, using a continuous flow of 10 mM HEPES, 0.15M NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.005% P20, pH 7.4 (HBS-EP buffer). Briefly, carboxyl groups on the sensor chips's surfaces were activated by injecting 60 μl of a mixture containing 0.2 M N-ethyl-N’-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and 0.05 M N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Specific surfaces were obtained by injecting rProtein A (Pierce) or IGF-1R-C3-mFc diluted in 10 mM acetate, pH 4.5 at concentrations between 20 and 50 μg/ml. Excess reactive groups on the surfaces were deactivated by injecting 60 μl of 1 M ethanolamine. Final immobilized levels were 5,000-6,000 resonance units (RU) for the Protein G surfaces, and 7,800 RU for the IGF-1R-mFc surfaces. A blank, mock-coupled reference surface was also prepared on the IGF-1R-mFc sensor chip.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kinetic analysis of the interaction between IGF-1R-mFc and antibodies was performed as follows. Antibodies as well as a positive control antibody (anti-IR3-CDR-human-mouse chimera) were diluted in PBS+0.005% P20+0.1 mg/ml BSA and injected over the Protein G surfaces to capture the antibodies. IGF-1R-mFc was diluted in PBS+0.005% P20+0.1 mg/ml BSA from 500 nM to 3.9 nM, and each concentration was injected over the captured antibody surfaces, as well as over a blank Protein G surface for background subtraction. After a 10 minute dissociation, each surface was regenerated by injecting 10 mM glycine, pH 1.5. Kinetic analysis of the resulting sensorgrams was performed using BIAEvaluation, v. 3.2 (BIACore, Inc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA solution affinity analysis was done by incubating two different concentrations (0.2 nM and 1 nM) of antibody with varying concentrations (0.01 nM to 50 nM) of IGF-1R-mFc in PBS+0.005% P-20+0.1 mg/ml BSA. Incubations were done at room temperature for at least five hours to allow samples to reach equilibrium. Samples were then injected over the immobilized IGF-1R-mFc surface. After the sample injection, the surfaces were regenerated by injecting 25 \nμl\n 8 mM glycine, pH 1.5. The binding signal obtained is proportional to the free antibody in solution at equilibrium. The dissociation equilibrium constant (K\nD\n) was obtained from nonlinear regression analysis of the competition curves using a dual-curve one-site homogeneous binding model (KinExA software v. 2.3, Sapidyne Instruments Inc., Boise Id.).

The IGF-1R subdomains were cloned into the expression vector pCep4avidin-N such that chicken avidin sequence (with endogenous signal sequence) is joined to the N-terminus of the expressed IGF-1R proteins. Expression of each avidin-fusion protein was achieved by transient transfection of human 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) in roller bottles cultures. The cells were grown and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS+1× Non-Essential Amino Acids+1× Pen Strep Glut+1× Sodium Pyruvate. Approximately 4-5×10\n7 \n293-EBNA cells were seeded in 850 cm\n2 \nroller bottles overnight. The previously seeded cells were then transfected with pCep4-avidin plasmid DNA the following day using \nFUGENE™\n 6 transfection reagent. The DNA—transfection reagent mixture was prepared in approximately in 6.75 mL serum-free DMEM. 6750 \nFUGENE™\n 6 transfection reagent was first added, followed by 112.5 μg plasmid DNA. The complex was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The entire mixture was then added to a roller bottle. The roller bottle was gassed with a 5% CO\n2 \ngas mixture, capped tightly and placed in a 37° C. incubator on a roller rack rotating at 0.35 RPM. The transfection was performed for 24 hours after which the medium was replaced with 100 mL DMEM+1× Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium Supplement+1× Pen Strep Glu+1× Non-Essential Amino Acids+1× Sodium Pyruvate. Harvest of the condition medium and replacement with fresh medium occurred 48 hr intervals (2-3 cycles). The harvested serum-free conditioned medium was pooled together and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000×g for 30 minutes at 4° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concentration of avidin-fusion in each conditioned medium was determined using a quantitative FACS based method. The avidin fusion protein in 200 μl of conditioned medium was captured by incubation for 2 hr at room temperature with 5 μl (˜3.5×10\n5\n) of biotin coated polystyrene beads (Spherotech, Inc., Libertyville, Ill.). The conditioned medium was removed by three cycles of centrifugation and resuspension of the avidin-coated beads in PBS containing 0.5% BSA (BPBS). The avidin-beads were stained with 1 μg/ml of goat FITC-labeled anti-avidin antibody (Vector Lab Burlingame, Calif.) in lml BPBS. After 0.5 hr incubation antibody-beads complexes were collected by centrifugation at 1800 rpm for 5 min and the pellet was washed three times. The FITC fluorescence was detected with a FACSCAN (Beckton Dickson Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). The signal was converted to protein mass using a standard curve derived with recombinant avidin. For epitope mapping the biotin-beads were loaded with 50-100 ng avidin-fusion protein per ˜3.5×10\n5 \nbeads of beads by incubation with the appropriate amount (1-20 ml) of conditioned medium. The loaded beads were washed extensively and resuspended in lml BPBS. For all experiment the biotin-beads were blocked with 10% BSA in PBS prior to loading fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMethod\n 1, One Color Assay: Biotin-coated polystyrene beads loaded with IGF-1R (ECD) and IGF-1R subdomain fusion proteins were mixed with 1 μg of anti-IGF-1R antibody in 1 ml of BPBS. After incubation for 1 hr at room temperature, 4 ml washing buffer was added and the antibody-beads complexes were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 750g. The pellet was washed 3 times by resuspension in 4 ml of BPBS. The antibody bound to avidin-bead complexes was detected by treatment with 0.5 μg/ml Phycoerythrin-(PE) labeled goat anti-human F(ab′)2 (Southern Biotech Associates, Inc., Birmingham, Ala.) in 1 ml BPBS. Tested antibodies were found to bind to the avidin-fusion protein containing the complete IGF-1R ECD and the L2 domain. Binding to L1, CR or FnIII-1 was not detected in this experiment. A relatively weak reaction was also observed with the L1 domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMethod\n 2, Two color assay: To simultaneously monitor the amounts of anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody and avidin-fusion bound to biotin-beads, FITC-labeled anti-avidin antibody was included (1 μg/ml) was included in the binding reaction in combination with 0.5 μg/ml PE-labeled goat anti-human IgG1. The beads were prepared for FACSCAN analysis as described for the one color assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMethod\n 3, Antibody Competition: To prepare for labeling with fluorescein the antibodies were dialyzed or resuspended at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in PBS (pH 8.5). Label ([6-fluorescein-5- (and-6)-carboxamido]hexanoic acid, succinimidyl ester 5(6)-SFX] mixed isomers from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oreg., Cat. No. F2181) was added to the protein at a molar ratio 9.5:1 (label: protein) from a label stock of 5 mg/ml in DMSO. The mixture was incubated at 4° C. overnight in the dark. The labeled antibody was separated from the free label by dialysis in PBS. The FITC/antibody ratios obtained ranged from 3 to 8. For each competition experiment, a binding reaction was assembled that contained a 50 fold excess (10-50 μg/ml) of unlabeled competitor antibody, 3.5×10\n5 \nbiotin beads coated with avidin fusion protein in BPBS. The FITC-labeled antibody (1 μg/ml) was added after a 30 min preincubation. The process followed the one color method from this point forward.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the four tested antibodies binds to the IGF-1R L2 domain, as shown in Table 8. However, the precise amino acid contacts of each antibody in the IGF-1R L2 domain may differ.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody\n\n\nL1\n1\n \n\n\nCR\n1\n \n\n\nL2\n1\n \n\n\nFnIII-1\n1\n \n\n\nECD\n1,2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTQ11C\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTQ25\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTQ58\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTQ59\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNo\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n1\nEpitope mapping was performed with avidin-IGF-1R fusion proteins containing the indicated human IGF-1R regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n2\nThe ECD fusion contains L1 + CR + L2 + FnIII-1 + FnIII-2 + ID + FnIII-3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 13\n\n\nANTIBODY BINDING TO CELL-SURFACE IGF-1R\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example provides a method for detecting the binding of an anti-IGF-1R antibody to cell-surface expressed IGF-1R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of antibodies TQ11C, TQ25, TQ58, and TQ59 to bind to human IGF-1R displayed on the cell surface was evaluated using Balb/C 3T3 fibroblasts and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells engineered to overexpress the human IGF-1R receptor at a level of ˜3-4×10\n5 \nmolecules per cell. A Balb/C 3T3 cell line that stably overexpresses the human IGF-1R (˜3×10\n5 \nreceptors per cell) was derived using with a retroviral vector essentially as described by Pietrzkowski et al., 1992, Cell Growth Differentiation 3:199-205. MCF-7 breast cancer cells that overproduce huIGF-1R were transfected with a pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen Corp.). Zeocin resistant cells that express a high level of hu IGF-1R (˜4×10\n5 \nreceptors per cell) were expanded after selection by FACS using anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody αIR3 and an PE-labeled goat anti murine IgG antibody (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.). The process of selection and expansion was repeated four times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIGF-1R Receptor antibody staining and receptor expression was monitored by FACS as follows: the cells were released from T175 flasks (Corning) by washing 2 times with excess PBS (Ca/Mg free) followed by treatment with 5 ml of Cell Dissociation Buffer (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed two times by resuspending them in PBS and centrifugation. For primary antibody staining, 1 μg of antibody was added to 10\n6 \ncells resuspended in 100 μl PBS plus 0.5% BSA (BPBS) and the cells were incubated at 4° C. for 1.5 hr. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with BPBS to remove unbound primary antibody. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of BPBS and incubated with 1 μg of FITC-labeled goat anti-human F(ab′)2 (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, Ala.) at 4° C. for 30 minutes. After washing to remove unbound FITC secondary antibody, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS+0.5% BSA and FITC cell fluorescence was detected with a FACSCAN (Beckton Dickson Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). The fluorescence levels were converted to absolute receptor levels using Quantum microbead (Bangs Laboratories, Inc., Fishers, Ind.) with predetermined IgG1 binding capacity to generate a standard curve. Data reduction was performed with QuickCal v2.1 software (Verity Software House, Topsham, Me.) provided by the manufacturer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peak fluorescent intensity of anti-IGF-1R antibody labeling of the IGF-1R overexpressors was increased 10-20 fold relative to parental Balb/C 3T3 and MCF-7 cells for each of the tested antibodies. This is the result predicted for an antibody that specifically binds IGF-1R. Background fluorescence of cells treated with no antibodies or FITC-labeled secondary alone were insignificant.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 14\n\n\nINHIBITION OF of IGF-1R\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example presents methods of detecting inhibition of IGF-1R by anti-IGF-1R antibodies.\n\n\n \n32D hu IGF-1R+IRS-1 Cell Inhibition\n\n\n \n \n \nMurine 32D cells that coexpress the human IGF-1R receptor (20K per cell) and human IRS-1 have proven to be a effective system to examine the molecular components IGF-1R signaling Valentinis et al., 1999, J Biol Chem 274:12423-30. Normal 32D cells express relatively low levels of the murine orthologs of these two gene products. 32D cell normally required IL3 for growth and survival. IGF-1 or IGF-2 can replace IL3 in 32D huIGF-1R+IRS-1 cells as shown in \nFIG. 16\n, panel A. The EC\n50 \nto the IGF-1 dose response curve was about 0.5 nM, whereas the IGF-2 EC\n50 \n(2.8 nM) is about six fold higher reflecting weaker affinity of IGF-2 for IGF-1R. To assess the ability of the antibodies TQ11C, TQ25, TQ58, and TQ59 to block IGF-1 or IGF-2 stimulation, 96-well microtitre plates were seeded with 30,000 32D hu IGF-1R+IRS-1 cells per well in a volume of 200 μl of RPMI (Gibco/BRL) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco/BRL) and 1× penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine (Giboco/BRL) and increasing concentrations of antibody (10\n−12\nM to 10\n−6\nM) or no antibody. IGF-1 (2 nM), IGF-2 (8 nM) or nothing was added after 1 hr preincubation with antibody. \n3\nH-thymidine (1 μCi per well) was added at 27 hr post-antibody addition. The cells were harvested 21 hr later, and incorporation of \n3\nH- thymidine into DNA was determined for each sample. The assays were performed in triplicate. An anti-CD20 antibody was used as a negative control. Each of antibodies TQ11C, TQ25, TQ58, and TQ59 was able to completely block the IGF-1 and IGF-2 mediated stimulation of the 32D cells. The reduction of background proliferation in the absence of added IGF-1 and IGF-2 is due to the inhibition of serum IGF-1 and IGF-2. The binding data were analyzed using GraphPad PRIZM™ software. The data are shown in \nFIG. 16\n.\n\n\n \nBalb/C 3T3 hu IGF-1R Cell Inhibition\n\n\n \n \n \nIGF-1 greatly stimulates the incorporation of \n3\nH-thymidine by serum-starved cultures of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Balb/C 3T3 or NIH 3T3) that overexpress IGF-1R (˜1×10\n6 \nIGF1R per cell). Kato et al., 1993, J Biol Chem 268:2655-61; Pietrzkowski et al., 1992, Cell Growth Differentiation 3:199-205. This phenomenon is recapitulated with both IGF-1 and IGF-2 in a Balb/C 3T3 cell line hu IGF-1R overexpressor. Both growth factors stimulated \n3\nH-thymidine incorporation by about 20-fold. The EC\n50 \nof the IGF-1 dose response curve was about 0.7 nM, whereas the IGF-2 EC\n50 \n(4.4 nM) is sevenfold higher, indicating a weaker affinity of IGF-2 for IGF-1R. To assess the ability of a given antibody to block IGF-1 or IGF-2 stimulation, 96-well microtitre plates were seeded with 10,000 cells per well in a volume of 200 μl of DMEM (Gibco/BRL) containing 10% calf serum (Gibco/BRL) and 1×penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine (Giboco/BRL). After overnight incubation when the cells were about 80% confluent the growth medium was replaced with 100 DMEM containing 0.1% BSA after washing once with 200 μl PBS. Antibodies at increasing concentrations (10\n−12\nM to 10\n−6\nM), or no antibody, were added at 24 hr post-serum starvation. IGF-1 (2 nM), IGF-2 (8 nM) and \n3\nH-thymindine (1 μCi per well) were added after a 1 hr preincubation with antibody. The cells were harvested 24 hr later, and incorporation of \n3\nH-thymidine into DNA was determined for each sample. The assays were performed in triplicate. Each tested antibody was able to completely block the IGF-1 and IGF-2 mediated stimulation of Balb/C 3T3 cells, as shown in \nFIG. 17\n. An anti-CD20 antibody was used as a negative control (“CD20” in \nFIG. 17\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach reference cited herein is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all that it teaches and for all purposes."

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to amino acid sequences that are directed against (as defined herein) heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, as well as to compounds or constructs, and in particular proteins and polypeptides, that comprise or essentially consist of one or more such amino acid sequences (also referred to herein as “amino acid sequences of the invention”, “compounds of the invention”, and “polypeptides of the invention”, respectively).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to nucleic acids encoding such amino acid sequences and polypeptides (also referred to herein as “nucleic acids of the invention” or “nucleotide sequences of the invention”); to methods for preparing such amino acid sequences and polypeptides; to host cells expressing or capable of expressing such amino acid sequences or polypeptides; to compositions, and in particular to pharmaceutical compositions, that comprise such amino acid sequences, polypeptides, nucleic acids and/or host cells; and to uses of such amino acid sequences or polypeptides, nucleic acids, host cells and/or compositions, in particular for prophylactic, therapeutic or diagnostic purposes, such as the prophylactic, therapeutic or diagnostic purposes mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther aspects, embodiments, advantages and applications of the invention will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeterodimeric cytokines, their receptors and the pathways, signalling, biological mechanisms and physiological effect in which they and their receptors are involved are known from the prior art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the best-known examples of heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors are IL-12, IL-23 and IL-27, and their receptors IL-12R, IL-23R, and IL-27, respectively. As their name implies, these cytokines are heterodimeric, consisting of two different subunits, i.e. IL12p40 and IL12p35 in case of IL-12, IL12p40 and IL23p19 (also called IL-30B) in case of IL-23, and EBI3 and IL27p28 in case of IL-27. Also, the receptors for these heterodimeric cytokines consist of multiple subunits, i.e. IL12Rbeta1 and IL12Rbeta2 in case of IL-12R, IL12Rbeta1 and IL23R in case of IL-23R, and WSX1 and gp130 in case of IL-27R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL12 remains the prototypical heterodimeric cytokine (composed of IL12p40 and IL12p35), it was not until relatively recently that other related heterodimers exist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn 2000, IL-23 and its subunit p19 (IL23p19) were identified on the basis of a homology search for IL-6-family members. Their studies revealed that p19 dimerizes with IL12p40 and that this cytokine, known as IL23, uses IL12Rβ1, but not IL12Rβ2, as a component of its high-affinity receptor. Functional cloning identified the other subunit of the receptor for IL23, a subunit known as IL23R (text adapted from CA Hunter 2003). It was also found that IL-23 plays an important role in proliferation of The17 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL27 is another heterodimeric cytokine related to IL12 composed of EBI3 and IL27p28. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced molecule 3 (EBI3) had been identified as an IL-12p40 homologue. In 2002, the p28 subunit of IL-27 (IL-27p28) was discovered as a protein with homology to IL-12p35 and IL-6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, the existence of a further heterodimeric cytokine belonging to the IL-12 family, called IL-35, has been described (Collison et al., Nature, 22 Nov. 2007, 566). This heterodimeric cytokine is described as contributing to regulator T-cell function and is composed of the IL12p35 and EBI-3 subunits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThirty-four known type I cytokine receptors have been described, and although the ligands are more difficult to identify, there are at least 27 that can be clustered into 5 distinct families (see Boulay et al 2003). One of these groupings is composed of the ligands for a series of cytokine receptors that use gp130 (glycoprotein 130) or one of several gp130-related proteins. These include the receptors for IL6 and the receptors for the heterodimeric cytokines IL-12, IL-23 and IL-27 (Hunter, supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IL12 receptor is a heterodimer of IL12Rbeta1 and IL12Rbeta2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IL23 receptor is a heterodimer of IL12Rbeta1 and IL23R. IL12Rbeta1 is a used by both IL12 and IL-23 for signalling. Targeting this receptor will lead to a blockade of both IL-12 and IL-23 signaling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IL27 receptor is a hetero dimer composed of WSX1 (Identified on the basis of a homology search for gp130-like proteins) and gp130 which is a common element of the receptor for IL-6 (which comprises IL-6Rα and gp130) and the receptor for IL27 (which comprises WSX1 and gp130), which is consistent with the close familial relationship of these cytokines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor further information on heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors, as well as the pathways, signalling, biological mechanisms and biological effects in which they are involved, and also the diseases in which they are associated, reference is made to the following prior art: Oppmann, 2000, Immunity, 13:751-725; Gubler et al., 1991, PNAS, 88: 4143-4147; Hunter, Nature Rev., Vol. 5, July 2003, 521; Watford et al., Cytokine and Growth Factor Reviews 14 (2003), 361-368; Boulay, Immunity, Vol. 19, 159-163 (2003); Goriely and Goldmann, American Journal of Transplantation 2007; 7: 208-284; Langrish et al., Immunological Reviews 2004, 202, 96-105; Kaufmann et al., J.

Some of the above references also describe antagonists of heterodimeric cytokines (such as conventional monoclonal antibodies) and mention diseases and disorders that can be prevented and/or treated by the use of such antagonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the sequences of the various subunits of the heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors, reference is made to following Genbank accession numbers, which also mention additional information on as the pathways, signalling, biological mechanisms and biological effects in which they are involved, and also the diseases in which they are associated:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nP19: NM_\n016584\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nP40: NM\n—\n002187\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL12Rbeta1: NM\n—\n005535\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL23R NM\n—\n144701\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL12Rbeta2 NM\n—\n001559\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWSX1: IL27RA: NM\n—\n004843\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGp130: NM\n—\n002184 and NM\n—\n175767\n\n\n \n \n \n \nP35 (IL12A): NM\n—\n000882\n\n\n \n \n \n \nP28: NM\n—\n145659\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEBI3: NM\n—\n005755\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the above, it will also be clear that the aforementioned heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors have some subunits in common., with for example IL12p40 being present in both IL-12 and IL-23, and for example IL-12Rbeta1 being present in both the (cognate) receptor for IL-12 as well as the (cognate) receptor for IL-23. Also, some of the other subunits present in the heterodimeric cytokines or the receptors, although not identical, are structurally and/or functionally similar, and on the basis of these similarities can be grouped as follows:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nthe p19, p35 and p28 subunits (and their present and future homologs), which will also be collectively referred to herein as the “p19-like subunits”, it being understood that the p19-like subunit of IL-12 is p35, the p19-like subunit of IL-23 is p19, the p19-like subunit of IL-27 is p28, and the p19-like subunit of IL-35 is p35. P19-like subunits (such as the p35) are also homologous to type I cytokines, such as IL6 and oncostatin M, and for example share the “four helix bundle” that is common to type I cytokines;\n \nthe p40 and EBI3 subunits (and their present and future homologs), which will also be collectively referred to herein as the “p40-like subunits”, it being understood that the p40-like subunit of IL-12 is p40, the p40-like subunit of IL-23 is p40, the p40-like subunit of IL-27 is EBI3, and the p40-like subunit of IL-35 is EBI3. P40-like subunits (such as IL12p40) are structurally related to the soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6Rα);\n \nthe gp130 and IL-12beta-1 subunits (and their present and future homologs), which will also be collectively referred to herein as the “gp130-like subunits”, it being understood that the gp130-like subunit of the IL-12 receptor is IL-12Rbeta-1, the gp130-like subunit of the IL-23 receptor is IL-12Rbeta-1, and the gp130-like subunit of the IL-27 receptor is gp130.\n \nthe IL-12Rbeta-2, IL-23R and WSX-1 subunits (and their present and future homologs), which will also be collectively referred to herein as the “IL-23 subunits”, it being understood that the IL-23 subunit of the IL-12 receptor is IL-12Rbeta-2, the IL-23-like subunit of the IL-23 receptor is IL-23R, and the IL-23-like subunit of the IL-27 receptor is WSX-1.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIt is generally known that cytokines and their receptors are critical players in (the pathways) regulating all aspects of immune responses. This is also the case for the heterodimeric cytokines that belong to the interleukin-12 (IL12)-related family and for their receptors. For example, \nIL\n 12—the prototypical heterodimeric member of the IL-12 family—induces interferon-□ (IFN-□) production by NK, T cells, dendritic cells (DC), and macrophages. IL-12 also promotes the differentiation of naive CD4\n+\n T cells into T helper 1 (T\nH\n1) cells that produce IFN-□ and aid in cell-mediated immunity. Therefore the central role of IL12 in the generation of \nT\n \n \n \nH\n1 cells (cell-mediated immune response) has long been appreciated. For example, mouse models established that IL12 is required for the development of protective innate and adaptive immune response to intracellular pathogens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL23 and IL27—two of the other heterodimeric cytokines from the IL-12 family—also regulate T\nH\n1-cell response, albeit with distinct functions. The ability of IL-23 to stimulate CD4\n+\n T cells to produce IL-17 has a dominant role in the development and maintenance of autoimmune inflammation. By contrast, a principal function of IL-27 in viva is to limit the intensity and duration of innate and adaptive immune responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition IL12p40 can be found as a monomers or homodimers which have antagonistic activities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, IL23 was shown to be responsible for the chronic inflammation observed in inflammatory bowel disease. This was confirmed by the fact that the IL23R gene was identified as being involved in inflammatory bowel disease. It has also been found that p19 knock out mice are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis and colitis, whereas comparable p35 knock out mice were found to be more susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis. Also, when p19 knock out mice were crossed with IL-10 knock out mice, the resulting offspring were resistant to colitis, whereas similar crosses of p19 knock out mice with IL-10 knock out mice resulted in offspring that was susceptible to colitis. It was further found that a monoclonal antibody against p19 inhibits the development of EAE, a preclinical animal model for multiple sclerosis, and reduces serum levels of IL-17 (which is not regulated by IL-12). Also, IL-23 rather than IL-\ni\n 2 appears to be the essential cytokine in CNS autoimmune inflammation. All this results suggests that IL-23/p19 may be a more attractive target for the treatment of colitis, Crohn's diseases, IBD, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and some of the other diseases and disorders mentioned herein that IL-12/p35 or p40 (as a compound directed against p40 will probably modulate both IL-12 and IL-23). It should also be noted that the monoclonal antibodies CNTO 1275 and ABT-874 (see below) that are currently under clinical development are both directed against p40. Thus, one specific object of the invention is to provide amino acid sequences and polypeptides that are directed against p19, and in particular amino acid sequences and polypeptides that are specific for (as defined herein) p19 compared to both p35 and p40 and/or that are specific for (as defined herein) IL-23 compared to IL-12. Examples of such amino acid sequences and polypeptides will become clear from the description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs further described herein, the amino acid sequences, polypeptides and compositions of the present invention can generally be used to modulate (as defined herein) the signalling that is mediated by heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, to modulate (as defined herein) the biological pathways in which heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors are involved, and/or to modulate (as defined herein) the biological mechanisms, responses and effects associated with heterodimeric cytokines, their receptors, such signalling and/or these pathways (all the foregoing is also collectively referred to herein as “heterodimeric cytokine-mediated signalling”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs such, the amino acid sequences, polypeptides and compositions of the present invention can generally be used to modulate the immune system and/or one or more specific immune responses in a subject to which one or more of the amino acid sequences, polypeptides and compositions of the present invention are administered (i.e. in therapeutically relevant amounts).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heterodimeric cytokines” as used herein in its broadest sense generally includes any heterodimeric cytokine, i.e. a cytokine that comprises at least two, and more preferably only two, subunits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the term “heterodimeric cytokine” as used herein encompasses heterodimeric cytokines that are associated with cell-mediated (T\nH\n1) immunity, although the invention is its broadest sense is not limited thereto and also encompasses heterodimeric cytokines associated with humoral (T\nH\n2) immunity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of invention are directed against a heterodimeric cytokine that is chosen from heterodimeric cytokines that comprise a p40 subunit or p40-like subunit, such as a p40 subunit (present in for example IL-12 and IL-23) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced molecule 3 (EB13, present in for example IL-27 and IL-35).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of invention are directed against a heterodimeric cytokine that is chosen from heterodimeric cytokines that comprise a p19 subunit or a p19-like subunit, such as a p19 subunit (present in for example IL-23), a p35 subunit (present in for example IL-12 and IL-35), or a p28 subunit (present in for example 1L-27) or a homolog thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of invention may be directed against a heterodimeric cytokine that will comprise at least one p19 subunit or p19-like subunit and at least one p40 subunit or p40-like subunit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to an even more specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of invention are directed against a heterodimeric cytokine that is chosen from IL-12, IL-23, IL-27 and/or IL-35.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific aspect, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are directed against IL-23 (i.e. against p40, p19 or both). Such amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention (as well as compositions comprising the same), can be used for preventing and treating disorders associated with IL-23.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another specific aspect, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are directed against IL-12 (i.e. against p40, p35 or both). Such amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention (as well as compositions comprising the same), may be as further described herein, and can be used for preventing and treating disorders associated with IL-12.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences, polypeptides and compositions can be used to modulate (as defined herein, and for example as an agonist or an antagonist) heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors; and/or the signaling, pathways, biological mechanisms and effects in which these are involved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences and polypeptides that are antagonists of heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors (and/or of the signaling, pathways, biological mechanisms and effects in which these are involved) can also be used to reduce or inhibit the agonistic effects of heterodimeric cytokines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore generally, the amino acid sequences (such as the p19+ sequences, p19− sequences, p40+ sequences, p40− sequences, p35 sequences, IL-27 sequences, IL-12Rb1 sequences, IL-12Rb2 sequences and IL-23 sequences described herein), polypeptides (such as the—for example multivalent, multispecific and/or biparatopic—constructs described herein that comprise at least one p19+ sequence, p19− sequence, p40+ sequence, p40− sequence, p35 sequence, IL-27 sequence, IL-12Rb1 sequence, IL-12Rb2 sequence and/or IL-23 sequence) and compositions of the present invention can be used for the prevention and treatment (as defined herein) of diseases and disorders associated with heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors (and/or with the signaling, pathways, biological mechanisms and effects in which these are involved). Generally, “diseases and disorders associated with heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors” can be defined as diseases and disorders that can be prevented and/or treated, respectively, by suitably administering to a subject in need thereof (i.e. having the disease or disorder or at least one symptom thereof and/or at risk of attracting or developing the disease or disorder) of either a polypeptide or composition of the invention (and in particular, of a pharmaceutically active amount thereof) and/or of a known active principle active against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors or a biological pathway or mechanism in which heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors is involved (and in particular, of a pharmaceutically active amount thereof). Examples of such diseases and disorders associated with heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein, and for example include the following diseases and disorders: inflammation and inflammatory disorders such as bowel diseases (colitis, Crohn'disease, IBD), infectious diseases, psioriasis, cancer, autoimmune diseases (such as MS), carcoidis, transplant rejection, cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, viral infection, common variable immunodeficiency, and the various diseases and disorders mentioned in the prior art cited herein. Based thereon, it will also be clear to the skilled person with heterodimeric cytokines (and/or receptors thereof) are involved in which specific diseases and disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the polypeptides and compositions of the present invention can be used for the prevention and treatment of diseases and disorders associated with heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors which are characterized by excessive and/or unwanted signalling mediated by heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors or by the pathway(s) in which heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors is involved. Examples of such diseases and disorders associated with heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors will again be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein. For this purpose, usually antagonists of heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors (and/or with the signaling, pathways, biological mechanisms and effects in which these are involved) will be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgonists of heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors (and/or with the signaling, pathways, biological mechanisms and effects in which these are involved) can be used to stimulate or enhance one or more immune response in a human or animal, for example for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases that are characterized by a weakened immune system or that may occur as a result of having a weakened immune system. Reference is for example made to Hunter (supra), Table 1, which lists several mice knock-outs in which various heterodimeric cytokines and receptors thereof (and in particular subunits thereof) have been knock-out, and the inflammatory phenotypes associated therewith.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL12p40 has also been shown to have an essential role in autoimmune inflammation as shown in disease model system as EAE (Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis) or CIA (Collagen-induced arthritis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, without being limited thereto, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention can for example be used to prevent and/or to treat all diseases and disorders that are currently being prevented or treated with active principles that can modulate heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors-mediated signalling, such as those mentioned in the prior art cited above (for example, the monoclonal antibody CNTO 1275 that is described in WO 02/09748 and WO 06/069036; ABT-874, a monoclonal against p40 that is being developed by Abbott; as well as the small molecule Apilimod®, Syntha Pharmaceuticals). It is also envisaged that the polypeptides of the invention can be used to prevent and/or to treat all diseases and disorders for which treatment with such active principles is currently being developed, has been proposed, or will be proposed or developed in future. In addition, it is envisaged that, because of their favourable properties as further described herein, the polypeptides of the present invention may be used for the prevention and treatment of other diseases and disorders than those for which these known active principles are being used or will be proposed or developed; and/or that the polypeptides of the present invention may provide new methods and regimens for treating the diseases and disorders described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be clear from the further description herein, the amino acid sequences of the invention may be in a so-called “monovalent” format (i.e. comprising or essentially consisting of a single antigen binding domain or binding unit) or in a “multivalent” format (i.e. comprising or essentially consisting of two or more binding domains or binding units—which may be the same or different—that are linked to each other, optionally via one or more suitable linkers). As also further described herein, such multivalent amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may for example, without limitation, be multispecific (such as bispecific or trispecific) or multiparatopic (such as biparatopic) constructs (or be both multiparatopic and multispecific, such as a biparatopic construct against the p19 subunit that contains a further binding domain for binding to a serum protein, as exemplified herein); and may for example be constructs that comprise at least two binding domains or binding units that are each directed towards a different epitope on the same subunit of a heterodimeric cytokine, constructs that comprise at least two binding domains or binding units that each have a different biological function (for example one binding domain that can block or inhibit receptor-ligand interaction, and one binding domain that does not block or inhibit receptor-ligand interaction), or constructs that comprise at least two binding domains or binding units that are each directed towards a different subunit of a heterodimeric cytokine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of such constructs will become clear from the further disclosure herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will also become clear from the further description herein that such constructs can generally be provided (and in particular, purposefully designed for a specific biological action) by suitably linking (optionally via suitable linkers) or combining two or more “monovalent” amino acid sequences of the invention (or by suitably linking or combining nucleotide sequences encoding such monovalent amino acid sequences to provide a nucleic acid that encodes the desired multivalent construct, and then suitably expressing said multivalent construct). Thus, it should be clear that the invention not only makes available the monovalent and multivalent amino acid sequences and polypeptides described herein, but also provides—by making available the monovalent amino acid sequences and polypeptides described herein—the skilled person with a range of different binding domains and binding units that can be used as “building blocks” to provide a range of different multivalent, multispecific and/or multiparatopic (and in particular, biparatopic) constructs (which may have different binding affinities, avidities, specificities, potencies and/or efficacies), which through the use of suitable “building blocks” as described herein can be purposefully designed for use in different aspects of the invention (as further described herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsequently, the use of the various monovalent amino acid sequences of the invention as “building blocks” for providing the proteins and polypeptides of the invention (or nucleotide sequences/nucleic acids encoding the same, which can then be expressed to provide such proteins and polypeptides) form an important aspect of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor this purpose and for the other purposes described herein, the invention in a particular aspect provides a number of different amino acid sequences that each can be used as a single binding domain or binding unit, either as such (i.e. as a monovalent amino acid sequence as further described herein) or as part of (and/or as a “building block”) for, a multivalent, multispecific and/or multispecific construct, as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn their monovalent form, these amino acid sequences may for example be classified as follows:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n“p19 sequences”, i.e. amino acid sequences of the invention that are directed against (as defined herein) the p19 subunit (as present in for example IL-23). The p19 sequences described herein may be further subdivided into “p19+sequences” (i.e. p19 sequences that are directed against the p19 subunit and that are capable of modulating, neutralizing, blocking and/or inhibiting the binding of a heterodimeric cytokine comprising a p19 subunit to its (cognate) receptor, and in particular capable of are capable of modulating, neutralizing, blocking and/or inhibiting the binding of IL-23 to its (cognate) receptor, for example in the alpha-screen assay of Example 19 or 22) and “p19− sequences” (i.e. p19 sequences that are directed against the p19 subunit but that (per se/as such) are (essentially) not capable of modulating, neutralizing, blocking and/or inhibiting the binding of a heterodimeric cytokine comprising a p19 subunit to its (cognate) receptor);\n \n“p40 sequences”, i.e. amino acid sequences of the invention that are directed against (as defined herein) the p40 subunit (as present in for example IL-12 and IL-23).

The IL-27 sequences described herein may be directed against the EBI-3 subunit or against the IL-27p28 subunit;\n \n“IL-12Rb1 sequences”, i.e. amino acid sequences of the invention that are directed against the Rbeta1 subunit of IL-12R and/or of IL-23R;\n \n“IL-2Rb2 sequences”, i.e. amino acid sequences of the invention that are directed against the Rbeta2 subunit of IL-12R)\n \n“IL-23R sequences”, i.e. amino acid sequences of the invention that are directed against the IL-23R subunit of the IL-23 receptor.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nEach of the p19+sequences, p19− sequences, p40+sequences, p40− sequence, p35 sequences, IL-27 sequences, IL-12Rb1 sequences, IL-12Rb2 sequences and IL-23R sequences may be as further described herein and each class of amino acid sequences of the invention forms a further aspect of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to the use of such p19+ sequences, p19− sequences, p40+ sequences, p40− sequences, p35 sequences, IL-27 sequences, IL-12Rb1 sequences, IL-12Rb2 sequences and IL-23R sequences (and/or of nucleotide sequences and/or nucleic acids encoding the same) as “building blocks” (i.e. as single antigen binding domains or units) in or for multivalent, multispecific and/or multiparatopic constructs, as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this respect, it should for example be noted that amino acid sequences of the invention that are not capable of modulating, neutralizing, blocking and/or inhibiting the binding of a heterodimeric cytokine to its cognate receptor (such as the p19− sequences or p40− sequences) may still find use as binding domains and/or binding units in multivalent, multispecific and/or multiparatopic polypeptides of the invention, for example in order to provide/improve specificity and/or to provide/improve affinity and/or avidity. Examples thereof will become clear to the skilled person from the disclosure herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, further aspects of the invention relate to:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nthe use of an amino acid

Said amino acid sequence preferably form and/or essentially consist of a single (antigen) binding domain or binding unit, and/or are capable of forming and/or of functioning as a single (antigen) binding domain or binding unit (optionally after suitable folding), either as such and/or as part of a protein or polypeptide of the invention as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore in particular, the invention provides amino acid sequences (such as the p19+ sequences, p19− sequences, p40+ sequences, p40− sequences, p35 sequences, IL-27 sequences, IL-12Rb1 sequences, IL-12Rb2 sequences and IL-23 sequences described herein) that can bind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K\nD\n-value (actual or apparent), a K\nA\n-value (actual or apparent), a k\non\n-rate and/or a k\noff\n-rate, or alternatively as an IC\n50 \nvalue, as further described herein) that is as defined herein; as well as compounds and constructs, and in particular proteins and polypeptides, that comprise at least one such amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are preferably such that they:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nbind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of 10\n−5 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less, and preferably 10\n−7 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less and more preferably 10\n−8 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter (i.e. with an association constant (K\nA\n) of 10\n5 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more, and preferably 10\n7 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more and more preferably 10\n8 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles);\n \nand/or such that they:\n \nbind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with a k\non\n-rate of between 10\n2 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nto about 10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, preferably between 10\n3 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, more preferably between 10\n4 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, such as between 10\n5 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, and/or such that they:\n \nbind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with a k\noff \nrate between 1s\n−1 \n(t\n1/2\n=0.69 s) and 10\n−6 \ns\n−1 \n(providing a near irreversible complex with a t\n1/2 \nof m days), preferably between 10\n−2 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n, more preferably between 10\n−3 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n, such as between 10\n−4 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nPreferably, a monovalent amino acid sequence of the invention (or a polypeptide that essentially contains only one amino acid sequence of the invention) is preferably such that it will bind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with an affinity less than 500 nM, preferably less than 200 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, such as less than 500 pM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome preferred IC50 values for binding of the amino acid sequences or polypeptides of the invention to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors will become clear from the further description and examples herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor binding to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, an amino acid sequence of the invention will usually contain within its amino acid sequence one or more amino acid residues or one or more stretches of amino acid residues (i.e. with each “stretch” comprising two or amino acid residues that are adjacent to each other or in close proximity to each other, i.e. in the primary or tertiary structure of the amino acid sequence) via which the amino acid sequence of the invention can bind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, which amino acid residues or stretches of amino acid residues thus form the “site” for binding to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors (also referred to herein as the “antigen binding site”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences provided by the invention are preferably in essentially isolated form (as defined herein), or form part of a protein or polypeptide of the invention (as defined herein), which may comprise or essentially consist of one or more amino acid sequences of the invention and which may optionally further comprise one or more further amino acid sequences (all optionally linked via one or more suitable linkers). For example, and without limitation, the one or more amino acid sequences of the invention may be used as a binding unit in such a protein or polypeptide, which may optionally contain one or more further amino acid sequences that can serve as a binding unit (i.e. against one or more other targets than heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors), so as to provide a monovalent, multivalent or multispecific polypeptide of the invention, respectively, all as described herein. Such a protein or polypeptide may also be in essentially isolated form (as defined herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences (such as the p19+ sequences, p19− sequences, p40+ sequences, p40− sequences, p35 sequences, IL-27 sequences, IL-12Rb1 sequences, IL-12Rb2 sequences and IL-23 sequences described herein) and polypeptides (such as the—for example multivalent, multispecific and/or biparatopic—constructs described herein that comprise at least one p19+ sequence, p19− sequence, p40+ sequence, p40− sequence, p35 sequence, IL-27 sequence, IL-12Rb1 sequence, IL-12Rb2 sequence and/or IL-23 sequence) of the invention as such preferably essentially consist of a single amino acid chain that is not linked via disulphide bridges to any other amino acid sequence or chain (but that may or may not contain one or more intramolecular disulphide bridges. For example, it is known that Nanobodies—as described herein—may sometimes contain a disulphide bridge between CDR3 and CDR1 or FR2). However, it should be noted that one or more amino acid sequences of the invention may be linked to each other and/or to other amino acid sequences (e.g. via disulphide bridges) to provide peptide constructs that may also be useful in the invention (for example Fab′ fragments, F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments, ScFv constructs, “diabodies” and other multispecific constructs. Reference is for example made to the review by Holliger and Hudson, Nat Biotechnol. 2005 September; 23(9):1126-36).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, when an amino acid sequence of the invention (or a compound, construct or polypeptide comprising the same) is intended for administration to a subject (for example for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes as described herein), it is preferably either an amino acid sequence that does not occur naturally in said subject; or, when it does occur naturally in said subject, in essentially isolated form (as defined herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will also be clear to the skilled person that for pharmaceutical use, the amino acid sequences of the invention (as well as compounds, constructs and polypeptides comprising the same) are preferably directed against human heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors; whereas for veterinary purposes, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are preferably directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors from the species to be treated, or at at least cross-reactive with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors from the species to be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, an amino acid sequence of the invention may optionally, and in addition to the at least one binding site for binding against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, contain one or more further binding sites for binding against other antigens, proteins or targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe efficacy of the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention, and of compositions comprising the same, can be tested using any suitable in vitro assay, cell-based assay, in vivo assay and/or animal model known per se, or any combination thereof, depending on the specific disease or disorder involved. Suitable assays and animal models will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include in vitro assays such as Biacore (see for example Example 12, 20 or 23), Alpha-screen (see for example Example 14, Example 20 or Example22), FLIPR, ELISA (see for example Example 10) and competitive ELISA (see for example Example 11), cell-based assays such as proliferation of activated PBMCs (for measuring modulation of IL-12 mediated signalling,) IL17 production of activated spleen cells (for measuring modulation of IL-23 mediated signalling, see for example Aggarwal, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 278, 3, 2003, 1910-1914); and assays for measuring differentiation of THE1 and/or inhibition of THE17 cells (for for measuring modulation of IL-23 mediated signalling), and various animal models for inflammatory diseases and disorders, such as models for autoimmune inflammation such as EAE (Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis), CIA (Collagen-induced arthritis), IL12-induced neopterin release, and mouse spleen IL17 production; IBD models in mice and rats such as Dextran Sulphate Salt induced Ulcerative Colitis and Dinitrofluorobenzene induced Crohn's disease, as well as the assays and animal models used in the experimental part below and in the prior art cited herein. Based on the disclosure herein, and depending on the heterodimeric cytokine(s) and/or receptor(s) involved, the skilled person will generally be able to select a suitable in vitro assay, cellular assay or animal model to test the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention to a heterodimeric cytokine or a receptor thereof, for their capacity to modulate heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors, and/or the signaling, pathways, biological mechanisms and effects in which these are involved; and for their therapeutic and/or prophylactic effect in respect of one or more diseases and disorders that are associate with a heterodimeric cytokine and/or a receptors thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, according to the invention, amino acid sequences and polypeptides that are directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors from a first species of warm-blooded animal may or may not show cross-reactivity with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors from one or more other species of warm-blooded animal. For example, amino acid sequences and polypeptides directed against human heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors may or may not show cross reactivity with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors from one or more other species of primates (such as, without limitation, monkeys from the genus \nMacaca \n(such as, and in particular, cynomologus monkeys (\nMacaca fascicularis\n) and/or rhesus monkeys (\nMacaca mulatta\n)) and baboon (\nPapio ursinus\n)) and/or with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors from one or more species of animals that are often used in animal models for diseases (for example mouse, rat, rabbit, pig or dog), and in particular in animal models for diseases and disorders associated with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors (such as the species and animal models mentioned herein). In this respect, it will be clear to the skilled person that such cross-reactivity, when present, may have advantages from a drug development point of view, since it allows the amino acid sequences and polypeptides against human heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors to be tested in such disease models.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore generally, amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention that are cross-reactive with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors from multiple species of mammal will usually be advantageous for use in veterinary applications, since it will allow the same amino acid sequence or polypeptide to be used across multiple species. Thus, it is also encompassed within the scope of the invention that amino acid sequences and polypeptides directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors from one species of animal (such as amino acid sequences and polypeptides against human heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors) can be used in the treatment of another species of animal, as long as the use of the amino acid sequences and/or polypeptides provide the desired effects in the species to be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is in its broadest sense also not particularly limited to or defined by a specific antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation (where applicable) of heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors against which the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are directed. In one particular aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides are (at least) directed against an interaction site (as defined herein) on the heterodimeric cytokine or the receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs further described herein, a polypeptide of the invention may contain two or more amino acid sequences of the invention that are directed against their intended (cognate) cognate target (such as a heterodimeric cytokine, a receptor for the same, or a subunit of either). Generally, such polypeptides will bind to said said target with increased avidity compared to a single amino acid sequence of the invention. Such a polypeptide may for example comprise two amino acid sequences of the invention that are directed against the same antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation (where applicable) of said target (which may or may not be an interaction site); or comprise at least one “first” amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against a first same antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation (where applicable) of said target (which may or may not be an interaction site); and at least one “second” amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against a second antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation (where applicable) different from the first (and which again may or may not be an interaction site). Preferably, in such “biparatopic” polypeptides of the invention, at least one amino acid sequence of the invention is directed against an interaction site (as defined herein), although the invention in its broadest sense is not limited thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, when the target is part of a binding pair (for example, a receptor-ligand binding pair), the amino acid sequences and polypeptides may be such that they compete with the cognate binding partner (e.g. the ligand, receptor or other binding partner, as applicable) for binding to the target, and/or such that they (fully or partially) neutralize binding of the binding partner to the target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also within the scope of the invention that, where applicable, an amino acid sequence of the invention can bind to two or more antigenic determinants, epitopes, parts, domains, subunits or confirmations of heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors. In such a case, the antigenic determinants, epitopes, parts, domains or subunits of heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors to which the amino acid sequences and/or polypeptides of the invention bind may be essentially the same (for example, if heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors contains repeated structural motifs or occurs in a multimeric form) or may be different (and in the latter case, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to such different antigenic determinants, epitopes, parts, domains, subunits of heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with an affinity and/or specificity which may be the same or different). Also, for example, when heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors exists in an activated conformation and in an inactive conformation, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to either one of these confirmation, or may bind to both these confirmations (i.e. with an affinity and/or specificity which may be the same or different). Also, for example, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to a conformation of heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors in which it is bound to a pertinent ligand, may bind to a conformation of heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors in which it not bound to a pertinent ligand, or may bind to both such conformations (again with an affinity and/or specificity which may be the same or different).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also expected that the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention will generally bind to all naturally occurring or synthetic analogs, variants, mutants, alleles, parts and fragments of heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors; or at least to those analogs, variants, mutants, alleles, parts and fragments of heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors that contain one or more antigenic determinants or epitopes that are essentially the same as the antigenic determinant(s) or epitope(s) to which the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention bind in heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors (e.g. in wild-type heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors). Again, in such a case, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may bind to such analogs, variants, mutants, alleles, parts and fragments with an affinity and/or specificity that are the same as, or that are different from (i.e. higher than or lower than), the affinity and specificity with which the amino acid sequences of the invention bind to (wild-type) heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors. It is also included within the scope of the invention that the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention bind to some analogs, variants, mutants, alleles, parts and fragments of heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, but not to others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences, polypeptides and compositions of the present invention can generally be used to modulate (as defined herein) the signalling that is mediated by heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, to modulate (as defined herein) the biological pathways in which heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors are involved, and/or to modulate (as defined herein) the biological mechanisms, responses and effects associated with heterodimeric cytokines, their receptors, such signalling and/or these pathways (all the foregoing is also collectively referred to herein as “heterodimeric cytokine-mediated signalling”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs such, the amino acid sequences, polypeptides and compositions of the present invention can generally be used to modulate the immune system and/or one or more specific immune responses in a subject to which one or more of the amino acid sequences, polypeptides and compositions of the present invention are administered (i.e. in therapeutically relevant amounts).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heterodimeric cytokines” as used herein in its broadest sense generally includes any heterodimeric cytokine, i.e. a cytokine that comprises at least two, and more preferably only two, subunits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the term “heterodimeric cytokine” as used herein encompasses heterodimeric cytokines that are associated with cell-mediated (T\nH\n1) immunity, although the invention is its broadest sense is not limited thereto and also encompasses heterodimeric cytokines associated with humoral (T\nH\n2) immunity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of invention are directed against a heterodimeric cytokine that is chosen from heterodimeric cytokines that comprise a p40 subunit or p40-like subunit, such as a p40 subunit (present in for example IL-12 and IL-23) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced molecule 3 (EBI3, present in for example IL-27 and IL-35).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of invention are directed against a heterodimeric cytokine that is chosen from heterodimeric cytokines that comprise a p19 subunit or a p19-like subunit, such as a p19 subunit (present in for example IL-23), a p35 subunit (present in for example IL-12 and IL-35), or a p28 subunit (present in for example IL-27) or a homolog thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of invention may be directed against a heterodimeric cytokine that will comprise at least one p19 subunit or p19-like subunit and at least one p40 subunit or p40-like subunit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to an even more specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of invention are directed against a heterodimeric cytokine that is chosen from IL-12, IL-23, IL-27 and/or IL-35.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific aspect, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention are directed against IL-23 (i.e. against p40, p19 or both). Such amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention (as well as compositions comprising the same) may be as further described herein and can be used for preventing and treating disorders associated with IL-23, the IL-23 receptor and/or IL-23 mediated signalling. Reference is again made to the prior art cited above. Also, as mentioned herein, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention that are directed against IL-23, and in particular those that are specific for (as defined herein) IL-23 compared to IL-12, may have advantages for therapeutic use over the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention that are directed against IL-12.

For example, the invention comprises multispecific proteins and polypeptides (as described herein) that comprise at least one binding unit against a first subunit of a heterodimeric cytokine and at least one binding unit against a second subunit of a heterodimeric cytokine that is different from said first subunit. For example, the invention comprises such multispecific proteins and polypeptides which comprise at least one binding unit against a first subunit of a heterodimeric cytokine and at least one binding unit against a second subunit of a heterodimeric cytokine that is different from said first subunit, in which said first and second subunit form part of the same heterodimeric cytokine (in other words, such multi specific proteins or polypeptides are “biparatopic” with respect to said heterodimeric cytokine, in that they are capable of binding to two different epitopes on said heterodimeric cytokine. Alternatively, and without limitation, a protein or polypeptide as described herein may for example be biparatopic in respect of one of the subunits mentioned herein, i.e. comprise at least one binding unit against a first epitope on said subunit and at least one binding unit against a second epitope on said subunit). Some non-limiting examples of such multispecific proteins and polypeptides are multispecific proteins and polypeptides that are directed against p35 and p40 (which are both present in IL-12, so that such a multivalent protein or polypeptide is expected to be specific for IL-12), against \np\n 19 and p40 (both present in IL-23), or against p28 and EBI3 (both present in IL-27).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore generally, the invention comprises such multispecific proteins and polypeptides which comprise at least one binding unit against a first subunit of a heterodimeric cytokine and at least one binding unit against a second subunit of a heterodimeric cytokine that is different from said first subunit, in which said first and second subunit are chosen from p19, p35, p28, p40 and/or EBI3; and/or mutants, variants, alleles or homologs of each of the foregoing. For example, such multispecific proteins and polypeptides may comprise at least one binding unit which is directed against a p19-like subunit such as p19, p35 or \np\n 28 and at least one binding unit that is directed against a p40-like subunit such as p40 or EBI3 (it should also be noted that the invention even more generally relates to any multispecific protein and polypeptide which comprises at least one binding unit that is directed against a heterodimeric cytokine or a subunit thereof—such as p19, p35, p28, p40 and/or EBI3—and at least one further binding unit that is directed against any other (e.g. non-heterodimeric cytokine) desired target, antigenic determinant or epitope).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will also be clear to the skilled person that an amino acid sequence or polypeptide as described herein may be directed against the interface between the two subunits that form a heterodimeric cytokine (usually the interface between a p19-like subunit and a p40-like subunit). Thus, such an amino acid sequence and polypeptide will often be able to (simultaneously) bind to both subunits that form the heterodimeric cytokine, so as to span the interface between said two subunits. For example, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides described herein may be directed against the p35/p40 interface of IL-12, against the p19/p40 interface of IL-23, or against the p28/EBI-3 interface of IL-28.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, from the above, it will be clear to the skilled person that the amino acid sequences and polypeptides described herein may be directed against a single heterodimeric cytokine (or against a single subunit of a heterodimeric cytokine), but may also be directed against multiple heterodimeric cytokines (or against multiple subunits thereof, that either form part of the same heterodimeric cytokine or even of different heterodimeric cytokines).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides described herein are specific for (as defined herein) IL-23, compared to IL-12, IL-27 and IL-35.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides described herein are specific for (as defined herein) IL-12, compared to IL-23, IL-27 and IL-35.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides described herein are specific for (as defined herein) IL-27, compared to IL-12, IL-23 and IL-35.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides described herein are specific for (as defined herein) IL-35, compared to IL-12, IL-23 and IL-27.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides described herein are specific for (as defined herein) the p19 subunit, compared to the p35 or p28 subunits.

Preferably, such a bispecific polypeptide is such that it is directed against a gp130-like subunit and an IL-23 like subunit that form part of the same receptor. Such bispecific polypeptides may for example trigger, facilitate and/or enhance activation and/or association of the receptor (or more generally receptor-mediated signalling), for example by mimicking the effects of ligand binding; and thus act as an agonist for the receptor, its ligand and/or the relevant heterodimeric cytokine-mediated signalling (in this respect, it should also be noted that in another aspect, the invention comprises polypeptides of the invention that comprise one or more, such as two, three or four, amino acid sequences of the invention that are directed against a single cytokine receptor chain so as to induce dimerisation or oligomerization and leading to activation of the receptor).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, such bispecific polypeptides may for example block, inhibit or reduce binding of the ligand to the receptor, or block, inhibit or reduce activation and/or association of the receptor after binding of the ligand, and/or more generally act as an agonist for the receptor, its ligand and/or the relevant heterodimeric cytokine-mediated signalling\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the invention provides:\n\n \n \n \n \n \namino acid sequences and (in particular) polypeptides that are directed against IL12Rbeta1 and IL12Rbeta2, which are expected to be (and preferably are) selective for the IL-12 receptor compared to the IL-23 receptor and the IL-27 receptor. For example, such a biparatopic polypeptide may comprise at least one amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against IL12Rbeta1 and at least one amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against IL12Rbeta2;\n \namino acid sequences and (in particular) polypeptides that are directed against IL12Rbeta1 and IL23R, which are expected to be (and preferably are) selective for the IL-23 receptor compared to the IL-12 receptor and the IL-27 receptor. For example, such a biparatopic polypeptide may comprise at least one amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against IL12Rbeta1 and at least one amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against IL23R;\n \namino acid sequences and (in particular) polypeptides that are directed against WSX-1 and gp130, which are expected to be (and preferably are) selective for the IL-27 receptor compared to the IL-12 receptor and the IL-23 receptor. For example, such a biparatopic polypeptide may comprise at least one amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against WSX-1 and at least one amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against gp130.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAgain, such amino acid sequences and polypeptides may all be as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another non-limiting aspect of the invention, a polypeptide of the invention may be a bispecific polypeptide that comprises at least one amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against a heterodimeric cytokine (or against at least one subunit thereof), and at least one amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against a receptor for a heterodimeric cytokine (or against at least one subunit thereof). In particular, in this aspect of the invention, a polypeptide of the invention may comprise at least amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against a heterodimeric cytokine (or at least one subunit thereof), and at least one amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against a receptor for said heterodimeric cytokine (or at least one subunit thereof), i.e. against the cognate receptor for said heterodimeric cytokine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is expected that such bispecific polypeptides may act as agonists of heterodimeric cytokines, their receptors, and heterodimeric cytokine-mediated signalling, i.e. by promoting or facilitating binding of the heterodimeric cytokine to its receptor, and/or by stabilizing the ligand/receptor complex upon binding of the heterodimeric cytokine to its receptor. For this purpose, such bispecific polypeptides preferably comprise amino acid sequences that do not neutralize binding of the heterodimeric cytokine to the receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the amino acid sequences that are chosen to form the construct, it is further expected that such bispecific polypeptides may also be designed to act as an antagonists, i.e. link the cytokine to the receptor without activating it, act as a dominant negative regulator since the receptor is then occupied and inactive).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific polypeptides as described herein can also be linked to a Fc portion as described in Applicant's copending application entitled “Immunoglobulin constructs”, which has the same filing date as this application, Dec. 4, 2007.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, a bispecific polypeptide that is directed against a heterodimeric cytokine and against a receptor that is not the cognate receptor for said heterodimeric cytokine, may also be used to modulate the signalling that is mediated by the cytokine against which it is directed and (in particular) by the receptor against which it is directed. For example, a bispecific anti-IL12p35 and anti-IL23R polypeptide of the invention could link IL12 to the IL23 receptor and trigger a IL23 signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the above bispecific polypeptides may comprise:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nat least one amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against IL-12 (or at least one subunit thereof, and preferably the p35 subunit), and at least one amino acid sequence of the invention that that is directed against the receptor for IL-12 (or at least one subunit thereof, and preferably the IL-12Rbeta-2 subunit).\n \nat least one amino acid sequence of the invention that that is directed against IL-23 (or at least one subunit thereof, and preferably the p19 subunit), and at least one amino acid sequence of the invention that that is directed against the receptor for IL-23 (or at least one subunit thereof; and preferably the IL-23 subunit); or\n \nat least one amino acid sequence of the invention that that is directed against IL-27 (or at least one subunit thereof, and preferably the p28 subunit), and at least one amino acid sequence of the invention that that is directed against the receptor for IL-27 (or at least one subunit thereof, and preferably the WSX-1 subunit).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAgain, such amino acid sequences and polypeptides may all be as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen an amino acid sequence or polypeptide of the invention is directed against a heterodimeric cytokine, it may modulate (as defined herein) heterodimeric cytokine-mediated signalling (as defined herein) in several different ways. For example, and although the invention in its broadest sense is not limited to any specific explanation, hypothesis or mechanism, it may be that such an amino acid sequence or polypeptide, upon binding to the heterodimeric cytokine (or to at least one subunit thereof):\n\n \n \n \n \n \nprevents, reduces or inhibits (in part or in full) binding of said heterodimeric cytokine to its receptor (or to at least one subunit thereof);\n \nprevents, reduces, inhibits the association (i.e. the heterodimerization) of the heterodimeric cytokine (e.g. of its subunits);\n \ndestabilizes the heterodimeric cytokine or otherwise influences the conformation of the heterodimeric cytokine or prevents or reduces the ability of the heterodimeric cytokine to change its confirmation, in particular so as to fully or partially reduce its ability to bind to its receptor (or to at least one subunit thereof) or, upon binding to its receptor, to trigger receptor-mediated signalling;\n \nstill allows the heterodimeric cytokine to bind to its receptor (or to at least one subunit thereof), but upon such binding prevents, reduces, inhibits (in part or in full) the activation and/or dimerization of the receptor (i.e. where the receptor associates upon ligand binding, as is for example the case for the IL-23 receptor, see Parham et al., supra);\n \nor otherwise prevents, reduces or inhibits the signalling that is caused by binding of the heterodimeric cytokine to its receptor\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThus, according to one non-limiting aspect, an amino acid sequence or polypeptide of the invention that is directed against a heterodimeric cytokine (and that may further be as described herein) is such that, upon binding to the heterodimeric cytokine, it prevents, reduces or inhibits binding of said heterodimeric cytokine to its receptor or to at least one subunit thereof (i.e. compared to the binding of the heterodimeric cytokine to the same receptor without the presence of the amino acid sequence or polypeptide, and by at least 1%, such as by at least 5%, for example by at least 10%, at least 30%, at least 50%, at least 70% and up to 90% or more, as determined by a suitable assay, such as one of the assays mentioned herein and/or used in the Experimental Part).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another non-limiting aspect, an amino acid sequence or polypeptide of the

heterodimeric cytokine to its receptor (or to at least one subunit of the receptor), it prevents, reduces or inhibits activation and/or association of its receptor (i.e. compared to the association of the receptor mediated by the heterodimeric cytokine without the presence of the amino acid sequence or polypeptide, and by at least 1%, such as by at least 5%, for example by at least 10%, at least

compared to the signalling following heterodimeric cytokine-mediated association of the receptor without the presence of the amino acid sequence or polypeptide, and by at least 1%, such as by at least 5%, for example by at least 10%, at least 30%, at least 50%, at least 70% and up to 90% or more, as determined by a suitable assay, such as one of the assays mentioned herein and/or used in the Experimental Part).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, according to a preferred aspect, an amino acid sequence or polypeptide of the invention that is directed against a heterodimeric cytokine (and that may further be as described herein) is such that, upon binding to the heterodimeric cytokine, it prevents, reduces or inhibits the heterodimeric cytokine-mediated signalling (as defined herein) associated with said heterodimeric cytokine and/or with its receptor (i.e. compared to the heterodimeric cytokine-mediated signalling mediated by the heterodimeric cytokines without the presence of the amino acid sequence or polypeptide, and by at least 1%, such as by at least 5%, for example by at least 10%, at least 30%, at least 50%, at least 70% and up to 90% or more, as determined by a suitable assay, such as one of the assays mentioned herein and/or used in the Experimental Part).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain, such amino acid sequences and polypeptides may all be as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen an amino acid sequence (such as the p19+ sequences, p19− sequences, p40+ sequences, p40− sequences, p35 sequences, IL-27 sequences, IL-12Rb1 sequences, IL-12Rb2 sequences and IL-23 sequences described herein) or polypeptide (such as the—for example multivalent, multispecific and/or biparatopic—constructs described herein that comprise at least one p19+ sequence, p19− sequence, p40+ sequence, p40− sequence, p35 sequence, IL-27 sequence, IL-12Rb1 sequence, IL-12Rb2 sequence and/or IL-23 sequence) of the invention is directed against a receptor for a heterodimeric cytokine, it may modulate (as defined herein) heterodimeric cytokine-mediated signalling (as defined herein) in several different ways. For example, and although the invention in its broadest sense is not limited to any specific explanation, hypothesis or mechanism, it may be that such an amino acid sequence or polypeptide, upon binding to the receptor (or to at least one subunit thereof):\n\n \n \n \n \n \nprevents, reduces or inhibits (in part or in full) binding of the ligand (i.e. of the heterodimeric cytokine that is the

be triggered by binding of the ligand to the receptor (for example, and without limitation, influencing the conformation of the receptor or by reducing the ability of the receptor to change its confirmation)\n \nprevents, reduces, inhibits the activation and/or association (e.g. dimerization) of the receptor (e.g. of its subunits), and in particular the association of the receptor that is triggered by binding of the ligand (i.e. of the heterodimeric cytokine that is the ligand of the receptor) to the receptor (or to at least one subunit thereof), as is for example the case for the the

further be as described herein) is such that, upon binding to the receptor (e.g. to at least one subunit thereof), it prevents, reduces or inhibits binding of its ligand to said receptor or to at least one subunit thereof (i.e. compared to the binding of the ligand to said receptor without the presence of the amino acid sequence or polypeptide, and by at least 1%, such as by at least 5%, for example by at least 10%, at least 30%, at least 50%, at least 70% and up to 90% or more, as determined by a suitable assay, such as one of the assays mentioned herein and/or used in the Experimental Part).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one non-limiting aspect, an amino acid sequence or polypeptide of the invention that is directed against a receptor for a heterodimeric cytokine (and that may further be as described herein) is such that, upon binding to the receptor (e.g. to at least one subunit thereof), allows the ligand to bind to the receptor, but prevents, reduces or inhibits the signalling that is (or normally would be) triggered by binding of the ligand to the receptor or to at least one subunit thereof (i.e. compared to the signalling upon binding of the ligand to said receptor without the presence of the amino acid sequence or polypeptide, and by at least 1%, such as by at least 5%, for example by at least 10%, at least 30%, at least 50%, at least 70% and up to 90% or more, as determined by a suitable assay, such as one of the assays mentioned herein and/or used in the Experimental Part).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another non-limiting aspect, an amino acid sequence or polypeptide of the invention that is directed against a receptor for a heterodimeric cytokine (and that may further be as described herein) is such that, upon binding to the receptor (or to at least one subunit thereof), it prevents, reduces or inhibits activation and/or association of the receptor, and in particular ligand-mediated association of the receptor (i.e. compared to the ligand-mediated association of the receptor without the presence of the amino acid sequence or polypeptide, and by at least 1%, such as by at least 5%, for example by at least 10%, at least 30%, at

acid sequences and polypeptides may all be as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be clear to the skilled person that the above amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention will generally act as antagonists of heterodimeric cytokine-mediated signalling (by which is generally meant herein the signalling associated with the heterodimeric cytokine and/or with the receptor for the heterodimeric cytokine, and in particular the signalling that is caused by binding of a heterodimeric cytokine to its receptor, as well as the biological mechanisms and effects that are triggered by such signalling).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, the invention also relates to amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention that act as agonists of heterodimeric cytokine-mediated signalling. For example, such agonists may be amino acid sequences or polypeptides of the invention that can bind to a receptor for a heterodimeric cytokine (such as the receptor for IL-12, IL-23, IL-27 or IL-35) or to at least one subunit thereof so as to trigger receptor mediated signalling. It is also expected that the some of the above-described bispecific polypeptides that comprise at least one amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against a heterodimeric cytokine (or against at least one subunit thereof) and at least one amino acid sequence of the invention that is directed against a receptor for said heterodimeric cytokine (or against at least one subunit thereof) may act as agonists for heterodimeric cytokine-mediated signalling, as further described herein. For this purpose, such bispecific polypeptides preferably comprise amino acid sequences that do not neutralize binding of the heterodimeric cytokine to the receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also within the scope of the invention to use parts, fragments, analogs, mutants, variants, alleles and/or derivatives of the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention, and/or to use proteins or polypeptides comprising or essentially consisting of one or more of such parts, fragments, analogs, mutants, variants, alleles and/or derivatives, as long as these are suitable for the uses envisaged herein. Such parts, fragments, analogs, mutants, variants, alleles and/or derivatives will usually contain (at least part of) a functional antigen-binding site for binding against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors; and more preferably will be capable of specific binding to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, and even more preferably capable of binding to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K\nD\n-value (actual or apparent), a K\nA\n-value (actual or apparent), a k\non\nrate and/or a k\noff\n-rate, or alternatively as an IC\n50 \nvalue, as further described herein) that is as defined herein. Some non-limiting examples of such parts, fragments, analogs, mutants, variants, alleles, derivatives, proteins and/or polypeptides will become clear from the further description herein. Additional fragments or polypeptides of the invention may also be provided by suitably combining (i.e. by linking or genetic fusion) one or more (smaller) parts or fragments as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, which will be further described herein, such analogs, mutants, variants, alleles, derivatives have an increased half-life in serum (as further described herein) compared to the amino acid sequence from which they have been derived. For example, an amino acid sequence of the invention may be linked (chemically or otherwise) to one or more groups or moieties that extend the half-life (such as PEG), so as to provide a derivative of an amino acid sequence of the invention with increased half-life. In one specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequences of the invention (such as the p19+ sequences, p19− sequences, p40+ sequences, p40− sequences, p35 sequences, IL-27 sequences, IL-12Rb I sequences, IL-12Rb2 sequences and IL-23 sequences described herein) may be amino acid sequences that comprise an immunoglobulin fold or may be amino acid sequences that, under suitable conditions (such as physiological conditions) are capable of forming an immunoglobulin fold (i.e. by folding). Reference is inter alia made to the review by Halaby et al., J. (1999) Protein Eng. 12, 563-71. Preferably, when properly folded so as to form an immunoglobulin fold, such an amino acid sequence is capable of specific binding (as defined herein) to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors; and more preferably capable of binding to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K\nD\n-value (actual or apparent), a K\nA\n-value (actual or apparent), a k\non\n-rate and/or a k\noff\n-rate, or alternatively as an IC\n50 \nvalue, as further described herein) that is as defined herein. Also, parts, fragments, analogs, mutants, variants, alleles and/or derivatives of such amino acid sequences are preferably such that they comprise an immunoglobulin fold or are capable for forming, under suitable conditions, an immunoglobulin fold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, but without limitation, the amino acid sequences of the invention (such as the p19+ sequences, p19− sequences, p40+ sequences, p40− sequences, p35 sequences, IL-27 sequences, IL-12Rb1 sequences, IL-12Rb2 sequences and IL-23 sequences described herein) may be amino acid sequences that essentially consist of 4 framework regions (FR1 to FR4 respectively) and 3 complementarity determining regions (CDR1 to CDR3 respectively); or any suitable fragment of such an amino acid sequence (which will then usually contain at least some of the amino acid residues that form at least one of the CDR's, as further described herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences of the invention (such as the p19+ sequences, p19− sequences, p40+ sequences, p40− sequences, p35 sequences, IL-27 sequences, IL-12Rb1 sequences, IL-12Rb2 sequences and IL-23 sequences described herein) may in particular be an immunoglobulin sequence or a suitable fragment thereof, and more in particular be an immunoglobulin variable domain sequence or a suitable fragment thereof, such as light chain variable domain sequence (e.g. a V\nL\n-sequence) or a suitable fragment thereof; or a heavy chain variable domain sequence (e.g. a V\nH\n-sequence) or a suitable fragment thereof. When the amino acid sequence of the invention is a heavy chain variable domain sequence, it may be a heavy chain variable domain sequence that is derived from a conventional four-chain antibody (such as, without limitation, a V\nH \nsequence that is derived from a human antibody) or be a so-called V\nHH\n-sequence (as defined herein) that is derived from a so-called “heavy chain antibody” (as defined herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, it should be noted that the invention is not limited as to the origin of the amino acid sequence of the invention (or of the nucleotide sequence of the invention used to express it), nor as to the way that the amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence of the invention is (or has been) generated or obtained. Thus, the amino acid sequences of the invention may be naturally occurring amino acid sequences (from any suitable species) or synthetic or semi-synthetic amino acid sequences. In a specific but non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence is a naturally occurring immunoglobulin sequence (from any suitable species) or a synthetic or semi-synthetic immunoglobulin sequence, including but not limited to “humanized” (as defined herein) immunoglobulin sequences (such as partially or fully humanized mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin sequences, and in particular partially or fully humanized V\nHH \nsequences or Nanobodies), “camelized” (as defined herein) immunoglobulin sequences, as well as immunoglobulin sequences that have been obtained by techniques such as affinity maturation (for example, starting from synthetic, random or naturally occurring immunoglobulin sequences), CDR grafting, veneering, combining fragments derived from different immunoglobulin sequences, PCR assembly using overlapping primers, and similar techniques for engineering immunoglobulin sequences well known to the skilled person; or any suitable combination of any of the foregoing. Reference is for example made to the standard handbooks, as well as to the further description and prior art mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, the nucleotide sequences of the invention may be naturally occurring nucleotide sequences or synthetic or semi-synthetic sequences, and may for example be sequences that are isolated by PCR from a suitable naturally occurring template (e.g. DNA or RNA isolated from a cell), nucleotide sequences that have been isolated from a library (and in particular, an expression library), nucleotide sequences that have been prepared by introducing mutations into a naturally occurring nucleotide sequence (using any suitable technique known per se, such as mismatch PCR), nucleotide sequence that have been prepared by PCR using overlapping primers, or nucleotide sequences that have been prepared using techniques for DNA synthesis known per se.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences of the invention (such as the p19+ sequences, p19− sequences, p40+ sequences, p40− sequences, p35 sequences, IL-27 sequences, IL-12Rb1 sequences, IL-12Rb2 sequences and IL-23 sequences described herein) may in particular be a domain antibody (or an amino acid sequence that is suitable for use as a domain antibody), a single domain antibody (or an amino acid sequence that is suitable for use as a single domain antibody), a “dAb” (or an amino acid sequence that is suitable for use as a dAb) or a Nanobody™ (as defined herein, and including but not limited to a V\nHH \nsequence); other single variable domains, or any suitable fragment of any one thereof. For a general description of (single) domain antibodies, reference is also made to the prior art cited above, as well as to \nEP\n 0 368 684. For the term “dAb's”, reference is for example made to Ward et al. (\nNature\n 1989 Oct. 12; 341 (6242): 544-6), to Holt et al., Trends Biotechnol., 2003, 21(10:484-490; as well as to for example WO 06/030220, WO 06/003388 and other published patent applications of Domantis Ltd. It should also be noted that, although less preferred in the context of the present invention because they are not of mammalian origin, single domain antibodies or single variable domains can be derived from certain species of shark (for example, the so-called “IgNAR domains”, see for example WO 05/18629).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the amino acid sequence of the invention may be a Nanobody™ (as defined herein) or a suitable fragment thereof. [Note: Nanobody™, Nanobodies™ and Nanoclone™ are registered trademarks of Ablynx N.V.] Such Nanobodies directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors will also be referred to herein as “Nanobodies of the invention”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor a general description of Nanobodies, reference is made to the further description below, as well as to the prior art cited herein. In this respect, it should however be noted that this description and the prior art mainly described Nanobodies of the so-called “\nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 class” (i.e. Nanobodies with a high degree of sequence homology to human germline sequences of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 class such as DP-47, DP-51 or DP-29), which Nanobodies form a preferred aspect of this invention. It should however be noted that the invention in its broadest sense generally covers any type of Nanobody directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, and for example also covers the Nanobodies belonging to the so-called “\nV\n \n \n \nH\n4 class” (i.e. Nanobodies with a high degree of sequence homology to human germline sequences of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n4 class such as DP-78), as for example described in the U.S. \nprovisional application\n 60/792,279 by Ablynx N.V. entitled “DP-78-like Nanobodies” filed on Apr. 14, 2006 (see also PCT/EP2007/003259 and WO 07/118670).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, Nanobodies (in particular V\nHH \nsequences and partially humanized Nanobodies) can in particular be characterized by the presence of one or more “Hallmark residues” (as described herein) in one or more of the framework sequences (again as further described herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, generally, a Nanobody can be defined as an amino acid sequence with the (general) structure\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nin which FR1 to FR4 refer to \nframework regions\n 1 to 4, respectively, and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the \ncomplementarity determining regions\n 1 to 3, respectively, and in which one or more of the Hallmark residues are as further defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, a Nanobody can be an amino acid sequence with the (general) structure\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nin which FR1 to FR4 refer to \nframework regions\n 1 to 4, respectively, and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the \ncomplementarity determining regions\n 1 to 3, respectively, and in which the framework sequences are as further defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore in particular, a Nanobody can be an amino acid sequence with the (general) structure\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nin which FR1 to FR4 refer to \nframework regions\n 1 to 4, respectively, and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the \ncomplementarity determining regions\n 1 to 3, respectively, and in which:\n\n \n \n \ni) preferably one or more of the amino acid residues at \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 11, 37, 44, 45, 47, 83, 84, 103, 104 and 108 according to the Kabat numbering are chosen from the Hallmark residues mentioned in Table A-4 below; and in which:\n \nii) said amino acid sequence has at least 80% amino acid identity with at least one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 1 to 22, in which for the purposes of determining the degree of amino acid identity, the amino acid residues that form the CDR sequences (indicated with X in the sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 1 to 22) are disregarded.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn these Nanobodies, the CDR sequences are generally as further defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the invention also relates to such Nanobodies that can bind to (as defined herein) and/or are directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, to suitable fragments thereof, as well as to polypeptides that comprise or essentially consist of one or more of such Nanobodies and/or suitable fragments.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nSome (other) examples of suitable framework sequences are:\n \nFor framework 1: the \nframework\n 1 sequences of \nFR1 Sequences Group\n 1; \nFR1 Sequences Group\n 8; FR1 Sequences Group 15; FR1 \nSequences Group\n 22; FR1 Sequences Group 29; FR1 Sequences Group 36; FR1 \nSequences Group\n 43; FR1 \nSequences Group\n 50 and/or FR1 Sequences Group 57 (see Table A-1 below), or amino acid sequences that have no more than 5, such as 4, 3, 2, or only 1 amino acid difference (as defined herein) with one or more of said \nframework\n 1 sequences (in which case Optional Condition I.

the invention that comprise one or more of such amino acid sequences (which may be as further described herein, and may for example be bispecific and/or biparatopic polypeptides as described herein), and nucleic acid sequences that encode such amino acid sequences and polypeptides.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAccordingly, some particularly preferred Nanobodies of the invention are Nanobodies which

form the CDR sequences are disregarded. In this respect, reference is also made to the various groups of \nFramework\n 1 sequences, \nFramework\n 2 sequences, \nFramework\n 3 sequences and \nFramework\n 4 sequences mentioned Table A-1 (see also \nFIGS. 11 to 19\n) (with respect to the amino acid residues at \npositions\n 1 to 4 and 27 to 30 of the \nframework\n 1 sequences, reference is also made to the comments made below. Thus, for determining the degree of amino acid identity, these residues are preferably disregarded);\n \n\n\n \n \n \nand in which:\n\n \n \n \nii) preferably one or more of the amino acid residues at \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 11, 37, 44, 45, 47, 83, 84, 103, 104 and 108 according to the Kabat numbering are chosen from the Hallmark residues mentioned in Table A-4 below.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn these Nanobodies, the CDR sequences are generally as further defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain, such Nanobodies may be derived in any suitable manner and from any suitable source, and may for example be naturally occurring V\nHH \nsequences (i.e. from a suitable species of Camelid) or synthetic or semi-synthetic amino acid sequences, including but not limited to “humanized” (as defined herein) Nanobodies, “camelized” (as defined herein) immunoglobulin sequences (and in particular camelized heavy chain variable domain sequences), as well as Nanobodies that have been obtained by techniques such as affinity maturation (for example, starting from synthetic, random or naturally occurring immunoglobulin sequences), CDR grafting, veneering, combining fragments derived from different immunoglobulin sequences, PCR assembly using overlapping primers, and similar techniques for engineering immunoglobulin sequences well known to the skilled person; or any suitable combination of any of the foregoing as further described herein. Also, when a Nanobody comprises a V\nHH \nsequence, said Nanobody may be suitably humanized, as further described herein, so as to provide one or more further (partially or fully) humanized Nanobodies of the invention. Similarly, when a Nanobody comprises a synthetic or semi-synthetic sequence (such as a partially humanized sequence), said Nanobody may optionally be further suitably humanized, again as described herein, again so as to provide one or more further (partially or fully) humanized Nanobodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, humanized Nanobodies may be amino acid sequences that are as generally defined for Nanobodies in the previous paragraphs, but in which at least one amino acid residue is present (and in particular, in at least one of the framework residues) that is and/or that corresponds to a humanizing substitution (as defined herein). Some preferred, but non-limiting humanizing substitutions (and suitable combinations thereof) will become clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein. In addition, or alternatively, other potentially useful humanizing substitutions can be ascertained by comparing the sequence of the framework regions of a naturally occurring V\nHH \nsequence with the corresponding framework sequence of one or more closely related human V\nHH \nsequences, after which one or more of the potentially useful humanizing substitutions (or combinations thereof) thus determined can be introduced into said V\nHH \nsequence (in any manner known per se, as further described herein) and the resulting humanized V\nHH \nsequences can be tested for affinity for the target, for stability, for ease and level of expression, and/or for other desired properties. In this way, by means of a limited degree of trial and error, other suitable humanizing substitutions (or suitable combinations thereof) can be determined by the skilled person based on the disclosure herein. Also, based on the foregoing, (the framework regions of) a Nanobody may be partially humanized or fully humanized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome particularly preferred humanized Nanobodies of the invention are humanized variants of the Nanobodies of SEQ ID NO's: 1890 to 2141, 2485 to 2490 and/or 2502 to 2529, which may for example, be humanized variants of Nanobodies that are directed against p19 (for example, humanized variants of Nanobodies that are p19+ sequences or p19− sequences, for example a humanized variant of one of the Nanobodies shown in \nFIGS. 20\n and \n21\n, respectively), against p40 (for example humanized variants of Nanobodies that are p40− sequences or p40+ sequences, for example a humanized variant of one of the Nanobodies shown in \nFIGS. 22 and 23\n, respectively), against p35 (for example a humanized variant of one of the Nanobodies shown in \nFIG. 24\n), against 11-27 (for example of one of the Nanobodies shown in \nFIG. 26\n), against IL-12Rb1 (for example a humanized variant of one of the Nanobodies shown in \nFIG. 27\n), against IL-12Rb2 (for example a humanized variant of one of the Nanobodies shown in \nFIG. 28\n), or against IL-23R (for example a humanized variant of one of the Nanobodies shown in \nFIG. 29\n). Examples of such humanized Nanobodies are given in SEQ ID NO's: 2559 to 2614 (see also \nFIG. 31\n), and the skilled person will be able to find other suitable humanized variants based on the disclosure herein, optionally after some limited trial-and-error.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, some other preferred Nanobodies of the invention are Nanobodies which can bind (as further defined herein) to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors and which:\n\n \n \n \ni) are a humanized variant of one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 1890 to 2141, 2485 to 2490 and/or 2502 to 2529; and/or\n \nii) have at least 80% amino acid identity with at least one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO's: 1890 to 2141, 2485 to 2490 and/or 2502 to 2529, in which for the purposes of determining the degree of amino acid identity, the amino acid residues that form the CDR sequences are disregarded;\n \n\n\n \n \n \nand in which:\n\n \n \n \ni) preferably one or more of the amino acid residues at \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 11, 37, 44, 45, 47, 83, 84, 103, 104 and 108 according to the Kabat numbering are chosen from the Hallmark residues mentioned in Table A-4 below.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention relates to nanobodies that are directed against p19 from mouse. Some non-limiting examples of such nanobodies are given in SEQ ID NO's: 2491-2501.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another specific aspect of the invention, the invention provides a number of stretches of amino acid residues (i.e. small peptides) that are particularly suited for binding to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors (i.e. to p19, p40, p35, IL-12, IL-23, IL-27, IL-12Rb1, IL-12Rb2, IL-23R, the cognate receptor for IL-12 or the cognate receptor for IL-23, respectively, as further described herein). These stretches of amino acid residues may be present in, and/or may be corporated into, an amino acid sequence of the invention, in particular in such a way that they form (part of) the antigen binding site of an amino acid sequence of the invention. As these stretches of amino acid residues were first generated as CDR sequences of heavy chain antibodies or V\nHH \nsequences that were raised against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors (or may be based on and/or derived from such CDR sequences, as further described herein), they will also generally be referred to herein as “CDR sequences” (i.e. as CDR1 sequences, CDR2 sequences and CDR3 sequences, respectively). It should however be noted that the invention in its broadest sense is not limited to a specific structural role or function that these stretches of amino acid residues may have in an amino acid sequence of the invention, as long as these stretches of amino acid residues allow the amino acid sequence of the invention to bind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors. Thus, generally, the invention in its broadest sense comprises any amino acid sequence that is capable of binding to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors and that comprises one or more CDR sequences as described herein, and in particular a suitable combination of two or more such CDR sequences, that are suitably linked to each other via one or more further amino acid sequences, such that the entire amino acid sequence forms a binding domain and/or binding unit that is capable of binding to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors. It should however also be noted that the presence of only one such CDR sequence in an amino acid sequence of the invention may by itself already be sufficient to provide an amino acid sequence of the invention that is capable of binding to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors; reference is for example again made to the so-called “Expedite fragments” described in WO 03/050531.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in another specific, but non-limiting aspect, the amino acid sequence of the invention may be an amino acid sequence that comprises at least one amino acid sequence that is chosen from the group consisting of the CDR1 sequences, CDR2 sequences and CDR3 sequences that are described herein from or any suitable combination thereof. Particularly suitable combinations will become clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein. In particular, an amino acid sequence of the invention may be an amino acid sequence that comprises at least one antigen binding site, wherein said antigen binding site comprises at least one amino acid sequence that is chosen from the group consisting of the CDR1 sequences, CDR2 sequences and CDR3 sequences that are described herein or any suitable combination thereof, such as the combinations that are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, in this aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence of the invention may be any amino acid sequence that comprises at least one stretch of amino acid residues, in which said stretch of amino acid residues has an amino acid sequence that corresponds to the sequence of at least one of the CDR sequences described herein. Such an amino acid sequence may or may not comprise an immunoglobulin fold. For example, and without limitation, such an amino acid sequence may be a suitable fragment of an immunoglobulin sequence that comprises at least one such CDR sequence, but that is not large enough to form a (complete) immunoglobulin fold (reference is for example again made to the “Expedite fragments” described in WO 03/050531). Alternatively, such an amino acid sequence may be a suitable “protein scaffold” that comprises least one stretch of amino acid residues that corresponds to such a CDR sequence (i.e. as part of its antigen binding site). Suitable scaffolds for presenting amino acid sequences will be clear to the skilled person, and for example comprise, without limitation, to binding scaffolds based on or derived from immunoglobulins (i.e. other than the immunoglobulin sequences already described herein), protein scaffolds derived from protein A domains (such as Affibodies™), tendamistat, fibronectin, lipocalin, CTLA-4, T-cell receptors, designed ankyrin repeats, avimers and PDZ domains (Binz et al., Nat. \nBiotech\n 2005, Vol 23:1257), and binding moieties based on DNA or RNA including but not limited to DNA or RNA aptamers (Ulrich et al., Comb Chem \nHigh Throughput Screen\n 2006 9(8):619-32).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain, any amino acid sequence of the invention that comprises one or more of these CDR sequences is preferably such that it can specifically bind (as defined herein) to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, and more in particular such that it can bind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K\nD\n-value (actual or apparent), a K\nA\n-value (actual or apparent), a k\non\n-rate and/or a k\noff\n-rate, or alternatively as an IC\n50 \nvalue, as further described herein), that is as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the amino acid sequences of the invention may be amino acid sequences that are directed against p19 (which may be “p19+ sequences” or “p19− sequences”, both as defined herein); amino acid sequences that are directed against p40 (which may be “p40+ sequences” or “p40− sequences”, both as defined herein); amino acid sequences that are directed against p35; amino acid sequences that are directed against IL-23 (which may be amino acid sequences that are directed against p19 or against p40); amino acid sequences that are directed against IL-12 (which may be amino acid sequences that are directed against p35 or against p40); amino acid sequences that are directed against IL-23 (which may be amino acid sequences that are directed against p19 or against p40); amino acid sequences that are directed against IL-27; amino acid sequences that are directed against IL-12Rb1; amino acid sequences that are directed against IL-12Rb2; amino acid sequences that are directed against IL-23R; amino acid sequences that are directed against the cognate receptor of IL-12 (which may be amino acid sequences that are directed against IL-12Rb1 or IL-12Rb2); and/or amino acid sequences that are directed against the cognate receptor of IL-23 (which may be amino acid sequences that are directed against IL-12Rb1 or IL-23R). These amino acid sequences may be as further described herein and form further aspects of the invention (as do nucleotide sequences/nucleic acids encoding the same, polypeptides comprising the same and the use of these amino acid sequences in such constructs, methods for preparing the same and uses of the same, all as further described herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA) “p19+ Sequences”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne specific, but non-limiting aspect relates to “p19+ sequences”, which generally are defined herein as amino acid sequences of the invention that are directed against (as defined herein) the p19 subunit (as present in for example IL-23), and that are capable of modulating, neutralizing, blocking and/or inhibiting the binding of a heterodimeric cytokine comprising a p19 subunit to its receptor, and in particular capable of are capable of modulating, neutralizing, blocking and/or inhibiting the binding of IL-23 to IL-23R (for example in the alpha-screen assay of Example 19 or 22).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nP19+ sequences may generally be as further described herein (for example, in terms of affinity, specificity etc. for p19) for amino acid sequences of the invention in general. Also, as described herein for the amino acid sequences of the invention, the p19+ sequences are preferably such that they form or are capable of forming (optionally after suitable folding) a single antigen binding domain or antigen binding unit, and may for example be amino acid sequences that comprise an immunoglobulin fold, amino acid sequences that are comprised of four framework regions and three CDR's, and may in particular be domain antibodies, single domain antibodies, VHH's, “dAb's” or Nanobodies (all as further described herein), or suitable fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one particular aspect, a p19+ sequence may comprise one or more stretches of amino acid residues chosen from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n \na) the amino acid sequences from the “\nCDR1 Sequences Group\n 2” (as defined and listed in Table A-1; see also \nFIG. 11\n);\n \nb) amino acid sequences that have at least 80% amino acid identity with at least one of the amino acid sequences from the “\nCDR1 Sequences Group\n 2”;\n \nc) amino acid sequences that have 3, 2, or 1 amino acid difference with at least one of the amino acid sequences from the “\nCDR1 Sequences Group\n 2”;\n \nd) the amino acid sequences from the “\nCDR2 Sequences Group\n 4” (as defined and listed in Table A-1; see also \nFIG. 11\n);\n \ne) amino acid sequences that have at least 80% amino acid identity with at least one of the amino acid sequences from the “\nCDR2 Sequences Group\n 4”;\n \nf) amino acid sequences that have 3, 2, or 1 amino acid difference with at least one of the amino acid sequences from the “\nCDR2 Sequences Group\n 4”;\n \ng) the amino acid sequences from the “\nCDR3 Sequences Group\n 6” (as defined and listed in Table A-1; see also \nFIG. 11\n);\n \nh) amino acid sequences that have at least 80% amino acid identity with at least one of the amino acid sequences from the “\nCDR3 Sequences Group\n 6”;\n \ni) amino acid sequences that have 3, 2, or 1 amino acid difference with at least one of the amino acid sequences from the “\nCDR3 Sequences Group\n 6”;\n \n\n\n \n \n \nor any suitable combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, when an amino acid sequence of the invention contains one or more amino acid sequences according to b) and/or c), Optional Condition I, Optional Condition II and/or Optional Condition III (all as defined herein) may apply to said amino acid sequence (i.e. compared to the original amino acid sequence according to a)).

The invention also relates to nucleotide sequences/nucleic acids encoding the same, to preparations and formulations comprising the same, to methods for producing the same and to uses of the same, all as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the amino acid sequence of the invention (such as the p19+ sequences, p19− sequences, p40+ sequences, p40− sequences, p35 sequences, IL-27 sequences, IL-12Rb1 sequences, IL-12Rb2 sequences and IL-23 sequences described herein), the framework sequences may be any suitable framework sequences, and examples of suitable framework sequences will be clear to the skilled person, for example on the basis the standard handbooks and the further disclosure and prior art mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe framework sequences are preferably (a suitable combination of) immunoglobulin framework sequences or framework sequences that have been derived from immunoglobulin framework sequences (for example, by humanization or camelization). For example, the framework sequences may be framework sequences derived from a light chain variable domain (e.g. a V\nL\n-sequence) and/or from a heavy chain variable domain (e.g. a V\nH\n-sequence). In one particularly preferred aspect, the framework sequences are either framework sequences that have been derived from V\nHH\n-sequence (in which said framework sequences may optionally have been partially or fully humanized) or are conventional V\nH \nsequences that have been camelized (as defined herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe framework sequences are preferably such that the amino acid sequence of the invention is a domain antibody (or an amino acid sequence that is suitable for use as a domain antibody); is a single domain antibody (or an amino acid sequence that is suitable for use as a single domain antibody); is a “dAb” (or an amino acid sequence that is suitable for use as a dAb); or is a Nanobody™ (including but not limited to V\nHH \nsequence). Again, suitable framework sequences will be clear to the skilled person, for example on the basis the standard handbooks and the further disclosure and prior art mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the framework sequences present in the amino acid sequences of the invention may contain one or more of Hallmark residues (as defined herein), such that the amino acid sequence of the invention is a Nanobody™. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of (suitable combinations of) such framework sequences will become clear from the further disclosure herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain, as generally described herein for the amino acid sequences of the invention, it is also possible to use suitable fragments (or combinations of fragments) of any of the foregoing, such as fragments that contain one or more CDR sequences, suitably flanked by and/or linked via one or more framework sequences (for example, in the same order as these CDR's and framework sequences may occur in the full-sized immunoglobulin sequence from which the fragment has been derived). Such fragments may also again be such that they comprise or can form an immunoglobulin fold, or alternatively be such that they do not comprise or cannot form an immunoglobulin fold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific aspect, such a fragment comprises a single CDR sequence as described herein (and in particular a CDR3 sequence), that is flanked on each side by (part of) a framework sequence (and in particular, part of the framework sequence(s) that, in the immunoglobulin sequence from which the fragment is derived, are adjacent to said CDR sequence. For example, a CDR3 sequence may be preceded by (part of) a FR3 sequence and followed by (part of) a FR4 sequence). Such a fragment may also contain a disulphide bridge, and in particular a disulphide bridge that links the two framework regions that precede and follow the CDR sequence, respectively (for the purpose of forming such a disulphide bridge, cysteine residues that naturally occur in said framework regions may be used, or alternatively cysteine residues may be synthetically added to or introduced into said framework regions). For a further description of these “Expedite fragments”, reference is again made to WO 03/050531, as well as to the US provisional application of Ablynx N.V. entitled “Peptides capable of binding to serum proteins” of Ablynx N.V. (inventors: Revets, Hilde Adi Pierrette; Kolkman, Joost Alexander; and Hoogenboom, Hendricus Renerus Jacobus Mattheus) filed on Dec. 5, 2006 (see also PCT/EP2007/063348).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention relates to a compound or construct, and in particular a protein or polypeptide (also referred to herein as a “compound of the invention” or “polypeptide of the invention”, respectively) that comprises or essentially consists of one or more amino acid sequences of the invention (or suitable fragments thereof), and optionally further comprises one or more other groups, residues, moieties or binding units. As will become clear to the skilled person from the further disclosure herein, such further groups, residues, moieties, binding units or amino acid sequences may or may not provide further functionality to the amino acid sequence of the invention (and/or to the compound or construct in which it is present) and may or may not modify the properties of the amino acid sequence of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, such further groups, residues, moieties or binding units may be one or more additional amino acid sequences, such that the compound or construct is a (fusion) protein or (fusion) polypeptide. In a preferred but non-limiting aspect, said one or more other groups, residues, moieties or binding units are immunoglobulin sequences. Even more preferably, said one or more other groups, residues, moieties or binding units are chosen from the group consisting of domain antibodies, amino acid sequences that are suitable for use as a domain antibody, single domain antibodies, amino acid sequences that are suitable for use as a single domain antibody, “dAb”'s, amino acid sequences that are suitable for use as a dAb, or Nanobodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, such groups, residues, moieties or binding units may for example be chemical groups, residues, moieties, which may or may not by themselves be biologically and/or pharmacologically active. For example, and without limitation, such groups may be linked to the one or more amino acid sequences of the invention so as to provide a “derivative” of an amino acid sequence or polypeptide of the invention, as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso within the scope of the present invention are compounds or constructs, that comprises or essentially consists of one or more derivatives as described herein, and optionally further comprises one or more other groups, residues, moieties or binding units, optionally linked via one or more linkers. Preferably, said one or more other groups, residues, moieties or binding units are amino acid sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the compounds or constructs described above, the one or more amino acid sequences of the invention and the one or more groups, residues, moieties or binding units may be linked directly to each other and/or via one or more suitable linkers or spacers. For example, when the one or more groups, residues, moieties or binding units are amino acid sequences, the linkers may also be amino acid sequences, so that the resulting compound or construct is a fusion (protein) or fusion (polypeptide).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds or polypeptides of the invention can generally be prepared by a method which comprises at least one step of suitably linking the one or more amino acid sequences of the invention to the one or more further groups, residues, moieties or binding units, optionally via the one or more suitable linkers, so as to provide the compound or polypeptide of the invention. Polypeptides of the invention can also be prepared by a method which generally comprises at least the steps of providing a nucleic acid that encodes a polypeptide of the invention, expressing said nucleic acid in a suitable manner, and recovering the expressed polypeptide of the invention. Such methods can be performed in a manner known per se, which will be clear to the skilled person, for example on the basis of the methods and techniques further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe process of designing/selecting and/or preparing a compound or polypeptide of the invention, starting from an amino acid sequence of the invention, is also referred to herein as “formatting” said amino acid sequence of the invention; and an amino acid of the invention that is made part of a compound or polypeptide of the invention is said to be “formatted” or to be “in the format of” said compound or polypeptide of the invention. Examples of ways in which an amino acid sequence of the invention can be formatted and examples of such formats will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein; and such formatted amino acid sequences form a further aspect of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific aspect of the invention, a compound of the invention or a polypeptide of the invention may have an increased half-life, compared to the corresponding amino acid sequence of the invention. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of such compounds and polypeptides will become clear to the skilled person based on the further disclosure herein, and for example comprise amino acid sequences or polypeptides of the invention that have been chemically modified to increase the half-life thereof (for example, by means of pegylation); amino acid sequences of the invention that comprise at least one additional binding site for binding to a serum protein (such as serum albumin; see for \nexample EP\n 0 368 684 B1, page 4); or polypeptides of the invention that comprise at least one amino acid sequence of the invention that is linked to at least one moiety (and in particular at least one amino acid sequence) that increases the half-life of the amino acid sequence of the invention. Examples of polypeptides of the invention that comprise such half-life extending moieties or amino acid sequences will become clear to the skilled person based on the further disclosure herein; and for example include, without limitation, polypeptides in which the one or more amino acid sequences of the invention are suitable linked to one or more serum proteins or fragments thereof (such as (human) serum albumin or suitable fragments thereof) or to one or more binding units that can bind to serum proteins (such as, for example, domain antibodies, amino acid sequences that are suitable for use as a domain antibody, single domain antibodies, amino acid sequences that are suitable for use as a single domain antibody, “dAb”'s, amino acid sequences that are suitable for use as a dAb, or Nanobodies that can bind to serum proteins such as serum albumin (such as human serum albumin), serum immunoglobulins such as IgG, or transferrine; reference is made to the further description and references mentioned herein); polypeptides in which an amino acid sequence of the invention is linked to an Fc portion (such as a human Fc) or a suitable part or fragment thereof; or polypeptides in which the one or more amino acid sequences of the invention are suitable linked to one or more small proteins or peptides that can bind to serum proteins (such as, without limitation, the proteins and peptides described in WO 91/01743, WO 01/45746, WO 02/076489 and to the US provisional application of Ablynx N.V. entitled “Peptides capable of binding to serum proteins” of Ablynx N.V. filed on Dec. 5, 2006 (see also PCT/EP2007/063348 and WO 08/068280) as well as the U.S. provisional applications 61/050,385 and 61/045,690 of Ablynx N.V. both entitled “Improved peptides capable of binding to serum proteins”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the compounds or polypeptides of the invention with increased half-life preferably have a half-life that is at least 1.5 times, preferably at least 2 times, such as at least 5 times, for example at least 10 times or more than 20 times, greater than the half-life of the corresponding amino acid sequence of the invention per se. For example, the compounds or polypeptides of the invention with increased half-life may have a half-life that is increased with more than 1 hours, preferably more than 2 hours, more preferably more than 6 hours, such as more than 12 hours, or even more than 24, 48 or 72 hours, compared to the corresponding amino acid sequence of the invention per se.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, such compounds or polypeptides of the invention have a serum half-life that is increased with more than 1 hours, preferably more than 2 hours, more preferably more than 6 hours, such as more than 12 hours, or even more than 24, 48 or 72 hours, compared to the corresponding amino acid sequence of the invention per se.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, such compounds or polypeptides of the invention exhibit a serum half-life in human of at least about 12 hours, preferably at least 24 hours, more preferably at least 48 hours, even more preferably at least 72 hours or more. For example, compounds or polypeptides of the invention may have a half-life of at least 5 days (such as about 5 to 10 days), preferably at least 9 days (such as about 9 to 14 days), more preferably at least about 10 days (such as about 10 to 15 days), or at least about 11 days (such as about 11 to 16 days), more preferably at least about 12 days (such as about 12 to 18 days or more), or more than 14 days (such as about 14 to 19 days).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome preferred, but non-limiting examples of polypeptides of the invention are:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nthe polypeptides of SEQ 1D NO: 2142; SEQ ID NO: 2143; SEQ ID NO: 2144; SEQ ID NO: 2145; SEQ ID NO: 2146; SEQ ID NO: 2147; SEQ ID NO: 2148; SEQ ID NO: 2149; SEQ ID NO: 2150; SEQ ID NO: 2151; SEQ ID NO: 2152; SEQ ID NO: 2153; SEQ ID NO: 2154; SEQ ID NO: 2155; SEQ ID NO: 2156; SEQ ID NO: 2157; SEQ ID NO: 2158; SEQ ID NO: 2159; SEQ ID NO: 2160; SEQ ID NO: 2161; SEQ ID NO: 2162; SEQ ID NO: 2163; SEQ ID NO: 2164; SEQ ID NO: 2165; SEQ ID NO: 2166; SEQ ID NO: 2167; SEQ ID NO: 2168; SEQ ID NO: 2169; SEQ ID NO: 2530; SEQ ID NO: 2531; SEQ ID NO: 2532; SEQ ID NO: 2533; SEQ ID NO: 2534; SEQ ID NO: 2535; SEQ ID NO: 2536; SEQ ID NO: 2537; SEQ ID NO: 2538; SEQ ID NO: 2539; SEQ ID NO: 2540; SEQ ID NO: 2541; SEQ ID NO: 2542; SEQ ID NO: 2543; SEQ ID NO: 2544; SEQ ID NO: 2545; SEQ ID NO: 2546; SEQ ID NO: 2547; SEQ ID NO: 2548; SEQ ID NO: 2549; SEQ ID NO: 2550; SEQ ID NO: 2551; SEQ ID NO: 2552; SEQ ID NO: 2553; SEQ ID NO: 2554; SEQ ID NO: 2555; SEQ ID NO: 2556; SEQ ID NO: 2557 and/or SEQ ID NO: 2558 (see also \nFIG. 30\n); which are some non-limiting examples of multivalent, multispecific and/or biparatopic polypeptides of the invention that are directed against p19 (i.e. comprising at least one p19+ sequence and/or at least one p19− sequence).

For example, the set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences may encode a set, collection or library of domain antibodies or single domain antibodies, or a set, collection or library of amino acid sequences that are capable of functioning as a domain antibody or single domain antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred aspect of this method, the set, collection or library of amino acid sequences may be an immune set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences, for example derived from a mammal that has been suitably immunized with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors or with a suitable antigenic determinant based thereon or derived therefrom, such as an antigenic part, fragment, region, domain, loop or other epitope thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one particular aspect, said antigenic determinant may be an extracellular part, region, domain, loop or other extracellular epitope(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences may for example encode an immune set, collection or library of heavy chain variable domains or of light chain variable domains.

the amino acid residues mentioned in the Table can be either charged and/or uncharged at such a higher or lower pH, as will be clear to the skilled person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n(4)\nAs is known in the art, the charge of a His residue is greatly dependant upon even small shifts in pH, but a His residu can generally be considered essentially uncharged at a pH of about 6.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\ne) For the purposes of comparing two or more nucleotide sequences, the percentage of “sequence identity” between a first nucleotide sequence and a second nucleotide sequence may be calculated by dividing [the number of nucleotides in the first nucleotide sequence that are identical to the nucleotides at the corresponding positions in the second nucleotide sequence] by [the total number of nucleotides in the first nucleotide sequence] and multiplying by [100%], in which each deletion, insertion, substitution or addition of a nucleotide in the second nucleotide sequence—compared to the first nucleotide sequence—is considered as a difference at a single nucleotide (position).\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAlternatively, the degree of sequence identity between two or more nucleotide sequences may be calculated using a known computer algorithm for sequence alignment such as NCBI Blast v2.0, using standard settings.\n\n\n \n \nSome other techniques, computer algorithms and settings for determining the degree of sequence identity are for example described in WO 04/037999, \nEP\n 0 967 284, \nEP\n 1 085 089, WO 00/55318, WO 00/78972, WO 98/49185 and \nGB\n 2 357 768-A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsually, for the purpose of determining the percentage of “sequence identity” between two nucleotide sequences in accordance with the calculation method outlined hereinabove, the nucleotide sequence with the greatest number of nucleotides will be taken as the “first” nucleotide sequence, and the other nucleotide sequence will be taken as the “second” nucleotide sequence;\n\n \n \n \nf) For the purposes of comparing two or more amino acid sequences, the percentage of “sequence identity” between a first amino acid sequence and a second amino acid sequence (also referred to herein as “amino acid identity”) may be calculated by dividing [the number of amino acid residues in the first amino acid sequence that are identical to the amino acid residues at the corresponding positions in the second amino acid sequence] by [the total number of amino acid residues in the first amino acid sequence] and multiplying by [100%], in which each deletion, insertion, substitution or addition of an amino acid residue in the second amino acid sequence—compared to the first amino acid sequence—is considered as a difference at a single amino acid residue (position), i.e. as an “amino acid difference” as defined herein.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAlternatively, the degree of sequence identity between two amino acid sequences may be calculated using a known computer algorithm, such as those mentioned above for determining the degree of sequence identity for nucleotide sequences, again using standard settings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsually, for the purpose of determining the percentage of “sequence identity” between two amino acid sequences in accordance with the calculation method outlined hereinabove, the amino acid sequence with the greatest number of amino acid residues will be taken as the “first” amino acid sequence, and the other amino acid sequence will be taken as the “second” amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, in determining the degree of sequence identity between two amino acid sequences, the skilled person may take into account so-called “conservative” amino acid substitutions, which can generally be described as amino acid substitutions in which an amino acid residue is replaced with another amino acid residue of similar chemical structure and which has little or essentially no influence on the function, activity or other biological properties of the polypeptide. Such conservative amino acid substitutions are well known in the art, for example from WO 04/037999, GB-A-4 357 768, WO 98/49185, WO 00/46383 and WO 01/09300; and (preferred) types and/or combinations of such substitutions may be selected on the basis of the pertinent teachings from WO 04/037999 as well as WO 98/49185 and from the further references cited therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch conservative substitutions preferably are substitutions in which one amino acid within the following groups (a)-(e) is substituted by another amino acid residue within the same group: (a) small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar residues: Ala, Ser, Thr, Pro and Gly; (b) polar, negatively charged residues and their (uncharged) amides: Asp, Asn, Glu and Gln; (c) polar, positively charged residues: His, Arg and Lys; (d) large aliphatic, nonpolar residues: Met, Leu, Ile, Val and Cys; and (e) aromatic residues: Phe, Tyr and Trp.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly preferred conservative substitutions are as follows: Ala into Gly or into Ser; Arg into Lys; Asn into Gin or into His; Asp into Glu; Cys into Ser; Gln into Asn; Glu into Asp; Gly into Ala or into Pro; His into Asn or into Gin; Ile into Leu or into Val; Leu into Ile or into Val; Lys into Arg, into Gln or into Glu; Met into Leu, into Tyr or into Ile; Phe into Met, into Leu or into Tyr; Ser into Thr; Thr into Ser; Trp into Tyr; Tyr into Trp; and/or Phe into Val, into Ile or into Leu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny amino acid substitutions applied to the polypeptides described herein may also be based on the analysis of the frequencies of amino acid variations between homologous proteins of different species developed by Schulz et al., Principles of Protein Structure, Springer-Verlag, 1978, on the analyses of structure forming potentials developed by Chou and Fasman, Biochemistry 13: 211, 1974 and Adv. Enzymol., 47: 45-149, 1978, and on the analysis of hydrophobicity patterns in proteins developed by Eisenberg et al., Proc. Nad. Acad Sci. USA 81: 140-144, 1984; Kyte & Doolittle; J Molec. Biol. 157: 105-132, 198 1, and Goldman et al., Ann. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 15: 321-353, 1986, all incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. Information on the primary, secondary and tertiary structure of Nanobodies is given in the description herein and in the general background art cited above. Also, for this purpose, the crystal structure of a V\nHH \ndomain from a llama is for example given by Desmyter et al., Nature Structural Biology, Vol. 3, 9, 803 (1996); Spinelli et al., Natural Structural Biology (1996); 3, 752-757; and Decanniere et al., Structure, Vol. 7, 4, 361 (1999). Further information about some of the amino acid residues that in conventional V\nH \ndomains form the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninterface and potential camelizing substitutions on these positions can be found in the prior art cited above.\n\n \n \n \ng) Amino acid sequences and nucleic acid sequences are said to be “exactly the same” if they have 100% sequence identity (as defined herein) over their entire length;\n \nh) When comparing two amino acid sequences, the term “amino acid difference” refers to an insertion, deletion or substitution of a single amino acid residue on a position of the first sequence, compared to the second sequence; it being understood that two amino acid sequences can contain one, two or more such amino acid differences;\n \ni) When a nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence is said to “comprise” another nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, respectively, or to “essentially consist of” another nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, this may mean that the latter nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence has been incorporated into the firstmentioned nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, respectively, but more usually this generally means that the firstmentioned nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence comprises within its sequence a stretch of nucleotides or amino acid residues, respectively, that has the same nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, respectively, as the latter sequence, irrespective of how the firstmentioned sequence has actually been generated or obtained (which may for example be by any suitable method described herein). By means of a non-limiting example, when a Nanobody of the invention is said to comprise a CDR sequence, this may mean that said CDR sequence has been incorporated into the Nanobody of the invention, but more usually this generally means that the Nanobody of the invention contains within its sequence a stretch of amino acid residues with the same amino acid sequence as said CDR sequence, irrespective of how said Nanobody of the invention has been generated or obtained. It should also be noted that when the latter amino acid sequence has a specific biological or structural function, it preferably has essentially the same, a similar or an equivalent biological or structural function in the firstmentioned amino acid sequence (in other words, the firstmentioned amino acid sequence is preferably such that the latter sequence is capable of performing essentially the same, a similar or an equivalent biological or structural function). For example, when a Nanobody of the invention is said to comprise a CDR sequence or framework sequence, respectively, the CDR sequence and framework are preferably capable, in said Nanobody, of functioning as a CDR sequence or framework sequence, respectively. Also, when a nucleotide sequence is said to comprise another nucleotide sequence, the firstmentioned nucleotide sequence is preferably such that, when it is expressed into an expression product (e.g. a polypeptide), the amino acid sequence encoded by the latter nucleotide sequence forms part of said expression product (in other words, that the latter nucleotide sequence is in the same reading frame as the firstmentioned, larger nucleotide sequence).\n \nj) A nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence is considered to be “(in) essentially isolated (form)”—for example, compared to its native biological source and/or the reaction medium or cultivation medium from which it has been obtained—when it has been separated from at least one other component with which it is usually associated in said source or medium, such as another nucleic acid, another protein/polypeptide, another biological component or macromolecule or at least one contaminant, impurity or minor component. In particular, a nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence is considered “essentially isolated” when it has been purified at least 2-fold, in particular at least 10-fold, more in particular at least 100-fold, and up to 1000-fold or more. A nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence that is “in essentially isolated form” is preferably essentially homogeneous, as determined using a suitable technique, such as a suitable chromatographical technique, such as polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis;\n \nk) The term “domain” as used herein generally refers to a globular region of an amino acid sequence (such as an antibody chain, and in particular to a globular region of a heavy chain antibody), or to a polypeptide that essentially consists of such a globular region. Usually, such a domain will comprise peptide loops (for example 3 or 4 peptide loops) stabilized, for example, as a sheet or by disulfide bonds. The term “binding domain” refers to such a domain that is directed against an antigenic determinant (as defined herein);\n \nl) The term “antigenic determinant” refers to the epitope on the antigen recognized by the antigen-binding molecule (such as a Nanobody or a polypeptide of the invention) and more in particular by the antigen-binding site of said molecule. The terms “antigenic determinant” and “epitope” may also be used interchangeably herein.\n \nm) An amino acid sequence (such as a Nanobody, an antibody, a polypeptide of the invention, or generally an antigen binding protein or polypeptide or a fragment thereof) that can (specifically) bind to, that has affinity for and/or that has specificity for a specific antigenic determinant, epitope, antigen or protein (or for at least one part, fragment or epitope thereof) is said to be “against”, “directed against” or “directed to” said antigenic determinant, epitope, antigen or protein.\n \nn) The term “specificity” refers to the number of different types of antigens or antigenic determinants to which a particular antigen-binding molecule or antigen-binding protein (such as a Nanobody or a polypeptide of the invention) molecule can bind. The specificity of an antigen-binding protein can be determined based on affinity and/or avidity. The affinity, represented by the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of an antigen with an antigen-binding protein (K\nD\n), is a measure for the binding strength between an antigenic determinant and an antigen-binding site on the antigen-binding protein: the lesser the value of the K\nD\n, the stronger the binding strength between an antigenic determinant and the antigen-binding molecule (alternatively, the affinity can also be expressed as the affinity constant (K\nA\n), which is 1/K\nD\n). As will be clear to the skilled person (for example on the basis of the further disclosure herein), affinity can be determined in a manner known per se, depending on the specific antigen of interest. Avidity is the measure of the strength of binding between an antigen-binding molecule (such as a Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention) and the pertinent antigen. Avidity is related to both the affinity between an antigenic determinant and its antigen binding site on the antigen-binding molecule and the number of pertinent binding sites present on the antigen-binding molecule. Typically, antigen-binding proteins (such as the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention) will bind to their antigen with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of 10\n−5 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less, and preferably 10\n−7 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less and more preferably 10\n−8 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter (i.e. with an association constant (K\nA\n) of 10\n5 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more, and preferably 10\n7 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more and more preferably 10\n8 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles). Any K\nD \nvalue greater than 10\n−4 \nmol/liter (or any K\nA \nvalue lower than 10\n4 \nM\n−1\n) liters/mol is generally considered to indicate non-specific binding. Preferably, a monovalent immunoglobulin sequence of the invention will bind to the desired antigen with an affinity less than 500 nM, preferably less than 200 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, such as less than 500 pM. Specific binding of an antigen-binding protein to an antigen or antigenic determinant can be determined in any suitable manner known per se, including, for example, Scatchard analysis and/or competitive binding assays, such as radioimmunoassays (RIA), enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and sandwich competition assays, and the different variants thereof known per se in the art; as well as the other techniques mentioned herein.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe dissociation constant may be the actual or apparent dissociation constant, as will be clear to the skilled person. Methods for determining the dissociation constant will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include the techniques mentioned herein. In this respect, it will also be clear that it may not be possible to measure dissociation constants of more then 10\n−4 \nmoles/liter or 10\n−3 \nmoles/liter (e,g, of 10\n−2 \nmoles/liter). Optionally, as will also be clear to the skilled person, the (actual or apparent) dissociation constant may be calculated on the basis of the (actual or apparent) association constant (K\nA\n), by means of the relationship [K\nD\n=1/K\nA\n].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe affinity denotes the strength or stability of a molecular interaction. The affinity is commonly given as by the K\nD\n, or dissociation constant, which has units of mol/liter (or M). The affinity can also be expressed as an association constant, K\nA\n, which equals 1/K\nD \nand has units of (mol/liter)\n−1 \n(or M\n−1\n). In the present specification, the stability of the interaction between two molecules (such as an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention and its intended target) will mainly be expressed in terms of the K\nD \nvalue of their interaction; it being clear to the skilled person that in view of the relation K\nA\n=1/K\nD\n, specifying the strength of molecular interaction by its K\nD \nvalue can also be used to calculate the corresponding K\nA \nvalue. The K\nD\n-value characterizes the strength of a molecular interaction also in a thermodynamic sense as it is related to the free energy (DO) of binding by the well known relation DG=RT.ln(K\nD\n) (equivalently DG=−RT.ln(K\nA\n)), where R equals the gas constant, T equals the absolute temperature and In denotes the natural logarithm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe K\nD \nfor biological interactions which are considered meaningful (e.g. specific) are typically in the range of 10\n−10\nM (0.1 nM) to 10\n−5\nM (10000 nM). The stronger an interaction is, the lower is its K\nD\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe K\nD \ncan also be expressed as the ratio of the dissociation rate constant of a complex, denoted as k\noff\n, to the rate of its association, denoted k\non \n(so that K\nD\n=k\noff\n/k\non \nand K\nA\n=k\non\n/k\noff\n). The off-rate k\noff \nhas units s\n−1 \n(where s is the SI unit notation of second). The on-rate k\non \nhas units M\n−1\ns\n−1\n. The on-rate may vary between 10\n2 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1 \nto about 10\n7 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1\n, approaching the diffusion-limited association rate constant for bimolecular interactions. The off-rate is related to the half-life of a given molecular interaction by the relation t\n1/2\n=ln(2)/k\noff \n. The off-rate may vary between 10\n−6 \ns\n−1 \n(near irreversible complex with a t\n1/2 \nof multiple days) to 1 s\n−1 \n(t\n1/2\n=0.69 s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe affinity of a molecular interaction between two molecules can be measured via different techniques known per se, such as the well known surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor technique (see for example Ober et al., Intern. Immunology, 13, 1551-1559, 2001) where one molecule is immobilized on the biosensor chip and the other molecule is passed over the immobilized molecule under flow conditions yielding k\non\n, k\noff\nmeasurements and hence K\nD \n(or K\nA\n) values. This can for example be performed using the well-known Biacore instruments (see for example Example 12 or 20),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will also be clear to the skilled person that the measured K\nD \nmay correspond to the apparent K\nD \nif the measuring process somehow influences the intrinsic binding affinity of the implied molecules for example by artefacts related to the coating on the biosensor of one molecule. Also, an apparent K\nD \nmay be measured if one molecule contains more than one recognition sites for the other molecule. In such situation the measured affinity may be affected by the avidity of the interaction by the two molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother approach that may be used to assess affinity is the 2-step ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) procedure of Friguet et al. (J. Immunol. Methods, 77, 305-19, 1985). This method establishes a solution phase binding equilibrium measurement and avoids possible artefacts relating to adsorption of one of the molecules on a support such as plastic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, the accurate measurement of K\nD \nmay be quite labor-intensive and as consequence, often apparent K\nD \nvalues are determined to assess the binding strength of two molecules. It should be noted that as long all measurements are made in a consistent way (e.g. keeping the assay conditions unchanged) apparent K\nD \nmeasurements can be used as an approximation of the true K\nD \nand hence in the present document K\nD \nand apparent K\nD \nshould be treated with equal importance or relevance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, it should be noted that in many situations the experienced scientist may judge it to be convenient to determine the binding affinity relative to some reference molecule. For example, to assess the binding strength between molecules A and B, one may e.g. use a reference molecule C that is known to bind to B and that is suitably labelled with a fluorophore or chromophore group or other chemical moiety, such as biotin for easy detection in an ELISA or FACS (Fluorescent activated cell sorting) or other format (the fluorophore for fluorescence detection, the chromophore for light absorption detection, the biotin for streptavidin-mediated ELISA detection). Typically, the reference molecule C is kept at a fixed concentration and the concentration of A is varied for a given concentration or amount of B. As a result an IC\n50 \nvalue is obtained corresponding to the concentration of A at which the signal measured for C in absence of A is halved. Provided K\nD ref\n, the K\nD \nof the reference molecule, is known, as well as the total concentration c\nref \nof the reference molecule, the apparent K\nD \nfor the interaction A-B can be obtained from following formula: K\nD\n=IC\n50\n/(1+c\nref\n/K\nD ref\n). Note that if c\nref\n<<K\nD ref\n, K\nD\n≈IC\n50\n. Provided the measurement of the IC\n50 \nis performed in a consistent way (e.g. keeping c\nref \nfixed) for the binders that are compared, the strength or stability of a molecular interaction can be assessed by the IC\n50 \nand this measurement is judged as equivalent to K\nD \nor to apparent K\nD \nthroughout this text.\n\n \n \n \no) The half-life of an amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention can generally be defined as the time taken for the serum concentration of the amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide to be reduced by 50%, in vivo, for example due to degradation of the sequence or compound and/or clearance or sequestration of the sequence or compound by natural mechanisms. The in vivo half-life of an amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention can be determined in any manner known per se, such as by pharmacokinetic analysis. Suitable techniques will be clear to the person skilled in the art, and may for example generally involve the steps of suitably administering to a warm-blooded animal (i.e. to a human or to another suitable mammal, such as a mouse, rabbit, rat, pig, dog or a primate, for example monkeys from the genus \nMacaca \n(such as, and in particular, cynomologus monkeys (\nMacaca fascicularis\n) and/or rhesus monkeys (\nMacaca mulatta\n)) and baboon (\nPapio ursinus\n)) a suitable dose of the amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention; collecting blood samples or other samples from said animal; determining the level or concentration of the amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention in said blood sample; and calculating, from (a plot of) the data thus obtained, the time until the level or concentration of the amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention has been reduced by 50% compared to the initial level upon dosing. Reference is for example made to the Experimental Part below, as well as to Dennis et al., J. Biol. Chem 277:35035-42 (2002), and to the standard handbooks, such as Kenneth, A et al: Chemical Stability of Pharmaceuticals: A Handbook for Pharmacists and Peters et al, Pharmacokinete analysis: A Practical Approach (1996). Reference is also made to “Pharmacokinetics”, M Gibaldi & D Perron, published by Marcel Dekker, 2nd Rev. edition (1982).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs will also be clear to the skilled person (see for \n \nexample pages\n \n 6 and 7 of WO 04/003019 and in the further references cited therein), the half-life can be expressed using parameters such as the t1/2-alpha, t1/2-beta and the area under the curve (AUC). In the present specification, an “increase in half-life” refers to an increase in any one of these parameters, such as any two of these parameters, or essentially all three these parameters. As used herein “increase in half-life” or “increased half-life” in particular refers to an increase in the t1/2-beta, either with or without an increase in the t1/2-alpha and/or the AUC or both.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the half-life of an amino acid sequence or polypeptide of the invention may be determined by means of a pharmacokinetic study, performed in a rodent or non-human primate model, as follows. Groups of animals (n=2-10) are given an intravenous bolus injection of 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg 2D3-17D12 fusion protein. Plasma samples are obtained via a vein at different timepoints after dosing (eg. 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48,144, 192, 240, 288 and 336 h after dosing) and analyzed for the presence of the 2D3-17D12 fusion protein by ELISA. Plasma concentration versus time are fitted to a two-compartment elimination model. The pharmacokinetic parameters of clearance, V1, steady state volume (Vss), T½; AUC, and AUC corrected for actual dose administered (AUC/dose) are averaged for each treatment group. Differences between groups are determined by analysis of variance.\n\n \n \n \np) In the context of the present invention, “modulating” or “to modulate” generally means either reducing or inhibiting the activity of, or alternatively increasing the activity of, a target or antigen, as measured using a suitable in vitro, cellular or in vivo assay. In particular, “modulating” or “to modulate” may mean either reducing or inhibiting the activity of, or alternatively increasing a (relevant or intended) biological activity of, a target or antigen, as measured using a suitable in vitro, cellular or in vivo assay (which will usually depend on the target or antigen involved), by at least 1%, preferably at least 5%, such as at least 10% or at least 25%, for example by at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or 90% or more, compared to activity of the target or antigen in the same assay under the same conditions but without the presence of the construct of the invention.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs will be clear to the skilled person, “modulating” may also involve effecting a change (which may either be an increase or a decrease) in affinity, avidity, specificity and/or selectivity of a target or antigen for one or more of its ligands, binding partners, partners for association into a homomultimeric or heteromultimeric form, or substrates; and/or effecting a change (which may either be an increase or a decrease) in the sensitivity of the target or antigen for one or more conditions in the medium or surroundings in which the target or antigen is present (such as pH, ion strength, the presence of co-factors, etc.), compared to the same conditions but without the presence of the construct of the invention. As will be clear to the skilled person, this may again be determined in any suitable manner and/or using any suitable assay known per se, depending on the target or antigen involved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Modulating” may also mean effecting a change (i.e. an activity as an agonist, as an antagonist or as a reverse agonist, respectively, depending on the target or antigen and the desired biological or physiological effect) with respect to one or more biological or physiological mechanisms, effects, responses, functions, pathways or activities in which the target or antigen (or in which its substrate(s), ligand(s) or pathway(s) are involved, such as its signalling pathway or metabolic pathway and their associated biological or physiological effects) is involved. Again, as will be clear to the skilled person, such an action as an agonist or an antagonist may be determined in any suitable manner and/or using any suitable (in vitro and usually cellular or in assay) assay known per se, depending on the target or antigen involved. In particular, an action as an agonist or antagonist may be such that an intended biological or physiological activity is increased or decreased, respectively, by at least 1%, preferably at least 5%, such as at least 10% or at least 25%, for example by at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or 90% or more, compared to the biological or physiological activity in the same assay under the same conditions but without the presence of the construct of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModulating may for example also involve allosteric modulation of the target or antigen; and/or reducing or inhibiting the binding of the target or antigen to one of its substrates or ligands and/or competing with a natural ligand, substrate for binding to the target or antigen. Modulating may also involve activating the target or antigen or the mechanism or pathway in which it is involved. Modulating may for example also involve effecting a change in respect of the folding or confirmation of the target or antigen, or in respect of the ability of the target or antigen to fold, to change its confirmation (for example, upon binding of a ligand), to associate with other (sub)units, or to disassociate. Modulating may for example also involve effecting a change in the ability of the target or antigen to transport other compounds or to serve as a channel for other compounds (such as ions).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModulating may be reversible or irreversible, but for pharmaceutical and pharmacological purposes will usually be in a reversible manner.\n\n \n \n \nq) In respect of a target or antigen, the term “interaction site” on the target or antigen means a site, epitope, antigenic determinant, part, domain or stretch of amino acid residues on the target or antigen that is a site for binding to a ligand, receptor or other binding partner, a catalytic site, a cleavage site, a site for allosteric interaction, a site involved in multimerisation (such as homomerization or heterodimerization) of the target or antigen; or any other site, epitope, antigenic determinant, part, domain or stretch of amino acid residues on the target or antigen that is involved in a biological action or mechanism of the target or antigen. More generally, an “interaction site” can be any site, epitope, antigenic determinant, part, domain or stretch of amino acid residues on the target or antigen to which an amino acid sequence or polypeptide of the invention can bind such that the target or antigen (and/or any pathway, interaction, signalling, biological mechanism or biological effect in which the target or antigen is involved) is modulated (as defined herein).\n \nr) An amino acid sequence or polypeptide is said to be “specific for” a first target or antigen compared to a second target or antigen when is binds to the first antigen with an affinity (as described above, and suitably expressed as a K\nD \nvalue, K\nA \nvalue, K\noff \nrate and/or K\non \nrate) that is at least 10 times, such as at least 100 times, and preferably at least 1000 times, and up to 10.000 times or more better than the affinity with which said amino acid sequence or polypeptide binds to the second target or polypeptide. For example, the first antigen may bind to the target or antigen with a K\nD \nvalue that is at least 10 times less, such as at least 100 times less, and preferably at least 1000 times less, such as 10.000 times less or even less than that, than the K\nD \nwith which said amino acid sequence or polypeptide binds to the second target or polypeptide. Preferably, when an amino acid sequence or polypeptide is “specific for” a first target or antigen compared to a second target or antigen, it is directed against (as defined herein) said first target or antigen, but not directed against said second target or antigen.\n \ns) The terms “cross-block”, “cross-blocked” and “cross-blocking” are used interchangeably herein to mean the ability of an amino acid sequence or other binding agents (such as a polypeptide of the invention) to interfere with the binding of other amino acid sequences or binding agents of the invention to a given target. The extend to which an amino acid sequence or other binding agents of the invention is able to interfere with the binding of another to [target], and therefore whether it can be said to cross-block according to the invention, can be determined using competition binding assays. One particularly suitable quantitative assay uses a Biacore machine which can measure the extent of interactions using surface plasmon resonance technology. Another suitable quantitative cross-blocking assay uses an ELISA-based approach to measure competition between amino acid sequence or another binding agents in terms of their binding to the target.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe following generally describes a suitable Biacore assay for determining whether an amino acid sequence or other binding agent cross-blocks or is capable of cross-blocking according to the invention. It will be appreciated that the assay can be used with any of the amino acid sequence or other binding agents described herein. The Biacore machine (for example the Biacore 3000) is operated in line with the manufacturer's recommendations. Thus in one cross-blocking assay, the target protein is coupled to a CM5 Biacore chip using standard amine coupling chemistry to generate a surface that is coated with the target. Typically 200-800 resonance units of the target would be coupled to the chip (an amount that gives easily measurable levels of binding but that is readily saturable by the concentrations of test reagent being used). Two test amino acid sequences (termed A* and B*) to be assessed for their ability to cross-block each other are mixed at a one to one molar ratio of binding sites in a suitable buffer to create the test mixture. When calculating the concentrations on a binding site basis the molecular weight of an amino acid sequence is assumed to be the total molecular weight of the amino acid sequence divided by the number of target binding sites on that amino acid sequence. The concentration of each amino acid sequence in the test mix should be high enough to readily saturate the binding sites for that amino acid sequence on the target molecules captured on the Biacore chip. The amino acid sequences in the mixture are at the same molar concentration (on a binding basis) and that concentration would typically be between 1.00 and 1.5 micromolar (on a binding site basis). Separate solutions containing A* alone and B* alone are also prepared. A* and B* in these solutions should be in the same buffer and at the same concentration as in the test mix. The test mixture is passed over the target-coated. Biacore chip and the total amount of binding recorded. The chip is then treated in such a way as to remove the bound amino acid sequences without damaging the chip-bound target. Typically this is done by treating the chip with 30 mM HCl for 60 seconds. The solution of A* alone is then passed over the target-coated surface and the amount of binding recorded. The chip is again treated to remove all of the bound amino acid sequences without damaging the chip-bound target. The solution of B* alone is then passed over the target-coated surface and the amount of binding recorded. The maximum theoretical binding of the mixture of A* and B* is next calculated, and is the sum of the binding of each amino acid sequence when passed over the target surface alone. If the actual recorded binding of the mixture is less than this theoretical maximum then the two amino acid sequences are cross-blocking each other. Thus, in general, a cross-blocking amino acid sequence or other binding agent according to the invention is one which will bind to the target in the above Biacore cross-blocking assay such that during the assay and in the presence of a second amino acid sequence or other binding agent of the invention the recorded binding is between 80% and 0.1% (e.g. 80% to 4%) of the maximum theoretical binding, specifically between 75% and 0.1% (e.g. 75% to 4%) of the maximum theoretical binding, and more specifically between 70% and 0.1% (e.g. 70% to 4%) of maximum theoretical binding (as just defined above) of the two amino acid sequences or binding agents in combination. The Biacore assay described above is a primary assay used to determine if amino acid sequences or other binding agents cross-block each other according to the invention. On rare occasions particular amino acid sequences or other binding agents may not bind to target coupled via amine chemistry to a CM5 Biacore chip (this usually occurs when the relevant binding site on target is masked or destroyed by the coupling to the chip). In such cases cross-blocking can be determined using a tagged version of the target, for example a N-terminal His-tagged version. In this particular format, an anti-His amino acid sequence would be coupled to the Biacore chip and then the His-tagged target would be passed over the surface of the chip and captured by the anti-His amino acid sequence. The cross blocking analysis would be carried out essentially as described above, except that after each chip regeneration cycle, new His-tagged target would be loaded back onto the anti-His amino acid sequence coated surface. In addition to the example given using N-terminal His-tagged [target], C-terminal His-tagged target could alternatively be used. Furthermore, various other tags and tag binding protein combinations that are known in the art could be used for such a cross-blocking analysis (e.g. HA tag with anti-HA antibodies; FLAG tag with anti-FLAG antibodies; biotin tag with streptavidin).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following generally describes an ELISA assay for determining whether an amino acid sequence or other binding agent directed against a target cross-blocks or is capable of cross-blocking as defined herein. It will be appreciated that the assay can be used with any of the amino acid sequences (or other binding agents such as polypeptides of the invention) described herein. The general principal of the assay is to have an amino acid sequence or binding agent that is directed against the target coated onto the wells of an ELISA plate. An excess amount of a second, potentially cross-blocking, anti-target amino acid sequence is added in solution (i.e. not bound to the ELISA plate). A limited amount of the target is then added to the wells. The coated amino acid sequence and the amino acid sequence in solution compete for binding of the limited number of target molecules. The plate is washed to remove excess target that has not been bound by the coated amino acid sequence and to also remove the second, solution phase amino acid sequence as well as any complexes formed between the second, solution phase amino acid sequence and target. The amount of bound target is then measured using a reagent that is appropriate to detect the target. An amino acid sequence in solution that is able to cross-block the coated amino acid sequence will be able to cause a decrease in the number of target molecules that the coated amino acid sequence can bind relative to the number of target molecules that the coated amino acid sequence can bind in the absence of the second, solution phase, amino acid sequence. In the instance where the first amino acid sequence, e.g. an Ab-X, is chosen to be the immobilized amino acid sequence, it is coated onto the wells of the ELISA plate, after which the plates are blocked with a suitable blocking solution to minimize non-specific binding of reagents that are subsequently added. An excess amount of the second amino acid sequence, i.e. Ab-Y, is then added to the ELISA plate such that the moles of Ab-Y [target] binding sites per well are at least 10 fold higher than the moles of Ab-X [target] binding sites that were used, per well, during the coating of the ELISA plate. [target] is then added such that the moles of [target] added per well are at least 25-fold lower than the moles of Ab-X [target] binding sites that were used for coating each well. Following a suitable incubation period the ELISA plate is washed and a reagent for detecting the target is added to measure the amount of target specifically bound by the coated anti-[target] amino acid sequence (in this case Ab-X). The background signal for the assay is defined as the signal obtained in wells with the coated amino acid sequence (in this case Ab-X), second solution phase amino acid sequence (in this case Ab-Y), [target] buffer only (i.e. no target) and target detection reagents. The positive control signal for the assay is defined as the signal obtained in wells with the coated amino acid sequence (in this case Ab-X), second solution phase amino acid sequence buffer only (i.e. no second solution phase amino acid sequence), target and target detection reagents. The ELISA assay may be run in such a manner so as to have the positive control signal be at least 6 times the background signal. To avoid any artefacts (e.g. significantly different affinities between Ab-X and Ab-Y for [target]) resulting from the choice of which amino acid sequence to use as the coating amino acid sequence and which to use as the second (competitor) amino acid sequence, the cross-blocking assay may to be run in two formats: 1) \nformat\n 1 is where Ab-X is the amino acid sequence that is coated onto the ELISA plate and Ab-Y is the competitor amino acid sequence that is in solution and 2) \nformat\n 2 is where Ab-Y is the amino acid sequence that is coated onto the ELISA plate and Ab-X is the competitor amino acid sequence that is in solution. Ab-X and Ab-Y are defined as cross-blocking if, either in \nformat\n 1 or in \nformat\n 2, the solution phase anti-target amino acid sequence is able to cause a reduction of between 60% and 100%, specifically between 70% and 100%, and more specifically between 80% and 100%, of the target detection signal {i.e. the amount of target bound by the coated amino acid sequence) as compared to the target detection signal obtained in the absence of the solution phase anti-target amino acid sequence (i.e. the positive control wells).\n\n \n \n \nf) An amino acid sequence is said to be “cross-reactive” for two different antigens or antigenic determinants (such as serum albumin from two different species of mammal, such as human serum albumin and cyno serum albumin) if it is specific for (as defined herein) both these different antigens or antigenic determinants.\n \nu) By binding that is “essentially independent of the pH” is generally meant herein that the association constant (K\nA\n) of the amino acid sequence with respect to the serum protein (such as serum albumin) at the pH value(s) that occur in a cell of an animal or human body (as further described herein) is at least 5%, such as at least 10%, preferably at least 25%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, such as even more preferably at least 70%, such as at least 80% or 90% or more (or even more than 100%, such as more than 110%, more than 120% or even 130% or more, or even more than 150%, or even more than 200%) of the association constant (K\nA\n) of the amino acid sequence with respect to the same serum protein at the pH value(s) that occur outside said cell. Alternatively, by binding that is “essentially independent of the pH” is generally meant herein that the k\noff \nrate (measured by Biacore) of the amino acid sequence with respect to the serum protein (such as serum albumin) at the pH value(s) that occur in a cell of an animal or human body (as e.g. further described herein, e.g. pH around 5.5, e.g. 5.3 to 5.7) is at least 5%, such as at least 10%, preferably at least 25%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, such as even more preferably at least 70%, such as at least 80% or 90% or more (or even more than 100%, such as more than 110%, more than 120% or even 130% or more, or even more than 150%, or even more than 200%) of the k\noff \nrate of the amino acid sequence with respect to the same serum protein at the pH value(s) that occur outside said cell, e.g. pH 7.2 to 7.4. By “the pH value(s) that occur in a cell of an animal or human body” is meant the pH value(s) that may occur inside a cell, and in particular inside a cell that is involved in the recycling of the serum protein. In particular, by “the pH value(s) that occur in a cell of an animal or human body” is meant the pH value(s) that may occur inside a (sub)cellular compartment or vesicle that is involved in recycling of the serum protein (e.g. as a result of pinocytosis, endocytosis, transcytosis, exocytosis and phagocytosis or a similar mechanism of uptake or internalization into said cell), such as an endosome, lysosome or pinosome.\n \nv) As further described herein, the total number of amino acid residues in a Nanobody can be in the region of 110-120, is preferably 112-115, and is most preferably 113. It should however be noted that parts, fragments, analogs or derivatives (as further described herein) of a Nanobody are not particularly limited as to their length and/or size, as long as such parts, fragments, analogs or derivatives meet the further requirements outlined herein and are also preferably suitable for the purposes described herein;\n \nw) The amino acid residues of a Nanobody are numbered according to the general numbering for V\nH \ndomains given by Kabat et al. (“Sequence of proteins of immunological interest”, US Public Health Services, NIH Bethesda, Md., Publication No. 91), as applied to V\nHH \ndomains from Camelids in the article of Riechmann and Muyldermans, J. Immunol. \nMethods\n 2000 Jun. 23; 240 (1-2): 185-195 (see for example \nFIG. 2\n of this publication); or referred to herein. According to this numbering, FR1 of a Nanobody comprises the amino acid residues at positions 1-30, CDR1 of a Nanobody comprises the amino acid residues at positions 31-35, FR2 of a Nanobody comprises the amino acids at positions 36-49, CDR2 of a Nanobody comprises the amino acid residues at positions 50-65, FR3 of a Nanobody comprises the amino acid residues at positions 66-94, CDR3 of a Nanobody comprises the amino acid residues at positions 95-102, and FR4 of a Nanobody comprises the amino acid residues at positions 103-113. [In this respect, it should be noted that—as is well known in the art for V\nH \ndomains and for V\nHH \ndomains—the total number of amino acid residues in each of the CDR's may vary and may not correspond to the total number of amino acid residues indicated by the Kabat numbering (that is, one or more positions according to the Kabat numbering may not be occupied in the actual sequence, or the actual sequence may contain more amino acid residues than the number allowed for by the Kabat numbering). This means that, generally, the numbering according to Kabat may or may not correspond to the actual numbering of the amino acid residues in the actual sequence. Generally, however, it can be said that, according to the numbering of Kabat and irrespective of the number of amino acid residues in the CDR's, \nposition\n 1 according to the Kabat numbering corresponds to the start of FR1 and vice versa, position 36 according to the Kabat numbering corresponds to the start of FR2 and vice versa, \nposition\n 66 according to the Kabat numbering corresponds to the start of FR3 and vice versa, and position 103 according to the Kabat numbering corresponds to the start of FR4 and vice versa.].\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAlternative methods for numbering the amino acid residues of V\nH \ndomains, which methods can also be applied in an analogous manner to V\nHH \ndomains from Camelids and to Nanobodies, are the method described by Chothia et al. (Nature 342, 877-883 (1989)), the so-called “AbM definition” and the so-called “contact definition”. However, in the present description, claims and figures, the numbering according to Kabat as applied to V\nHH \ndomains by Riechmann and Muyldermans will be followed, unless indicated otherwise; and\n\n \n \n \nx) In respect of any amino acid sequence described herein that is a CDR sequence (such as any of the CDR sequences from the \n \n \n \n \nCDR1 Sequences Groups\n \n \n \n \n 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44, 51 and/or 58 (see Table A-1); from the \n \n \n \n \n \nCDR2 Sequences Groups\n \n \n \n \n \n 4, 11, 18, 25, 32, 39, 46, 53, and/or 60 (see Table A-1); and/or from the \n \n \n \nCDR3 Sequences Groups\n \n \n \n 6, 13, 20, 27, 34, 41, 48, 54 and/or 62 (see Table A-1)), “Optional Condition I” means that when said amino acid sequence contains an amino acid substitution, such an amino acid substitution is preferably, and compared to the original amino acid sequence without said substitution, a conservative amino acid substitution (as defined herein): “Optional Condition II” means that said preferably only contains amino acid substitutions, and no amino acid deletions or insertions, compared to the original amino acid sequence without said substitution; “Optional Condition III” means that said amino acid sequence may be an amino acid sequence that is derived from the corresponding amino acid sequence by means of affinity maturation using one or more techniques of affinity maturation known per se.\n \ny) In respect of any amino acid sequence described herein that is a framework sequence, “Optional Condition I” means that when said amino acid sequence contains an amino acid substitution, such an amino acid substitution is preferably, and compared to the original amino acid sequence without said substitution, a conservative amino acid substitution (as defined herein): “Optional Condition II” means that said preferably only contains amino acid substitutions, and no amino acid deletions or insertions, compared to the original amino acid sequence without said substitution; and “Optional Condition IV” means that where such an amino acid sequence contains any amino acid differences, these amino acid differences are preferably not present at one of the Hallmark Residues (although the presence of an amino acid difference at a position of a Hallmark Residue is not excluded, provided the favourable properties of a VHH or nanobody as described herein are essentially maintained or not affected to an extent that would make the resulting amino acid sequence no longer suitable for use as a single antigen binding domain or unit (for example, as a nanobody);\n \nz) The Figures, Sequence Listing and the Experimental Part/Examples are only given to further illustrate the invention and should not be interpreted or construed as limiting the scope of the invention and/or of the appended claims in any way, unless explicitly indicated otherwise herein. Also, generally, the amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention that are explicitly referred to in the Experimental Part are preferred examples of amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention.

Reference is also made to the further prior art mentioned in these applications, and in particular to the list of references mentioned on pages 41-43 of the International application WO 06/040153, which list and references are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the terminology used in the art (see the above references), the variable domains present in naturally occurring heavy chain antibodies will also be referred to as “V\nHH \ndomains”, in order to distinguish them from the heavy chain variable domains that are present in conventional 4-chain antibodies (which will be referred to hereinbelow as “V\nH \ndomains”) and from the light chain variable domains that are present in conventional 4-chain antibodies (which will be referred to hereinbelow as “V\nL \ndomains”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned in the prior art referred to above, V\nHH \ndomains have a number of unique structural characteristics and functional properties which make isolated V\nHH \ndomains (as well as Nanobodies based thereon, which share these structural characteristics and functional properties with the naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains) and proteins containing the same highly advantageous for use as functional antigen-binding domains or proteins. In particular, and without being limited thereto, V\nHH \ndomains (which have been “designed” by nature to functionally bind to an antigen without the presence of, and without any interaction with, a light chain variable domain) and Nanobodies can function as a single, relatively small, functional antigen-binding structural unit, domain or protein. This distinguishes the V\nHH \ndomains from the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of conventional 4-chain antibodies, which by themselves are generally not suited for practical application as single antigen-binding proteins or domains, but need to be combined in some form or another to provide a functional antigen-binding unit (as in for example conventional antibody fragments such as Fab fragments; in ScFv's fragments, which consist of a V\nH \ndomain covalently linked to a V\nL \ndomain).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of these unique properties, the use of V\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies as single antigen-binding proteins or as antigen-binding domains (i.e. as part of a larger protein or polypeptide) offers a number of significant advantages over the use of conventional V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains, scFv's or conventional antibody fragments (such as Fab- or F(ab′)\n2\n-fragments):\n\n \n \n \n \n \nonly a single domain is required to bind an antigen with high affinity and with high selectivity, so that there is no need to have two separate domains present, nor to assure that these two domains are present in the right spacial conformation and configuration (i.e. through the use of especially designed linkers, as with scFv's);\n \nV\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies can be expressed from a single gene and require no post-translational folding or modifications;\n \nV\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies can easily be engineered into multivalent and multispecific formats (as further discussed herein);\n \nV\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies are highly soluble and do not have a tendency to aggregate (as with the mouse-derived “dAb's” described by Ward et al., Nature, Vol. 341, 1989, p. 544);\n \nV\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies are highly stable to beat, pH, proteases and other denaturing agents or conditions (see for example Ewert et al, supra);\n \nV\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies are easy and relatively cheap to prepare, even on a scale required for production. For example, V\nHH \ndomains, Nanobodies and proteins/polypeptides containing the same can be produced using microbial fermentation (e.g. as further described below) and do not require the use of mammalian expression systems, as with for example conventional antibody fragments;\n \nV\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies are relatively small (approximately 15 kDa, or 10 times smaller than a conventional IgG) compared to conventional 4-chain antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, and therefore show higher) penetration into tissues (including but not limited to solid tumors and other dense tissues) than such conventional 4-chain antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof;\n \nV\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies can show so-called cavity-binding properties (inter alia due to their extended CDR3 loop, compared to conventional V\nH \ndomains) and can therefore also access targets and epitopes not accessable to conventional 4-chain antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof. For example, it has been shown that V\nHH \ndomains and Nanobodies can inhibit enzymes (see for example WO 97/49805; Transue et al., \nProteins\n 1998 Sep. 1; 32(4): 515-22; Lauwereys et al., EMBO J. 1998 Jul. 1; 17(13): 3512-20).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a specific and preferred aspect, the invention provides Nanobodies against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, and in particular Nanobodies against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors from a warm-blooded animal, and more in particular Nanobodies against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors from a mammal, and especially Nanobodies against human heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors; as well as proteins and/or polypeptides comprising at least one such Nanobody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the invention provides Nanobodies against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, and proteins and/or polypeptides comprising the same, that have improved therapeutic and/or pharmacological properties and/or other advantageous properties (such as, for example, improved ease of preparation and/or reduced costs of goods), compared to conventional antibodies against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors or fragments thereof, compared to constructs that could be based on such conventional antibodies or antibody fragments (such as Fab′ fragments, F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments, ScFv constructs, “diabodies” and other multispecific constructs (see for example the review by Holliger and Hudson, Nat Biotechnol. 2005 September; 23(9):1126-36)), and also compared to the so-called “dAb's” or similar (single) domain antibodies that may be derived from variable domains of conventional antibodies. These improved and advantageous properties will become clear from the further description herein, and for example include, without limitation, one or more of:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nincreased affinity and/or avidity for heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described hereinbelow);\n \nbetter suitability for formatting in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format);\n \nbetter suitability for formatting in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described hereinbelow);\n \nimproved suitability or susceptibility for “humanizing” substitutions (as defined herein);\n \nless immunogenicity, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described hereinbelow);\n \nincreased stability, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described hereinbelow);\n \nincreased specificity towards heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described hereinbelow);\n \ndecreased or where desired increased cross-reactivity with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors from different species;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nand/or\n\n \n \n \n \n \none or more other improved properties desirable for pharmaceutical use (including prophylactic use and/or therapeutic use) and/or for diagnostic use (including but not limited to use for imaging purposes), either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described hereinbelow).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs generally described herein for the amino acid sequences of the invention, the Nanobodies of the invention are preferably in essentially isolated form (as defined herein), or form part of a protein or polypeptide of the invention (as defined herein), which may comprise or essentially consist of one or more Nanobodies of the invention and which may optionally further comprise one or more further amino acid sequences (all optionally linked via one or more suitable linkers). For example, and without limitation, the one or more amino acid sequences of the invention may be used as a binding unit in such a protein or polypeptide, which may optionally contain one or more further amino acid sequences that can serve as a binding unit (i.e. against one or more other targets than heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors), so as to provide a monovalent, multivalent or multispecific polypeptide of the invention, respectively, all as described herein. In particular, such a protein or polypeptide may comprise or essentially consist of one or more Nanobodies of the invention and optionally one or more (other) Nanobodies (i.e. directed against other targets than heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors), all optionally linked via one or more suitable linkers, so as to provide a monovalent, multivalent or multispecific Nanobody construct, respectively, as further described herein. Such proteins or polypeptides may also be in essentially isolated form (as defined herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a Nanobody of the invention, the binding site for binding against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors is preferably formed by the CDR sequences. Optionally, a Nanobody of the invention may also, and in addition to the at least one binding site for binding against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, contain one or more further binding sites for binding against other antigens, proteins or targets. For methods and positions for introducing such second binding sites, reference is for example made to Keck and Huston, Biophysical Journal, 71, October 1996, 2002-2011; \nEP\n 0 640 130; WO 06/07260.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs generally described herein for the amino acid sequences of the invention, when a Nanobody of the invention (or a polypeptide of the invention comprising the same) is intended for administration to a subject (for example for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes as described herein), it is preferably directed against human heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors; whereas for veterinary purposes, it is preferably directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors from the species to be treated. Also, as with the amino acid sequences of the invention, a Nanobody of the invention may or may not be cross-reactive (i.e. directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors from two or more species of mammal, such as against human heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors and heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors from at least one of the species of mammal mentioned herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, again as generally described herein for the amino acid sequences of the invention, the Nanobodies of the invention may generally be directed against any antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain, subunit or confirmation (where applicable) of heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, such as an interaction site (as defined herein) or a site, antigenic determinant, epitope, part, domain that is not an interaction site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs already described herein, the amino acid sequence and structure of a Nanobody can be considered—without however being limited thereto—to be comprised of four framework regions or “FR's” (or sometimes also referred to as “FW's”), which are referred to in the art and herein as “\nFramework region\n 1” or “FR1”; as “\nFramework region\n 2” or “FR2”; as “\nFramework region\n 3” or “FR3”; and as “\nFramework region\n 4” or “FR4”, respectively; which framework regions are interrupted by three complementary determining regions or “CDR's”, which are referred to in the art as “\nComplementarity Determining Region\n 1” or “CDR1”; as “\nComplementarity Determining Region\n 2” or “CDR2”; and as “\nComplementarity Determining Region\n 3” or “CDR3”, respectively. Some preferred framework sequences and CDR's (and combinations thereof) that are present in the Nanobodies of the invention are as described herein. Other suitable CDR sequences can be obtained by the methods described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a non-limiting but preferred aspect of the invention, (the CDR sequences present in) the Nanobodies of the invention are such that:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nthe Nanobodies can bind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of 10\n−5 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less, and preferably 10\n−7 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less and more preferably 10\n−8 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter (i.e. with an association constant (K\nA\n) of 10\n5 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more, and preferably 10\n7 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more and more preferably 10\n8 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles);\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nand/or such that:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nthe Nanobodies can bind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with a k\non\n-rate of between 10\n2 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1 \nto about 10\n7 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1\n, preferably between 10\n3 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1\n, more preferably between 10\n4 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1\n, such as between 10\n5 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1\n;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nand/or such that they:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nthe Nanobodies can bind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with a k\noff \nrate between 1 s\n−1 \n(t\n1/2\n=0.69 s) and 10\n−6 \ns\n−1 \n(providing a near irreversible complex with a t\n1/2 \nof multiple days), preferably between 10\n−2 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n, more preferably between 10\n−3 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n, such as between 10\n−4 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nPreferably, (the CDR sequences present in) the Nanobodies of the invention are such that: a monovalent Nanobody of the invention (or a polypeptide that contains only one Nanobody of the invention) is preferably such that it will bind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with an affinity less than 500 nM, preferably less than 200 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, such as less than 500 pM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe affinity of the Nanobody of the invention against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors can be determined in a manner known per se, for example using the general techniques for measuring K\nD\n. K\nA\n, k\noff \nor k\non \nmentioned herein, as well as some of the specific assays described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome preferred IC50 values for binding of the Nanobodies of the invention (and of polypeptides comprising the same) to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors will become clear from the further description and examples herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred but

are also as further described herein. Thus, for example and as mentioned herein, such Nanobodies may be naturally occurring Nanobodies (from any suitable species), naturally occurring V\nHH \nsequences (i.e. from a suitable species of Camelid) or synthetic or semi-synthetic amino acid sequences or Nanobodies, including but not limited to partially humanized Nanobodies or V\nHH \nsequences, fully humanized Nanobodies or V\nHH \nsequences, camelized heavy chain variable domain sequences, as well as Nanobodies that have been obtained by the techniques mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the above p19+, p19−, p40+, p40−, anti p35, anti-IL-27, anti IL-12Rb1, anti IL-12Rb2 and anti IL-23R Nanobodies, respectively, preferably as described herein in terms of degree of sequence identity with, the number of amino acid differences with, and/or of the ability to cross-block and/or compete, with the p19+ sequences, p19− sequences, p40− sequences, p40+ sequences, p35 sequences, IL-27 sequences, IL-12Rb1 sequences, IL-12Rb2 sequences or IL-23R sequences, respectively,that are mentioned in Table A-2. Preferably, the p19+, p19−, p40+, p40−, anti p35, anti-IL-27, anti IL-12Rb1, anti IL-12Rb2 and anti IL-23R Nanobodies are chosen from the corresponding sequences mentioned in Table A-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one specific, but non-limiting aspect, the invention relates to a humanized Nanobody, which consists of 4 framework regions (FR1 to FR4 respectively) and 3 complementarity determining regions (CDR1 to CDR3 respectively), in which CDR1 to CDR3 are as defined herein and in which said humanized Nanobody comprises at least one humanizing substitution (as defined herein), and in particular at least one humanizing substitution in at least one of its framework sequences (as defined herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention relates to humanized variants of the above p19+, p19−, p40+, p40−, anti p35, anti-IL-27, anti IL-12Rb1, anti IL-12Rb2 and anti IL-23R Nanobodies, that comprise, compared to the corresponding native V\nHH \nsequence (i.e. as mentioned in Table A-2), at least one humanizing substitution (as defined herein), and in particular at least one humanizing substitution in at least one of its framework sequences (as defined herein). Examples of such humanized Nanobodies are given in SEQ ID NO's: 2559 to 2614 (see also \nFIG. 31\n), and the skilled person will be able to find other suitable humanized variants based on the disclosure herein, optionally after some limited trial-and-error.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptides of the invention comprise or essentially consist of at least one Nanobody of the invention. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of polypeptides of the invention are given in SEQ ID NO's: 2142 to 2169 and 2530 to 2558 (see also \nFIG. 30\n), as well as SEQ ID NO:2615 to 2622 (see \nFIGS. 32\n), \n2623\n to \n2629\n, \n2643\n and \n2644\n (see \nFIG. 33\n), SEQ ID NO: 2630 to 2641 (see \nFIG. 34\n), SEQ ID NO: 2645 and 2646 (see \nFIG. 35\n) and SEQ ID NO: 2647 and 2648 (see \nFIG. 36\n). The invention also relates to polypeptides that have at least 70%, such as at least 80%, for example at least 90% sequence identity with at least one of these polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, as further described in the Experimental Part, in the splenocyte assay described by Aggarwal (see Example 15), the Monovalent Nb 121A2 gave an IC50 of about 1.5 nM, whereas the following biparatopic constructs gave the following \nIC\n 50 values: 121A2-35GS-81A2: IC50=˜60 pM; 121A2-35GS-81G2: IC50=˜90 pM: 121A2-35GS-119G7): IC50=30-60 pM; 121A2-35GS-124H2: IC50=˜90 pM; and 121A2-35GS-124H IC50=˜180 pM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be clear to the skilled person that the Nanobodies that are mentioned herein as “preferred” (or “more preferred”, “even more preferred”, etc.) are also preferred (or more preferred, or even more preferred, etc.) for use in the polypeptides described herein. Thus, polypeptides that comprise or essentially consist of one or more “preferred” Nanobodies of the invention will generally be preferred, and polypeptides that comprise or essentially consist of one or more “more preferred” Nanobodies of the invention will generally be more preferred, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, proteins or polypeptides that comprise or essentially consist of a single Nanobody (such as a single Nanobody of the invention) will be referred to herein as “monovalent” proteins or polypeptides or as “monovalent constructs”. Proteins and polypeptides that comprise or essentially consist of two or more Nanobodies (such as at least two Nanobodies of the invention or at least one Nanobody of the invention and at least one other Nanobody) will be referred to herein as “multivalent” proteins or polypeptides or as “multivalent constructs”, and these may provide certain advantages compared to the corresponding monovalent Nanobodies of the invention. Some non-limiting examples of such multivalent constructs will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one specific, but non-limiting aspect, a polypeptide of the invention comprises or essentially consists of at least two Nanobodies of the invention, such as two or three Nanobodies of the invention. As further described herein, such multivalent constructs can provide certain advantages compared to a protein or polypeptide comprising or essentially consisting of a single Nanobody of the invention, such as a much improved avidity for heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors. Such multivalent constructs will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another specific, but non-limiting aspect, a polypeptide of the invention comprises or essentially consists of at least one Nanobody of the invention and at least one other binding unit (i.e. directed against another epitope, antigen, target, protein or polypeptide), which is preferably also a Nanobody. Such proteins or polypeptides are also referred to herein as “multispecific” proteins or polypeptides or as “multispecific constructs”, and these may provide certain advantages compared to the corresponding monovalent Nanobodies of the invention (as will become clear from the further discussion herein of some preferred, but-nonlimiting multispecific constructs). Such multispecific constructs will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein, and may in particular be biparatopic constructs (as mentioned herein). Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of such multispecific Nanobody constructs will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to yet another specific, but non-limiting aspect, a polypeptide of the invention comprises or essentially consists of at least one Nanobody of the invention, optionally one or more further Nanobodies, and at least one other amino acid sequence (such as a protein or polypeptide) that confers at least one desired property to the Nanobody of the invention and/or to the resulting fusion protein. Again, such fusion proteins may provide certain advantages compared to the corresponding monovalent Nanobodies of the invention. Some non-limiting examples of such amino acid sequences and of such fusion constructs will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible to combine two or more of the above aspects, for example to provide a trivalent bispecific construct comprising two Nanobodies of the invention and one other Nanobody, and optionally one or more other amino acid sequences. Further non-limiting examples of such constructs, as well as some constructs that are particularly preferred within the context of the present invention, will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above constructs, the one or more Nanobodies and/or other amino acid sequences may be directly linked to each other and/or suitably linked to each other via one or more linker sequences. Some suitable but non-limiting examples of such linkers will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific aspect of the invention, a Nanobody of the invention or a compound, construct or polypeptide of the invention comprising at least one Nanobody of the invention may have an increased half-life, compared to the corresponding amino acid sequence of the invention. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of such Nanobodies, compounds and polypeptides will become clear to the skilled person based on the further disclosure herein, and for example comprise Nanobodies sequences or polypeptides of the invention that have been chemically modified to increase the half-life thereof (for example, by means of pegylation); amino acid sequences of the invention that comprise at least one additional binding site for binding to a serum protein (such as serum albumin; or polypeptides of the invention that comprise at least one Nanobody of the invention that is linked to at least one moiety (and in particular at least one amino acid sequence) that increases the half-life of the Nanobody of the invention. Examples of polypeptides of the invention that comprise such half-life extending moieties or amino acid sequences will become clear to the skilled person based on the further disclosure herein; and for example include, without limitation, polypeptides in which the one or more Nanobodies of the invention are suitable linked to one or more serum proteins or fragments thereof (such as serum albumin or suitable fragments thereof) or to one or more binding units that can bind to serum proteins (such as, for example, Nanobodies or (single) domain antibodies that can bind to serum proteins such as serum albumin, serum immunoglobulins such as IgG, or transferrine); polypeptides in which a Nanobody of the invention is linked to an Fe portion (such as a human Fe) or a suitable part or fragment thereof; or polypeptides in which the one or more Nanobodies of the invention are suitable linked to one or more small proteins or peptides that can bind to serum proteins (such as, without limitation, the proteins and peptides described in WO 91/01743, WO 01/45746, WO 02/076489 and to the U.S. provisional application of Ablynx N.V. entitled “Peptides capable of binding to serum proteins” of Ablynx N.V. filed on Dec. 5, 2006 (see also WO 068280) as well as the U.S. provisional applications 61/050,385 and 61/045,690 of Ablynx N.V. both entitled “Improved peptides capable of binding to serum proteins”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain, as will be clear to the skilled person, such Nanobodies, compounds, constructs or polypeptides may contain one or more additional groups, residues, moieties or binding units, such as one or more further amino acid sequences and in particular one or more additional Nanobodies (i.e. not directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors), so as to provide a tri- of multispecific Nanobody construct.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the Nanobodies of the invention (or compounds, constructs or polypeptides comprising the same) with increased half-life preferably have a half-life that is at least 1.5 times, preferably at least 2 times, such as at least 5 times, for example at least 10 times or more than 20 times, greater than the half-life of the corresponding amino acid sequence of the invention per se.

In particular, said one or more amino acid sequences that allow the resulting polypeptides of the invention to cross the blood brain barrier may be one or more (such as two and preferably one) Nanobodies, such as the Nanobodies described in WO 02/057445, of which FC44 (SEQ ID NO: 189 of WO 06/040153) and FC5 (SEQ ID NO: 190 of WO 06/040154) are preferred examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, polypeptides comprising one or more Nanobodies of the invention are preferably such that they:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nbind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of 10\n−5 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less, and preferably 10\n−7 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less and more preferably 10\n−8 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter (i.e. with an association constant (K\nA\n) of 10\n5 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more, and preferably 10\n7 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more and more preferably 10\n8 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles);\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nand/or such that they:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nbind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with a k\non\n-rate of between 10\n2 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1 \nto about 10\n7 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1\n, preferably between 10\n3 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1\n, more preferably between 10\n4 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1\n, such as between 10\n5 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1\n;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nand/or such that they:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nbind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with a k\noff \nrate between 1 s\n−1 \n(t\n1/2\n=0.69 s) and 10\n−6 \ns\n−1 \n(providing a near irreversible complex with a t\n1/2 \nof multiple days), preferably between 10\n−2 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n, more preferably between 10\n−3 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n, such as between 10\n−4 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nPreferably, a polypeptide that contains only one amino acid sequence of the invention is preferably such that it will bind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with an affinity less than 500 nM, preferably less than 200 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, such as less than 500 pM. In this respect, it will be clear to the skilled person that a polypeptide that contains two or more Nanobodies of the invention may bind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with an increased avidity, compared to a polypeptide that contains only one amino acid sequence of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome preferred IC\n50 \nvalues for binding of the amino acid sequences or polypeptides of the invention to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors will become clear from the further description and examples herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of this invention relates to a nucleic acid that encodes a Nanobody of the invention or a polypeptide of the invention comprising the same. Again, as generally described herein for the nucleic acids of the invention, such a nucleic acid may be in the form of a genetic construct, as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention relates to host or host cell that expresses or that is capable of expressing an amino acid sequence (such as a (single) domain antibody and/or Nanobody) of the invention and/or a polypeptide of the invention comprising the same; and/or that contains a nucleic acid of the invention. Some preferred but non-limiting examples of such hosts or host cells will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention relates to a product or composition containing or comprising at least one amino acid sequence (such as a (single) domain antibody and/or Nanobody) of the invention, at least one polypeptide of the invention and/or at least one nucleic acid of the invention, and optionally one or more further components of such compositions known per se, i.e. depending on the intended use of the composition. Such a product or composition may for example be a pharmaceutical composition (as described herein), a veterinary composition or a product or composition for diagnostic use (as also described herein). Some preferred but non-limiting examples of such products or compositions will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further relates to methods for preparing or generating the amino acid sequences, compounds, constructs, polypeptides, nucleic acids, host cells, products and compositions described herein. Some preferred but non-limiting examples of such methods will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further relates to applications and uses of the amino acid sequences, compounds, constructs, polypeptides, nucleic acids, host cells, products and compositions described herein, as well as to methods for the prevention and/or treatment for diseases and disorders associated with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors. Some preferred but non-limiting applications and uses will become clear from the further description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther aspects, embodiments, advantages and applications of the invention will also become clear from the further description hereinbelow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, it should be noted that the term Nanobody as used herein in its broadest sense is not limited to a specific biological source or to a specific method of preparation. For example, as will be discussed in more detail below, the Nanobodies of the invention can generally be obtained: (1) by isolating the V\nHH \ndomain of a naturally occurring heavy chain antibody; (2) by expression of a nucleotide sequence encoding a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain; (3) by “humanization” (as described herein) of a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain or by expression of a nucleic acid encoding a such humanized V\nHH \ndomain; (4) by “camelisation” (as described herein) of a naturally occurring V\nH \ndomain from any animal species, and in particular a from species of mammal, such as from a human being, or by expression of a nucleic acid encoding such a camelized V\nH \ndomain; (5) by “camelisation” of a “domain antibody” or “Dab” as described by Ward et al (supra), or by expression of a nucleic acid encoding such a camelized V\nH \ndomain; (6) by using synthetic or semi-synthetic techniques for preparing proteins, polypeptides or other amino acid sequences known per se; (7) by preparing a nucleic acid encoding a Nanobody using techniques for nucleic acid synthesis known per se, followed by expression of the nucleic acid thus obtained; and/or (8) by any combination of one or more of the foregoing. Suitable methods and techniques for performing the foregoing will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein and for example include the methods and techniques described in more detail herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne preferred class of Nanobodies corresponds to the V\nHH \ndomains of naturally occurring heavy chain antibodies directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors. As further described herein, such V\nHH \nsequences can generally be generated or obtained by suitably immunizing a species of Camelid with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors (i.e. so as to raise an immune response and/or heavy chain antibodies directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors), by obtaining a suitable biological sample from said Camelid (such as a blood sample, serum sample or sample of B-cells), and by generating V\nHH \nsequences directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, starting from said sample, using any suitable technique known per se. Such techniques will be clear to the skilled person and/or are further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, such naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, can be obtained from naïve libraries of Camelid V\nHH \nsequences, for example by screening such a library using heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, or at least one part, fragment, antigenic determinant or epitope thereof using one or more screening techniques known per se. Such libraries and techniques are for example described in WO 99/37681, WO 01/90190, WO 03/025020 and WO 03/035694. Alternatively, improved synthetic or semi-synthetic libraries derived from naïve V\nHH \nlibraries may be used, such as V\nHH \nlibraries obtained from naïve V\nHH \nlibraries by techniques such as random mutagenesis and/or CDR shuffling, as for example described in WO 00/43507.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in another aspect, the invention relates to a method for generating Nanobodies, that are directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors. In one aspect, said method at least comprises the steps of:\n\n \n \n \na) providing a set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences; and\n \nb) screening said set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences for Nanobody sequences that can bind to and/or have affinity for heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors;\n \n\n\n \n \n \nand\n\n \n \n \nc) isolating the amino acid sequence(s) that can bind to and/or have affinity for heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn such a method, the set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences may be a naïve set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences; a synthetic or semi-synthetic set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences; and/or a set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences that have been subjected to affinity maturation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred aspect of this method, the set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences may be an immune set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences, and in particular an immune set, collection or library of V\nHH \nsequences, that have been derived from a species of Camelid that has been suitably immunized with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors or with a suitable antigenic determinant based thereon or derived therefrom, such as an antigenic part, fragment, region, domain, loop or other epitope thereof. In one particular aspect, said antigenic determinant may be an extracellular part, region, domain, loop or other extracellular epitope(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above methods, the set, collection or library of Nanobody or V\nHH \nsequences may be displayed on a phage, phagemid, ribosome or suitable micro-organism (such as yeast), such as to facilitate screening. Suitable methods, techniques and host organisms for displaying and screening (a set, collection or library of) Nanobody sequences will he clear to the person skilled in the art, for example on the basis of the further disclosure herein. Reference is also made to WO 03/054016 and to the review by Hoogenboom in Nature Biotechnology, 23, 9, 1105-1116 (2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the method for generating Nanobody sequences comprises at least the steps of:\n\n \n \n \na) providing a collection or sample of cells derived from a species of Camelid that express immunoglobulin sequences;\n \nb) screening said collection or sample of cells for (i) cells that express an immunoglobulin sequence that can bind to and/or have affinity for heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors; and (ii) cells that express heavy chain antibodies, in which substeps (i) and (ii) can be performed essentially as a single screening step or in any suitable order as two separate screening steps, so as to provide at least one cell that expresses a heavy chain antibody that can bind to and/or has affinity for heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors;\n \n\n\n \n \n \nand\n\n \n \n \nc) either (i) isolating from said cell the V\nHH \nsequence present in said heavy chain antibody; or (ii) isolating from said cell a nucleic acid sequence that encodes the V\nHH \nsequence present in said heavy chain antibody, followed by expressing said V\nHH \ndomain.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn the method according to this aspect, the collection or sample of cells may for example be a collection or sample of B-cells. Also, in this method, the sample of cells may be derived from a Camelid that has been suitably immunized with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors or a suitable antigenic determinant based thereon or derived therefrom, such as an antigenic part, fragment, region, domain, loop or other epitope thereof. In one particular aspect, said antigenic determinant may be an extracellular part, region, domain, loop or other extracellular epitope(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above method may be performed in any suitable manner, as will be clear to the skilled person. Reference is for example made to \nEP\n 0 542 810, WO 05/19824, WO 04/051268 and WO 04/106377. The screening of step b) is preferably performed using a flow cytometry technique such as FACS. For this, reference is for example made to Lieby et al., Blood, Vol. 97, No. 12, 3820. Particular reference is made to the so-called “Nanoclone™” technique described in International application WO 06/079372 by Ablynx N.V.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the method for generating an amino acid sequence directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors may comprise at least the steps of:\n\n \n \n \na) providing a set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences encoding heavy chain antibodies or Nanobody sequences;\n \nb) screening said set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences for nucleic acid sequences that encode a heavy chain antibody or a Nanobody sequence that can bind to and/or has affinity for heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors;\n \n\n\n \n \n \nand\n\n \n \n \nc) isolating said nucleic acid sequence, followed by expressing the V\nHH \nsequence present in said heavy chain antibody or by expressing said Nanobody sequence, respectively.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn such a method, the set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences encoding heavy chain antibodies or Nanobody sequences may for example be a set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences encoding a naïve set, collection or library of heavy chain antibodies or V\nHH \nsequences; a set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences encoding a synthetic or semi-synthetic set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences; and/or a set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences encoding a set, collection or library of Nanobody sequences that have been subjected to affinity maturation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred aspect of this method, the set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences may be an immune set, collection or library of nucleic acid sequences encoding heavy chain antibodies or V\nHH \nsequences derived from a Camelid that has been suitably immunized with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors or with a suitable antigenic determinant based thereon or derived therefrom, such as an antigenic part, fragment, region, domain, loop or other epitope thereof. In one particular aspect, said antigenic determinant may be an extracellular part, region, domain, loop or other extracellular epitope(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above methods, the set, collection or library of nucleotide sequences may be displayed on a phage, phagemid, ribosome or suitable micro-organism (such as yeast), such as to facilitate screening. Suitable methods, techniques and host organisms for displaying and screening (a set, collection or library of) nucleotide sequences encoding amino acid sequences will be clear to the person skilled in the art, for example on the basis of the further disclosure herein. Reference is also made to WO 03/054016 and to the review by Hoogenboom in Nature Biotechnology, 23, 9, 1105-1116 (2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be clear to the skilled person, the screening step of the methods described herein can also be performed as a selection step. Accordingly the term “screening” as used in the present description can comprise selection, screening or any suitable combination of selection and/or screening techniques. Also, when a set, collection or library of sequences is used, it may contain any suitable number of sequences, such as 1, 2, 3 or about 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10\n4\n, 10\n5\n, 10\n6\n, 10\n7\n, 10\n8 \nor more sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, one or more or all of the sequences in the above set, collection or library of amino acid sequences may be obtained or defined by rational, or semi-empirical approaches such as computer modelling techniques or biostatics or datamining techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, such a set, collection or library can comprise one, two or more sequences that are variants from one another (e.g. with designed point mutations or with randomized positions), compromise multiple sequences derived from a diverse set of naturally diversified sequences (e.g. an immune library)), or any other source of diverse sequences (as described for example in Hoogenboom et al, Nat Biotechnol 23:1105, 2005 and Binz et al, \nNat Biotechnol\n 2005, 23:1247). Such set, collection or library of sequences can be displayed on the surface of a phage particle, a ribosome, a bacterium, a yeast cell, a mammalian cell, and linked to the nucleotide sequence encoding the amino acid sequence within these carriers. This makes such set, collection or library amenable to selection procedures to isolate the desired amino acid sequences of the invention. More generally, when a sequence is displayed on a suitable host or host cell, it is also possible (and customary) to first isolate from said host or host cell a nucleotide sequence that encodes the desired sequence, and then to obtain the desired sequence by suitably expressing said nucleotide sequence in a suitable host organism. Again, this can be performed in any suitable manner known per se, as will be clear to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another technique for obtaining V\nHH \nsequences or Nanobody sequences directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors involves suitably immunizing a transgenic mammal that is capable of expressing heavy chain antibodies (i.e. so as to raise an immune response and/or heavy chain antibodies directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors), obtaining a suitable biological sample from said transgenic mammal that contains (nucleic acid sequences encoding) said V\nHH \nsequences or Nanobody sequences (such as a blood sample, serum sample or sample of B-cells), and then generating V\nHH \nsequences directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, starting from said sample, using any suitable technique known per se (such as any of the methods described herein or a hybridoma technique). For example, for this purpose, the heavy chain antibody-expressing mice and the further methods and techniques described in WO 02/085945, WO 04/049794 and WO 06/008548 and Janssens et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006 Oct. 10; 103(41):15130-5 can be used. For example, such heavy chain antibody expressing mice can express heavy chain antibodies with any suitable (single) variable domain, such as (single) variable domains from natural sources (e.g. human (single) variable domains, Camelid (single) variable domains or shark (single) variable domains), as well as for example synthetic or semi-synthetic (single) variable domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to the V\nHH \nsequences or Nanobody sequences that are obtained by the above methods, or alternatively by a method that comprises the one of the above methods and in addition at least the steps of determining the nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence of said V\nHH \nsequence or Nanobody sequence; and of expressing or synthesizing said V\nHH \nsequence or Nanobody sequence in a manner known per se, such as by expression in a suitable host cell or host organism or by chemical synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned herein, a particularly preferred class of Nanobodies of the invention comprises Nanobodies with an amino acid sequence that corresponds to the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain, but that has been “humanized”, i.e. by replacing one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of said naturally occurring V\nHH \nsequence (and in particular in the framework sequences) by one or more of the amino acid residues that occur at the corresponding position(s) in a V\nH \ndomain from a conventional 4-chain antibody from a human being (e.g. indicated above). This can be performed in a manner known per se, which will be clear to the skilled person, for example on the basis of the further description herein and the prior art on humanization referred to herein. Again, it should be noted that such humanized Nanobodies of the invention can be obtained in any suitable manner known per se (i.e. as indicated under points (1)-(8) above) and thus are not strictly limited to polypeptides that have been obtained using a polypeptide that comprises a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain as a starting material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother particularly preferred class of Nanobodies of the invention comprises Nanobodies with an amino acid sequence that corresponds to the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring V\nH \ndomain, but that has been “camelized”, i.e. by replacing one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring V\nH \ndomain from a conventional 4-chain antibody by one or more of the amino acid residues that occur at the corresponding position(s) in a V\nHH \ndomain of a heavy chain antibody. This can be performed in a manner known per se, which will be clear to the skilled person, for example on the basis of the further description herein. Such “camelizing” substitutions are preferably inserted at amino acid positions that form and/or are present at the V\nH\n-V\nL \ninterface, and/or at the so-called Camelidae hallmark residues, as defined herein (see for example WO 94/04678 and Davies and Riechmann (1994 and 1996), supra). Preferably, the V\nH \nsequence that is used as a starting material or starting point for generating or designing the camelized Nanobody is preferably a V\nH \nsequence from a mammal, more preferably the V\nH \nsequence of a human being, such as a \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 sequence. However, it should be noted that such camelized Nanobodies of the invention can be obtained in any suitable manner known per se (i.e. as indicated under points (1)-(8) above) and thus are not strictly limited to polypeptides that have been obtained using a polypeptide that comprises a naturally occurring V\nH \ndomain as a starting material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, again as further described herein, both “humanization” and “camelization” can be performed by providing a nucleotide sequence that encodes a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain or V\nH \ndomain, respectively, and then changing, in a manner known per se, one or more codons in said nucleotide sequence in such a way that the new nucleotide sequence encodes a “humanized” or “camelized” Nanobody of the invention, respectively. This nucleic acid can then be expressed in a manner known per se, so as to provide the desired Nanobody of the invention. Alternatively, based on the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain or V\nH \ndomain, respectively, the amino acid sequence of the desired humanized or camelized Nanobody of the invention, respectively, can be designed and then synthesized de novo using techniques for peptide synthesis known per se. Also, based on the amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence of a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain or V\nH \ndomain, respectively, a nucleotide sequence encoding the desired humanized or camelized Nanobody of the invention, respectively, can be designed and then synthesized de novo using techniques for nucleic acid synthesis known per se, after which the nucleic acid thus obtained can be expressed in a manner known per se, so as to provide the desired Nanobody of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable methods and techniques for obtaining the Nanobodies of the invention and/or nucleic acids encoding the same, starting from naturally occurring V\nH \nsequences or preferably V\nHH \nsequences, will be clear from the skilled person, and may for example comprise combining one or more parts of one or more naturally occurring V\nH \nsequences (such as one or more FR sequences and/or CDR sequences), one or more parts of one or more naturally occurring V\nHH \nsequences (such as one or more FR sequences or CDR sequences), and/or one or more synthetic or semi-synthetic sequences, in a suitable manner, so as to provide a Nanobody of the invention or a nucleotide sequence or nucleic acid encoding the same (which may then be suitably expressed). Nucleotide sequences encoding framework sequences of V\nHH \nsequences or Nanobodies will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein and/or the further prior art cited herein (and/or may alternatively be obtained by PCR starting from the nucleotide sequences obtained using the methods described herein) and may be suitably combined with nucleotide sequences that encode the desired CDR's (for example, by PCR assembly using overlapping primers), so as to provide a nucleic acid encoding a Nanobody of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned herein, Nanobodies may in particular be characterized by the presence of one or more “Hallmark residues” (as described herein) in one or more of the framework sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, according to one preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, a Nanobody in its broadest sense can be generally defined as a polypeptide comprising:\n\n \n \n \na) an amino acid sequence that is comprised of four framework regions/sequences interrupted by three complementarity determining regions/sequences, in which the amino acid residue at \nposition\n 108 according to the Kabat numbering is Q;\n \n\n\n \n \n \nand/or:\n\n \n \n \nb) an amino acid sequence that is comprised of four framework regions/sequences interrupted by three complementarity determining regions/sequences, in which the amino acid residue at \nposition\n 45 according to the Kabat numbering is a charged amino acid (as defined herein) or a cysteine residue, and position 44 is preferably an E;\n \n\n\n \n \n \nand/or:\n\n \n \n \nc) an amino acid sequence that is comprised of four framework regions/sequences interrupted by three complementarity determining regions/sequences, in which the amino acid residue at position 103 according to the Kabat numbering is chosen from the group consisting of P, R and S, and is in particular chosen from the group consisting of R and S.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThus, in a first preferred, but non-limiting aspect, a Nanobody of the invention may have the structure\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nin which FR1 to FR4 refer to \nframework regions\n 1 to

As further described herein, Nanobodies within this group usually have a V at position 37, and can have a W, P, R or S at position 103, and preferably have a W at position 103. The GLEW group also comprises some GLEW-like sequences such as those mentioned in Table A-4 below. More generally, and without limitation, Nanobodies belonging to the GLEW-group can be defined as Nanobodies with a G at position 44 and/or with a W at position 47, in which \nposition\n 46 is usually E and in which preferably position 45 is not a charged amino acid residue and not cysteine;\n \nii) The “KERE-group”: Nanobodies with the amino acid sequence KERE or KQRE (or another KERE-like sequence) at positions 43-46 according to the Kabat numbering and Q or L at \nposition\n 108 according to the Kabat numbering. As further described herein, Nanobodies within this group usually have a F at position 37, an L or F at position 47; and can have a W, P, R or S at position 103, and preferably have a W at position 103. More generally, and without limitation, Nanobodies belonging to the KERE-group can be defined as Nanobodies with a K, Q or R at position 44 (usually K) in which \nposition\n 45 is a charged amino acid residue or cysteine, and position 47 is as further defined herein;\n \niii) The “103 P, R, S-group”: Nanobodies with a P, R or S at position 103. These Nanobodies can have either the Amino acid sequence GLEW at positions 44-47 according to the Kabat numbering or the amino acid sequence KERE or KQRE at positions 43-46 according to the Kabat numbering, the latter most preferably in combination with an F at position 37 and an L or an F at position 47 (as defined for the KERE-group); and can have Q or L at \nposition\n 108 according to the Kabat numbering, and preferably have Q.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAlso, where appropriate, Nanobodies may belong to (i.e. have characteristics of) two or more of these classes. For example, one specifically preferred group of Nanobodies has GLEW or a GLEW-like sequence at positions 44-47; P, R or S (and in particular R) at position 103; and Q at position 108 (which may be humanized to L).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore generally, it should be noted that the definitions referred to above describe and apply to Nanobodies in the form of a native (i.e. non-humanized) V\nHH \nsequence, and that humanized variants of these Nanobodies may contain other amino acid residues than those indicated above (i.e. one or more humanizing substitutions as defined herein). For example, and without limitation, in some humanized Nanobodies of the GLEW-group or the 103 P, R, S-group, Q at \nposition\n 108 may be humanized to 108L. As already mentioned herein, other humanizing substitutions (and suitable combinations thereof) will become clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein. In addition, or alternatively, other potentially useful humanizing substitutions can be ascertained by comparing the sequence of the framework regions of a naturally occurring V\nHH \nsequence with the corresponding framework sequence of one or more closely related human V\nH \nsequences, after which one or more of the potentially useful humanizing substitutions (or combinations thereof) thus determined can be introduced into said V\nHH \nsequence (in any manner known per se, as further described herein) and the resulting humanized V\nHH \nsequences can be tested for affinity for the target, for stability, for ease and level of expression, and/or for other desired properties. In this way, by means of a limited degree of trial and error, other suitable humanizing substitutions (or suitable combinations thereof) can be determined by the skilled person based on the disclosure herein. Also, based on the foregoing, (the framework regions of) a Nanobody may be partially humanized or fully humanized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in another preferred, but non-limiting aspect, a Nanobody of the invention may be a Nanobody belonging to the GLEW-group (as defined herein), and in which CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 are as defined herein, and are preferably as defined according to one of the preferred aspects herein, and are more preferably as defined according to one of the more preferred aspects herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred, but non-limiting aspect, a Nanobody of the invention may be a Nanobody belonging to the KERE-group (as defined herein), and CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 are as defined herein, and are preferably as defined according to one of the preferred aspects herein, and are more preferably as defined according to one of the more preferred aspects herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in another preferred, but non-limiting aspect, a Nanobody of the invention may be a Nanobody belonging to the 103 P, R, S-group (as defined herein), and in which CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 are as defined herein, and are preferably as defined according to one of the preferred aspects herein, and are more preferably as defined according to one of the more preferred aspects herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, more generally and in addition to the 108Q, 43E/44R and 103 P, R, S residues mentioned above, the Nanobodies of the invention can contain, at one or more positions that in a conventional V\nH \ndomain would form (part of) the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninterface, one or more amino acid residues that are more highly charged than the amino acid residues that naturally occur at the same position(s) in the corresponding naturally occurring V\nH \nsequence, and in particular one or more charged amino acid residues (as mentioned in Table A-3). Such substitutions include, but are not limited to, the GLEW-like sequences mentioned in Table A-4 below; as well as the substitutions that are described in the International Application WO 00/29004 for so-called “microbodies”, e.g. so as to obtain a Nanobody with Q at \nposition\n 108 in combination with KLEW at positions 44-47. Other possible substitutions at these positions will be clear to the skilled person based upon the disclosure herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the Nanobodies of the invention, the amino acid residue at position 83 is chosen from the group consisting of L, M, S, V and W; and is preferably L.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, in one aspect of the Nanobodies of the invention, the amino acid residue at position 83 is chosen from the group consisting of R, K, N, E, G, I, T and Q; and is most preferably either K or E (for Nanobodies corresponding to naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains) or R (for “humanized” Nanobodies, as described herein).

Tables A-6 to A-9 mention some non-limiting residues that can be present at each position (according to the Kabat numbering) of the FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4 of naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains. For each position, the amino acid residue that most frequently occurs at each position of a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain (and which is the most preferred amino acid residue for said position in a Nanobody) is indicated in bold; and other preferred amino acid residues for each position have been underlined (note: the number of amino acid residues that are found at positions 26-30 of naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains supports the hypothesis underlying the numbering by Chothia (supra) that the residues at these positions already form part of CDR1.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Tables A-6-A-9, some of the non-limiting residues that can be present at each position of a \nhuman V\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain have also been mentioned. Again, for each position, the amino acid residue that most frequently occurs at each position of a naturally occurring \nhuman V\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain is indicated in bold; and other preferred amino acid residues have been underlined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor reference only, Tables A-6-A-9 also contain data on the V\nHH \nentropy (“V\nHH \nEnt.”) and V\nHH \nvariability (“V\nHH \nVar.”) at each amino acid position for a representative sample of 1118 V\nHH \nsequences (data kindly provided by David Lutje Hulsing and Prof. Theo Verrips of Utrecht University). The values for the V\nHH \nentropy and the V\nHH \nvariability provide a measure for the variability and degree of conservation of amino acid residues between the 1118 V\nHH \nsequences analyzed: low values (i.e. <1, such as <0.5) indicate that an amino acid residue is highly conserved between the V\nHH \nsequences (i.e. little variability). For example, the G at \nposition\n 8 and the G at \nposition\n 9 have values for the V\nHH \nentropy of 0.1 and 0 respectively, indicating that these residues are highly conserved and have little variability (and in case of \nposition\n 9 is Gin all 1118 sequences analysed), whereas for residues that form part of the CDR's generally values of 1.5 or more are found (data not shown). Note that (1) the amino acid residues listed in the second column of Tables A-6-A-9 are based on a bigger sample than the 1118 V\nHH \nsequences that were analysed for determining the V\nHH \nentropy and V\nHH \nvariability referred to in the last two columns; and (2) the data represented below support the hypothesis that the amino acid residues at positions 27-30 and maybe even also at \n \npositions\n \n 93 and 94 already form part of the CDR's (although the invention is not limited to any specific hypothesis or explanation, and as mentioned above, herein the numbering according to Kabat is used). For a general explanation of sequence entropy, sequence variability and the methodology for determining the same, see Oliveira et al., PROTEINS: Structure, Function and Genetics, 52: 544-552 (2003).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE A-6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-limiting examples of amino acid residues in FR1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(for the footnotes, see the footnotes to Table A-4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAmino acid residue(s):\n\n\nV\nHH\n \n\n\nV\nHH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPos.\n\n\n \nHuman V\n \n \n \nH\n3\n\n\nCamelid V\nHH\n's\n\n\nEnt.\n\n\nVar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n \nE\n, \nQ\n \n\n\n \nQ\n, A, E\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\n\n\n \nQ\n, K\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n \nV\n, L\n\n\n \nQ\n, E, L, V\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n\n\n \nE\n, D, Q, A\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n \nS\n, T\n\n\n \nS\n, F\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n \nG\n, R\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n \nG\n, V\n\n\n \nG\n, D, R\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nHallmark residue: L, M, S, V, W;

example be V\nHH \nsequences or may be humanized Nanobodies. When the above Nanobody sequences are V\nHH \nsequences, they may be suitably humanized, as further described herein. When the Nanobodies are partially humanized Nanobodies, they may optionally be further suitably humanized, again as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above Nanobodies, one or more of the further Hallmark residues are preferably as described herein (for example, when they are V\nHH \nsequences or partially humanized Nanobodies).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the CDR sequences and FR sequences in the (single) domain antibodies and/or Nanobodies of the invention are such that the Nanobodies of the invention (and polypeptides of the invention comprising the same):\n\n \n \n \n \n \nbind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of 10\n−5 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less, and preferably 10\n—7 \nto 10\n−12 \nmoles/liter or less and more preferably 10\n−8 \nto 10\n—12 \nmoles/liter (i.e. with an association constant (K\nA\n) of 10\n5 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more, and preferably 10\n7 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles or more and more preferably 10\n8 \nto 10\n12 \nliter/moles);\n \nand/or such that they:\n \nbind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with a k\non\n-rate of between 10\n2 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nto about 10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, preferably between 10\n3 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, more preferably between 10\n4 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, such as between 10\n5 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nand 10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n;\n \nand/or such that they:\n \nbind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with a k\noff \nrate between 1 s\n−1 \n(t\n1/2\n=0.69 s) and 10\n−6 \ns\n−1 \n(providing a near irreversible complex with a t\n1/2 \nof multiple days), preferably between 10\n−2 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n, more preferably between 10\n−3 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n, such as between 10\n−4 \ns\n−1 \nand 10\n−6 \ns\n−1\n.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nPreferably, CDR sequences and FR sequences present in the Nanobodies of the invention are such that the Nanobodies of the invention will bind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with an affinity less than 500 nM, preferably less than 200 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, such as less than 500 pM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one non-limiting aspect of the invention, a Nanobody may be as defined herein, but with the proviso that it has at least “one amino acid difference” (as defined herein) in at least one of the framework regions compared to the corresponding framework region of a naturally occurring human V\nH \ndomain, and in particular compared to the corresponding framework region of DP-47. More specifically, according to one non-limiting aspect of the invention, a Nanobody may be as defined herein, but with the proviso that it has at least “one amino acid difference” (as defined herein) at at least one of the Hallmark residues (including those at \npositions\n 108, 103 and/or 45) compared to the corresponding framework region of a naturally occurring human V\nH \ndomain, and in particular compared to the corresponding framework region of DP-47. Usually, a Nanobody will have at least one such amino acid difference with a naturally occurring V\nH \ndomain in at least one of FR2 and/or FR4, and in particular at at least one of the Hallmark residues in FR2 and/or FR4 (again, including those at \npositions\n 108, 103 and/or 45).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, a humanized Nanobody of the invention may be as defined herein, but with the proviso that it has at least “one amino acid difference” (as defined herein) in at least one of the framework regions compared to the corresponding framework region of a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain. More specifically, according to one non-limiting aspect of the invention, a humanized Nanobody may be as defined herein, but with the proviso that it has at least “one amino acid difference” (as defined herein) at at least one of the Hallmark residues (including those at \npositions\n 108, 103 and/or 45) compared to the corresponding framework region of a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain. Usually, a humanized Nanobody will have at least one such amino acid difference with a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain in at least one of FR2 and/or FR4, and in particular at at least one of the Hallmark residues in FR2 and/or FR4 (again, including those at \npositions\n 108, 103 and/or 45).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be clear from the disclosure herein, it is also within the scope of the invention to use natural or synthetic analogs, mutants, variants, alleles, homologs and orthologs (herein collectively referred to as “analogs”) of the Nanobodies of the invention as defined herein. Thus, according to one aspect of the invention, the term “Nanobody of the invention” in its broadest sense also covers such analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, in such analogs, one or more amino acid residues may have been replaced, deleted and/or added, compared to the Nanobodies of the invention as defined herein. Such substitutions, insertions or deletions may be made in one or more of the framework regions and/or in one or more of the CDR's. When such substitutions, insertions or deletions are made in one or more of the framework regions, they may be made at one or more of the Hallmark residues and/or at one or more of the other positions in the framework residues, although substitutions, insertions or deletions at the Hallmark residues are generally less preferred (unless these are suitable humanizing substitutions as described herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy means of non-limiting examples, a substitution may for example be a conservative substitution (as described herein) and/or an amino acid residue may be replaced by another amino acid residue that naturally occurs at the same position in another V\nHH \ndomain (see Tables A-5 to A-8 for some non-limiting examples of such substitutions), although the invention is generally not limited thereto. Thus, any one or more substitutions, deletions or insertions, or any combination thereof, that either improve the properties of the Nanobody of the invention or that at least do not detract too much from the desired properties or from the balance or combination of desired properties of the Nanobody of the invention (i.e. to the extent that the Nanobody is no longer suited for its intended use) are included within the scope of the invention. A skilled person will generally be able to determine and select suitable substitutions, deletions or insertions, or suitable combinations of thereof, based on the disclosure herein and optionally after a limited degree of routine experimentation, which may for example involve introducing a limited number of possible substitutions and determining their influence on the properties of the Nanobodies thus obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, and depending on the host organism used to express the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention, such deletions and/or substitutions may be designed in such a way that one or more sites for post-translational modification (such as one or more glycosylation sites) are removed, as will be within the ability of the person skilled in the art. Alternatively, substitutions or insertions may be designed so as to introduce one or more sites for attachment of functional groups (as described herein), for example to allow site-specific pegylation (again as described herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs can be seen from the data on the V\nHH \nentropy and V\nHH \nvariability given in Tables A-5 to A-8 above, some amino acid residues in the framework regions are more conserved than others. Generally, although the invention in its broadest sense is not limited thereto, any substitutions, deletions or insertions are preferably made at positions that are less conserved. Also, generally, amino acid substitutions are preferred over amino acid deletions or insertions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe analogs are preferably such that they can bind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K\nD\n-value (actual or apparent), a K\nA\n-value (actual or apparent), a k\non\n-rate and/or a k\noff\n-rate, or alternatively as an IC\n50 \nvalue, as further described herein) that is as defined herein for the Nanobodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe analogs are preferably also such that they retain the favourable properties the Nanobodies, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, according to one preferred aspect, the analogs have a degree of sequence identity of at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, such as at least 95% or 99% or more; and/or preferably have at most 20, preferably at most 10, even more preferably at most 5, such as 4, 3, 2 or only 1 amino acid difference (as defined herein), with one of the p19+ sequences, p19− sequences, p40− sequences, p40+ sequences, p35 sequences, IL-27 sequences, IL-12Rb1 sequences, IL-12Rb2 sequences or IL-23R sequences, respectively,that are mentioned in Table A-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the framework sequences and CDR's of the analogs are preferably such that they are in accordance with the preferred aspects defined herein. More generally, as described herein, the analogs will have (a) a Q at \nposition\n 108; and/or (b) a charged amino acid or a cysteine residue at \nposition\n 45 and preferably an E at position 44, and more preferably E at position 44 and R at \nposition\n 45; and/or (c) P, R or S at position 103.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne preferred class of analogs of the Nanobodies of the invention comprise Nanobodies that have been humanized (i.e. compared to the sequence of a naturally occurring Nanobody of the invention). As mentioned in the background art cited herein, such humanization generally involves replacing one or more amino acid residues in the sequence of a naturally occurring V\nHH \nwith the amino acid residues that occur at the same position in a human V\nH \ndomain, such as a \nhuman V\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain. Examples of possible humanizing substitutions or combinations of humanizing substitutions will be clear to the skilled person, for example from the Tables herein, from the possible humanizing substitutions mentioned in the background art cited herein, and/or from a comparision between the sequence of a Nanobody and the sequence of a naturally occurring human V\nH \ndomain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe humanizing substitutions should be chosen such that the resulting humanized Nanobodies still retain the favourable properties of Nanobodies as defined herein, and more preferably such that they are as described for analogs in the preceding paragraphs. A skilled person will generally be able to determine and select suitable humanizing substitutions or suitable combinations of humanizing substitutions, based on the disclosure herein and optionally after a limited degree of routine experimentation, which may for example involve introducing a limited number of possible humanizing substitutions and determining their influence on the properties of the Nanobodies thus obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, as a result of humanization, the Nanobodies of the invention may become more “human-like”, while still retaining the favorable properties of the Nanobodies of the invention as described herein. As a result, such humanized Nanobodies may have several advantages, such as a reduced immunogenicity, compared to the corresponding naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains. Again, based on the disclosure herein and optionally after a limited degree of routine experimentation, the skilled person will be able to select humanizing substitutions or suitable combinations of humanizing substitutions which optimize or achieve a desired or suitable balance between the favourable properties provided by the humanizing substitutions on the one hand and the favourable properties of naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains on the other hand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Nanobodies of the invention may be suitably humanized at any framework residue(s), such as at one or more Hallmark residues (as defined herein) or at one or more other framework residues (i.e. non-Hallmark residues) or any suitable combination thereof. One preferred humanizing substitution for Nanobodies of the “P,R,S-103 group” or the “KERE group” is Q108 into L108. Nanobodies of the “GLEW class” may also be humanized by a Q108 into L108 substitution, provided at least one of the other Hallmark residues contains a camelid (camelizing) substitution (as defined herein). For example, as mentioned above, one particularly preferred class of humanized Nanobodies has GLEW or a GLEW-like sequence at positions 44-47; P, R or S (and in particular R) at position 103, and an L at \nposition\n 108.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe humanized and other analogs, and nucleic acid sequences encoding the same, can be provided in any manner known per se. For example, the analogs can be obtained by providing a nucleic acid that encodes a naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomain, changing the codons for the one or more amino acid residues that are to be substituted into the codons for the corresponding desired amino acid residues (e.g. by site-directed mutagenesis or by PCR using suitable mismatch primers), expressing the nucleic acid/nucleotide sequence thus obtained in a suitable host or expression system; and optionally isolating and/or purifying the analog thus obtained to provide said analog in essentially isolated form (e.g. as further described herein). This can generally be performed using methods and techniques known per se, which will be clear to the skilled person, for example from the handbooks and references cited herein, the background art cited herein and/or from the further description herein. Alternatively, a nucleic acid encoding the desired analog can be synthesized in a manner known per se (for example using an automated apparatus for synthesizing nucleic acid sequences with a predefined amino acid sequence) and can then be expressed as described herein. Yet another technique may involve combining one or more naturally occurring and/or synthetic nucleic acid sequences each encoding a part of the desired analog, and then expressing the combined nucleic acid sequence as described herein. Also, the analogs can be provided using chemical synthesis of the pertinent amino acid sequence using techniques for peptide synthesis known per se, such as those mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this respect, it will be also be clear to the skilled person that the Nanobodies of the invention (including their analogs) can be designed and/or prepared starting from human V\nH \nsequences (i.e. amino acid sequences or the corresponding nucleotide sequences), such as for example from \nhuman V\n \n \n \nH\n3 sequences such as DP-47, DP-51 or DP-29, i.e. by introducing one or more camelizing substitutions (i.e. changing one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of said human V\nH \ndomain into the amino acid residues that occur at the corresponding position in a V\nHH \ndomain), so as to provide the sequence of a Nanobody of the invention and/or so as to confer the favourable properties of a Nanobody to the sequence thus obtained. Again, this can generally be performed using the various methods and techniques referred to in the previous paragraph, using an amino acid sequence and/or nucleotide sequence for a human V\nH \ndomain as a starting point.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome preferred, but non-limiting camelizing substitutions can be derived from Tables A-5-A-8. It will also be clear that camelizing substitutions at one or more of the Hallmark residues will generally have a greater influence on the desired properties than substitutions at one or more of the other amino acid positions, although both and any suitable combination thereof are included within the scope of the invention. For example, it is possible to introduce one or more camelizing substitutions that already confer at least some the desired properties, and then to introduce further camelizing substitutions that either further improve said properties and/or confer additional favourable properties. Again, the skilled person will generally be able to determine and select suitable camelizing substitutions or suitable combinations of camelizing substitutions, based on the disclosure herein and optionally after a limited degree of routine experimentation, which may for example involve introducing a limited number of possible camelizing substitutions and determining whether the favourable properties of Nanobodies are obtained or improved (i.e. compared to the original V\nH \ndomain).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, however, such camelizing substitutions are preferably such that the resulting an amino acid sequence at least contains (a) a Q at \nposition\n 108; and/or (b) a charged amino acid or a cysteine residue at \nposition\n 45 and preferably also an E at position 44, and more preferably E at position 44 and R at \nposition\n 45; and/or (c) P, R or S at position 103; and optionally one or more further camelizing substitutions. More preferably, the camelizing substitutions are such that they result in a Nanobody of the invention and/or in an analog thereof (as defined herein), such as in a humanized analog and/or preferably in an analog that is as defined in the preceding paragraphs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will also be clear from the disclosure herein, it is also within the scope of the invention to use parts or fragments, or combinations of two or more parts or fragments, of the Nanobodies of the invention as defined herein, and in particular parts or fragments of the p19+, p19−, p40+, p40−, anti p35, anti-IL-27, anti IL-12Rb1, anti IL-12Rb2 and anti IL-23R Nanobodies, respectively, as further described herein and/or as listed in Table A-2; or of humanized variants thereof. Thus, according to one aspect of the invention, the term “Nanobody of the invention” in its broadest sense also covers such parts or fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, such parts or fragments of the Nanobodies of the invention (including analogs thereof) have amino acid sequences in which, compared to the amino acid sequence of the corresponding full length Nanobody of the invention (or analog thereof), one or more of the amino acid residues at the N-terminal end, one or more amino acid residues at the C-terminal end, one or more contiguous internal amino acid residues, or any combination thereof, have been deleted and/or removed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe parts or fragments are preferably such that they can bind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K\nD\n-value (actual or apparent), a K\nA\n-value (actual or apparent), a k\non\n-rate and/or a k\noff\n-rate, or alternatively as an IC\n50 \nvalue, as further described herein) that is as defined herein for the Nanobodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny part or fragment is preferably such that it comprises at least 10 contiguous amino acid residues, preferably at least 20 contiguous amino acid residues, more preferably at least 30 contiguous amino acid residues, such as at least 40 contiguous amino acid residues, of the amino acid sequence of the corresponding full length Nanobody of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, any part or fragment is such preferably that it comprises at least one of CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 or at least part thereof (and in particular at least CDR3 or at least part thereof). More preferably, any part or fragment is such that it comprises at least one of the CDR's (and preferably at least CDR3 or part thereof) and at least one other CDR (i.e. CDR1 or CDR2) or at least part thereof, preferably connected by suitable framework sequence(s) or at least part thereof. More preferably, any part or fragment is such that it comprises at least one of the CDR's (and preferably at least CDR3 or part thereof) and at least part of the two remaining CDR's, again preferably connected by suitable framework sequence(s) or at least part thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another particularly preferred, but non-limiting aspect, such a part or fragment comprises at least CDR3, such as FR3, CDR3 and FR4 of the corresponding full length Nanobody of the invention, i.e. as for example described in the International application WO 03/050531 (Lasters et al.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs already mentioned above, it is also possible to combine two or more of such parts or fragments (i.e. from the same or different Nanobodies of the invention), i.e. to provide an analog (as defined herein) and/or to provide further parts or fragments (as defined herein) of a Nanobody of the invention. It is for example also possible to combine one or more parts or fragments of a Nanobody of the invention with one or more parts or fragments of a human V\nH \ndomain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one preferred aspect, the parts or fragments have a degree of sequence identity of at least 50%, preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, even more preferably at least 80%, such as at least 90%, 95% or 99% or more with one of the p19+, p19−, p40+, p40−, anti p35, anti-IL-27, anti IL-12Rb1, anti IL-12Rb2 and anti IL-23R Nanobodies, respectively, as further described herein and/or as listed in Table A-2; and/or with of humanized variants thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe parts and fragments, and nucleic acid sequences encoding the same, can be provided and optionally combined in any manner known per se. For example, such parts or fragments can be obtained by inserting a stop codon in a nucleic acid that encodes a full-sized Nanobody of the invention, and then expressing the nucleic acid thus obtained in a manner known per se (e.g. as described herein). Alternatively, nucleic acids encoding such parts or fragments can be obtained by suitably restricting a nucleic acid that encodes a full-sized Nanobody of the invention or by synthesizing such a nucleic acid in a manner known per se. Parts or fragments may also be provided using techniques for peptide synthesis known per se.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention in its broadest sense also comprises derivatives of the Nanobodies of the invention. Such derivatives can generally be obtained by modification, and in particular by chemical and/or biological (e.g enzymatical) modification, of the Nanobodies of the invention and/or of one or more of the amino acid residues that form the Nanobodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of such modifications, as well as examples of amino acid residues within the Nanobody sequence that can be modified in such a manner (i.e. either on the protein backbone but preferably on a side chain), methods and techniques that can be used to introduce such modifications and the potential uses and advantages of such modifications will be clear to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, such a modification may involve the introduction (e.g. by covalent linking or in an other suitable manner) of one or more functional groups, residues or moieties into or onto the Nanobody of the invention, and in particular of one or more functional groups, residues or moieties that confer one or more desired properties or functionalities to the Nanobody of the invention. Example of such functional groups will be clear to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, such modification may comprise the introduction (e.g. by covalent binding or in any other suitable manner) of one or more functional groups that increase the half-life, the solubility and/or the absorption of the Nanobody of the invention, that reduce the immunogenicity and/or the toxicity of the Nanobody of the invention, that eliminate or attenuate any undesirable side effects of the Nanobody of the invention, and/or that confer other advantageous properties to and/or reduce the undesired properties of the Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention; or any combination of two or more of the foregoing. Examples of such functional groups and of techniques for introducing them will be clear to the skilled person, and can generally comprise all functional groups and techniques mentioned in the general background art cited hereinabove as well as the functional groups and techniques known per se for the modification of pharmaceutical proteins, and in particular for the modification of antibodies or antibody fragments (including ScFv's and single domain antibodies), for which reference is for example made to Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (1980). Such functional groups may for example be linked directly (for example covalently) to a Nanobody of the invention, or optionally via a suitable linker or spacer, as will again be clear to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of the most widely used techniques for increasing the half-life and/or reducing the immunogenicity of pharmaceutical proteins comprises attachment of a suitable pharmacologically acceptable polymer, such as poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) or derivatives thereof (such as methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) or mPEG). Generally, any suitable form of pegylation can be used, such as the pegylation used in the art for antibodies and antibody fragments (including but not limited to (single) domain antibodies and ScFv's); reference is made to for example Chapman, Nat. Biotechnol., 54, 531-545 (2002); by Veronese and Harris, Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 54, 453-456 (2003), by Harris and Chess, Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov., 2, (2003) and in WO 04/060965. Various reagents for pegylation of proteins are also commercially available, for example from Nektar Therapeutics, USA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, site-directed pegylation is used, in particular via a cysteine-residue (see for example Yang et al., Protein Engineering, 16, 10, 761-770 (2003). For example, for this purpose, PEG may be attached to a cysteine residue that naturally occurs in a Nanobody of the invention, a Nanobody of the invention may be modified so as to suitably introduce one or more cysteine residues for attachment of PEG, or an amino acid sequence comprising one or more cysteine residues for attachment of PEG may be fused to the N- and/or C-terminus of a Nanobody of the invention, all using techniques of protein engineering known per se to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, for the Nanobodies and proteins of the invention, a PEG is used with a molecular weight of more than 5000, such as more than 10,000 and less than 200,000, such as less than 100,000; for example in the range of 20,000-80,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother, usually less preferred modification comprises N-linked or O-linked glycosylation, usually as part of co-translational and/or post-translational modification, depending on the host cell used for expressing the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another modification may comprise the introduction of one or more detectable labels or other signal-generating groups or moieties, depending on the intended use of the labelled Nanobody. Suitable labels and techniques for attaching, using and detecting them will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include, but are not limited to, fluorescent labels (such as fluorescein, isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaldehyde, and fluorescamine and fluorescent metals such as \n152\nEu or others metals from the lanthanide series), phosphorescent labels, chemiluminescent labels or bioluminescent labels (such as luminal, isoluminol, theromatic acridinium ester, imidazole, acridinium salts, oxalate ester, dioxetane or GFP and its analogs), radio-isotopes (such as \n3\nH, \n125\nI, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n14\nC, \n51\nCr, \n36\nCl, \n57\nCo, \n58\nCo, \n59\nFe, and \n75\nSe), metals, metal chelates or metallic cations (for example metallic cations such as \n99m\nTc, \n123\nI, \n111\nIn, \n131\nI, \n97\nRu, \n67\nCu, \n67\nGa, and \n68\nGa or other metals or metallic cations that are particularly suited for use in in vivo, in vitro or in situ diagnosis and imaging, such as (\n157\nGd, \n55\nMn, \n162\nDy, \n52\nCr, and \n56\nFe), as well as chromophores and enzymes (such as malate dehydrogenase, staphylococcal nuclease, delta-V-steroid isomerase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, biotinavidin peroxidase, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, asparaginase, glucose oxidase, beta-galactosidase, ribonuclease, urease, catalase, glucose-VI-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucoamylase and acetylcholine esterase). Other suitable labels will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include moieties that can be detected using NMR or ESR spectroscopy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch labelled Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may for example be used for in vitro, in vivo or in situ assays (including immunoassays known per se such as ELISA, RIA, EIA and other “sandwich assays”, etc.) as well as in vivo diagnostic and imaging purposes, depending on the choice of the specific label.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be clear to the skilled person, another modification may involve the introduction of a chelating group, for example to chelate one of the metals or metallic cations referred to above. Suitable chelating groups for example include, without limitation, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another modification may comprise the introduction of a functional group that is one part of a specific binding pair, such as the biotin-(strept)avidin binding pair. Such a functional group may be used to link the Nanobody of the invention to another protein, polypeptide or chemical compound that is bound to the other half of the binding pair, i.e. through formation of the binding pair. For example, a Nanobody of the invention may be conjugated to biotin, and linked to another protein, polypeptide, compound or carrier conjugated to avidin or streptavidin. For example, such a conjugated Nanobody may be used as a reporter, for example in a diagnostic system where a detectable signal-producing agent is conjugated to avidin or streptavidin. Such binding pairs may for example also be used to bind the Nanobody of the invention to a carrier, including carriers suitable for pharmaceutical purposes. One non-limiting example are the liposomal formulations described by Cao and Suresh, Journal of Drug Targetting, 8, 4, 257 (2000). Such binding pairs may also be used to link a therapeutically active agent to the Nanobody of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some applications, in particular for those applications in which it is intended to kill a cell that expresses the target against which the Nanobodies of the invention are directed (e.g. in the treatment of cancer), or to reduce or slow the growth and/or proliferation such a cell, the Nanobodies of the invention may also be linked to a toxin or to a toxic residue or moiety. Examples of toxic moieties, compounds or residues which can be linked to a Nanobody of the invention to provide—for example—a cytotoxic compound will be clear to the skilled person and can for example be found in the prior art cited above and/or in the further description herein. One example is the so-called ADEPT™ technology described in WO 03/055527.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther potential chemical and enzymatical modifications will be clear to the skilled person. Such modifications may also be introduced for research purposes (e.g. to study function-activity relationships). Reference is for example made to Lundblad and Bradshaw, Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem., 26, 143-151 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the derivatives are such that they bind to heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors with an affinity (suitably measured and/or expressed as a K\nD\n-value (actual or apparent), a K\nA\n-value (actual or apparent), a k\non\n-rate and/or a k\noff\n-rate, or alternatively as an IC\n50 \nvalue, as further described herein) that is as defined herein for the Nanobodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, the invention also relates to proteins or polypeptides that essentially consist of or comprise at least one Nanobody of the invention. By “essentially consist of” is meant that the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide of the invention either is exactly the same as the amino acid sequence of a Nanobody of the invention or corresponds to the amino acid sequence of a Nanobody of the invention which has a limited number of amino acid residues, such as 1-20 amino acid residues, for example 1-10 amino acid residues and preferably 1-6 amino acid residues, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 amino acid residues, added at the amino terminal end, at the carboxy terminal end, or at both the amino terminal end and the carboxy terminal end of the amino acid sequence of the Nanobody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSaid amino acid residues may or may not change, alter or otherwise influence the (biological) properties of the Nanobody and may or may not add further functionality to the Nanobody. For example, such amino acid residues:\n\n \n \n \n \n \ncan comprise an N-terminal Met residue, for example as result of expression in a heterologous host cell or host organism.\n \nmay form a signal sequence or leader sequence that directs secretion of the Nanobody from a host cell upon synthesis. Suitable secretory leader peptides will be clear to the skilled person, and may be as further described herein. Usually, such a leader sequence will be linked to the N-terminus of the Nanobody, although the invention in its broadest sense is not limited thereto;\n \nmay form a sequence or signal that allows the Nanobody to be directed towards and/or to penetrate or enter into specific organs, tissues, cells, or parts or compartments of cells, and/or that allows the Nanobody to penetrate or cross a biological barrier such as a cell membrane, a cell layer such as a layer of epithelial cells, a tumor including solid tumors, or the blood-brain-barrier. Examples of such amino acid sequences will be clear to the skilled person. Some non-limiting examples are the small peptide vectors (“Pep-trans vectors”) described in WO 03/026700 and in Temsamani et at, Expert Opin. Biol. Ther., 1, 773 (2001); Temsamani and Vidal, Drug Discov. Today, 9, 1012 (004) and Rousselle, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 296, 124-131 (2001), and the membrane translocator sequence described by Zhao et al., Apoptosis, 8, 631-637 (2003). C-terminal and N-terminal amino acid sequences for intracellular targeting of antibody fragments are for example described by Cardinale et al., Methods, 34, 171 (2004). Other suitable techniques for intracellular targeting involve the expression and/or use of so-called “intrabodies” comprising a Nanobody of the invention, as mentioned below;\n \nmay form a “tag”, for example an amino acid sequence or residue that allows or facilitates the purification of the Nanobody, for example using affinity techniques directed against said sequence or residue. Thereafter, said sequence or residue may be removed (e.g. by chemical or enzymatical cleavage) to provide the Nanobody sequence (for this purpose, the tag may optionally be linked to the Nanobody sequence via a cleavable linker sequence or contain a cleavable motif). Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of such residues are multiple histidine residues, glutatione residues and a myc-tag (see for example SEQ ID NO:31 of WO 06/12282).\n \nmay be one or more amino acid residues that have been functionalized and/or that can serve as a site for attachment of functional groups. Suitable amino acid residues and functional groups will be clear to the skilled person and include, but are not limited to, the amino acid residues and functional groups mentioned herein for the derivatives of the Nanobodies of the invention.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAccording to another aspect, a polypeptide of the invention comprises a Nanobody of the invention, which is fused at its amino terminal end, at its carboxy terminal end, or both at its amino terminal end and at its carboxy terminal end to at least one further amino acid sequence, i.e. so as to provide a fusion protein comprising said Nanobody of the invention and the one or more further amino acid sequences. Such a fusion will also be referred to herein as a “Nanobody fusion”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe one or more further amino acid sequence may be any suitable and/or desired amino acid sequences. The further amino acid sequences may or may not change, alter or otherwise influence the (biological) properties of the Nanobody, and may or may not add further functionality to the Nanobody or the polypeptide of the invention. Preferably, the further amino acid sequence is such that it confers one or more desired properties or functionalities to the Nanobody or the polypeptide of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the further amino acid sequence may also provide a second binding site, which binding site may be directed against any desired protein, polypeptide, antigen, antigenic determinant or epitope (including but not limited to the same protein, polypeptide, antigen, antigenic determinant or epitope against which the Nanobody of the invention is directed, or a different protein, polypeptide, antigen, antigenic determinant or epitope).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExample of such amino acid sequences will be clear to the skilled person, and may generally comprise all amino acid sequences that are used in peptide fusions based on conventional antibodies and fragments thereof (including but not limited to ScFv's and single domain antibodies). Reference is for example made to the review by Holliger and Hudson, Nature Biotechnology, 23, 9, 1126-1136 (2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, such an amino acid sequence may be an amino acid sequence that increases the half-life, the solubility, or the absorption, reduces the immunogenicity or the toxicity, eliminates or attenuates undesirable side effects, and/or confers other advantageous properties to and/or reduces the undesired properties of the polypeptides of the invention, compared to the Nanobody of the invention per se. Some non-limiting examples of such amino acid sequences are serum proteins, such as human serum albumin (see for example WO 00/27435) or haptenic molecules (for example haptens that are recognized by circulating antibodies, see for example WO 98/22141).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, it has been described in the art that linking fragments of immunoglobulins (such as V\nH \ndomains) to serum albumin or to fragments thereof can be used to increase the half-life. Reference is for made to WO 00/27435 and WO 01/077137). According to the invention, the Nanobody of the invention is preferably either directly linked to serum albumin (or to a suitable fragment thereof) or via a suitable linker, and in particular via a suitable peptide linked so that the polypeptide of the invention can be expressed as a genetic fusion (protein). According to one specific aspect, the Nanobody of the invention may be linked to a fragment of serum albumin that at least comprises the domain III of serum albumin or part thereof. Reference is for example made to the U.S. \nprovisional application\n 60/788,256 of Ablynx N. V. entitled “\nAlbumin derived amino acid sequence, use thereof for increasing the half\n-\nlife of therapeutic proteins and of other therapeutic proteins and entities, and constructs comprising the same\n” filed on Mar. 31, 2006 (see also PCT/EP2007/002817).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the further amino acid sequence may provide a second binding site or binding unit that is directed against a serum protein (such as, for example, human serum albumin or another serum protein such as IgG), so as to provide increased half-life in serum. Such amino acid sequences for example include the Nanobodies described below, as well as the small peptides and binding proteins described in WO 91/01743, WO 01/45746 and WO 02/076489 and the dAb's described in WO 03/002609 and WO 04/003019. Reference is also made to Harmsen et al., Vaccine, 23 (41); 4926-42, 2005, as well as to \nEP\n 0 368 684, as well as to the following the U.S. \nprovisional applications\n 60/843,349 (see also PCT/EP2007/059475), 60/850,774 (see also PCT/EP2007/060849), 60/850,775 (see also PCT/EP2007/060850) by Ablynx N. V. mentioned herein and U.S. provisional application of Ablynx N. V. entitled “\nPeptides capable of binding to serum proteins\n” filed on Dec. 5, 2006 (see also WO 068280) as well as the U.S. \nprovisional applications\n 61/050,385 and 61/045,690 of Ablynx N. V. both entitled “Improved peptides capable of binding to serum proteins”. Such amino acid sequences may in particular be directed against serum albumin (and more in particular human serum albumin) and/or against IgG (and more in particular human IgG). For example, such amino acid sequences may be amino acid sequences that are directed against (human) serum albumin and amino acid sequences that can bind to amino acid residues on (human) serum albumin that are not involved in binding of serum albumin to FcRn (see for example WO 06/0122787) and/or amino acid sequences that are capable of binding to amino acid residues on serum albumin that do not form part of domain III of serum albumin (see again for example WO 06/0122787); amino acid sequences that have or can provide an increased half-life (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/843,349 by Ablynx N. V. entitled “Serum albumin binding proteins with long half-lives” filed on Sep. 8, 2006; see also PCT/EP2007/059475); amino acid sequences against human serum albumin that are cross-reactive with serum albumin from at least one species of mammal, and in particular with at least one species of primate (such as, without limitation, monkeys from the genus \nMacaca \n(such as, and in particular, cynomologus monkeys (\nMacaca fascicularis\n) and/or rhesus monkeys (\nMacaca mulatta\n)) and baboon (\nPapio ursinus\n), reference is again made to the U.S. provisional application 60/843,349 and PCT/EP2007/059475); amino acid sequences that can bind to serum albumin in a pH independent manner (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/850,774 by Ablynx N. V. entitled “\nAmino acid sequences that bind to serum proteins in a manner that is essentially independent of the pH, compounds comprising the same, and uses thereof\n”, filed on Oct. 11, 2006, see also WO 08/043821) and/or amino acid sequences that are conditional binders (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/850,775 by Ablynx N. V. entitled “\nAmino acid sequences that bind to a desired molecule in a conditional manner\n”, filed on Oct. 11, 2006); see also PCT/EP2007/060850).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another aspect, the one or more further amino acid sequences may comprise one or more parts, fragments or domains of conventional 4-chain antibodies (and in particular human antibodies) and/or of heavy chain antibodies. For example, although usually less preferred, a Nanobody of the invention may be linked to a conventional (preferably human) V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomain or to a natural or synthetic analog of a V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomain, again optionally via a linker sequence (including but not limited to other (single) domain antibodies, such as the dAb's described by Ward et al.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe at least one Nanobody may also be linked to one or more (preferably human) \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and/or \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains, optionally via a linker sequence. For instance, a Nanobody linked to a suitable C\nH\nI domain could for example be used—together with suitable light chains—to generate antibody fragments/structures analogous to conventional Fab fragments or F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments, but in which one or (in case of an F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment) one or both of the conventional V\nH \ndomains have been replaced by a Nanobody of the invention. Also, two Nanobodies could be linked to a \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain (optionally via a linker) to provide a construct with increased half-life in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one specific aspect of a polypeptide of the invention, one or more Nanobodies of the invention may be linked (optionally via a suitable linker or hinge region) to one or more constant domains (for example, 2 or 3 constant domains that can be used as part of/to form an Fc portion), to an Fc portion and/or to one or more antibody parts, fragments or domains that confer one or more effector functions to the polypeptide of the invention and/or may confer the ability to bind to one or more Fc receptors. For example, for this purpose, and without being limited thereto, the one or more further amino acid sequences may comprise one or \nmore C\n \n \n \nH\n2 and/or \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains of an antibody, such as from a heavy chain antibody (as described herein) and more preferably from a conventional human 4-chain antibody; and/or may form (part of) and Fc region, for example from IgG (e.g. from IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4), from IgE or from another human Ig such as IgA, IgD or IgM. For example, WO 94/04678 describes heavy chain antibodies comprising a Camelid V\nHH \ndomain or a humanized derivative thereof (i.e. a Nanobody), in which the \nCamelidae C\n \n \n \nH\n2 and/or \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain have been replaced by \nhuman C\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains, so as to provide an immunoglobulin that consists of 2 heavy chains each comprising a Nanobody and \nhuman C\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains (but no \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domain), which immunoglobulin has the effector function provided by the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains and which immunoglobulin can function without the presence of any light chains. Other amino acid sequences that can be suitably linked to the Nanobodies of the invention so as to provide an effector function will be clear to the skilled person, and may be chosen on the basis of the desired effector function(s). Reference is for example made to WO 04/058820, WO 99/42077; WO 02/056910 and WO 05/017148, as well as the review by Holliger and Hudson, supra; and to the non-prepublished U.S. provisional application by Ablynx N. V. entitled “\nConstructs comprising single variable domains and an Fc portion derived from IgE\n” which has a filing date of Dec. 4, 2007 and the corresponding PCT application based thereon (also invoked as priority for this application), which has the same filing date as the present application. Coupling of a Nanobody of the invention to an Fc portion may also lead to an increased half-life, compared to the corresponding Nanobody of the invention. For some applications, the use of an Fc portion and/or of constant domains (i.e. \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and/or \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains) that confer increased half-life without any biologically significant effector function may also be suitable or even preferred. Other suitable constructs comprising one or more Nanobodies and one or more constant domains with increased half-life in vivo will be clear to the skilled person, and may for example comprise two Nanobodies linked to a \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain, optionally via a linker sequence. Generally, any fusion protein or derivatives with increased half-life will preferably have a molecular weight of more than 50 kD, the cut-off value for renal absorption.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another one specific, but non-limiting, aspect, in order to form a polypeptide of the invention, one or more amino acid sequences of the invention may be linked (optionally via a suitable linker or hinge region) to naturally occurring, synthetic or semisynthetic constant domains (or analogs, variants, mutants, parts or fragments thereof) that have a reduced (or essentially no) tendency to self-associate into dimers (i.e. compared to constant domains that naturally occur in conventional 4-chain antibodies). Such monomeric (i.e. not self-associating) Fc chain variants, or fragments thereof, will be clear to the skilled person. For example, Helm et al., \nJ Biol Chem\n 1996 271 7494, describe monomeric Fcε chain variants that can be used in the polypeptide chains of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, such monomeric Fc chain variants are preferably such that they are still capable of binding to the complement or the relevant Fc receptor(s) (depending on the Fc portion from which they are derived), and/or such that they still have some or all of the effector functions of the Fc portion from which they are derived (or at a reduced level still suitable for the intended use). Alternatively, in such a polypeptide chain of the invention, the monomeric Fc chain may be used to confer increased half-life upon the polypeptide chain, in which case the monomeric Fc chain may also have no or essentially no effector functions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBivalent/multivalent, bispecific/multispecific or biparatopic/multiparatopic polypeptides of the invention may also be linked to Fc portions, in order to provide polypeptide constructs of the type that is described in the non-prepublished U.S. provisional application entitled “immunoglobulin constructs” filed on Dec. 4, 2007 (also invoked as priority for this application) and the corresponding PCT application based thereon, which has the same filing date as the present application.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe further amino acid sequences may also form a signal sequence or leader sequence that directs secretion of the Nanobody or the polypeptide of the invention from a host cell upon synthesis (for example to provide a pre-, pro- or prepro-form of the polypeptide of the invention, depending on the host cell used to express the polypeptide of the invention).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe further amino acid sequence may also form a sequence or signal that allows the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to be directed towards and/or to penetrate or enter into specific organs, tissues, cells, or parts or compartments of cells, and/or that allows the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to penetrate or cross a biological barrier such as a cell membrane, a cell layer such as a layer of epithelial cells, a tumor including solid tumors, or the blood-brain-barrier. Suitable examples of such amino acid sequences will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include, but are not limited to, the “Peptrans” vectors mentioned above, the sequences described by Cardinale et al. and the amino acid sequences and antibody fragments known per se that can be used to express or produce the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention as so-called “intrabodies”, for example as described in WO 94/02610, WO 95/22618, U.S. Pat. No. 7,004,940, WO 03/014960, WO 99/07414; WO 05/01690; \nEP\n 1 512 696; and in Cattaneo, A. & Biocca, S. (1997) Intracellular Antibodies: Development and Applications. Landes and Springer-Verlag; and in Kontermann, Methods 34, (2004), 163-170, and the further references described therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some applications, in particular for those applications in which it is intended to kill a cell that expresses the target against which the Nanobodies of the invention are directed (e.g. in the treatment of cancer), or to reduce or slow the growth and/or proliferation of such a cell, the Nanobodies of the invention may also be linked to a (cyto)toxic protein or polypeptide. Examples of such toxic proteins and polypeptides which can be linked to a Nanobody of the invention to provide—for example—a cytotoxic polypeptide of the invention will be clear to the skilled person and can for example be found in the prior art cited above and/or in the further description herein. One example is the so-called ADEPT™ technology described in WO 03/055527.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one preferred, but non-limiting aspect, said one or more further amino acid sequences comprise at least one further Nanobody, so as to provide a polypeptide of the invention that comprises at least two, such as three, four, five or more Nanobodies, in which said Nanobodies may optionally be linked via one or more linker sequences (as defined herein). Polypeptides of the invention that comprise two or more Nanobodies, of which at least one is a Nanobody of the invention, will also be referred to herein as “multivalent” polypeptides of the invention, and the Nanobodies present in such polypeptides will also be referred to herein as being in a “multivalent format”. For example a “bivalent” polypeptide of the invention comprises two Nanobodies, optionally linked via a linker sequence, whereas a “trivalent” polypeptide of the invention comprises three Nanobodies, optionally linked via two linker sequences; etc.; in which at least one of the Nanobodies present in the polypeptide, and up to all of the Nanobodies present in the polypeptide, is/are a Nanobody of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a multivalent polypeptide of the invention, the two or more Nanobodies may be the same or different, and may be directed against the same antigen or antigenic determinant (for example against the same part(s) or epitope(s) or against different parts or epitopes) or may alternatively be directed against different antigens or antigenic determinants; or any suitable combination thereof. For example, a bivalent polypeptide of the invention may comprise (a) two identical Nanobodies; (b) a first Nanobody directed against a first antigenic determinant of a protein or antigen and a second Nanobody directed against the same antigenic determinant of said protein or antigen which is different from the first Nanobody; (c) a first Nanobody directed against a first antigenic determinant of a protein or antigen and a second Nanobody directed against another antigenic determinant of said protein or antigen; or (d) a first Nanobody directed against a first protein or antigen and a second Nanobody directed against a second protein or antigen (i.e. different from said first antigen). Similarly, a trivalent polypeptide of the invention may, for example and without being limited thereto. comprise (a) three identical Nanobodies; (b) two identical Nanobody against a first antigenic determinant of an antigen and a third Nanobody directed against a different antigenic determinant of the same antigen; (c) two identical Nanobody against a first antigenic determinant of an antigen and a third Nanobody directed against a second antigen different from said first antigen; (d) a first Nanobody directed against a first antigenic determinant of a first antigen, a second Nanobody directed against a second antigenic determinant of said first antigen and a third Nanobody directed against a second antigen different from said first antigen; or (e) a first Nanobody directed against a first antigen, a second Nanobody directed against a second antigen different from said first antigen, and a third Nanobody directed against a third antigen different from said first and second antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides of the invention that contain at least two Nanobodies, in which at least one Nanobody is directed against a first antigen (i.e. against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors,) and at least one Nanobody is directed against a second antigen (i.e. different from heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors,), will also be referred to as “multispecific” polypeptides of the invention, and the Nanobodies present in such polypeptides will also be referred to herein as being in a “multispecific format”. Thus, for example, a “bispecific” polypeptide of the invention is a polypeptide that comprises at least one Nanobody directed against a first antigen (i.e. heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors,) and at least one further Nanobody directed against a second antigen (i.e. different from heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors,), whereas a “trispecific” polypeptide of the invention is a polypeptide that comprises at least one Nanobody directed against a first antigen (i.e. heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors,), at least one further Nanobody directed against a second antigen (i.e. different from heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors,) and at least one further Nanobody directed against a third antigen (i.e. different from both heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, and the second antigen); etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in its simplest form, a bispecific polypeptide of the invention is a bivalent polypeptide of the invention (as defined herein), comprising a first Nanobody directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, and a second Nanobody directed against a second antigen, in which said first and second Nanobody may optionally be linked via a linker sequence (as defined herein); whereas a trispecific polypeptide of the invention in its simplest form is a trivalent polypeptide of the invention (as defined herein), comprising a first Nanobody directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, a second Nanobody directed against a second antigen and a third Nanobody directed against a third antigen, in which said first, second and third Nanobody may optionally be linked via one or more, and in particular one and more, in particular two, linker sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, as will be clear from the description hereinabove, the invention is not limited thereto, in the sense that a multispecific polypeptide of the invention may comprise at least one Nanobody against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, and any number of Nanobodies directed against one or more antigens different from heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, although it is encompassed within the scope of the invention that the specific order or arrangement of the various Nanobodies in the polypeptides of the invention may have some influence on the properties of the final polypeptide of the invention (including but not limited to the affinity, specificity or avidity for heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, or against the one or more other antigens), said order or arrangement is usually not critical and may be suitably chosen by the skilled person, optionally after some limited routine experiments based on the disclosure herein. Thus, when reference is made to a specific multivalent or multispecific polypeptide of the invention, it should be noted that this encompasses any order or arrangements of the relevant Nanobodies, unless explicitly indicated otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, it is also within the scope of the invention that the polypeptides of the invention contain two or more Nanobodies and one or more further amino acid sequences (as mentioned herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor multivalent and multispecific polypeptides containing one or more V\nHH \ndomains and their preparation, reference is also made to Conrath et al., J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 276, 10. 7346-7350, 2001; Muyldermans, Reviews in Molecular Biotechnology 74 (2001), 277-302; as well as to for example WO 96/34103 and WO 99/23221. Some other examples of some specific multispecific and/or multivalent polypeptide of the invention can be found in the applications by Ablynx N. V. referred to herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne preferred, but non-limiting example of a multispecific polypeptide of the invention comprises at least one Nanobody of the invention and at least one Nanobody that provides for an increased half-life. Such Nanobodies may for example be Nanobodies that are directed against a serum protein, and in particular a human serum protein, such as human serum albumin, thyroxine-binding protein, (human) transferrin, fibrinogen, an immunoglobulin such as IgG, IgE or IgM, or against one of the serum proteins listed in WO 04/003019. Of these, Nanobodies that can bind to serum albumin (and in particular human serum albumin) or to IgG (and in particular human IgG, see for example Nanobody VH-1 described in the review by Muyldermans, supra) are particularly preferred (although for example, for experiments in mice or primates, Nanobodies against or cross-reactive with mouse serum albumin (MSA) or serum albumin from said primate, respectively, can be used. However, for pharmaceutical use, Nanobodies against human serum albumin or human IgG will usually be preferred). Nanobodies that provide for increased half-life and that can be used in the polypeptides of the invention include the Nanobodies directed against serum albumin that are described in WO 04/041865, in WO 06/122787 and in the further patent applications by Ablynx N. V., such as those mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the some preferred Nanobodies that provide for increased half-life for use in the present invention include Nanobodies that can bind to amino acid residues on (human) serum albumin that are not involved in binding of serum albumin to FcRn (see for example WO 06/0122787); Nanobodies that are capable of binding to amino acid residues on serum albumin that do not form part of domain III of serum albumin (see for example WO 06/0122787); Nanobodies that have or can provide an increased half-life (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/843,349 by Ablynx N.V mentioned herein; see also PCT/EP2007/059475); Nanobodies against human serum albumin that are cross-reactive with serum albumin from at least one species of mammal, and in particular with at least one species of primate (such as, without limitation, monkeys from the genus \nMacaca \n(such as, and in particular, cynomologus monkeys (\nMacaca fascicularis\n) and/or rhesus monkeys (\nMacaca mulatta\n)) and baboon (\nPapio ursinus\n)) (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/843,349 by Ablynx N.V see also PCT/EP2007/059475); Nanobodies that can bind to serum albumin in a pH independent manner (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/850,774 by Ablynx N. V. mentioned herein, see also WO 08/043821) and/or Nanobodies that are conditional binders (see for example the U.S. provisional application 60/850,775 by Ablynx N. V.; see also PCT/EP2007/060850).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome particularly preferred Nanobodies that provide for increased half-life and that can be used in the polypeptides of the invention include the Nanobodies ALB-1 to ALB-10 disclosed in WO 06/122787 (see Tables II and III) of which ALB-8 (SEQ ID NO: 62 in WO 06/122787) is particularly preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a specific, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, the polypeptides of the invention contain, besides the one or more Nanobodies of the invention, at least one Nanobody against human serum albumin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, any polypeptides of the invention with increased half-life that contain one or more Nanobodies of the invention, and any derivatives of Nanobodies of the invention or of such polypeptides that have an increased half-life, preferably have a half-life that is at least 1.5 times, preferably at least 2 times, such as at least 5 times, for example at least 10 times or more than 20 times, greater than the half-life of the corresponding Nanobody of the invention per se. For example, such a derivative or polypeptides with increased half-life may have a half-life that is increased with more than 1 hours, preferably more than 2 hours, more preferably more than 6 hours, such as more than 12 hours, or even more than 24, 48 or 72 hours, compared to the corresponding Nanobody of the invention per se.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, such derivatives or polypeptides may exhibit a serum half-life in human of at least about 12 hours, preferably at least 24 hours, more preferably at least 48 hours, even more preferably at least 72 hours or more. For example, such derivatives or polypeptides may have a half-life of at least 5 days (such as about 5 to 10 days), preferably at least 9 days (such as about 9 to 14 days), more preferably at least about 10 days (such as about 10 to 15 days), or at least about 11 days (such as about 11 to 16 days), more preferably at least about 12 days (such as about 12 to 18 days or more), or more than 14 days (such as about 14 to 19 days).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention the polypeptides are capable of binding to one or more molecules which can increase the half-life of the polypeptide in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptides of the invention are stabilised in vivo and their half-life increased by binding to molecules which resist degradation and/or clearance or sequestration. Typically, such molecules are naturally occurring proteins which themselves have a long half-life in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother preferred, but non-limiting example of a multispecific polypeptide of the invention comprises at least one Nanobody of the invention and at least one Nanobody that directs the polypeptide of the invention towards, and/or that allows the polypeptide of the invention to penetrate or to enter into specific organs, tissues, cells, or parts or compartments of cells, and/or that allows the Nanobody to penetrate or cross a biological barrier such as a cell membrane, a cell layer such as a layer of epithelial cells, a tumor including solid tumors, or the blood-brain-barrier. Examples of such Nanobodies include Nanobodies that are directed towards specific cell-surface proteins, markers or epitopes of the desired organ, tissue or cell (for example cell-surface markers associated with tumor cells), and the single-domain brain targeting antibody fragments described in WO 02/057445 and WO 06/040153, of which FC44 (SEQ ID NO: 189 of WO 06/040153) and FC5 (SEQ ID NO: 190 of WO 06/040154) are preferred examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the polypeptides of the invention, the one or more Nanobodies and the one or more polypeptides may be directly linked to each other (as for example described in WO 99/23221) and/or may be linked to each other via one or more suitable spacers or linkers, or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable spacers or linkers for use in multivalent and multispecific polypeptides will be clear to the skilled person, and may generally be any linker or spacer used in the art to link amino acid sequences. Preferably, said linker or spacer is suitable for use in constructing proteins or polypeptides that are intended for pharmaceutical use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome particularly preferred spacers include the spacers and linkers that are used in the art to link antibody fragments or antibody domains. These include the linkers mentioned in the general background art cited above, as well as for example linkers that are used in the art to construct diabodies or ScFv fragments (in this respect, however, its should be noted that, whereas in diabodies and in ScFv fragments, the linker sequence used should have a length, a degree of flexibility and other properties that allow the pertinent V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains to come together to form the complete antigen-binding site, there is no particular limitation on the length or the flexibility of the linker used in the polypeptide of the invention, since each Nanobody by itself forms a complete antigen-binding site).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a linker may be a suitable amino acid sequence, and in particular amino acid sequences of between 1 and 50, preferably between 1 and 30, such as between 1 and 10 amino acid residues. Some preferred examples of such amino acid sequences include gly-ser linkers, for example of the type (gly\nx\nser\ny\n)\nz\n, such as (for example (gly\n4\nser)\n3 \nor (gly\n3\nser\n2\n)\n3\n, as described in WO 99/42077 and the GS30, GS15, GS9 and GS7 linkers described in the applications by Ablynx mentioned herein (see for example WO 06/040153 and WO 06/122825), as well as hinge-like regions, such as the hinge regions of naturally occurring heavy chain antibodies or similar sequences (such as described in WO 94/04678).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome other particularly preferred linkers are poly-alanine (such as AAA), as well as the linkers GS30 (SEQ ID NO: 85 in WO 06/122825) and GS9 (SEQ ID NO: 84 in WO 06/122825).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable linkers generally comprise organic compounds or polymers, in particular those suitable for use in proteins for pharmaceutical use. For instance, poly(ethyleneglycol) moieties have been used to link antibody domains, see for example WO 04/081026.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is encompassed within the scope of the invention that the length, the degree of flexibility and/or other properties of the linker(s) used (although not critical, as it usually is for linkers used in ScFv fragments) may have some influence on the properties of the final polypeptide of the invention, including but not limited to the affinity, specificity or avidity for heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, or for one or more of the other antigens. Based on the disclosure herein, the skilled person will be able to determine the optimal linker(s) for use in a specific polypeptide of the invention, optionally after some limited routine experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in multivalent polypeptides of the invention that comprise Nanobodies directed against a multimeric antigen (such as a multimeric receptor or other protein), the length and flexibility of the linker are preferably such that it allows each Nanobody of the invention present in the polypeptide to bind to the antigenic determinant on each of the subunits of the multimer. Similarly, in a multispecific polypeptide of the invention that comprises Nanobodies directed against two or more different antigenic determinants on the same antigen (for example against different epitopes of an antigen and/or against different subunits of a multimeric receptor, channel or protein), the length and flexibility of the linker are preferably such that it allows each Nanobody to bind to its intended antigenic determinant. Again, based on the disclosure herein, the skilled person will be able to determine the optimal linker(s) for use in a specific polypeptide of the invention, optionally after some limited routine experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also within the scope of the invention that the linker(s) used confer one or more other favourable properties or functionality to the polypeptides of the invention, and/or provide one or more sites for the formation of derivatives and/or for the attachment of functional groups (e.g. as described herein for the derivatives of the Nanobodies of the invention). For example, linkers containing one or more charged amino acid residues (see Table A-3 above) can provide improved hydrophilic properties, whereas linkers that form or contain small epitopes or tags can be used for the purposes of detection, identification and/or purification. Again, based on the disclosure herein, the skilled person will be able to determine the optimal linkers for use in a specific polypeptide of the invention, optionally after some limited routine experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, when two or more linkers are used in the polypeptides of the invention, these linkers may be the same or different. Again, based on the disclosure herein, the skilled person will be able to determine the optimal linkers for use in a specific polypeptide of the invention, optionally after some limited routine experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsually, for easy of expression and production, a polypeptide of the invention will be a linear polypeptide. However, the invention in its broadest sense is not limited thererto. For example, when a polypeptide of the invention comprises three of more Nanobodies, it is possible to link them by use of a linker with three or more “arms”, which each “arm” being linked to a Nanobody, so as to provide a “star-shaped” construct. It is also possible, although usually less preferred, to use circular constructs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also comprises derivatives of the polypeptides of the invention, which may be essentially analogous to the derivatives of the Nanobodies of the invention, i.e. as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also comprises proteins or polypeptides that “essentially consist” of a polypeptide of the invention (in which the wording “essentially consist of” has essentially the same meaning as indicated hereinabove).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention, the polypeptide of the invention is in essentially isolated from, as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences, Nanobodies, polypeptides and nucleic acids of the invention can be prepared in a manner known per se, as will be clear to the skilled person from the further description herein. For example, the Nanobodies and polypetides of the invention can be prepared in any manner known per se for the preparation of antibodies and in particular for the preparation of antibody fragments (including but not limited to (single) domain antibodies and ScFv fragments). Some preferred, but non-limiting methods for preparing the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies, polypeptides and nucleic acids include the methods and techniques described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be clear to the skilled person, one particularly useful method for preparing an amino acid sequence, Nanobody and/or a polypeptide of the invention generally comprises the steps of:\n\n \n \n \ni) the expression, in a suitable host cell or host organism (also referred to herein as a “host of the invention”) or in another suitable expression system of a nucleic acid that encodes said amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention (also referred to herein as a “nucleic acid of the invention”), optionally followed by:\n \nii) isolating and/or purifying the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention thus obtained.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn particular, such a method may comprise the steps of\n\n \n \n \ni) cultivating and/or maintaining a host of the invention under conditions that are such that said host of the invention expresses and/or produces at least one amino acid sequence, Nanobody and/or polypeptide of the invention; optionally followed by:\n \nii) isolating and/or purifying the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention thus obtained.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nA nucleic acid of the invention can be in the form of single or double stranded DNA or RNA, and is preferably in the form of double stranded DNA. For example, the nucleotide sequences of the invention may be genomic DNA, cDNA or synthetic DNA (such as DNA with a codon usage that has been specifically adapted for expression in the intended host cell or host organism).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the invention, the nucleic acid of the invention is in essentially isolated from, as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid of the invention may also be in the form of, be present in and/or be part of a vector, such as for example a plasmid, cosmid or YAC, which again may be in essentially isolated form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acids of the invention can be prepared or obtained in a manner known per se, based on the information on the amino acid sequences for the polypeptides of the invention given herein, and/or can be isolated from a suitable natural source. To provide analogs, nucleotide sequences encoding naturally occurring V\nHH \ndomains can for example be subjected to site-directed mutagenesis, so at to provide a nucleic acid of the invention encoding said analog. Also, as will be clear to the skilled person, to prepare a nucleic acid of the invention, also several nucleotide sequences, such as at least one nucleotide sequence encoding a Nanobody and for example nucleic acids encoding one or more linkers can be linked together in a suitable manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques for generating the nucleic acids of the invention will be clear to the skilled person and may for instance include, but are not limited to, automated DNA synthesis; site-directed mutagenesis; combining two or more naturally occurring and/or synthetic sequences (or two or more parts thereof), introduction of mutations that lead to the expression of a truncated expression product; introduction of one or more restriction sites (e.g. to create cassettes and/or regions that may easily be digested and/or ligated using suitable restriction enzymes), and/or the introduction of mutations by means of a PCR reaction using one or more “mismatched” primers, using for example a sequence of a naturally occurring form of heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors as a template. These and other techniques will be clear to the skilled person, and reference is again made to the standard handbooks, such as Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al., mentioned above, as well as the Examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid of the invention may also be in the form of, be present in and/or be part of a genetic construct, as will be clear to the person skilled in the art. Such genetic constructs generally comprise at least one nucleic acid of the invention that is optionally linked to one or more elements of genetic constructs known per se, such as for example one or more suitable regulatory elements (such as a suitable promoter(s), enhancer(s), terminator(s), etc.) and the further elements of genetic constructs referred to herein. Such genetic constructs comprising at least one nucleic acid of the invention will also be referred to herein as “genetic constructs of the invention”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe genetic constructs of the invention may be DNA or RNA, and are preferably double-stranded DNA. The genetic constructs of the invention may also be in a form suitable for transformation of the intended host cell or host organism, in a form suitable for integration into the genomic DNA of the intended host cell or in a form suitable for independent replication, maintenance and/or inheritance in the intended host organism. For instance, the genetic constructs of the invention may be in the form of a vector, such as for example a plasmid, cosmid, YAC, a viral vector or transposon. In particular, the vector may be an expression vector, i.e. a vector that can provide for expression in vitro and/or in vivo (e.g. in a suitable host cell, host organism and/or expression system).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred but non-limiting aspect, a genetic construct of the invention comprises\n\n \n \n \ni) at least one nucleic acid of the invention; operably connected to\n \nii) one or more regulatory elements, such as a promoter and optionally a suitable terminator;\n    \n \nand optionally also\n \n\n\n \niii) one or more further elements of genetic constructs known per se;\n \n\n\n \n \n \nin which the terms “regulatory element”, “promoter”, “terminator” and “operably connected” have their usual meaning in the art (as further described herein); and in which said “further elements” present in the genetic constructs may for example be 3′- or 5′-UTR sequences, leader sequences, selection markers, expression markers/reporter genes, and/or elements that may facilitate or increase (the efficiency of) transformation or integration. These and other suitable elements for such genetic constructs will be clear to the skilled person, and may for instance depend upon the type of construct used, the intended host cell or host organism; the manner in which the nucleotide sequences of the invention of interest are to be expressed (e.g. via constitutive, transient or inducible expression); and/or the transformation technique to be used. For example, regulatory requences, promoters and terminators known per se for the expression and production of antibodies and antibody fragments (including but not limited to (single) domain antibodies and ScFv fragments) may be used in an essentially analogous manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, in the genetic constructs of the invention, said at least one nucleic acid of the invention and said regulatory elements, and optionally said one or more further elements, are “operably linked” to each other, by which is generally meant that they are in a functional relationship with each other. For instance, a promoter is considered “operably linked” to a coding sequence if said promoter is able to initiate or otherwise control/regulate the transcription and/or the expression of a coding sequence (in which said coding sequence should be understood as being “under the control of” said promotor). Generally, when two nucleotide sequences are operably linked, they will be in the same orientation and usually also in the same reading frame. They will usually also be essentially contiguous, although this may also not be required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the regulatory and further elements of the genetic constructs of the invention are such that they are capable of providing their intended biological function in the intended host cell or host organism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor instance, a promoter, enhancer or terminator should be “operable” in the intended host cell or host organism, by which is meant that (for example) said promoter should be capable of initiating or otherwise controlling/regulating the transcription and/or the expression of a nucleotide sequence—e.g. a coding sequence—to which it is operably linked (as defined herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome particularly preferred promoters include, but are not limited to, promoters known per se for the expression in the host cells mentioned herein; and in particular promoters for the expression in the bacterial cells, such as those mentioned herein and/or those used in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA selection marker should be such that it allows—i.e. under appropriate selection conditions—host cells and/or host organisms that have been (successfully) transformed with the nucleotide sequence of the invention to be distinguished from host cells/organisms that have not been (successfully) transformed. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of such markers are genes that provide resistance against antibiotics (such as kanamycin or ampicillin), genes that provide for temperature resistance, or genes that allow the host cell or host organism to be maintained in the absence of certain factors, compounds and/or (food) components in the medium that are essential for survival of the non-transformed cells or organisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA leader sequence should be such that—in the intended host cell or host organism—it allows for the desired post-translational modifications and/or such that it directs the transcribed mRNA to a desired part or organelle of a cell. A leader sequence may also allow for secretion of the expression product from said cell. As such, the leader sequence may be any pro-, pre-, or prepro-sequence operable in the host cell or host organism. Leader sequences may not be required for expression in a bacterial cell. For example, leader sequences known per se for the expression and production of antibodies and antibody fragments (including but not limited to single domain antibodies and ScFv fragments) may be used in an essentially analogous manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn expression marker or reporter gene should be such that—in the host cell or host organism—it allows for detection of the expression of (a gene or nucleotide sequence present on) the genetic construct. An expression marker may optionally also allow for the localisation of the expressed product, e.g. in a specific part or organelle of a cell and/or in (a) specific cell(s), tissue(s), organ(s) or part(s) of a multicellular organism. Such reporter genes may also be expressed as a protein fusion with the amino acid sequence of the invention. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples include fluorescent proteins such as GFP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome preferred, but non-limiting examples of suitable promoters, terminator and further elements include those that can be used for the expression in the host cells mentioned herein; and in particular those that are suitable for expression in bacterial cells, such as those mentioned herein and/or those used in the Examples below. For some (further) non-limiting examples of the promoters, selection markers, leader sequences, expression markers and further elements that may be present/used in the genetic constructs of the invention—such as terminators, transcriptional and/or translational enhancers and/or integration factors—reference is made to the general handbooks such as Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al. mentioned above, as well as to the examples that are given in WO 95/07463, WO 96/23810, WO 95/07463, WO 95/21191, WO 97/11094, WO 97/42320, WO 98/06737, WO 98/21355, U.S. Pat. No. 7,207,410, U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,492 and \nEP\n 1 085 089. Other examples will be clear to the skilled person. Reference is also made to the general background art cited above and the further references cited herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe genetic constructs of the invention may generally be provided by suitably linking the nucleotide sequence(s) of the invention to the one or more further elements described above, for example using the techniques described in the general handbooks such as Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al., mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOften, the genetic constructs of the invention will be obtained by inserting a nucleotide sequence of the invention in a suitable (expression) vector known per se. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of suitable expression vectors are those used in the Examples below, as well as those mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acids of the invention and/or the genetic constructs of the invention may be used to transform a host cell or host organism, i.e. for expression and/or production of the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention. Suitable hosts or host cells will be clear to the skilled person, and may for example be any suitable fungal, prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell or cell line or any suitable fungal, prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism, for example:\n\n \n \n \n \n \na bacterial strain, including but not limited to gram-negative strains such as strains of \nEscherichia coli; \nof \nProteus, \nfor example of \nProteus mirabilis; \nof \nPseudomonas, \nfor example of \nPseudomonas fluorescens; \nand gram-positive strains such as strains of \nBacillus, \nfor example of \nBacillus subtilis \nor of \nBacillus brevis; \nof \nStreptomyces, \nfor example of \nStreptomyces lividans; \nof \nStaphylococcus, \nfor example of \nStaphylococcus carnosus; \nand of \nLactococcus, \nfor example of \nLactococcus lactis; \n \n \na fungal cell, including but not limited to cells from species of \nTrichoderma, \nfor example from \nTrichoderma reesei; \nof \nNeurospora, \nfor example from \nNeurospora crassa; \nof \nSordaria, \nfor example from \nSordaria macrospora; \nof \nAspergillus, \nfor example from \nAspergillus niger \nor from \nAspergillus sojae; \nor from other filamentous fungi;\n \na yeast cell, including but not limited to cells from species of \nSaccharomyces, \nfor example of \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae; \nof \nSchizosaccharomyces, \nfor example of \nSchizosaccharomyces pombe; \nof \nPichia, \nfor example of \nPichia pastoris \nor of \nPichia methanolica; \nof \nHansenula, \nfor example of \nHansenula polymorpha; \nof \nKluyveromyces, \nfor example of \nKluyveromyces lactis; \nof \nArxula, \nfor example of \nArxula adeninivorans; \nof \nYarrowia, \nfor example of \nYarrowia lipolytica; \n \n \nan amphibian cell or cell line, such as \nXenopus oocytes; \n \n \nan insect-derived cell or cell line, such as cells/cell lines derived from lepidoptera, including but not limited to \nSpodoptera \nSF9 and Sf21 cells or cells/cell lines derived from \nDrosophila, \nsuch as Schneider and Kc cells;\n \na plant or plant cell, for example in tobacco plants; and/or\n \na mammalian cell or cell line, for example a cell or cell line derived from a human, a cell or a cell line from mammals including but not limited to CHO-cells, BHK-cells (for example BHK-21 cells) and human cells or cell lines such as HeLa, COS (for example COS-7) and PER.C6 cells;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nas well as all other hosts or host cells known per se for the expression and production of antibodies and antibody fragments (including but not limited to (single) domain antibodies and ScFv fragments), which will be clear to the skilled person. Reference is also made to the general background art cited hereinabove, as well as to for example WO 94/29457; WO 96/34103; WO 99/42077; Frenken et al., (1998), supra; Riechmann and Muyldermans, (1999), supra; van der Linden, (2000), supra; Thomassen et al., (2002), supra; Joosten et al., (2003), supra; Joosten et al., (2005), supra; and the further references cited herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can also be introduced and expressed in one or more cells, tissues or organs of a multicellular organism, for example for prophylactic and/or therapeutic purposes (e.g. as a gene therapy). For this purpose, the nucleotide sequences of the invention may be introduced into the cells or tissues in any suitable way, for example as such (e.g. using liposomes) or after they have been inserted into a suitable gene therapy vector (for example derived from retroviruses such as adenovirus, or parvoviruses such as adeno-associated virus). As will also be clear to the skilled person, such gene therapy may be performed in vivo and/or in situ in the body of a patient by administering a nucleic acid of the invention or a suitable gene therapy vector encoding the same to the patient or to specific cells or a specific tissue or organ of the patient; or suitable cells (often taken from the body of the patient to be treated, such as explanted lymphocytes, bone marrow aspirates or tissue biopsies) may be treated in vitro with a nucleotide sequence of the invention and then be suitably (re-)introduced into the body of the patient. All this can be performed using gene therapy vectors, techniques and delivery systems which are well known to the skilled person, and for example described in Culver, K. W., “Gene Therapy”, 1994, p. xii, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., Publishers, New York, N.Y.); Giordano, Nature F Medicine 2 (1996), 534-539; Schaper, Circ.

No. 5,5895466; or Schaper, Current Opinion in Biotechnology 7 (1996), 635-640. For example, in situ expression of ScFv fragments (Afanasieva et al., Gene Ther., 10, 1850-1859 (2003)) and of diabodies (Blanco et al., J. Immunol, 171, 1070-1077 (2003)) has been described in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor expression of the Nanobodies in a cell, they may also be expressed as so-called “intrabodies”, as for example described in WO 94/02610, WO 95/22618 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,004,940; WO 03/014960; in Cattaneo, A. & Biocca, S. (1997) Intracellular Antibodies: Development and Applications. Landes and Springer-Verlag; and in Kontermann, Methods 34, (2004), 163-170.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can for example also be produced in the milk of transgenic mammals, for example in the milk of rabbits, cows, goats or sheep (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 6,741,957, U.S. Pat. No. 6,304,489 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,849,992 for general techniques for introducing transgenes into mammals), in plants or parts of plants including but not limited to their leaves, flowers, fruits, seed, roots or turbers (for example in tobacco, maize, soybean or alfalfa) or in for example pupae of the silkworm \nBombix mori. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can also be expressed and/or produced in cell-free expression systems, and suitable examples of such systems will be clear to the skilled person. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples include expression in the wheat germ system; in rabbit reticulocyte lysates; or in the \nE. coli \nZubay system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, one of the advantages of the use of Nanobodies is that the polypeptides based thereon can be prepared through expression in a suitable bacterial system, and suitable bacterial expression systems, vectors, host cells, regulatory elements, etc., will be clear to the skilled person, for example from the references cited above. It should however be noted that the invention in its broadest sense is not limited to expression in bacterial systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, in the invention, an (in vivo or in vitro) expression system, such as a bacterial expression system, is used that provides the polypeptides of the invention in a form that is suitable for pharmaceutical use, and such expression systems will again be clear to the skilled person. As also will be clear to the skilled person, polypeptides of the invention suitable for pharmaceutical use can be prepared using techniques for peptide synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor production on industrial scale, preferred heterologous hosts for the (industrial) production of Nanobodies or Nanobody-containing protein therapeutics include strains of \nE. coli, Pichia pastoris, S. cerevisiae \nthat are suitable for large scale expression/production/fermentation, and in particular for large scale pharmaceutical (i.e. GMP grade) expression/production/fermentation. Suitable examples of such strains will be clear to the skilled person. Such strains and production/expression systems are also made available by companies such as Biovitrum (Uppsala, Sweden).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, mammalian cell lines, in particular Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, can be used for large scale expression/production/fermentation, and in particular for large scale pharmaceutical expression/production/fermentation. Again, such expression/production systems are also made available by some of the companies mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe choice of the specific expression system would depend in part on the requirement for certain post-translational modifications, more specifically glycosylation. The production of a Nanobody-containing recombinant protein for which glycosylation is desired or required would necessitate the use of mammalian expression hosts that have the ability to glycosylate the expressed protein. In this respect, it will be clear to the skilled person that the glycosylation pattern obtained (i.e. the kind, number and position of residues attached) will depend on the cell or cell line that is used for the expression. Preferably, either a human cell or cell line is used (i.e. leading to a protein that essentially has a human glycosylation pattern) or another mammalian cell line is used that can provide a glycosylation pattern that is essentially and/or functionally the same as human glycosylation or at least mimics human glycosylation. Generally, prokaryotic hosts such as \nE. coli \ndo not have the ability to glycosylate proteins, and the use of lower eukaryotes such as yeast usually leads to a glycosylation pattern that differs from human glycosylation. Nevertheless, it should be understood that all the foregoing host cells and expression systems can be used in the invention, depending on the desired amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide to be obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, according to one non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is glycosylated. According to another non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is non-glycosylated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is produced in a bacterial cell, in particular a bacterial cell suitable for large scale pharmaceutical production, such as cells of the strains mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is produced in a yeast cell, in particular a yeast cell suitable for large scale pharmaceutical production, such as cells of the species mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to yet another preferred, but non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is produced in a mammalian cell, in particular in a human cell or in a cell of a human cell line, and more in particular in a human cell or in a cell of a human cell line that is suitable for large scale pharmaceutical production, such as the cell lines mentioned hereinabove.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen expression in a host cell is used to produce the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and the polypeptides of the invention, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can be produced either intracellullarly (e.g. in the cytosol, in the periplasma or in inclusion bodies) and then isolated from the host cells and optionally further purified; or can be produced extracellularly (e.g. in the medium in which the host cells are cultured) and then isolated from the culture medium and optionally further purified. When eukaryotic host cells are used, extracellular production is usually preferred since this considerably facilitates the further isolation and downstream processing of the Nanobodies and proteins obtained. Bacterial cells such as the strains of \nE. coli \nmentioned above normally do not secrete proteins extracellularly, except for a few classes of proteins such as toxins and hemolysin, and secretory production in \nE. coli \nrefers to the translocation of proteins across the inner membrane to the periplasmic space. Periplasmic production provides several advantages over cytosolic production. For example, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the secreted product can be identical to the natural gene product after cleavage of the secretion signal sequence by a specific signal peptidase. Also, there appears to be much less protease activity in the periplasm than in the cytoplasm. In addition, protein purification is simpler due to fewer contaminating proteins in the periplasm. Another advantage is that correct disulfide bonds may form because the periplasm provides a more oxidative environment than the cytoplasm. Proteins overexpressed in \nE. coli \nare often found in insoluble aggregates, so-called inclusion bodies. These inclusion bodies may be located in the cytosol or in the periplasm; the recovery of biologically active proteins from these inclusion-bodies requires a denaturation/refolding process. Many recombinant proteins, including therapeutic proteins, are recovered from inclusion bodies. Alternatively, as will be clear to the skilled person, recombinant strains of bacteria that have been genetically modified so as to secrete a desired protein, and in particular an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or a polypeptide of the invention, can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, according to one non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide that has been produced intracellularly and that has been isolated from the host cell, and in particular from a bacterial cell or from an inclusion body in a bacterial cell. According to another non-limiting aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide that has been produced extracellularly, and that has been isolated from the medium in which the host cell is cultivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome preferred, but non-limiting promoters for use with these host cells include,\n\n \n \n \n \n \nfor expression in \nE. coli: \nlac promoter (and derivatives thereof such as the lacUV5 promoter); arabinose promoter; left- (PL) and rightward (PR) promoter of phage lambda; promoter of the trp operon; hybrid lac/trp promoters (tac and trc); T7-promoter (more specifically that of T7-phage gene 10) and other T-phage promoters; promoter of the Tn10 tetracycline resistance gene; engineered variants of the above promoters that include one or more copies of an extraneous regulatory operator sequence;\n \nfor expression in \nS. cerevisiae: \nconstitutive: ADH1 (alcohol dehydrogenase 1), ENO (enolase), CYC1 (cytochrome c iso-1), GAPDH (glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), PGK1 (phosphoglycerate kinase), PYK1 (pyruvate kinase); regulated: GAL1,10,7 (galactose metabolic enzymes), ADH2 (alcohol dehydrogenase 2), PHO5 (acid phosphatase), CUP1 (copper metallothionein); heterologous: CaMV (cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter);\n \nfor expression in \nPichia pastoris: \nthe AOX1 promoter (alcohol oxidase I);\n \nfor expression in mammalian cells: human cytomegalovirus (heterodimeric cytokinesMV) immediate early enhancer/promoter; human cytomegalovirus (heterodimeric cytokinesMV) immediate early promoter variant that contains two tetracycline operator sequences such that the promoter can be regulated by the Tet repressor; Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter; Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat (RSV LTR) enhancer/promoter; elongation factor 1α (hEF-1α) promoter from human, chimpanzee, mouse or rat; the SV40 early promoter; HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter; β-actin promoter;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nSome preferred, but non-limiting vectors for use with these host cells include:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nvectors for expression in mammalian cells: pMAMneo (Clontech), pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pMC1neo (Stratagene), pSG5 (Stratagene), EBO-pSV2-neo (ATCC 37593), pBPV-1 (8-2) (ATCC 37110), pdBPV-MMTneo (342-12) (ATCC 37224), pRSVgpt (ATCC37199), pRSVneo (ATCC37198), pSV2-dhfr (ATCC 37146), pUCTag (ATCC 37460) and 1ZD35 (ATCC 37565), as well as viral-based expression systems, such as those based on adenovirus;\n \nvectors for expression in bacterial cells: pET vectors (Novagen) and pQE vectors (Qiagen);\n \nvectors for expression in yeast or other fungal cells: pYES2 (Invitrogen) and \nPichia \nexpression vectors (Invitrogen);\n \nvectors for expression in insect cells: pBlueBacil (Invitrogen) and other baculovirus vectors\n \nvectors for expression in plants or plant cells: for example vectors based on cauliflower mosaic virus or tobacco mosaic virus, suitable strains of \nAgrobacterium, \nor Ti-plasmid based vectors.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nSome preferred, but non-limiting secretory sequences for use with these host cells include:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nfor use in bacterial cells such as \nE. coli: \nPelB, Bla, OmpA, OmpC, OmpF, OmpT, StII, PhoA, PhoE, MalE, Lpp, LamB, and the like; TAT signal peptide, hemolysin C-terminal secretion signal;\n \nfor use in yeast: α-mating factor prepro-sequence, phosphatase (pho1), invertase (Suc), etc.;\n \nfor use in mammalian cells: indigenous signal in case the target protein is of eukaryotic origin; murine Ig κ-chain V-J2-C signal peptide; etc.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nSuitable techniques for transforming a host or host cell of the invention will be clear to the skilled person and may depend on the intended host cell/host organism and the genetic construct to be used. Reference is again made to the handbooks and patent applications mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter transformation, a step for detecting and selecting those host cells or host organisms that have been succesfully transformed with the nucleotide sequence/genetic construct of the invention may be performed. This may for instance be a selection step based on a selectable marker present in the genetic construct of the invention or a step involving the detection of the amino acid sequence of the invention, e.g. using specific antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe transformed host cell (which may be in the form or a stable cell line) or host organisms (which may be in the form of a stable mutant line or strain) form further aspects of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, these host cells or host organisms are such that they express, or are (at least) capable of expressing (e.g. under suitable conditions), an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention (and in case of a host organism: in at least one cell, part, tissue or organ thereof). The invention also includes further generations, progeny and/or offspring of the host cell or host organism of the invention, that may for instance be obtained by cell division or by sexual or asexual reproduction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo produce/obtain expression of the amino acid sequences of the invention, the transformed host cell or transformed host organism may generally be kept, maintained and/or cultured under conditions such that the (desired) amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is expressed/produced. Suitable conditions will be clear to the skilled person and will usually depend upon the host cell/host organism used, as well as on the regulatory elements that control the expression of the (relevant) nucleotide sequence of the invention. Again, reference is made to the handbooks and patent applications mentioned above in the paragraphs on the genetic constructs of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, suitable conditions may include the use of a suitable medium, the presence of a suitable source of food and/or suitable nutrients, the use of a suitable temperature, and optionally the presence of a suitable inducing factor or compound (e.g. when the nucleotide sequences of the invention are under the control of an inducible promoter); all of which may be selected by the skilled person. Again, under such conditions, the amino acid sequences of the invention may be expressed in a constitutive manner, in a transient manner, or only when suitably induced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will also be clear to the skilled person that the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention may (first) be generated in an immature form (as mentioned above), which may then be subjected to post-translational modification, depending on the host cell/host organism used. Also, the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention may be glycosylated, again depending on the host cell/host organism used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention may then be isolated from the host cell/host organism and/or from the medium in which said host cell or host organism was cultivated, using protein isolation and/or purification techniques known per se, such as (preparative) chromatography and/or electrophoresis techniques, differential precipitation techniques, affinity techniques (e.g. using a specific, cleavable amino acid sequence fused with the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention) and/or preparative immunological techniques (i.e. using antibodies against the amino acid sequence to be isolated).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, for pharmaceutical use, the polypeptides of the invention may be formulated as a pharmaceutical preparation or compositions comprising at least one polypeptide of the invention and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient and/or adjuvant, and optionally one or more further pharmaceutically active polypeptides and/or compounds. By means of non-limiting examples, such a formulation may be in a form suitable for oral administration, for parenteral administration (such as by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion), for topical administration (for example, as a cream for the prevention and/or treatment of superficial inflammation, such as psoriasis), for administration by inhalation, by a skin patch, by an implant, by a suppository, etc. Such suitable administration forms—which may be solid, semi-solid or liquid, depending on the manner of administration—as well as methods and carriers for use in the preparation thereof, will be clear to the skilled person, and are further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in a further aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition that contains at least one amino acid of the invention, at least one Nanobody of the invention or at least one polypeptide of the invention and at least one suitable carrier, diluent or excipient (i.e. suitable for pharmaceutical use), and optionally one or more further active substances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can be formulated and administered in any suitable manner known per se, for which reference is for example made to the general background art cited above (and in particular to WO 04/041862, WO 04/041863, WO 04/041865 and WO 04/041867) as well as to the standard handbooks, such as Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18\nth \nEd., Mack Publishing Company, USA (1990) or Remington, the Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21th Edition, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins (2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be formulated and administered in any manner known per se for conventional antibodies and antibody fragments (including ScFv's and diabodies) and other pharmaceutically active proteins. Such formulations and methods for preparing the same will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include preparations suitable for parenteral administration (for example intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraluminal, intra-arterial or intrathecal administration) or for topical (i.e. transdermal or intradermal) administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations for parenteral administration may for example be sterile solutions, suspensions, dispersions or emulsions that are suitable for infusion or injection. Suitable carriers or diluents for such preparations for example include, without limitation, sterile water and aqueous buffers and solutions such as physiological phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solutions, dextrose solution, and Hank's solution; water oils; glycerol; ethanol; glycols such as propylene glycol or as well as mineral oils, animal oils and vegetable oils, for example peanut oil, soybean oil, as well as suitable mixtures thereof. Usually, aqueous solutions or suspensions will be preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can also be administered using gene therapy methods of delivery. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,346, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Using a gene therapy method of delivery, primary cells transfected with the gene encoding an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention can additionally be transfected with tissue specific promoters to target specific organs, tissue, grafts, tumors, or cells and can additionally be transfected with signal and stabilization sequences for subcellularly localized expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention. Their percentage in the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of the amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically accepTable And substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations and formulations for oral administration may also be provided with an enteric coating that will allow the constructs of the invention to resist the gastric environment and pass into the intestines. More generally, preparations and formulations for oral administration may be suitably formulated for delivery into any desired part of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, suitable suppositories may be used for delivery into the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention or their salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form must be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical administration, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be applied in pure form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, hydroxyalkyls or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention to the skin are known to the art; for example, see Jacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392), Geria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478), Smith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157) and Wortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful dosages of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the concentration of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention in a liquid composition, such as a lotion, will be from about 0.1-25 wt-%, preferably from about 0.5-10 wt-%. The concentration in a semi-solid or solid composition such as a gel or a powder will be about 0.1-5 wt-%, preferably about 0.5-2.5 wt-%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. Also the dosage of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention varies depending on the target cell, tumor, tissue, graft, or organ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn administration regimen could include long-term, daily treatment. By “long-term” is meant at least two weeks and preferably, several weeks, months, or years of duration. Necessary modifications in this dosage range may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation given the teachings herein. See Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Martin, E. W., ed. 4), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. The dosage can also be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention relates to a method for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one diseases and disorders associated with heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors, said method comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of the present invention, the term “prevention and/or treatment” not only comprises preventing and/or treating the disease, but also generally comprises preventing the onset of the disease, slowing or reversing the progress of disease, preventing or slowing the onset of one or more symptoms associated with the disease, reducing and/or alleviating one or more symptoms associated with the disease, reducing the severity and/or the duration of the disease and/or of any symptoms associated therewith and/or preventing a further increase in the severity of the disease and/or of any symptoms associated therewith, preventing, reducing or reversing any physiological damage caused by the disease, and generally any pharmacological action that is beneficial to the patient being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject to be treated may be any warm-blooded animal, but is in particular a mammal, and more in particular a human being. As will be clear to the skilled person, the subject to be treated will in particular be a person suffering from, or at risk of, the diseases and disorders mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention relates to a method for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one disease or disorder that is associated with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, with its biological or pharmacological activity, and/or with the biological pathways or signalling in which heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors is involved, said method comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same. In particular, the invention relates to a method for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one disease or disorder that can be treated by modulating heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, its biological or pharmacological activity, and/or the biological pathways or signalling in which heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors is involved, said method comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same. In particular, said pharmaceutically effective amount may be an amount that is sufficient to modulate heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, its biological or pharmacological activity, and/or the biological pathways or signalling in which heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors is involved; and/or an amount that provides a level of the amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention in the circulation that is sufficient to modulate heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, its biological or pharmacological activity, and/or the biological pathways or signalling in which heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors is involved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention furthermore relates to a method for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one disease or disorder that can be prevented and/or treated by administering an amino acid sequence of the invention, a Nanobody of the invention or a polypeptide of the invention to a patient, said method comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore in particular, the invention relates to a method for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one disease or disorder chosen from the group consisting of the diseases and disorders listed herein, said method comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention relates to a method for immunotherapy, and in particular for passive immunotherapy, which method comprises administering, to a subject suffering from or at risk of the diseases and disorders mentioned herein, a pharmaceutically active amount of an amino acid sequence of the invention, of a Nanobody of the invention, of a polypeptide of the invention, and/or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above methods, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention and/or the compositions comprising the same can be administered in any suitable manner, depending on the specific pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used. Thus, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention and/or the compositions comprising the same can for example be administered orally, intraperitoneally (e.g. intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or via any other route of administration that circumvents the gastrointestinal tract), intranasally, transdermally, topically, by means of a suppository, by inhalation, again depending on the specific pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used. The clinician will be able to select a suitable route of administration and a suitable pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used in such administration, depending on the disease or disorder to be prevented or treated and other factors well known to the clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention and/or the compositions comprising the same are administered according to a regime of treatment that is suitable for preventing and/or treating the disease or disorder to be prevented or treated. The clinician will generally be able to determine a suitable treatment regimen, depending on factors such as the disease or disorder to be prevented or treated, the severity of the disease to be treated and/or the severity of the symptoms thereof, the specific amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to be used, the specific route of administration and pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used, the age, gender, weight, diet, general condition of the patient, and similar factors well known to the clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the treatment regimen will comprise the administration of one or more amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention, or of one or more compositions comprising the same, in one or more pharmaceutically effective amounts or doses. The specific amount(s) or doses to administered can be determined by the clinician, again based on the factors cited above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, for the prevention and/or treatment of the diseases and disorders mentioned herein and depending on the specific disease or disorder to be treated, the potency of the specific amino acid sequence, Nanobody and polypeptide of the invention to be used, the specific route of administration and the specific pharmaceutical formulation or composition used, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention will generally be administered in an amount between 1 gram and 0.01 microgram per kg body weight per day, preferably between 0.1 gram and 0.1 microgram per kg body weight per day, such as about 1, 10, 100 or 1000 microgram per kg body weight per day, either continuously (e.g. by infusion), as a single daily dose or as multiple divided doses during the day. The clinician will generally be able to determine a suitable daily dose, depending on the factors mentioned herein. It will also be clear that in specific cases, the clinician may choose to deviate from these amounts, for example on the basis of the factors cited above and his expert judgment. Generally, some guidance on the amounts to be administered can be obtained from the amounts usually administered for comparable conventional antibodies or antibody fragments against the same target administered via essentially the same route, taking into account however differences in affinity/avidity, efficacy, biodistribution, half-life and similar factors well known to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsually, in the above method, a single amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention will be used. It is however within the scope of the invention to use two or more amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention in combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Nanobodies, amino acid sequences and polypeptides of the invention may also be used in combination with one or more further pharmaceutically active compounds or principles, i.e. as a combined treatment regimen, which may or may not lead to a synergistic effect. Again, the clinician will be able to select such further compounds or principles, as well as a suitable combined treatment regimen, based on the factors cited above and his expert judgement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be used in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds or principles that are or can be used for the prevention and/or treatment of the diseases and disorders cited herein, as a result of which a synergistic effect may or may not be obtained. Examples of such compounds and principles, as well as routes, methods and pharmaceutical formulations or compositions for administering them will be clear to the clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen two or more substances or principles are to be used as part of a combined treatment regimen, they can be administered via the same route of administration or via different routes of administration, at essentially the same time or at different times (e.g. essentially simultaneously, consecutively, or according to an alternating regime). When the substances or principles are to be administered simultaneously via the same route of administration, they may be administered as different pharmaceutical formulations or compositions or part of a combined pharmaceutical formulation or composition, as will be clear to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, when two or more active substances or principles are to be used as part of a combined treatment regimen, each of the substances or principles may be administered in the same amount and according to the same regimen as used when the compound or principle is used on its own, and such combined use may or may not lead to a synergistic effect. However, when the combined use of the two or more active substances or principles leads to a synergistic effect, it may also be possible to reduce the amount of one, more or all of the substances or principles to be administered, while still achieving the desired therapeutic action. This may for example be useful for avoiding, limiting or reducing any unwanted side-effects that are associated with the use of one or more of the substances or principles when they are used in their usual amounts, while still obtaining the desired pharmaceutical or therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effectiveness of the treatment regimen used according to the invention may be determined and/or followed in any manner known per se for the disease or disorder involved, as will be clear to the clinician. The clinician will also be able, where appropriate and on a case-by-case basis, to change or modify a particular treatment regimen, so as to achieve the desired therapeutic effect, to avoid, limit or reduce unwanted side-effects, and/or to achieve an appropriate balance between achieving the desired therapeutic effect on the one hand and avoiding, limiting or reducing undesired side effects on the other hand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the treatment regimen will be followed until the desired therapeutic effect is achieved and/or for as long as the desired therapeutic effect is to be maintained. Again, this can be determined by the clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention relates to the use of an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for prevention and/or treatment of at least one diseases and disorders associated with heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors; and/or for use in one or more of the methods of treatment mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject to be treated may be any warm-blooded animal, but is in particular a mammal, and more in particular a human being. As will be clear to the skilled person, the subject to be treated will in particular be a person suffering from, or at risk of, the diseases and disorders mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to the use of an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one disease or disorder that can be prevented and/or treated by administering an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to a patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore in particular, the invention relates to the use of an amino acid sequence, Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases and disorders associated with heterodimeric cytokines and their receptors, and in particular for the prevention and treatment of one or more of the diseases and disorders listed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain, in such a pharmaceutical composition, the one or more amino acid sequences, Nanobodies or polypeptides of the invention may also be suitably combined with one or more other active principles, such as those mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, although the use of the Nanobodies of the invention (as defined herein) and of the polypeptides of the invention is much preferred, it will be clear that on the basis of the description herein, the skilled person will also be able to design and/or generate, in an analogous manner, other amino acid sequences and in particular (single) domain antibodies against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, as well as polypeptides comprising such (single) domain antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, it will also be clear to the skilled person that it may be possible to “graft” one or more of the CDR's mentioned above for the Nanobodies of the invention onto such (single) domain antibodies or other protein scaffolds, including but not limited to human scaffolds or non-immunoglobulin scaffolds. Suitable scaffolds and techniques for such CDR grafting will be clear to the skilled person and are well known in the art, see for example U.S. Pat. No. 7,180,370, WO 01/27160, \nEP\n 0 605 522, \nEP\n 0 460 167, U.S. Pat. No. 7,054,297, Nicaise et al., Protein Science (2004), 13:1882-1891; Ewert et al., Methods, October 2004; 34(2):184-199; Kettleborough et al., Protein Eng. October 1991; 4(7): 773-783; O'Brien and Jones, Methods Mol. Biol. 2003: 207: 81-100; Skerra, J. Mol. Recognit. 2000: 13: 167-187, and Saerens et al., J. Mol. Biol. Sep. 23, 2005; 352(3):597-607, and the further references cited therein. For example, techniques known per se for grafting mouse or rat CDR's onto human frameworks and scaffolds can be used in an analogous manner to provide chimeric proteins comprising one or more of the CDR's of the Nanobodies of the invention and one or more human framework regions or sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should also be noted that, when the Nanobodies of the inventions contain one or more other CDR sequences than the preferred CDR sequences mentioned above, these CDR sequences can be obtained in any manner known per se, for example from Nanobodies (preferred), V\nH \ndomains from conventional antibodies (and in particular from human antibodies), heavy chain antibodies, conventional 4-chain antibodies (such as conventional human 4-chain antibodies) or other immuno globulin sequences directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors. Such immunoglobulin sequences directed against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors can be generated in any manner known per se, as will be clear to the skilled person, i.e. by immunization with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors or by screening a suitable library of immunoglobulin sequences with heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, or any suitable combination thereof. Optionally, this may be followed by techniques such as random or site-directed mutagenesis and/or other techniques for affinity maturation known per se. Suitable techniques for generating such immunoglobulin sequences will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include the screening techniques reviewed by Hoogenboom, Nature Biotechnology, 23, 9, 1105-1116 (2005) Other techniques for generating immunoglobulins against a specified target include for example the Nanoclone technology (as for example described in the published US patent application 2006-0211088), so-called SLAM technology (as for example described in the \nEuropean patent application\n 0 542 810), the use of transgenic mice expressing human immunoglobulins or the well-known hybridoma techniques (see for example Larrick et al, Biotechnology, Vol. 7, 1989, p. 934). All these techniques can be used to generate immunoglobulins against heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors, and the CDR's of such immunoglobulins can be used in the Nanobodies of the invention, i.e. as outlined above. For example, the sequence of such a CDR can be determined, synthesized and/or isolated, and inserted into the sequence of a Nanobody of the invention (e.g. so as to replace the corresponding native CDR), all using techniques known per se such as those described herein, or Nanobodies of the invention containing such CDR's (or nucleic acids encoding the same) can be synthesized de novo, again using the techniques mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther uses of the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies, polypeptides, nucleic acids, genetic constructs and hosts and host cells of the invention will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein. For example, and without limitation, the amino acid sequences of the invention can be linked to a suitable carrier or solid support so as to provide a medium than can be used in a manner known per se to purify heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors from compositions and preparations comprising the same. Derivatives of the amino acid sequences of the invention that comprise a suitable detectable label can also be used as markers to determine (qualitatively or quantitatively) the presence of heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors in a composition or preparation or as a marker to selectively detect the presence of heterodimeric cytokines and/or their receptors on the surface of a cell or tissue (for example, in combination with suitable cell sorting techniques).\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention will now be further described by means of the following non-limiting Examples and Figures, in which the Figures show:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n: Representative result of a competitive binding ELISA showing the IL23 neutralizing activity of nanobodies (in periplasm fraction) for IL12Rbeta1 chain or IL23R chain binding as described in Example 5.

Blood and lymph nodes were collected from these animals after 7 days after \n \nboost\n \n 6 and 10 days after \nboost\n 6. All 3 cytokines were recombinant proteins purchased from R&D systems: hIL-12 (Cat. No 219-IL/CF); hIL-23 (Cat. No 1290-IL/CF) and hIL-27 (Cat. No 2526-IL/CF)\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nLibrary Construction\n\n\n \n \n \nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared from blood samples using Ficoll-Hypaque according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, total RNA extracted was extracted from these cells as well as from the lymph node bow cells and used as starting material for RT-PCR to amplify Nanobody encoding gene fragments. These fragments were cloned into phagemid vector pAX50. Phage was prepared according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein) and stored at 4° C. for further use, resulting in two phage libraries (“A” and “B”).\n\n\n \nExample 3a\n\n\nSelections\n\n\n \n \n \nTo identify nanobodies recognizing the cytokines, the phage libraries from Example 2 were used for selections on the immunized cytokines and biotinylated cytokines. The (biotinylated) proteins were immobilized independently at 5 microg/ml, 0.5 ug/ml or 0 ug/ml (control) on Nunc Maxisorp ELISA plates previously coated with Neutravidine (5 ug/ml) when biotinylated proteins were used for selection. Bound phages were eluted from the IL12, IL23 or IL27 (and the biotinylated form) using trypsin (1 mg/ml) as in standard protocols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOutputs of both R1 selections were analyzed for enrichment factor (phage present in eluate relative to controls). Based on these parameters the best selections were chosen for further analysis. The polyclonal output was then recloned in PAX51 and individual TG1 colonies were picked and grown in 96 deep well plates (1 ml volume) and induced by adding IPTG for nanobody expression. Periplasmic extracts (volume: ˜100 ul) were prepared according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein).\n\n\n \nExample 3b\n\n\nSelections of hIL12 or hIL23 Specific Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nTo identify nanobodies specifically recognizing hIL12 or hIL23 and therefore recognizing IL12p35 or IL23p19 respectively, 2 rounds of selections with relevant counterselection were performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor IL23 specific nanobodies, 2.5 ug/ml IL23 was coated on Nunc Maxisorp ELISA plates. Phages from libraries 146 and 147 were added to the coated wells in the presence of 10 ug IL12 (100 ug/ml). The presence of IL12 prevents the phages recognizing non specific IL23 epitops (on IL12p40) to binds IL23. To identify IL12 specific nanobodies, the same was done with 2.5 ug/ml IL12 coated and 10 ug IL23 (100 ug/ml) added with the phages. In all cases, bound phages were eluted (R1) using trypsin (1 mg/ml) using standard protocols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phages eluted in the first round were used to do a second round using the same condition as in the first round, giving R2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOutput of R2 selections were rescued, cloned in PAX51 using standard polyclonal recloning. Individual colonies containing PAX51-expressing nanobodies were picked and grown in 96 deep well plates (1 ml volume) and induced by adding IPTG for nanobody expression. Periplasmic extracts (volume: ˜100 ul) were prepared according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein).\n\n\n \nExample 3c\n\n\nSelections of Mouse IL12 or Mouse IL23 Specific Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to complete animal studies, it is desirable to have nanobodies recognizing the mouse cytokines isoforms. To identify nanobodies crossreacting with the mouse IL12 or mouse IL23, one approach is to test the nanobodies identified earlier against human IL12/IL23 for cross-reactivity with mouse IL12 or IL23. Several cross reacting nanobodies were identified that way.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA second approach is to select phages directly from the library of Example 2 directed against human IL12 and Il123. Therefore, the selection was done as in Example 3a except that mouse IL12 (5 ug/ml in 100 ul; cat. 419-ML/CF, R&Dsystem) or mouse IL23 (5 ug/ml in 100 ul; cat. 1887-MF/CF, R&Dsystem) was coated. In addition, the same selection was done in the presenece of mouse IL12 (when IL23 was coated) and humanIL23 (when IL12 was coated) as counterselection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA third approach is to select phages directly from the phage eluted during the R1 as in Example 3b (the approach is then 1 round against humanILs with counterselection and a second round against mouseILs). Therefore, the second round of selection was done as in Example 3b except mouse IL12 (5 ug/ml in 100 ul; cat. 419-ML/CF, R&Dsystem) or mouse IL23 (5 ug/ml in 100 ul; cat. 1887-MF/CF, R&Dsystem) was coated. In parallel, to identify specific mouse IL12 and mouse IL23, the same was done with the presence of mouse IL12 (when IL23 was coated) and human IL23 (when IL12 was coated) to act as counterselective protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn all selections, bound phages were eluted using trypsin and resued in TG1. Individual TG1 colonies were picked and grown in 96 deep well plates (1 ml volume) and induced by adding IPTG for nanobody expression. Periplasmic extracts (volume: ˜100 ul) were prepared according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein).\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nScreening for Binding\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to determine binding specificity to the cytokines, the clones were tested in an ELISA binding assay setup.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn short, 1 ug/ml of cytokines (IL12, IL23 or IL27) was immobilized directly on polysorp microtiter plates (Nunc). Free binding sites were blocked using 4% Marvel in PBS. Next, 5 ul of periplasmic extract containing nanobody of the different clones in 100 \nul\n 2% Marvel PBST were allowed to bind to the immobilized antigen. After incubation and washing, nanobody binding was revealed using a mouse-anti-myc secondary antibody, which was after a wash step detected with a HRP-conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody. Binding specificity was determined based on OD values compared to controls having received no nanobody (as exemplified in Table B-1).

Then we added IL-12 (in the presence of a range of anti-IL-12 nanobodies). After 2 days, the proliferation was measured with 3H-thymidine incorporation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing this setup, the maximum of proliferation was obtained with 60 pg/well (=300 pg/ml) of rhIL-12. So the purified nanobodies (concentration varied from 1 μg to 10-6 μg/well) were tested against 60 pg/well of IL-12. The antibodies LG120C7 and 120F8 were tested against commercially available antibody (anti-p35 and anti-p40, MAB219 and MAB1510 respectively were from R&D system; B-T21 was from Diaclone).

The proteins were immobilized independently at 5 microg/ml, 0.5 microg/ml or 0 microg/ml (control) on Nunc Maxisorp ELISA plates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo get rid of phages binding to the Fc fusion domain fused to the recombinant protein, total human IgG (250 microg/ml from sigma) and non-relevant hFc fusion protein (hRAGE-Fc, at 25 microg/ml from R&D System) was added to the phages during the time of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBound phages were eluted from the coated proteins using trypsine (1 mg/ml) as in standard protocols.\n\n\n \nExample 9b\n\n\nSelections of Nanobodies Neutralizing IL12-Family Receptors\n\n\n \n \n \nThis was performed as described in Example 9a, except that only 0.5 ug/ml of receptor was coated and that a competitive elution was performed instead of trypsin elution. For this, after binding of the phages and extensive washing, the ligands of the respective receptor chains were was used to elute the phages. In short, 5 ug of IL12 (for IL12Rbeta1 and IL12Rbeta2) or 5 ug of IL23 (for IL12Rbeta1 or IL23R) was added to the phages still bound to the coated receptors. After 2 h shacking, the eluted phages were recovered and rescued in TG1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOutputs of both R1 selections were analyzed for enrichment factor (phage present in eluate relative to controls).

Biacore off-rates were determined using on hIL-23 from R&D systems (or from eBiosciences) for a panel of p19+ and p19− Nanobodies as well as one p40− Nanobody.\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nConstruction, Production and Purification of Bispecific/Biparatopic IL23 Nanobody Constructs\n\n\n \n \n \nBiparatopic constructs were made in the pAX55 vector, with a p19+ nanobody (121A2 or 119A3) in the N-terminal position and a p19− nanobody (81G2, 81A12, 123F1, 119G7, 124C4 or 124H5) or a p40− nanobody (119B2) in the C-terminal position fused by a 35GS linker sequence. Additionally contracts were made with a p19− nanobody (81G2, 81A12, 123F1, 119G7, 124C4 or 124H5) in the N-terminal position and the p19+ nanobody 121A2 in the C-terminal position fused by a 35 GS linker. Similarly, the monovalent nanobodies were also cloned into pAX55 for use as controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe constructs were transformed in TG1 cells which were induced with 1 mM IPTG. Nanobodies were purified from the periplasmic extract using histidine trap affinity chromatography followed by desalting. LPS removal was performed by anion exhange chromatography at neutral pH, or by gel filtration in the presence of 50 mM octyl-glycosyl pyranoside, when additional purification was required\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\nAlpha-Screen Blockade of IL-23-IL23R Binding\n\n\n \n \n \nAn alpha-screen was performed in which the blocking of hIL-23 binding to hIL23R-Fc (see \nFIG. 5\n \nb\n) was monitored to determine the potency of biparatopic nanobodies compared to the monovalent p19+ nanobodies. Results are indicated in \nFIGS. 5A\n, \n6\n and \n7\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n shows the results of an Alpha-screen measuring hIL-23 binding to hIL23R-Fc (see \nFIG. 5B\n) for determining the potency of biparatopic nanobodies compared to the monovalent p19+ nanobodies. \nFIG. 5A\n is a graphic representations of the results. \nFIGS. 6 and 7\n show potencies of monovalent and biparatopic Nanobodies in the hIL-23-hIL-23R alpha-screen.\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\nNeutralization of IL-23 Biological Function by IL-23 Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nFreshly isolated mouse splenocytes were treated with hIL-23 (eBiosciences) preincubated with titrated hIL-23 nanobodies or control nanobodies or antibodies. After 3-7 days in culture, cell supernatants were removed and assayed by ELISA using IL-17 ELISA duo set (R&D systems). \nFIG. 8\n shows results of a Splenocyte bioassay (measuring mIL-17 levels) for a selection of monovalent and biparatopic Nbs (p19+-35GS-p19−; and p19+-35GS-p40−). Reference is made to Aggarwal, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 278, 3, 2003, 1910-1914.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 8\n, monovalent p19+ Nbs inhibit hIL-23 mediated IL-17 production and most biparatopics show a considerable enhancement of potency.\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nImmunizations\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo llamas were immunized according to standard protocols with 6 intramuscular injections at weekly intervals of recombinant human IL-23 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., US) (two first injections at 40 μg/dose, 4 following injections at 20 μg/dose). Two weeks after the last injection a boost of 20 μg was given. The antigen was formulated in Stimune (Cedi-Diagnostics B.V., Lelystad, The Netherlands). At \nweek\n 3, sera were collected to define antibody titers against human IL-23 by ELISA. 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) were coated with human IL-23. After blocking and adding diluted sera samples, the presence of anti-IL-23 antibodies was demonstrated by using HRP (horseradish peroxidase) conjugated goat anti-llama immunoglobulin (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, Tex. USA) and a subsequent enzymatic reaction in the presence of the substrate TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramentylbenzidine) (Pierce, Rockford, Ill., USA). OD\n450 nm \nexceeded 1 in both animals. Blood and lymph nodes were collected from these animals, \n \nblood\n \n 4 and 8 days after the last injection and lymph nodes 13 days after the boost.\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\nLibrary Construction\n\n\n \n \n \nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared from blood samples using Ficoll-Hypaque according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, total RNA was extracted from these cells as well as from the lymph node bow cells and used as starting material for RT-PCR to amplify Nanobody encoding gene fragments. These fragments were cloned into phagemid vector pAX50. Phage was prepared according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein) and stored at 4° C. for further use, resulting in two phage libraries (“E” and “F”).\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\nNew Selections of Anti IL-23 p19 and p40 Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nTo identify Nanobodies recognizing specifically the p19 subunit of human IL-23, 5 or 0.5 nM human IL-23 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., US) was coated on Nunc Maxisorp ELISA plates. Phages from libraries E and F were predepleted 3 times by binding to wells coated with 5 μg/ml human IL-12 (to remove p40 binding phages) and further preincubated with 1 μM hIL-12 in solution before adding to the IL-23 coated wells. Phages were either specifically eluted with either 500 nM of a biparatopic anti-p19 Nanobody or 500 nM of recombinant IL-23R (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., US), or were eluted with trypsin as described in standard protocols. Outputs of these \nround\n 1 selections were analyzed for enrichment factor (number of phage present in eluate relative to controls). Based on this parameter the best outputs were chosen for a second selection round using the same conditions as \nround\n 1. Enriched outputs of these \nround\n 2 selections were screened in an ELISA for binding to hIL-23 versus hIL-12. Mostly specific binding to hIL-23 was observed. Individual TG1 colonies were picked and grown in 96 deep well plates (1 ml volume) and induced by adding IPTG for Nanobody expression. Periplasmic extracts (volume: ˜100 ul) were prepared according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe p40 binding Nanobodies were obtained as described above, however bound phages were eluted using trypsin (1 mg/ml). Individual TG1 colonies from first round outputs were picked, grown and induced as described above. Clones were screened in an ELISA for binding to hIL-23 versus hIL-12. Clones binding to both hIL-23 and hIL-12 were selected for further characterization as p40 binders.\n\n\n \nExample 19\n\n\nScreening for p19 and p40 Binding Nanobodies and Identification of p19 and p40 Nanobodies Blocking Receptor Interaction\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to determine binding specificity to the p19 or the p40 subunit of IL-23, the periplasmic extracts were tested in an ELISA binding assay setup. In this screen also periplasmic extracts derived from selections on libraries derived from llama's 146 and 147 were included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1 μg/ml of hIL-12 or hIL-23 was immobilized directly on polysorp microtiter plates (Nunc). Free binding sites were blocked using 1% casein in PBS. Next, periplasmic extracts containing Nanobody of the different clones were diluted 1/50 in 100 μl PBS+0.1% casein=0.05% tween and were allowed to bind to the immobilized antigen. After incubation and washing, Nanobody binding was revealed using a biotinylated anti-His antibody, which, after a wash step, was detected with HRP-conjugated extravidin and TMB substrate. Binding specificity was determined based on OD values compared to controls having received no Nanobody. Nanobodies binding to p40 were identified as Nanobodies recognizing hIL-12 and hIL-23, Nanobodies binding to p19 as the ones only recognizing hIL-23.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCross-reactivity towards cynomolgus IL-23 was tested in an ELISA, where cynomolgus IL-23 was bound on the plate via an immobilized anti-IL-23 antibody (AF1716 R&D systems). Binding of the Nanobodies present in the extracts was revealed using HRP conjugated anti-myc antibodies and TMB substrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to determine neutralizing efficiency of the expressed Nanobodies, the periplasmic extracts were screened in a hIL-23 or hIL-12 alpha-screen assay. This assay relies on the use of Donor and Acceptor beads which can be conjugated to biological molecules. When a biological interaction between molecules brings the beads into proximity, excited singlet oxygen molecules that are produced upon laser excitation at 680 nm by a photosensitizer in the Donor bead, diffuse across to react with a chemiluininiscer in the acceptor bead that further activates fluorophores which subsequently emit light at 520-620 nm. If the Nanobody inhibits binding of hIL-23 to hIL-23R, or hIL-12 to hIL12Rbeta1 fluorescent output will decrease, and the amount of Nanobody present will be inversely related to the amount of fluorescence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nhIL-12 (R&D Systems) and hIL-23 (eBioscience) were biotinylated using Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce). Human IL23R-Fc chimera and hIL12Rbeta1-Fc chimera (R&D Systems) were coupled to acceptor beads according to manufacturer instructions (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass., US). To evaluate the neutralizing capacity of anti-p19 Nanobodies, dilution series of the periplasmic extracts were pre-incubated with biotinylated hIL-23. To this mixture, the IL-23R-Fc coupled acceptor beads and the streptavidin donor beads were added and further incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Fluorescence was measured by reading plates on the EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer) using an excitation wavelength of 680 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. Decrease in fluorescence signal indicates that the binding of biotinylated hIL-23 to the IL-23 receptor is blocked by the Nanobody expressed in the periplasmic extract, the Nanobodies are designated 19+ when neutralizing and p19− when not neutralizing. The neutralizing capacity of anti-p40 Nanobodies was evaluated in the same way, but using biotinylated hIL-12 and hIL12Rbeta1-Fc coupled acceptor beads, with p40+ neutralizing Nanobodies and p40− non neutralizing Nanobodies.\n\n\n \nExample 20 \n\n\nBiacore Off-Rate Screening of Periplasmic Extracts Containing Monovalent Anti-p19 and Anti p40 Monovalent Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman IL-23 (eBioscience) was covalently bound to CM5 sensor chips surface via amine coupling using EDC/NHS for activation and HCl for deactivation. Periplasmic extracts containing p19+, p19−, p40+ or p40− Nanobodies were injected for 4 minutes at a flow rate of 45 μl/min to allow binding to chip-bound antigen. Next, binding buffer without periplasmic extracts was sent over the chip at the same flow rate to allow spontaneous dissociation of bound Nanobody. From the sensorgrams obtained for the different periplasmic extract k\noff\n-values (k\n1\n) were calculated. (\nFIGS. 9 and 10\n). As a control hIL-12 (R&D systems) was immobilized on the Biacore chips, p19 Nanobodies did not bind to his chip, whereas the p40 Nanobodies bound and showed similar off rates as for hIL-23.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on this Biacore analysis, p19 and p40 Nanobodies with the best off rates were selected and sequenced. This provided, after sequencing analysis, 6 unique p19+ Nanobodies belonging to 4 families, 2 unique p19− Nanobodies belonging to 2 families, 6 unique p40+ sequences belonging to 5 families and 6 unique p40− sequences belonging to 6 families. Together with the sequences obtained in Examples 1 to 6, this makes a total of 7 families of p19+ Nanobodies, 15 families of p19− Nanobodies, 14 families of p40+ Nanobodies and 11 families of p40− Nanobodies. The amino acid sequences of these Nanobodies are listed in \nFIGS. 20 to 23\n, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe periplasmic extracts were also screened for cross-reactivity towards murine IL-23, by determining off rates on immobilized mIL-23. Two p19− families were cross-reactive towards mIL-23, no p19+, p40+ nor p40− mouse cross-reactive Nanobodies were retrieved.\n\n\n \nExample 21\n\n\nAnti IL-23 Nanobody Expression and Purification\n\n\n \n \n \nSix p19+ Nanobodies from Example 20, one of the p19− Nanobodies from Example 20 and 12 of the p40+ Nanobodies from Example 20 and 8 of the p40− Nanobodies from Example 20 were expressed, purified and further characterised. Expression occurred in \nE. coli \nTG1 cells as c-myc, His6-tagged proteins in a culture volume of 250 mL. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG and further incubation for 3 h at 37° C. After spinning down the cell cultures, periplasmic extracts were prepared by freeze-thawing the pellets and resuspension in dPBS. These extracts were used as starting material for immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Histrap FF crude columns (GE Healthcare). Nanobodies were eluted from the column with 250 mM imidazole and subsequently desalted towards dPBS. For the splenocyte assays described below, endotoxins should be removed from the Nanobodies and this was obtained by either gelfiltration in the presence of 50 mM Octylβ-D-glucopyranoside (OGP, Sigma) or by anion exchange (Mono Q HR5/50, GE healthcare) in dPBS, where the Nanobody is recovered in the flow through, whereas LPS is retained on the column. LPS levels are determined using a LAL-assay.\n\n\n \nExample 22 \n\n\nPotency of Neutralizing Anti p19 and Anti p40 Nanobodies Determined in Alpha-Screen\n\n\n \n \n \nhIL-12 (R&D Systems), hIL-23 (eBioscience) and cynomolgus IL-23 were biotinylated using Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce). Human IL-23R-Fc chimera and hIL12Rbeta1-Fc chimera (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., US) were coupled to acceptor beads according to manufacturer instructions (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass., US).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine potencies of the p19+ Nanobodies, a dilution series of anti-p19 Nanobodies starting from 250 nM up to 1 pM was pre-incubated with 500 pM biotinylated hIL-23 or cyno IL-23 during 15 minutes at room temperature (RT). To this mixture, the IL-23R acceptor beads and the streptavidin donor beads were added and further incubated for 1 hour at RT. Preincubation of all Nanobodies with biotinylated IL-23 reduced fluorescence intensity at 520 nm, demonstrating that the Nanobodies can effectively inhibit hIL-23 binding to IL-23R in a dose-dependent manner. The results are shown in \nFIG. 37\n, which is a graph showing the results obtained in this Example 22 for the measurement of the potency of some anti p19 and anti p40 Nanobodies in alpha-screen using hIL-23; and in \nFIG. 38\n, which is a graph showing the results obtained in this Example 22 for the measurement of the potency of some anti p19 and anti p40 Nanobodies in alpha-screen using cyno IL-23. The calculated IC50 values are shown in Table B-5, and vary from 7.3 nM for P23IL36A1 to 110 pM for P23IL37D5. However, cyno IL-23 binding is only effectively inhibited by P23IL36A4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine potencies of the p40+ Nanobodies, a dilution series of anti-p40 Nanobodies starting from 250 nM up to 1 pM was pre-incubated with 3 nM biotinylated hIL-12 during 15 minutes at room temperature (RT). To this mixture, the IL12Rbeta1 acceptor beads and the streptavidin donor beads were added and further incubated for 1 hour at RT. Preincubation of most tested Nanobodies with biotinylated IL-12 reduced fluorescence intensity at 520 nm, demonstrating that the Nanobodies can effectively inhibit hIL-12 binding to IL12Rbeta1 in a dose-dependent manner. The calculated IC50 values are shown in Table B-6, and vary from 23 nM for P23IL81E10 up to 350 pM for P23IL3B8.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE B-5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 values for p19+ Nanobodies in alpha-screen for blocking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhIL-23 or cynomolgus IL-23 (cIL-23) receptor interaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP19+ Nanobody\n\n\nIC50 (nM) hIL-23\n\n\nIC50 (nM) cIL-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP23IL 36A1\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n7.80 (partial blocking)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP23IL 36B3\n\n\n2.2\n\n\nNot blocking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP23IL 36B4\n\n\n1.8\n\n\nNot blocking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP23IL 36E5\n\n\n0.96\n\n\nPartial blocking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP23IL 36A4 (=36G2)\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP23IL 37D5\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n0.32 (partial blocking)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE B-6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 values for p40+ Nanobodies in alpha-screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP40+ Nanobody\n\n\nIC50 (nM) hIL-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL 3B8\n\n\n0.35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL 3G10\n\n\n0.90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL 84A12\n\n\n0.96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL 3F11\n\n\nnot tested\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL 21C4\n\n\n1.63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL 3C1\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL 84G12\n\n\npartial blocking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nP23IL 81E10\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL 22D7\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL 22E11\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL 23H3\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL 23E3\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 23\n\n\nBinding Kinetics of IL-23 Monovalent p19+, p19−, and IL-23/IL-12 p40+, and p40− Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nBinding kinetics of of a selection of p19+, p19−, p40+ and p40− Nanobodies were analysed by Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore T100). Human IL-23 was covalently bound to CM5 sensor chips surface via amine coupling using EDC/NHS for activation and HCl for deactivation. Nanobody binding was assessed at one concentration (100 nM). Each Nanobody was injected for 4 minutes at a flow rate of 45 μl/min to allow binding to chip-bound antigen. Next, binding buffer without Nanobody was sent over the chip at the same flow rate to allow spontaneous dissociation of bound Nanobody.

A dilution series of a second anti-p19 Nanobody starting from 200 nM up to 1 pM was pre-incubated with 500 pM hIL-23 during 15 minutes at RT.

Subsequently the p40+ monovalent Nanobodies were tested for their capacity to bind. As expected the p40+ Nanobodies bind to a separate epitope group since they could still bind hIL-23 already attached to P23IL119A3 fixed to the Biacore chip.\n\n\n \nExample 25 \n\n\nNeutralizing Activity of p19+ and p40+ Nanobodies in Cell Based Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nA mouse splenocyte assay (modified from Example 15) was used to determine inhibition of IL-23 activity based on the ability of IL-23 to stimulate IL-22 secretion from mouse spleen cells. The basic protocol is as follows: the spleens of 5 C57BL/6 mice are removed and the splenocytes are harvested and a single cell suspension is prepared. The splenocytes are washed 3 times in RPMI (Invitrogen, Cat 72400-021) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen, Cat 10270-106), 1% Pen/Strep (Invitrogen, Cat 15140-122), 80 μM β-mercapto-ethanol (Invitrogen, Cat 31350-010) and 1 mM SodiumPyruvate (Gibco, Cat 1136). This medium is further referred to as complete RPMI. The splenocyte suspension is treated with 1× erythrocyte lysis buffer (10× stock: 82.9 g NH4Cl, 10.9 g KHCO3 and 370 mg EDTA in 1 liter MilliQ) to remove all residual erythrocytes. After 3 wash steps in complete RPMI, the cells are filtered over a 100 μM cell strainer (BD, Cat 35260) and resuspended in complete RPMI containing 20 ng/ml recombinant mIL-2 (R&D systems, Cat 402-ML). Cells are seeded at 400 000 cells/well in 96-well flat bottom plates (Falcon, Cat 353072).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNanobodies (50 μl) were pre-incubated with recombinant hIL-23 in complete RPMI for 30 minutes at room temperature and then incubated for another 5 days with the splenocytes, at a pre-determined final concentration of hIL-23 or cyno IL-23 (ranging from 3.7-19 pM).

At first, the BA/F3 cell line was stably transfected with an expression vector encoding hIL-12Rβ1. Transfection was performed using an Amaxa nucleofector II (Cat. No. AAD-1001) and the Amaxa nucleofection kit V (Cat. No. VCA-1003). Immediately after transfection, 500 μl pre-warmed culture medium is added to the cuvette and the entire content is transferred into a T25 containing 4 ml culture medium as described above. To select the transfected cells, 1.1 mg/ml Hygromycin B (Invitrogen, Cat 10687-010) was added 48 h after transfection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pool of hIL12Rβ1 expressing Ba/F3 cells was single-cell sorted using a FACSaria. Hereto, cells were resuspended in a 15 ml Falcon tube at 20E6/ml in diluted mouse-anti-hIL-12Rβ1 (0.5 mg/ml, R&D systems, Cat MAB839). The cells were counted using Trypan Blue and haematocytometer. All dilutions and wash steps are done with \nPBS\n 1× (Invitrogen: 141190-094) supplemented with 10% FBS. After 30 minutes incubation at 4° C., the cells are washed three times with PBS. A second staining is done with phycoerythrin-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Cat 115-115-164). The cells are incubated for 30 minutes at 4° C. and washed three times. A final stain with TOPRO3 (Molecular Probes T3605) is included to exclude dead cells. H-IL12Rβ1 expressing Ba/F3 cells were single-cell sorted into 96-well culture plates and further cultured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter several screenings on FACSarray, h-IL12Rβ1 expressing Ba/F3 subclone 4D9 was selected for transfection with a hIL-23 encoding plasmid. The results of flow cytometric analysis of h-IL12Rβ1 expressing Ba/F3 subclone 4D9, as obtained in this Example 26 are shown in \nFIG. 43\n. Detection was performed by a mouse-anti-hIL-12Rβ1 antibody followed by a PE-labeled polyclonal anti-mouse Ig antibody. The presence of h-IL12Rβ1 on the cells was measured by an increase in fluorescence intensity as compared to cells that were incubated with FACS buffer (PBS+10% FBS) followed by PE-labeled polyclonal anti-mouse Ig antibody. Fluorescence intensity is plotted on the X-axis, the number of events on the Y-axis. The FACS profile of unstained cells is also shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the stable transfection of the hIL12Rβ1 expressing Ba/F3 subclone 4D9 with hIL-23R, the same protocol as described above is used, with the only difference that 2 μg pcDNA3.1Neo-hIL23R instead of 2 μg pcDNA3.1Hygro-h-IL12Rβ1 is used. To select for stable transfected cells, 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen, Cat 10131-07) was added 48 h after transfection. After culturing a few passages on G418 selection, the pool of Ba/F3-hIL12Rβ1-hIL23R cells was depleted of WEHI-3B culture supernatant (containing the mIL-3 growth factor) and supplemented with 100 ng/ml recombinant hIL-23 (e-Bioscience, Cat 34-8239-85). The surviving cells were expanded and seeded out at 3 cells/well, 1 cell/well or 0.3 cells/well in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% P/S and 100 ng/ml recombinant hIL-23.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObtained single cell clones are expanded and screened for their hIL-23 responsiveness in a cell proliferation assay. Hereto, selected cell clones are washed three times in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep and subsequently incubated for 3 hours in hIL-23-free medium at a cell density of 3E06-5E06 cells/ml. After starvation, the cells are seeded at 7500 cells/well in 96-well flat bottom plates (Greiner bio-one, Cat 655180) in a volume of 100 μl hIL-23-free medium. Next, 100 μl of a hIL-23 dilution curve is added to the cells in such a manner that a ½ serial dilution starting from 500 ng/ml is obtained. After 72 hours of incubation, the cells are pulsed with 1 μCi [\n3\nH]-thymidine and incubated for an additional 24 h prior to freezing at −80° C. Cells were subsequently thawed and embedded on glass fiber membranes using a cell harvester (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Wellesley, Mass., USA). After several washings with water, filters were air-dried and counted using a γ-counter (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). The results are shown in \nFIG. 44\n, which is a graph showing the results obtained in this Example 26 for hIL-23 responsiveness of several Ba/F3-hIL12Rβ1-hIL23R single cell clones, in a cell proliferation assay after a 72 hour incubation with several concentrations hIL-23, as a readout using [methyl-3H]-thymidine incorporation [ON pulse]. Clone 5H10 was chosen for further characterization of IL-23 neutralizing Nanobody formats.\n\n\n \nExample 27 \n\n\nIL-12 Dependent PHA Blast Proliferation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nPHA blasts were derived by culturing PBMC in PHA (50 μg/ml) during 3 days and IL-2 (50 U/ml) during one day. These PHA blasts were stimulated with 1 pM hIL-12 pre-incubated with a dilution series of a p40+ Nanobody starting starting from 2000 nM up to 1 pM or control Nanobodies or antibodies. Cells were stimulated for 2 days and pulsed with 1 μCi/well \n3\nH-thymidine for the 6 last hours, hence proliferation was determined by measuring \n3\nH-thymidine incorporation by scintillation counting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Table B-15, most tested monovalent p40+ Nanobodies inhibit hIL-12 mediated proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE B-15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\npotency of p40+ Nanobodies to block the hIL-12 mediated proliferation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusing 1 pM hIL-12 (nc = no complete blocking).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNanobody\n\n\nInput hIL-12 (pM)\n\n\nIC 50 (pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBM01\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n   0.67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3B8 (SEQ ID NO: 2527)\n\n\n1\n\n\nnc 1505\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3C1 (SEQ ID NO: 2526)\n\n\n1\n\n\nhardly blocking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3G10 (SEQ ID NO: 2516)\n\n\n1\n\n\n194\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23E3 (SEQ ID NO: 2514)\n\n\n1\n\n\nnc 1734\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23H3 (SEQ ID NO: 2515)\n\n\n1\n\n\n174\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22D7 (SEQ ID NO: 2511)\n\n\n1\n\n\n116\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22E11 (SEQ ID NO: 2513)\n\n\n1\n\n\n159\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 28 \n\n\nConstruction, Production and Purification of Additional Bispecific/Biparatopic IL-23 p19 Nanobodies in Order to Investigate the Effect of Linker Length on Potency\n\n\n \n \n \nIn addition to the biparatopic constructs described in Example 13, some biparatopic constructs were made with shorter linkers to determine the optimal linker length. The individual building blocks were fused by a 9 Gly/Ser (GGGGSGGGS; SEQ ID NO: 2649) or a 20 Gly/Ser linker (GGGGSGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGS; SEQ ID NO: 2650) and cloned in the the pAX100 vector. The sequences of these biparatopic anti-p19 Nanobodies are shown in \nFIG. 30\n. The constructs were transformed in TG1 cells which were induced with 1 mM IPTG. Nanobodies were purified from the periplasmic extract using histidine trap affinity chromatography followed by desalting. Further purification and LPS removal was performed by gel filtration in the presence of 50 mM Octylβ-D-glucopyranoside (Sigma). Potency was evaluated in the splenocyte assay (see Example 27) and IC50's are listed in Tables B-16 and B-17. Results clearly show that shortening the linker length worsens the IC50, so the use of a linker with more than 20 amino acid residues in total (such as between 20 amino acid residues and 45 amino acid residues, for example a 35 Gly/Ser linker (GGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGS, SEQ ID NO: 2651) may be preferred.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE B-16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\npotencies in the splenocyte assay using 19 pM hIL-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNanobody\n\n\nhIL-23 IC50 (pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL119A3-35GS-81G2\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL119A3-9GS-\n81G2\n \n\n\n1988\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL-121A2-35GS-\n81G2\n \n\n\n94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL-121A2-9GS-81G2\n\n\n740\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE B-17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\npotencies in the splenocyte assay using 37 pM hIL-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNanobody\n\n\nhIL-23 IC50 (pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL-121A2-35GS-124C4\n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL-121A2-20GS-124C4\n\n\n1360\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL-121A2-9GS-124C4\n\n\n1715\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL-121A2-35GS-\n119G7\n \n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL-121A2-9GS-119G7\n\n\n4755\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 29 \n\n\nConstruction, Production and Characterization of HLE p19 Biparatopic Constructs with Extended Half-Life\n\n\n \n \n \nA) HLE1: Anti Human Serum Albumin Nanobody, ALB-1:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTrivalent biparatopic anti-p19 Nanobodies were constructed (e.g. P23IL-121A2-9GS-ALB1-9GS-124C4) which comprise of two building blocks corresponding to anti-p19 Nanobodies with in the middle a third building block corresponding to an anti Human Serum Albumin Nanobody building block (ALB-1; SEQ ID NO: 790). The individual building blocks are fused by a 9 Gly/Ser linker (GGGGSGGGS; SEQ ID NO: 792). To test if the positioning of the ALB1 Nanobody influences the potency, we also made a construct with ALB-1 at the C-terminus (e.g. P23IL119A3-35GS-81G2-9GS-ALB1), where the p19 Nanobodies are fused by a 35 Gly/Ser linker and the ALB1 is fused to this by a 9 Gly/Ser linker. The sequences of these trivalent bispecific anti-p19 Nanobodies are also shown in \nFIG. 30\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese constructs were cloned in pAX100, transformed to TG1 cells, expressed as c-myc, His6-tagged proteins and subsequently purified from the periplasmic extract by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and size exclusion chromotagraphy (SEC) in the presence of OGP to remove endotoxins. Two of such formatted Nanobodies were produced at larger scale to test in the acute in vivo mouse splenocyte assay (see example 36).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nP23IL0036=119A3-9GS-ALB1-9GS-81G2 was produced in \nE. coli \nand captured on MabCapture A (Poros), eluted using 100 mM Glycine pH 2.5 and immediately neutralized with 150 mM Tris pH8.8. The Nanobody was further polished on Poros 50HS (Poros), incubated, overnight at 4° C., with 50 mM OGP (Octylβ-D-glucopyranoside, Sigma) for LPS-removal, followed by SEC (Superdex75pg, GE Healthcare). P23IL0044=119A3(H37Y-M43K)-9GS-ALB1-9GS-81A12 was first recloned in pAX98 (which results in P23IL0049) and transformed \nPichia pastoris. \nIt was then purified starting from the clarified fermentation broth of the recombinant \nPichia pastoris, \nexpressing the Nanobody®. The fermentation broth was made particle free and concentrated in D-PBS via tangential flow filtration using respectively 0.22 μm and 10KMWCO HydroSart cassettes (Sartorius). The TFF retentate was further processed on MabCaptureA (Poros), after elution using 100 mM Glycine pH 2.5, fractions were neutralized with 150 mM Tris pH7.5 and dialysed to 1/10 PBS (SnakeSkin Pleated Dialysis Tubing 10,000 MWCO (Pierce, ref 68100)).

This occurred by ligating the coding sequence for P23IL119A3-35GS-81G2 into the pAX99 vector (which is pPICZalphaA vector containing the coding sequence for full length human serum albumin) resulting in P23IL0041=P23IL119A3-35GS-81G2-HSA. The plasmid was transformed into \nPichia pastoris \nstrain X33. It was then purified starting from the clarified fermentation broth of the recombinant \nPichia pastoris, \nexpressing the Nanobody. The clarified fermentation broth was made particle free via TFF (Hydrosart 0.22 μm cassette, Sartorius), followed by a concentration and diafiltration step to PBS using TFF (PESU-AL cassette Sartorius). The protein of interest was purified via a capture step on MabCaptureA (Poros) and further polishing steps using Poros50HQ and Superdex200 XK26/60.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC) HLE3: PEG\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to pegylate biparatopic Nanobodies, constructs were generated whereby the C-terminal tag was replaced by a GGGC-sequence. Therefore the coding sequences of P23IL119A3-35GS-81G2 and of P23IL-121A2-35GS-124C4 were cloned into vector. Constructs were expressed in TG1. Purification and pegylation was carried out as follows: Nanobody P23IL0038=P23IL119A3-35GS-81G2-GGGC was captured on MabSelect Xtra™ (GE Healthcare) and eluted using 100 mM Glycine pH 2.5. The collected sample was immediately neutralized using 150 mM Tris pH7.5, dialyzed against 1/10 PBS (SnakeSkin Pleated Dialysis Tubing 10,000 MWCO (Pierce, ref 68100)) and further polished via CEX (Poros 50HS, Poros) in the presence of 5 mM DTT. The fraction containing the Nanobody was concentrated via Vivaspin (5 kDa), DTT was added to a final concentration of 10 mM and incubated overnight. After removal of the excess of free DTT by SEC (Superdex 75pg XK16/60, GE healthcare), the reduced Nanobody was incubated overnight with a 5 molar excess of branched-mPEG40 (NOF, SunBright GL2-400MA). The PEGylated Nanobody was further purified on MacroCap SP (GE Healthcare) to remove the excess of non-reacting PEG40. Finally, the PEGylated Nanobody was treated overnight with 50 mM Octylβ-D-glucopyranoside (Sigma) for LPS-removal, and sized using Superdex75pg (GE Healthcare).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the generation of a second batch of pegylated P23IL0038, the Nanobody was captured on MabCapture A (POROS), eluted using 100 mM Glycine pH 2.5 and immediately neutralized using 150 mM Tris pH7.5.

The excess of DTT was removed by SEC (Superdex75pg, GE healthcare) and the reduced Nanobody was coupled to linear-mPEG40 (40 kDa methoxy poly (ethylene glycol) maleimido-propionamice, Dow Pharma). The PEGylated Nanobody was separated from the excess of mPEG40 and non-reacting Nanobody on MacroCap SP (GE healthcare).

The collected sample was immediately neutralized using 150 mM Tris pH7.5, and further polished via Anion exchange chromatography (Poros 50HQ, Poros). The fraction containing the Nanobody was reduced in the presence of 10 mM DTT. After an overnight incubation, the excess of free DTT was removed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200pg XK26/60, GE healthcare). The reduced Nanobody was incubated overnight with a 5 molar excess of branched-mPEG40 (NOF, SunBright GL2-400MA).

All three type of HLE are suitable since no FILE type leads to loss of potency, on the contrary, potency slightly improves. Also the position of the ALB1 Nanobody does not influence the potency. As the 9GS-ALB1-9GS moiety can efficiently replace the 35Gly/Ser-linker, anti-p19 biparatopic Nanobodies containing the P23IL37D5 building block, were immeadiately constructed, expressed and tested as HLE Nanobodies with ALB1 in the middle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, cross reactivity towards cynomolgus IL-23 was checked.

THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). Cells were maintained by subculturing every 2-3 days, keeping the cell density between 10\n4\n-10\n6 \ncells/mL. Secretion of IL-23 was induced by stimulating THP-1 cells with fixed \nStaphylococcus aureus \ncells (SAC; Pansorbin, Calbiochem, Merck). TRP-1 cells (2.5-5×10\n6 \ncells/mL) were stimulated for 20-24 hours with 0.05% SAC (37° \nC\n 5% CO\n2\n). Subsequently, the supernatant was harvested by centrifugation (200 g, 5 min, room temperature), filtered (0.22 μm PVDF, Millipore, Ireland) to remove remaining cells and debris and stored at −70° C. The concentration of human IL-23 was determined using the Human IL-23 (p19/p40) Elisa Ready-SET-Go! kit (eBioscience, San Diego, USA). Typically, 20-40 ng/mL human IL-23 was induced. The IL-23 containing supernatant was then used as a source of IL-23 in the mouse splenocyte assay to determine whether the Nanbodies are able to neutralize native human IL-23. A limited panel of the biparatopic Nanobodies were tested and all of them were capable to neutralize the native hIL-23 as indicated in Table B-20.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE B-20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\npotencies in splenocyte assay with 19 pM native hIL-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhIL-23 IC50\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNanobody/mAB\n\n\n(pM)\n\n\nassay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP23IL119A3-35GS-81G2\n\n\n76\n\n\n \nExpt\n 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP23IL119A3-35GS-81G2\n\n\n153\n\n\n \nExpt\n 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP23IL119A3(H37Y-M43K)-9GS-ALB1-9GS-\n\n\n9.3\n\n\n \nExpt\n 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n81A12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP23IL119A3(H37Y-M43K)-9GS-ALB1-9GS-\n\n\n20\n\n\n \nExpt\n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n81A12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBM01\n \n\n\n161\n\n\n \nExpt\n 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBM01\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n \nExpt\n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP23IL37D5-9GS-\nALB1\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n \nExpt\n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP23IL37D5-9GS-ALB1-9GS-\n20B11\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n \nExpt\n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP23IL-124C4-9GS-ALB1-9GS-\n37D5\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n \nExpt\n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 34\n\n\nELISA Potency Assay—Inhibition of IL-23 Interaction with IL-23R by Monovalent and Biparatopic Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \n96-well plates were coated overnight at 4° C. with anti-Fe Nanobody (6 μg/ml) and subsequently blocked with Superblock T20 (PBS) blocking buffer for 30 min. Different concentrations of monovalent and biparatopic Nanobodies were preincubated with 4 ng/ml hIL-23 for 30 min prior to a 30 min incubation with 300 ng/ml hIL-23R-Fc, after which the mixtures were transferred to the coated wells. Bound hIL-23 was detected for 30 min at room temperature with a 1/750 dilution of Biotinylated anti-human interleukin-12 (IL-12) p40/70 monoclonal antibody (eBiosciences, San Diego, USA) in PBS containing 10% Superblock T20 (PBS) blocking buffer, followed by a 30 min incubation at room temperature with 1/5000 horseradish peroxidase labeled streptavidin in PBS containing 10% Superblock T20 (PBS) blocking buffer. Visualisation was performed with enhanced soluble 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (esTMB) colouring reagent, after which the coloring reaction was stopped with 1N HCl. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm. As shown in \nFIG. 45\n, the p19+ (119A3; 37D5-ALB1) monovalent Nanobodies inhibit the interaction with IL-23R, while p19− (81A12, 81G2) monovalent Nanobodies do not. The biparatopic (230049, 23IL0041 and 23IL0038) Nanobodies have a significantly higher potency to inhibit the hIL-23-hIL-23R interaction than the monovalent ones (\nFIG. 46\n).

In all experiments, C57BL/6 mice have been injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with hIL-23. Exactly 31 hours after the only/first hIL-23 injection, the mice were bled and subsequently sacrificed. The spleens were removed and the splenocytes were isolated by homogenizing the spleens between frosted glass slides. The splenocytes were washed and resuspended in medium at a concentration of 106 cells/ml. The medium used was RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 2.5 mM HEPES and 0.00035% 2-mercapto ethanol. The cells were seeded at 200,000 cells/200 μl/well in a 96-well culture plate that was pre-coated with hamster anti-mouse CD3e antibody (5 μg/ml in PBS overnight at 4° C.). For each spleen, 6 wells were seeded. The 96-well plates were then incubated for 24 hours in a humidified CO2 incubator. A sandwich ELISA kit for mouse IL-22 (RMF222CK, Antigenix) was used to measure the amount of mIL-22 in each supernatant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are shown in \nFIG. 47\n, which is a graph showing the results obtained in this Example 35 for the inhibition of the mIL-22 synthesis in a mouse splenocyte assay upon administration of 3 microgram hIL-23 alone or in combination 23IL0036. Average mIL-22 synthesis is expressed as % change compared to \ngroup\n 4; and in \nFIG. 48\n, which is a graph showing the results obtained in this Example 35 for the inhibition of the mIL-22 synthesis in a mouse splenocyte assay upon administration of 23IL0036 or IRR007 via different routes of administration. Average mIL-22 synthesis is expressed as % change compared to the group which received hIL-23 only.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a first experiment, different groups of mice (n=4) were injected i.p. with PBS at t=0 h, 7 h and 31 h (group 1), 1×3 μg hIL-23 at t=0 h (group 2), 2×3 μg hIL-23 at t=0 h and 7 h (group 3) or 3×3 μg hIL-23 at t=0 h, 7 h and 23 h (\n \ngroups\n \n 4, 5 and 6). In \n \ngroups\n \n 5 and 6, 0.2 mg of the anti-IL-23p19 Nanobody 23IL0036 was additionally administered i.p. 2 hours before and 29 hours after the first hIL-23 injection, respectively. The results showed clearly that 2 or 3 injections of hIL-23 are needed to get a considerable induction of mIL-22 synthesis (\nFIG. 47\n). The results were normalized to the mean mIL-22 concentration of \ngroup\n 4, which was injected with 3×3 μg hIL-23. Based on these results, we decided to induce mIL-22 synthesis in subsequent experiments with three injections of 3 μg hIL-23 at t=0 h, 7 h and 23 h. In addition, we have demonstrated with this experiment that neutralization of hIL-23 is required, during the in vivo phase and not ex vivo as 23IL0036 can inhibit mIL-22 synthesis when administered 2 hours before the first hIL-23 injection and not when administered 2 hours before the isolation of the splenocytes (\nFIG. 47\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a second experiment, different groups of mice (n=4) were injected with PBS (group 1) or 3×3 μg hIL-23 (groups 2-6). In addition, groups 3-5 were injected with 0.2 mg 23IL0036, while \ngroup\n 6 was injected with the irrelevant Nanobody IRR007. The route of administration of the Nanobodies varied between the different groups. 23IL0036 and IRR007 were administered i.p. in \n \ngroups\n \n 3 and 6, respectively, while 23IL0036 was injected intraveneously (i.v.) in \ngroup\n 4 and subcutaneously (s.c.) in \ngroup\n 5. The results were normalized to the mean mIL-22 concentration of \ngroup\n 2, which was injected with hIL-23 only. There was no difference observed in inhibition of mIL-22 synthesis between the different routes of administration (\nFIG. 48\n). Due to the fact that hIL-23 is administered i.p. and we want to inhibit hIL-23 systemically and not in the intraperitoneal cavity, we decided to inject the Nanobodies s.c. in following experiments. The irrelevant Nanobody IRR007 had no effect on mIL-22 synthesis. In \nFIG. 48\n, the graph shows the results obtained in this Example 35 for the inhibition of the mIL-22 synthesis in a mouse splenocyte assay upon administration of 23IL0036 or IRR007 via different routes of administration. Average mIL-22 synthesis is expressed as % change compared to the group which received hIL-23 only.\n\n\n \nExample 36\n\n\nDose Range Analysis of the Wild Type Nanobodies 23IL0038, 23IL0041 and 23IL0049 in an Acute in vivo Mouse Splenocyte Model\n\n\n \n \n \nEfficacy of the wild type IL-23p19-neutralizing Nanobodies 23IL0038, 23IL0041 and 23IL0049 was demonstrated in the optimized acute in vivo mouse splenocyte model described in Example 35.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn four separate experiments, C57BL/6 mice were assigned to seven groups, each group consisting of four individuals. All mice from groups 2-7 were 3× injected i.p. with 3 μg hIL-23 at 3 different time points (t=0 h, 7 h and 23 h). The animals from \ngroup\n 1 received PBS instead of hIL-23 at the same time points. In each of the four experiments, 5 different doses of a specific Nanobody or positive control antibody were injected s.c. 2 hours before the first hIL-23 injection. The doses were chosen such that in all experiments the molar excess to each injection of 3 μg hIL-23 was the same for each of the three Nanobodies and positive control antibody BM01 (82-fold, 16-fold, 3.2-fold, 0.64-fold and 0.128-fold excess).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor each experiment; the results were normalized to the mean mIL-22 concentration of \ngroup\n 2, which was injected with hIL-23 only, and the normalized results are represented in \nFIGS. 49A\n to D, which are graphs showing the results obtained in this Example 36 for the inhibition of the mIL-22 synthesis in a mouse splenocyte assay upon administration of Nanobodies (\nFIG. 49A\n: 23IL0049; \nFIG. 49B\n: 23IL0041; \nFIG. 49C\n: 23IL0038) or positive control antibody (\nFIG. 49D\n: BM01). Average mIL-22 synthesis is expressed as % change compared to the group which received hIL-23 only.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll three Nanobodies were capable to neutralize hIL-23 in vivo. The Nanobodies 23IL0049 and 23IL0038 significantly blocked the synthesis of mIL-22 at the four highest doses. The lowest dose of these Nanobodies (0.128-fold excess) still had an effect but could not completely block mIL-22 production. For 23IL0041, the highest three doses blocked the synthesis of mIL-22 significantly, while inhibition in the two lowest dose groups was not complete. The efficacy of the Nanobodies was comparable with the efficacy of BM01.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hIL-23 concentration was measured in the final bleeding samples of the groups which were injected with hIL-23 only. The mean serum concentration of hIL-23, 8 hours after the last injection of 3 μg hIL-23, is 22.5 ng/ml.\n\n\n \nExample 37\n\n\nActivity of Nanobodies 23IL0050 and 23IL0054 in an Acute in vivo Mouse Splenocyte Model\n\n\n \n \n \nThe monovalent Nanobody 23IL0050 and the biparatopic Nanobody 23IL0054 have been tested in the acute in vivo mouse splenocyte model described in Example 35. C57BL/6 mice, seven groups with each four mice, were stimulated with 3 μg hIL-23 on t=0 h, 7 h and 23 h. The mice from \ngroup\n 1 received PBS instead of hIL-23 at the same time points. Both Nanobodies were injected s.c. 24 hours before the first hIL-23 injection. Three doses were analyzed and for each dose level the same molar excess with respect to each injection of 3 μg hIL-23 was used (16-fold, 3.2-fold or 0.64-fold excess).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are shown in \nFIG. 50\n, which is a graph showing the results obtained in this Example 37 for the inhibition of the mIL-22 synthesis in a mouse splenocyte assay upon administration of P23IL0054 and P23IL0050. The results were normalized to the mean mIL-22 concentration of \ngroup\n 2, which was injected with hIL-23 only.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth Nanobodies blocked synthesis of mIL-22 completely at the highest two dose levels. At the lowest dose, there was a clear difference between the monovalent and the biparatopic Nanobody. While the biparatopic 23IL0054 still inhibited mIL-22 synthesis at a 0.64-fold molar excess, mIL-22 concentrations were back to basal levels at the same molar dose of 23IL0050.\n\n\n \nExample 38\n\n\nHumanization of P23IL119A3, 81A12, 81G2, 37D5, 20B11 and 124C4 \n\n\n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequence of P23IL119A3 was blasted to the human germline V\nH \nsequence database using an in-house sequence query/alignment tool (see \nFIG. 51A\n). The human germlines V113-23 (also called DP-47) and JH5 showed the closest related sequence. 10 amino acid residues (indicated in black boxes in 119A3v16 in \nFIG. 51A\n) were substituted for humanization purposes and 1 (H37Y) for stability purposes to make P23IL119A3v16 (SEQ ID NO: 2578).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the humanization process of P23IL119A3, eighteen P23IL119A3 versions (P23IL119A3-BASIC and P23IL119A3v1 to v17) were constructed. P23IL119A3-BASIC contains 5 substitutions: A14P, H37Y, V78L, K84R and Q108L. In addition to these changes, additional substitutions have been introduced in the v1-v17 versions: V5L, M43K, Q44G, A49S, N58Y, A74S, Q75K, K76N, N82bS and Q93A. They were assembled from oligonucleotides using a PCR overlap extension method. The constructs were expressed in \nE. coli \nand purified by IMAC and desalting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll variants were were evaluated for their hIL-23binding capacity by surface plasmon resonance and for their neutralizing activity in alpha-screen and in the splenocyte assay as described in Examples 27 and 35. Also thermal stability of the variants was tested in a thermal shift assay using the Lightcylcer (Roche). In this assay the Nanobodies variants are incubated at different pH values in the presence of sypro orange and a temperature gradient is applied. When the Nanobodies start denaturing, sypro orange binds and the measured fluorescence increases suddenly, as such a melting temperature can be determined for a certain pH. The analysis occurred in two rounds, in a first round single mutations upon the basic variants were evaluated, and based upond these results, new variants were made with combined mutations. Results are summarized in Table B-22.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding kinetics of the second round variants are in depth analysed by Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore 3000). Human soluble IL-23 was covalently bound to CM5 sensor chips surface via amine coupling using EDC/NHS for activation and HCl for deactivation. Nanobody binding was assessed at one concentration (100 nM). Each Nanobody was injected for 4 minutes at a flow rate of 45 μl/min to allow binding to chip-bound antigen. Next, binding buffer without Nanobody was sent over the chip at the same flow rate to allow spontaneous dissociation of bound Nanobody. From the sensorgrams obtained for the different Nanobodies k\noff\n-values (k\nd\n) were calculated and are indicated in Table B-23. Association rate constants (k\non \nor k\na\n), and hence also K\nD \nvalues, were only indicative as only one concentration of Nanobody was used to fit the binding model.

Human germline VH3-23 (also called DP-47) and JH5 showed the closest related sequence. Six amino acid residues can be substituted for humanization purposes. The basic variant P23IL-124C4-BASIC was made and contains mutations E44G and V78L. In addition to these changes, additional substitutions have been introduced in the v1-v3versions: S71R, A74S and K105Q. They were assembled from oligonucleotides using a PCR overlap extension method. The constructs were expressed in \nE. coli \nand purified by IMAC and desalting.\n\n\n\n \nExample 39\n\n\nConstruction and Production of Different Formats of the Humanized Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nBiparatopic anti-p19 Nanobodies were constructed with three different types of HLE, using the building blocks P23IL119A3v16 or P23IL119A3v10, P23IL81G2v11 or P23IL81A12v4. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of the different formatted humanized Nanobodies with corresponding Nanobody IDs are represented in \nFIG. 32\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA) HLE1: Anti Human Serum Albumin Nanobody\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe trivalent humanized biparatopic molecules (P23IL0057 and P23IL0058/0064) have two building blocks corresponding to humanized anti-p19 Nanobodies with in the middle a third humanized Nanobody building block corresponding to an anti-Human Serum Albumin Nanobody building block. The individual building blocks are fused by a 9 Gly/Ser (GGGGSGGGS; SEQ ID NO: 792) linker. P23IL0057 consists of P23IL119A3v10 and P23IL84A12, whereas P23IL0058 consists P23IL119A3v16 and P23IL84A12. The constructs were transformed into TG1. After expression, these Nanobodies were purified from the periplasmic extract by capturing on Mabselect Extra and elution with 100 mM Glycine pH 2.5 followed by immediate neutralization with 1 M TrisHCl pH7.5. The sample was polished by cation exchange using a Mono S HR5/50 column (GE healthcare) and size exclusion on Superdex 75 10/300 GL (GE healthcare).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the production of large batches of these Nanobodies, the constructs were cloned in pAX89 (a modified pPICZalphaA vector, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and transformed in \nPichia pastoris \nstrain X33. Nanobody P23IL0064 was purified starting from the clarified fermentation broth of the recombinant \nPichia pastoris, \nexpressing the Nanobody Nanobody. The clarified fermentation broth was made particle free via TFF (Hydrosart 0.22 μm cassette, Sartorius), followed by a concentration and diafiltration step to PBS using TFF (\nHydrosart\n 10 kDa MWCO-cassette Sartorius). The Nanobody was captured on MabCapture A (Poros), followed by a buffer switch to 1/10 PBS via SEC (Sephadex G25 fine, GE healthcare) and a polish step on Poros 50HS (Poros). After treatment with 50 mM Octylβ-D-glucopyranoside (Sigma) for LPS-removal, the Nanobody was sized on a Superdex 75 pg (GE Healthcare).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB) HLE2: HSA:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HSA-fused humanized bipartopic Nanobody (P23IL0065) consists of two building blocks corresponding to humanized anti-p19 Nanobodies P23IL119A3v16 and P23IL81G2v11 fused by a 35 Gly/Ser linker. HSA was fused directly to the C-terminus of this construct. This occurred by ligating the coding sequence for P23IL119A3v16-35GS-81G2v11 into the pAX99 vector (which is a pPICZalphaA vector containing the coding sequence for full length human serum albumin). The plasmid was transformed into \nPichia pastoris \nstrain X33. The Nanobodywas purified starting from the clarified fermentation broth of the recombinant \nPichia pastoris, \nexpressing the Nanobody. The clarified fermentation broth was made particle free via TFF (Hydrosart 0.22 μm cassette, Sartorius), followed by a concentration and diafiltration step to PBS using TFF (PESU-AL cassette Sartorius). The protein of interest was captured on Blue Sepharose 6FF (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and further purified via polishing steps using Poros50HQ and Superdex200 XK26/60.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC) HLE3: PEG:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pegylated humanized biparatopic Nanobody P23IL0062/0063, consists of two building blocks corresponding to humanized anti-p19 Nanobodies P23IL119A3v16 and P23IL81G2v11 fused by a 35 Gly/Ser linker. A GGGC sequence was added at the C-terminus of the construct. This occurred by ligating the coding sequence of P23IL119A3v16-35GS-81G2v11 in the pAX97 vector (which is a pPICZalphaA vector containing this GGGC sequence) resulting in P23IL0063 or in the pAX101 vector resulting in P23IL0062. The pAX97 construct was transformed into \nPichia pastoris \nstrain X33, and the pAX101 construct in TG1. Purification and pegylation was carried out as follows: The Nanobody P23IL0063 was produced in the \nPichia pastoris. \nThe Nanobody was purified starting from the clarified fermentation broth by a capture step on MabCaptureA (Poros), and eluted using 100 mM glycine pH 2.7. After a buffer switch to 1/10 PBS and the protein of interest was further polished on Poros 50HS (Poros), followed by a reduction with 10 mM DTT. The excess of DTT was be removed by SEC (Superdex75pg, GE Healthcare), and the reduced Nanobody was coupled to linear-mPEG40 (40 kDa methoxy poly (ethylene glycol) maleimido-propionamice, Dow Pharma). The PEGylated Nanobody was further purified on MacroCap SP (GE healthcare) to remove the excess of non-reacting PEG40. Finally, the PEGylated Nanobody was treated with 50 mM Octylβ-D-glucopyranoside (Sigma) for LPS-removal, followed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex75pg, GE Healthcare).\n\n\n \nExample 40\n\n\nCharacterization of the Formatted Humanized Anti-p19 Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nA) Potency in Mouse Splenocyte Assays\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe humanised HLE Nanobodies were tested and compared to the WT HLE Nanobodies in the splenocyte assay using hIL-23 and cynomolgus IL-23 as described in Example 27.

All mice from groups 2-8 were three times injected IP with 3 μg hIL-23 at three different time points (t=0 h, 7 h and 23 h). The animals from \ngroup\n 1 received PBS instead of hIL-23 at the same time points. The Nanobodies or positive control antibody were injected s.c. 24 hours before the first hIL-23 injection. Spread over the two experiments, Nanobodies 23IL0063, 231L0064 and 23IL0065 were administered at three different doses. The doses were chosen such that the molar excess to each injection of 3 μg hIL-23 was the same for each of the three Nanobodies (16-fold, 3.2-fold or 0.64-fold excess). As positive control, BM01 was used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results were normalized to the mean mIL-22 concentration of \ngroup\n 2, which was injected with hIL-23 only, and are represented in \nFIGS. 54 and 55\n. All three Nanobodies were capable of neutralizing hIL-23 and significantly blocked the synthesis of mIL-22 at the two highest doses. The lowest dose of the Nanobodies (0.64-fold excess) still had an effect but could not completely block mIL-22 production. The efficacy of the Nanobodies was comparable with the efficacy of BM01.\n\n\n \nExample 42\n\n\nPharmacokinetics of Biparatopic Wild Type Nanobodies in Mouse\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine the pharmacokinetic properties of some representative biparatopic wild-type Nanobodies, seventy-two male Balb/c mice were assigned to six groups, each group consisting of twelve mice.

Wells were aspirated and blocked for 30 minutes at room temperature with SuperBlock®T20 PBS (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) (300 μL/well). After 3 washing steps with PBS-0.05% Tween20, 100 μL/well biotinylated hIL23 (0.2 μg/mL in PBS-0.1% casein-0.05% Tween20; Carrier-Free Recombinant Human IL-23 (p19/p40) eBioScience, San Diego, USA) was captured by incubating for 1 hour at RT while shaking at 600 rpm. Biotinylated hIL23 was prepared with EZ-Link® Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce, Rockford, Ill., USA) and free biotin was removed using Zeba desalt spin columns (Pierce, Rockford, Ill., USA). After this incubation step, wells were washed 3 times with PBS-0.05% Tween20. All preparations for standards, QC samples and test samples were done in a non-coated (polypropylene) plate. Predilutions of standards and QC samples were prepared in 100% mouse serum. To prepare standards and QC samples, a 1/10 dilution of the predilutions was made in PBS-0.1% casein-0.05% Tween20 (final concentration of mouse serum is 10%). Test samples were diluted 1/10 in PBS-0.1% casein-0.05% Tween20 and where needed further diluted in PBS-0.1% casein-0.05% Tween20 with 10% Mouse Serum (final concentration of mouse serum is 10%). Standards, QC samples and test samples were transferred to the coated plate and incubated for 2 hours at RT while shaking at 600 rpm.

Visualization was performed by incubation with 100 μL/well enhanced soluble 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (esTMB, SDT, Brussels, Belgium). After 10 min, the colouring reaction was stopped with 100 μL/well 1N HCl. The absorbance was determined at 450 nm after a 10 seconds shake in the Tecan ELISA reader, and corrected for background absorbance at 620 nm.

Model and Weighting discrimination was performed by visual inspection of the fit, and evaluation of minimum AIC (Akaike's Information Criterion), SBC (Schwarz Bayesian Criterion), WRSS (Weighted Residual Sum of Squares) and CV % (Coefficient of variation of the parameters).

Profiles after subcutaneous administration of 23IL0049, 23IL0041 and 23IL0038 declined in a monophasic manner after the maximum concentrations were reached. Expected PK parameters were obtained for 23IL0049 and 23IL0038 after both intravenous and subcutaneous administration, with slightly higher terminal half-lives after both intravenous and subcutaneous administration and higher bioavailability for 23IL0049.

This model is based on studies described by Wrone-Smith and Nickoloff (1996). It is the only available model in which the effects of drugs on the development of a human psoriatic lesion can be monitored in vivo. Briefly, non-lesional skin from psoriasis patients are transplanted onto immunodeficient mice and, after acceptance of the grafts, autologous pre-activated PBMCs are intradermally injected triggering the psoriatic process. Mice are treated intraperitoneally twice weekly. After three weeks of treatment, mice are sacrificed and the human skin transplants are evaluated histologically, with regard to epidermal hyperplasia (HE-staining) as well as proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes (e.g. Ki-67 staining).\n\n\n \nExample 46\n\n\nAnti-p40 Biparatopic Nanobodies and Anti-p19-Anti-p40 Bispecific Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \nA) Construction of Anti-p40 Biparatopic Nanobodies and Anti-p19 Anti-p40 Bispecific Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the data from the epitope grouping experiment with the p40 Nanobodies (Example 26), the following Nanobodies were combined in an anti-p40 biparatopic format: P23IL3C1 with P23IL3B8 or P23IL3G10, P23IL3B8 with P23IL80D10 or P23IL84G12, P23IL-23E3 with P23IL81A1 or P23IL84G1, P23IL-22D7 with P23IL80D10 or P23IL-22D10 and P23IL-22E11 with P23IL80D10 or P23IL84G12 or in an anti-p19 and anti-p40 bispecific format: P23IL119A3 with P23IL3C1, P23IL3B8 or P23IL-23E3 and P23IL37D5 with P23IL-22D7. The influence of the formatting, the positioning of the Nanobodies and the linker lengths on the potency was investigated.

Results are shown in Table B-37. For the bispecific Nanobodies, all performed well on hIL-23, but P23IL0202 and 0204 performed less on cynomolgus IL-23. For the biparatopic Nanobodies P23IL0406 and 0407 have a bad potency when using cynomolgus IL-23, so their cross-reactivity is not optimal.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE B-37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\npotency of anti-p40 biparatopic Nanobodies and anti-p19 anti-\n\n\n\n\n\n\np40 bispecific Nanobodies in the mouse splenocyte assay using\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19 pM hIL-23 and 3.8 pM cynomolgus IL-23 (cIL-23)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhIL-23\n\n\ncIL-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC50\n\n\nIC50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(pM)\n\n\n(pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBispecific Nanobody/mAB\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBM01\n\n\n5.2\n\n\n23.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0200\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0201\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0202\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n34.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0203\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0204\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n23.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0205\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBiparatopic Nanobody/mAB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBM01\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n29.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0400\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0401\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n5.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0402\n\n\n11.0\n\n\n8.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0403\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0404\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0405\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n6.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0406\n\n\n11.0\n\n\n628.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0407\n\n\n5.6\n\n\n883.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0408\n\n\n4.6\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP23IL0409\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n6.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC) Potency of Anti-p40 Biparatopic Nanobodies and Anti-p19 Anti-p40 Bispecific Nanobodies in the BAF3 Proliferation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the results from the mouse splenocyte assay, a selected set of anti-p40 biparatopic and anti-p19 anti-p40 bispecific HLE Nanobodies with best potencies were tested and compared with the mAB BM01 in the BA/F3 proliferation assay using 76 pM hIL-23 as described in Example 27.

Shortly PHA blasts were derived by culturing PBMC in PHA (50 μg/ml) during 3 days and IL-2 (50 U/ml) during one day. These PHA blasts are stimulated with hIL-12 pre-incubated with a dilution series of a Nanobody test items (for instance starting starting from 60 nM u to 0.15 pM or p19-p40 bispecific Nanobodies and \np\n 40 monovalent Nanobodies starting from 2000 nM to 1 pM or control Nanobodies or antibodies. Cells are stimulated for 2 days and pulsed with 1 μCi/well \n3\nH-thymidine for the 6 last hours, hence proliferation was determined by measuring \n3\nH-thymidine incorporation by scintillation counting.\n\n\n \nExample 47\n\n\nActivity of Nanobodies 23IL400 and 23IL403 in an Acute in vivo Mouse Splenocyte Model\n\n\n \n \n \nThe bivalent p40+/p40+ Nanobodies 23IL400 (3B8-ALB1-3C1, SEQ ID NO: 2630) and 23IL403 (3G10-ALB1-3C1, SEQ ID NO: 2633) have been analyzed in the acute in vivo mouse splenocyte model described in Example 35. Seven groups with each four C57BL/6 mice were stimulated with 3 μg hIL-23 on t=0 h, 7 h and 23 h. The mice from \ngroup\n 1 received PBS instead of hIL-23 at the same time points. The positive control antibody (BM01; \ngroups\n 3 and 4), 23IL400 (\ngroups\n 5 and 6) and 23IL403 (\ngroups\n 7 and 8) were injected s.c. 24 hours before the first hIL-23 injection. Two doses were analyzed and for both doses was the molar excess to each injection of 3 μg hIL-23 the same for all three test items (3.2-fold excess and 0.64-fold excess).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are shown in \nFIG. 51\n, which is a graph showing the results obtained in Example 38 for the inhibition of the mIL-22 synthesis in a mouse splenocyte assay upon administration of BM01, P23IL0400 and P23IL0403 at two different dose levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results were normalized to the mean mIL-22 concentration of \ngroup\n 2, which was injected with hIL-23 only. Both Nanobodies blocked synthesis of mIL-22 completely at the highest dose. At the lowest dose, there was a clear difference between 23IL400 and 23IL403. While 23IL400 still inhibited mIL-22 synthesis significantly at a 0.64-fold molar excess, mIL-22 concentrations were almost back to basal levels at the same molar dose of 23IL403. The efficacy of 23IL400 is comparable with BM01."
