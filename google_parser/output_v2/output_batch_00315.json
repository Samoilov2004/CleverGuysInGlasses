The government may have certain rights in the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to androgen receptor targeting agents (ARTA), which demonstrate androgenic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal ligand for the androgen receptor. The agents define a new subclass of compounds, which are selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) useful for a) male contraception; b) treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM); c) treatment of conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Female (ADIF); d) treatment and/or prevention of acute and/or chronic muscular wasting conditions; e) preventing and/or treating dry eye conditions; f) oral androgen replacement therapy; and/or g) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe androgen receptor (\"AR\") is a ligand-activated transcriptional regulatory protein that mediates induction of male sexual development and function through its activity with endogenous androgens. Androgens are generally known as the male sex hormones. The androgenic hormones are steroids which are produced in the body by the testes and the cortex of the adrenal gland or can be synthesized in the laboratory. Androgenic steroids play an important role in many physiologic processes, including the development and maintenance of male sexual characteristics such as muscle and bone mass, prostate growth, spermatogenesis, and the male hair pattern (\nMatsumoto, Endocrinol. Met Clin. N. Am. 23:857-75 (1994\n)). The endogenous steroidal androgens include testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (\"DHT\"). Testosterone is the principal steroid secreted by the testes and is the primary circulating androgen found in the plasma of males. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase in many peripheral tissues. DHT is thus thought to serve as the intracellular mediator for most androgen actions (\nZhou, et al., Molec. Endocrinol. 9:208-18 (1995\n)). Other steroidal androgens include esters of testosterone, such as the cypionate, propionate, phenylpropionate, cyclopentylpropionate, isocarporate, enanthate, and decanoate esters, and other synthetic androgens such as 7-Methyl-Nortestosterone (\"MENT') and its acetate ester (\nSundaram et al., \"\n7 Alpha-Methyl-Nortestosterone(MENT): The Optimal Androgen For Male Contraception,\n\" Ann. Med., 25:199-205 (1993\n) (\"Sundaram\")). Because the AR is involved in male sexual development and function, the AR is a likely target for effecting male contraception or other forms of hormone replacement therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWorldwide population growth and social awareness of family planning have stimulated a great deal of research in contraception. Contraception is a difficult subject under any circumstance. It is fraught with cultural and social stigma, religious implications, and, most certainly, significant health concerns. This situation is only exacerbated when the subject focuses on male contraception. Despite the availability of suitable contraceptive devices, historically, society has looked to women to be responsible for contraceptive decisions and their consequences. Although concern over sexually transmitted diseases has made men more aware of the need to develop safe and responsible sexual habits, women still often bear the brunt of contraceptive choice. Women have a number of choices, from temporary mechanical devices such as sponges and diaphragms to temporary chemical devices such as spermicides. Women also have at their disposal more permanent options, such as physical devices including IUDs and cervical caps as well as more permanent chemical treatments such as birth control pills and subcutaneous implants. However, to date, the only options available for men include the use of condoms and vasectomy. Condom use, however is not favored by many men because of the reduced sexual sensitivity, the interruption in sexual spontaneity, and the significant possibility of pregnancy caused by breakage or misuse. Vasectomies are also not favored. If more convenient methods of birth control were available to men, particularly long-term methods which require no preparative activity immediately prior to a sexual act, such methods could significantly increase the likelihood that men would take more responsibility for contraception.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the male sex steroids (e.g., testosterone and its derivatives) has shown particular promise in this regard due to the combined gonadotropin-suppressing and androgen-substituting properties of these compounds (\nSteinberger et al., \"Effect of Chronic Administration of Testosterone Enanthate on Sperm Production and Plasma Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone Levels: A Preliminary Evaluation of a Possible Male Contraceptive, Fertility and Sterility 28:1320-28 (1977\n)). Chronic administration of high doses of testosterone completely abolishes sperm production (azoospermia) or reduces it to a very low level (oligospermia). The degree of spermatogenic suppression necessary to produce infertility is not precisely known. However, a recent report by the World Health Organization showed that weekly intramuscular injections of testosterone enanthate result in azoospermia or severe oligospermia (i.e., less than 3 million sperm per ml) and infertility in 98% of men receiving therapy (World Health Organization Task Force on Methods And Regulation of Male Fertility, \"\nContraceptive Efficacy of Testosterone-Induced Azoospermia and Oligospermia in Normal Men,\" Fertility and Sterility 65:821-29 (1996\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of testosterone esters have been developed which are more slowly absorbed after intramuscular injection and thus result in greater androgenic effect. Testosterone enanthate is the most widely used of these esters. While testosterone enanthate has been valuable in terms of establishing the feasibility of hormonal agents for male contraception, it has several drawbacks, including the need for weekly injections and the presence of supraphysiologic peak levels of testosterone immediately following intramuscular injection (\nWu, \"\nEffects of Testosterone Enanthate in Normal Men: Experience From a Multicenter Contraceptive Efficacy Study,\n\" Fertility and Sterility 65:626-36 (1996\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSteroidal ligands which bind the AR and act as androgens (e.g. testosterone enanthate) or as antiandrogens (e.g. cyproterone acetate) have been known for many years and are used clinically (Wu 1988). Although nonsteroidal antiandrogens are in clinical use for hormone-dependent prostate cancer, nonsteroidal androgens have not been reported. For this reason, research on male contraceptives has focused solely on steroidal compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProstate cancer is one of the most frequently occurring cancers among men in the United States, with hundreds of thousands of new cases diagnosed each year. Unfortunately, over sixty percent of newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer are found to be pathologically advanced, with no cure and a dismal prognosis. One approach to this problem is to find prostate cancer earlier through screening programs and thereby reduce the number of advanced prostate cancer patients. Another strategy, however, is to develop drugs to prevent prostate cancer. One third of all men over 50 years of age have a latent form of prostate cancer that may be activated into the life-threatening clinical prostate cancer form. The frequency of latent prostatic tumors has been shown to increase substantially with each decade of life from the 50s (5.3-14%) to the 90s (40-80%). The number of people with latent prostate cancer is the same across all cultures, ethnic groups, and races, yet the frequency of clinically aggressive cancer is markedly different. This suggests that environmental factors may play a role in activating latent prostate cancer. Thus, the development of treatment and preventative strategies against prostate cancer may have the greatest overall impact both medically and economically against prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOsteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease, characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. In the U.S., the condition affects more than 25 million people and causes more than 1.3 million fractures each year, including 500,000 spine, 250,000 hip and 240,000 wrist fractures annually. Hip fractures are the most serious consequence of osteoporosis, with 5-20% of patients dying within one year, and over 50% of survivors being incapacitated. The elderly are at greatest risk of osteoporosis, and the problem is therefore predicted to increase significantly with the aging of the population. Worldwide fracture incidence is forecasted to increase three-fold over the next 60 years, and one study estimated that there will be 4.5 million hip fractures worldwide in 2050.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWomen are at greater risk of osteoporosis than men. Women experience a sharp acceleration of bone loss during the five years following menopause. Other factors that increase the risk include smoking, alcohol abuse, a sedentary lifestyle and low calcium intake. However, osteoporosis also occurs frequently in males. It is well established that the bone mineral density of males decrease with age. Decreased amounts of bone mineral content and density correlates with decreased bone strength, and predisposes to fracture. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects of sex-hormones in non-reproductive tissues are only beginning to be understood, but it is clear that physiologic concentrations of androgens and estrogens play an important role in maintaining bone homeostasis throughout the life-cycle. Consequently, when androgen or estrogen deprivation occurs there is a resultant increase in the rate of bone remodeling that tilts the balance of resorption and formation to the favor of resorption that contributes to the overall loss of bone mass. In males, the natural decline in sex-hormones at maturity (direct decline in androgens as well as lower levels of estrogens derived from peripheral aromatization of androgens) is associated with the frailty of bones. This effect is also observed in males who have been castrated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAndrogen decline in the aging male (ADAM) refers to a progressive decrease in androgen production, common in males after middle age. The syndrome is characterized by alterations in the physical and intellectual domains that correlate with and can be corrected by manipulation of the androgen milieu. ADAM is characterized biochemically by a decrease not only in serum androgen, but also in other hormones, such as growth hormone, melatonin and dehydroepiandrosterone. Clinical manifestations include fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, benign prostate hyperplasia, anemia, alterations in mood and cognition and prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAndrogen Deficiency in Female (ADIF) refers to a variety of hormone-related conditions including, common in females after middle agest. The syndrome is characterized by sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, anemia, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity, endometriosis, breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscle wasting refers to the progressive loss of muscle mass and/or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles, including the skeletal or voluntary muscles, which control movement, cardiac muscles, which control the heart (cardiomyopathics), and smooth muscles. Chronic muscle wasting is a chronic condition (i.e. persisting over a long period of time) characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass, weakening and degeneration of muscle. The loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein breakdown or degradation. Protein degradation occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation, an unusually low rate of protein synthesis, or a combination of both. Protein degradation, whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis, leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting. Muscle wasting is associated with chronic, neurological, genetic or infectious pathologies, diseases, illnesses or conditions. These include Muscular Dystrophies such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Myotonic Dystrophy; Muscle Atrophies such as Post-Polio Muscle Atrophy (PPMA); Cachexias such as Cardiac Cachexia, AIDS Cachexia and Cancer Cachexia, malnutrition, Leprosy, Diabetes, Renal Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cancer, end stage Renal failure, Emphysema, Osteomalacia, HIV Infection, AIDS, and Cardiomyopathy, In addition, other circumstances and conditions are linked to and can cause muscle wasting. These include chronic lower back pain, advanced age, central nervous system (CNS) injury, peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury, chemical injury, central nervous system (CNS) damage, peripheral nerve damage, spinal cord damage, chemical damage, burns, disuse deconditioning that occurs when a limb is immobilized, long term hospitalization due to illness or injury, and alcoholism. Muscle wasting, if left unabated, can have dire health consequences. For example, the changes that occur during muscle wasting can lead to a weakened physical state that is detrimental to an individual's health, resulting in increased susceptibility to infection, poor performance status and susceptibility to injury.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNew innovative approaches are urgently needed at both the basic science and clinical levels to develop compounds which are useful for a) male contraception; b) treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM), such as fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, anemia, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, benign prostate hyperplasia, alterations in mood and cognition and prostate cancer; c) treatment of conditions associated with ADIF, such as sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity, endometriosis, breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer; d) treatment and/or prevention of acute and/or chronic muscular wasting conditions; e) preventing and/or treating dry eye conditions; f) oral androgen replacement therapy; and/or g) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, this invention provides androgen receptor targeting agents (ARTA).

Further, appropriately substituted compounds are effective to treat prostate cancer and useful for imaging of prostate cancer. The compounds demonstrate an in-vivo androgenic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal ligand for the androgen receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs contemplated herein, the appropriately substituted compounds of the present invention are useful for a) male contraception; b) treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM), such as fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, anemia, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia,osteoporosis, benign prostate hyperplasia, alterations in mood and cognition and prostate cancer; c) treatment of conditions associated with ADIF, such as sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity, endometriosis, breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer; d) treatment and/or prevention of acute and/or chronic muscular wasting conditions; e) preventing and/or treating dry eye conditions; f) oral androgen replacement therapy; and/or g) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, receptors for extracellular signaling molecules are collectively referred to as \"cell signaling receptors\". Many cell signaling receptors are transmembrane proteins on a cell surface; when they bind an extracellular signaling molecule (i.e., a ligand), they become activated so as to generate a cascade of intracellular signals that alter the behavior of the cell. In contrast, in some cases, the receptors are inside the cell and the signaling ligand has to enter the cell to activate them; these signaling molecules therefore must be sufficiently small and hydrophobic to diffuse across the plasma membrane of the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSteroid hormones are one example of small hydrophobic molecules that diffuse directly across the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to intracellular cell signaling receptors. These receptors are structurally related and constitute the intracellular receptor superfamily (or steroid-hormone receptor superfamily). Steroid hormone receptors include progesterone receptors, estrogen receptors, androgen receptors, glueocorticoid receptors, and mineralocorticoid receptors. The present invention is particularly directed to androgen receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to ligand binding to the receptors, the receptors can be blocked to prevent ligand binding. When a substance binds to a receptor, the three-dimensional structure of the substance fits into a space created by the three-dimensional structure of the receptor in a ball and socket configuration. The better the ball fits into the socket, the more tightly it is held. This phenomenon is called affinity. If the affinity of a substance is greater than the original hormone, it will compete with the hormone and bind the binding site more-frequently. Once bound, signals may be sent through the receptor into the cells, causing the cell to respond in some fashion. This is called activation. On activation, the activated receptor then directly regulates the transcription of specific genes. But the substance and the receptor may have certain attributes, other than affinity, in order to activate the cell. Chemical bonds between atoms of the substance and the atoms of the receptors may form. In some cases, this leads to a change in the configuration of the receptor, which is enough to begin the activation process (called signal transduction).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the present invention is directed to compounds which are agonist compounds. A receptor agonist is a substance which binds receptors and activates them. Thus, in one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention are useful in binding to and activating steroidal hormone receptors. In one embodiment, the agonist compound of the present invention is an agonist which binds the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the compound has high affinity for the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the agonist compound also has anabolic activity. In another embodiment, the present invention provides selective androgen modulator compounds which have agonistic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal compound for the androgen receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention is directed to selective androgen receptor modulator compounds which are antagonist compounds. A receptor antagonist is a substance which binds receptors and inactivates them. Thus, in one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention are useful in binding to and inactivating steroidal hormone receptors. In one embodiment, the antagonist compound of the present invention is an antagonist which binds the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the compound has high affinity for the androgen receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the compounds of the present invention can be classified as partial AR agonist/antagonists. The compounds are AR agonists in some tissues, to cause increased transcription of AR-responsive genes (e.g. muscle anabolic effect). In other tissues, these compounds serve as inhibitors at the AR to prevent agonistic effects of the native androgens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays to determine whether the compounds of the present invention are AR agonists or antagonists are well known to a person skilled in the art For example, AR agonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the compounds to maintain and/or stimulate the growth of AR containing tissue such as prostate and seminal vesicles, as measured by weight. AR antagonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the compounds to inhibit the growth of AR containing tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention bind either reversibly or irreversibly to an androgen receptor. In one embodiment, the androgen receptor is an androgen receptor of a mammal. In another embodiment, the androgen receptor is an androgen receptor of a human. In one embodiment, the compounds bind reversibly to the androgen receptor of a mammal, for example a human. Reversible binding of a compound to a receptor means that a compound can detach from the receptor after binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the compounds bind irreversibly to the androgen receptor of a mammal, for example a human. Thus, in one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention may contain a functional group (e.g. affinity label) that allows alkylation of the androgen receptor (i.e. covalent bond formation). Thus, in this case, the compounds are alkylating agents which bind irreversibly to the receptor and, accordingly, cannot be displaced by a steroid, such as the endogenous ligands DHT and testosterone. An \"alkylating agent\" is defined herein as an agent which alkylates (forms a covalent bond) with a cellular component, such as DNA, RNA or enzyme. It is a highly reactive chemical that introduces alkyl radicals into biologically active molecules and thereby prevents their proper functioning. The alkylating moiety is an electrophilic group that interacts with nucleophilic moieties in cellular components.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one embodiment of the present invention, the compounds of the present invention are useful for binding to an androgen receptor by contacting the receptor with a compound and/or its optical isomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate or N-oxide or any combination thereof, under conditions effective to cause the compound to bind the androgen receptor. The binding of the compounds to the androgen receptor enables the compounds of the present invention to be useful as a male contraceptive and in a number of hormone therapies. The agonist compounds bind to and activate the androgen receptor. The antagonist compounds bind to and inactivate the androgen receptor. Binding of the agonist or antagonist compounds is either reversible or irreversible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for suppressing spermatogenesis in a subject is by contacting an androgen receptor of the subject with a compound of the present invention and/or its optical isomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate or N-oxide or any combination thereof, in an amount effective to bind the compound to the androgen receptor and suppress spermatogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for contraception in a male subject comprises the step of administering to the subject a compound of the present invention and/or its optical isomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate or N-oxide or any combination thereof, in an amount effective to suppress sperm production in the subject, thereby effecting contraception in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for hormonal therapy in a patient (i.e., one suffering from an androgen-dependent condition) includes contacting an androgen receptor of a patient with a compound of the present invention and/or its optical isomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate or N-oxide or any combination thereof, in an amount effective to bind the compound to the androgen receptor and effect a change in an androgen-dependent condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for hormone replacement therapy in a patient (i.e., one suffering from an androgen- dependent condition) includes contacting an androgen receptor of a patient with a compound of the present invention and/or its isomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate or N-oxide or any combination thereof, in an amount effective to bind the compound to the androgen receptor and effect a change in an androgen-dependent condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for treating a subject having a hormone related condition includes administering to the subject a compound of the present invention and/or its optical isomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate or N-oxide or any combination thereof, in an amount effective to bind the compound to the androgen receptor and effect a change in an androgen-dependent condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAndrogen- dependent conditions which may be treated include those conditions which are associated with aging, such as hypogonadism, sarcopenia, erythropoiesis, osteoporosis, and any other conditions later determined to be dependent upon low androgen (e.g., testosterone) levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for treating a subject suffering from prostate cancer comprises the step of administering to the subject a compound of the present invention and/or its optical isomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate or N-oxide or any combination thereof, in an amount effective to treat prostate cancer in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for preventing prostate cancer in a subject comprises the step of administering to the subject a compound of the present invention and/or its\n\noptical isomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate or N-oxide or any combination thereof, in an amount effective to treat prevent prostate cancer in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for delaying the progression of prostate cancer in a subject suffering from prostate cancer comprises the step of administering to the subject a compound of the present invention and/or its optical isomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate or N-oxide or any combination thereof, in an amount effective to delay the progression of prostate cancer in the subject\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for preventing the recurrence of prostate cancer in a subject suffering from prostate cancer comprises the step of administering to the subject a compound of the present invention and/or its optical isomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate or N-oxide or any combination thereof, in an amount effective to prevent the recurrence of prostate cancer in the subject\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for treating the recurrence of prostate cancer in a subject suffering from prostate cancer comprises the step of administering to the subject a compound of the present invention and/or its optical isomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate or N-oxide or any combination thereof, in an amount effective to treat the recurrence of prostate cancer in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, stimulation of the Androgen Receptor stimulates the production of tears, and thus the compounds of the present invention may be used to treat dry eye conditions.

BPH occurs in over 75% of men over 50 years of age, reaching 88% prevalence by the ninth decade. BPH frequently results in a gradual squeezing of the portion of the urethra which traverses the prostate (prostatic urethra). This causes patients to experience a frequent urge to urinate because of incomplete emptying of the bladder and urgency of urination.

Anemia is caused by four basic factors: a) hemorrhage (bleeding); b) hemolysis (excessive destruction of red blood cells); c) underproduction of red blood cells; and d) not enough normal hemoglobin. There are many forms of anemia, including aplastic anemia, benzene poisoning, Fanconi anemia, hemolytic disease of the newborn, hereditary spherocytosis, iron deficiency anemia, osteopetrosis, pernicious anemia, sickle cell disease, thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and a variety of bone marrow diseases. As contemplated herein, the compounds of the present invention are useful in preventing and/or treating any one or more of the above-listed forms of anemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Obesity\" refers to the state of being well above one's normal weight. Traditionally, a person is considered to be obese if they are more than 20 percent over their ideal weight. Obesity has been more precisely defined by the National Institute of Health (NIH) as a Body to Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or above. Obesity is often multifactorial, based on both genetic and behavioral factors. Overweight due to obesity is a significant contributor to health problems. It increases the risk of developing a number of diseases including: Type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes; high blood pressure (hypertension); stroke (cerebrovascular accident or CVA); heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI); heart failure (congestive heart failure); cancer (certain forms such as cancer of the prostate and cancer of the colon and rectum); gallstones and gallbladder disease (cholecystitis); Gout and gouty arthritis; osteoarthritis (degenerative arthritis) of the knees, hips, and the lower back; sleep apnea (failure to breath normally during sleep, lowering blood oxygen); and Pickwickian syndrome (obesity, red face, underventilation and drowsiness). As contemplated herein, the term \"obesity\" includes any one of the above-listed obesity-related conditions and diseases. Thus the compounds of the present invention are useful in preventing and/or treating obesity and any one or more of the above-listed obesity-related conditions and diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Prostate cancer\" is one of the most frequently occurring cancers among men in the United States, with hundreds of thousands of new cases diagnosed each year. -Over sixty percent of newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer are found to be pathologically advanced, with no cure and a dismal prognosis. One third of all men over 50 years of age have a latent form of prostate cancer that may be activated into the life-threatening clinical prostate cancer form. The frequency of latent prostatic tumors has been shown to increase substantially with each decade of life from the 50s (5.3-14%) to the 90s (40-80%). The number of people with latent prostate cancer is the same across all cultures, ethnic groups, and races, yet the frequency of clinically aggressive cancer is markedly different. This suggests that environmental factors may play a role in activating latent prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods may comprise administering the compound as the sole active ingredient. However, also, methods for hormone therapy, for treating prostate cancer, for delaying the progression of prostate cancer, and for preventing and/or treating the recurrence of prostate cancer, may comprise administering the compounds in combination with one or more therapeutic agents. These agents include, but are not limited to: LHRH analogs, reversible antiandrogens, antiestrogens, anticancer drugs, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, aromatase inhibitors, progestins, agents acting through other nuclear hormone receptors, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM), progesterone, estrogen, PDE5 inhibitors, apomorphine, bisphosphonate, and one or more additional SARMS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the methods may comprise administering the compound, in combination with an LHRH analogy; administering the compound, in combination with a reversible antiandrogen; administering the compound, in combination with an antiestrogen; administering the compound, in combination with an anticancer drug; administering the compound, in combination with a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor; administering the compound, in combination with an aromatase inhibitor; administering the compound, in combination with a progestin; administering the compound, in combination with an agent acting through other nuclear hormone receptors; administering the compound, in combination with a selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM); administering the compound, in combination with a progesterone; administering the compound, in combination with an estrogen; administering the compound, in combination with a PDE5 inhibitor; administering the compound, in combination with apomorphine; administering the compound, in combination with a bisphosphonate; or administering the compound, in combination with one or more additional SARMS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the present invention provides a composition and a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound of any of formulas I-VI and/or its optical isomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate or N-oxide or any combination thereof; and a suitable carrier or diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"pharmaceutical composition\" means therapeutically effective amounts of the compound together with suitable diluents, preservatives, solubilizers, emulsifiers, adjuvant and/or carriers. A \"therapeutically effective amount\" as used herein refers to that amount which provides a therapeutic effect for a given condition and administration regimen. Such compositions are liquids or Lyophilized or otherwise dried formulations and include diluents of various buffer content (e.g., Tris-HCI., acetate, phosphate), pH and ionic strength, additives such as albumin or gelatin to prevent absorption to surfaces, detergents (e.g., \nTween\n 20, \nTween\n 80, Pluronic F68, bile acid salts), solubilizing agents (e.g., glycerol, polyethylene glycerol), anti-oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite), preservatives (e.g., Thimerosal, benzyl alcohol, parabens), bulking substances or tonicity modifiers (e.g., lactose, mannitol), covalent attachment of polymers such as polyethylene glycol to the protein, complexation with metal ions, or incorporation of the material into or onto particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polglycolic acid, hydrogels, etc, or onto liposomes, microemulsions, micelles, unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles, erythrocyte ghosts, or spheroplasts.) Such compositions will influence the physical state, solubility, stability, rate of \nin vivo\n release, and rate of \nin vivo\n clearance. Controlled or sustained release compositions include formulation in lipophilic depots (e.g., fatty acids, waxes, oils).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso comprehended by the invention are particulate compositions coated with polymers (e.g., poloxamers or poloxamines). Other embodiments of the compositions of the invention incorporate particulate forms protective coatings, protease inhibitors or permeation enhancers for various routes of administration, including parenteral, pulmonary, nasal and oral. In one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition is administered parenterally, paracancerally, transmucosally, transdermally, intramuscularly, intravenously, intradermally, subcutaneously, intravaginally, intraperitonealy, intraventricularly, intracranially or intratumorally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, as used herein \"pharmaceutically acceptable carriers\" are well known to those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to, 0.01-0.1M and preferably 0.05M phosphate buffer or 0.8% saline. Additionally, such pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's and fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers such as those based on Ringer's dextrose, and the like. Preservatives and other additives may also be present, such as, for example, antimicrobials, antioxidants, collating agents, inert gases and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControlled or sustained release compositions include formulation in lipophilic depots (e.g. fatty acids, waxes, oils). Also comprehended by the invention are particulate compositions coated with polymers (e.g. poloxamers or poloxamines) and the compound coupled to antibodies directed against tissue-specific receptors, ligands or antigens or coupled to ligands of tissue-specific receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther embodiments of the compositions of the invention incorporate particulate forms, protective coatings, protease inhibitors or permeation enhancers for various routes of administration, including parenteral, pulmonary, nasal and oral.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds modified by the covalent attachment of water-soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol, copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyproline are known to exhibit substantially longer half-lives in blood following intravenous injection than do the corresponding unmodified compounds (Abuchowski et al., 1981; Newmark et al., 1982; and Katre et al., 1987). Such modifications may also increase the compound's solubility in aqueous solution, eliminate aggregation, enhance the physical and chemical stability of the compound, and greatly reduce the immunogenicity and reactivity of the compound. As a result, the desired \nin vivo\n biological activity may be achieved by the administration of such polymer-compound abducts less frequently or in lower doses than with the unmodified compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. For example, the agent may be administered using intravenous infusion, an implantable osmotic pump, a transdermal patch, liposomes, or other modes of administration. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; \nSefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987\n); \nBuchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980\n); \nSaudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989\n). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity to the therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., \nGoodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984\n). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by \nLanger (Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical preparation can comprise the SARM agent alone, or can further include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and can be in solid or liquid form such as tablets, powders, capsules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, emulsions, gels, creams, or suppositories, including rectal and urethral suppositories. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include gums, starches, sugars, cellulosic materials, and mixtures thereof. The pharmaceutical preparation containing the SARM agent can be administered to a subject by, for example, subcutaneous implantation of a pellet; in one embodiment, the pellet provides for controlled release of SARM agent over a period of time. The preparation can also be administered by intravenous, intraarterial, or intramuscular injection of a liquid preparation, oral administration of a liquid or solid preparation, or by topical application. Administration can also be accomplished by use of a rectal suppository or a urethral suppository.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical preparations of the invention can be prepared by known dissolving, mixing, granulating, or tablet-forming processes. For oral administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are mixed with additives customary for this purpose, such as vehicles, stabilizers, or inert diluents, and converted by customary methods into suitable forms for administration, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard or soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. Examples of suitable inert vehicles are conventional tablet bases such as lactose, sucrose, or cornstarch in combination with binders such as acacia, cornstarch, gelatin, with disintegrating agents such as cornstarch, potato starch, alginic acid, or with a lubricant such as stearic acid or magnesium stearate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable oily vehicles or solvents are vegetable or animal oils such as sunflower oil or fish-liver oil. Preparations can be effected both as dry and as wet granules. For parenteral administration (subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, or intramuscular injection), the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are converted into a solution, suspension, or emulsion, if desired with the substances customary and suitable for this purpose, for example, solubilizers or other auxiliaries. Examples are sterile liquids such as water and oils, with or without the addition of a surfactant and other pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants. Illustrative oils are those of petroleum, animals, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, or mineral oil. In general, water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, and glycols such as propylene glycols or polyethylene glycol are preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation of pharmaceutical compositions which contain an active component is well understood in the art. Typically, such compositions are prepared as aerosols of the polypeptide delivered to the nasopharynx or as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions; however, solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid prior to injection can also be prepared. The preparation can also be emulsified. The active therapeutic ingredient is often mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, or the like or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the composition can contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents which enhance the effectiveness of the active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn active component can be formulated into the composition as neutralized pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide or antibody molecule), which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, mandelic, and the like. Salts formed from the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical administration to body surfaces using, for example, creams, gels, drops, and the like, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like can be prepared and applied as solutions, suspensions, or emulsions in a physiologically acceptable diluent with or without a pharmaceutical carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the active compound can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see \nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n); \nTreat et al., in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez- Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989\n); \nLopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327\n; see generally ibid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor use in medicine, the salts of the SARM may be pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of the compounds according to the invention or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic: acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are presented in order to more fully illustrate the preferred embodiments of the invention.

The animals were maintained on a 12-hour light-dark cycle with food and water available \nad libitum.\n The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStudy Design.\n Rats were randomly distributed into treatment groups groups. One day prior to the start of drug treatment, animals were individually removed from the cage, weighed and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal dose of ketamine/xylazine (87/13 mg/kg; approximately 1 mL per kg). When appropriately anesthetized (i.e., no response to toe pinch), the animals' ears were marked for identification purposes. Animals were then placed on a sterile pad and their abdomen and scrotum washed with betadine and 70% alcohol. The testes were removed via a midline scrotal incision, with sterile suture being used to ligate supra-testicular tissue prior to surgical removal of each testis. The surgical wound site was closed with sterile stainless steel wound clips, and the site cleaned with betadine. The animals were allowed to recover on a sterile pad (until able to stand) and then returned to their cage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwenty-four hours later, animals were re-anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, and an Alzet osmotic pump(s) (model 2002) was placed subcutaneouly in the scapular region. In this instance, the scapular region was shaved and cleaned (betadine and alcohol) and a small incision (1 cm) made using a sterile scalpel. The osmotic pump was inserted and the wound closed with a sterile stainless steel wound clip. Animals were allowed to recover and were returned to their cage. Osmotic pumps contained the appropriate treatment dissolved in polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG300). Osmotic pumps were filled with the appropriate solution one day prior to implantation. Animals were monitored daily for signs of acute toxicity to drug treatment (e.g., lethargy, rough coat).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter 14 days of drug treatment, rats were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. Animals were then sacrificed by exsanguinations under anesthesia. A blood sample was collected by venipuncture of the abdominal aorta, and submitted for complete blood cell analysis. A portion of the blood was placed in a separate tube, centrifuged at 12,000g for 1 minute, and the plasma layer removed and frozen at -20°C. The ventral prostates, seminal vesicles, levator ani muscle, liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs, and heart were removed, cleared of extraneous tissue, weighed, and placed in vials containing 10% neutral buffered formalin. Preserved tissues were sent to GTx, Inc. for histopathological analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor data analysis, the weights of all organs were normalized to body weight, and analyzed for any statistical significant difference by single-factor ANOVA. The weights of prostate and seminal vesicle were used as indexes for evaluation of androgenic activity, and the levator ani muscle weight was used to evaluate the anabolic activity.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds 1 and 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe androgenic and anabolic activities of \n \ncompounds\n \n 1 and 2 were examined in a castrated rat model after 14 days of administration. Intact Controls (not castrated, untreated) and Castrated Controls (castrated, untreated) were used as the control groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Table 1 and \nFigure 1\n, the weights of prostate, seminal vesicle, and levator ani muscle in castrated rats decreased significantly, due to the ablation of endogenous androgen production. Treatment with 1mg/\n \nd compounds\n \n 1 and 2 resulted in an increase in prostate, seminal vesicle and levator ani muscle weights. \n \nCompounds\n \n 1 and 2 showed lower potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weights of prostate and seminal vesicle, but a greater potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weight of levator ani muscle. Particularly, \ncompound\n 1 was able to maintain the levator ani muscle weight of castrated animals in the same level as that of intact animals. Thus, \ncompound\n 1 is a potent nonsteroidal anabolic agent. This is a significant improvement over previous compounds, in that this compound selectively stimulates muscle growth and other anabolic effects while having less effect on the prostate and seminal vesicles. This may be particularly relevant in aging men with concerns related to the development or progression of prostate cancer.\n\n \n \nTable 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIntact\n \nCastrated\n \nCompound 1 (pump)\n \nCompound 1 (daily injection)\n \nCompound 2 (daily injection)\n \n \n \n \n \nProstate\n \n \n100 ± 14.3\n \n6.2 ± 2.5\n \n40.3 ± 10.0\n \n33.1 ± 8.5\n \n7.2 ± 1.4\n \n \n \nSeminal Vesicles\n \n101 ± 26.8\n \n8.1 ± 1.8\n \n30.9 ± 5.7\n \n23.6 ± 8.8\n \n7.2 ± 0.9\n \n \n \nLevator Ani Muscle\n \n102 ± 8.1\n \n40.9 ± 9.4\n \n122.5 ± 10.4\n \n112.8 ± 9.4\n \n55.83 ± 2.84\n \n \n \n \n \n* Reference group that treated with \nCompound\n 1 1 mg/day via osmotic pump.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nCompound\n 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe androgenic and anabolic activities of \ncompound\n 7 were examined in a castrated rat model after 14 days of administration.

Rats were castrated on \nday\n 0 and received daily subcutaneous doses (0.05 to 3 mg/day) of \ncompound\n 7 in a vehicle of DMSO/PEG. Rats were sacrificed on final day and the wet weight of androgenic (prostate and seminal vesicles) and anabolic (levator ani) organs determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFigure 2\n, treatment with increasing doses of \ncompound\n 7 resulted in an increase in prostate, seminal vesicle and levator ani muscle weights in a dose-dependent manner. \nCompound\n 7 showed lower potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weights of prostate and seminal vesicle, but a greater potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weight of levator ani muscle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited by what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe histamine-3 (H3) receptor is one of four histamine receptor subtypes (H1-H4), all of which are members of the larger G-protein-coupled receptor (GCPR) superfamily of receptors. The H3 receptor is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. In the brain, it is located in regions associated with learning and memory such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum. The H3 receptor acts as both auto- and hetero-receptor to regulate the release of histamine and other neurotransmitters. Within the cortex, the H3 receptor appears to directly modify GABA release from cortical intemeurons. Antagonism of the H3 receptor produces a decrease in GABA release and disinhibition of the cortical cholinergic system, resulting in increased acetylcholine levels (\nBacciottini, L. et al, Behavioral Brain Research, 124, 2001, 183-194\n). In addition to direct regulation of cholinergic neurotransmission, the H3 receptor has been shown to modulate the release of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine (\nLeurs, R., et al, Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 19, 1998, 177-183\n). A postmortem study in humans suggests that a decrease in brain histamine levels may contribute to the cognitive decline which occurs in Alzheimers diseae, directly or through the cholinergic system (\nPanula. P., et al, Neuroscience, 82, 1998, 993-997\n). H3 agonists have been reported to impair memory in various tasks, such as, object recognition, passive avoidance (\nBlandina, P., et al, British Journal of Pharmacology, 119(8), 1996, 1656-1664\n) and social olfactory memory (Prast, H., \net al\n, 734, \n1996\n. 316-318), whereas H3 antagonists have been reported to rescue impairments produced pharmacologically or genetically; i.e. \nMiyazaki, S.; et al, Life Sciences, 61, 1997, 355-361\n; \nMeguro, K., et al, Pharmacology. Biochemistry and Behavior, 50, 1995, 321-325\n; \nFox, G. B., et al. Behavioral Brain Research. 131, 2002, 151-161\n; and \nKomater, V. A., et al. Psychopharmacology, 167, 2003; 363-372\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccumulating neuroanatomical, neurochemical, pharmacological and behavioral data support the concept that H3 receptor antagonists may improve cognitive performance in disease states such as mild cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's disease and may have therapeutic value in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, obesity and sleep disorders. Numerous H3 ligands are already known, such as e.g. the cycloamino derivatives described in \n \nWO 2006/011042\n \n. However it is still desirable to propose further H3 antagonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, it is an object of this invention to provide compounds which are inhibitors of the H3 receptor and are useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of a variety of central nervous system disorders related to or affected by the H3 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is another object of this invention to provide therapeutic methods and pharmaceutical compositions useful for the treatment of central nervous system disorders related to or affected by the H3 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a feature of this invention that the compounds provided may also be useful to further study and elucidate the H3 receptor.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides an N-benzoyl- or N-benzylpyrrolidin-3-ylamine compound of formula I\n\n \n \n\nwherein\n\nX is CO\n\nY is O;\n\nR\n1\n and R\n2\n are each independently H or an optionally-substituted alkyl group or R\n1\n and R\n2\n may be taken together with the atom to which they are attached to form an optionally substituted 4- to 7-membered ring optionally containing one or two additional heteroatoms seloected from N, O or S\n\nR\n3\n is an aryl or heteroaryl group each group optionally substituted;\n\nR\n4\n and R\n5\n are each independently H, halogen, OR\n9\n or an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl group each optionally substituted;\n\nR\n9\n is H or an optionally substituted alkyl group; ; or\n\na stereoisomer thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides methods and compositions useful for the therapeutic treatment of central nervous system disorders related to or affected by the Histamine-3 receptor.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive loss of memory and cognitive function and is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. AD is believed to affect approximately 15-20 million people worldwide. The goal of treatment in AD, in addition to reversing the disease process, is to improve or at least slow the loss of memory and cognition and to maintain independent function in patients with mild to moderate disease. AD is characterized by numerous deficits in neurotransmitter function (\nMöller, H-J., European Neuropsychopharmacology, 9, 1999, S53-S59\n), further a postmortem study in humans suggests that a decrease in brain histamine levels may contribute to the cognitive decline asssociated with AD, directly or through the cholinergic system (\nPanula, P., et al, Neuroscience, 82, 1998, 993-997\n). Histamine-3 (H3) receptor antagonists have been reported to rescue impairments produced pharmacologically or genetically (\nMiyazaki, S., et al. Life Sciences, 61, 1997, 355-361\n: \nMeguro, K., et al, Pharmacology. Biochemistry and Behavior, 50, 1995, 321-325\n; \nFox, G. B., et. al, Behavioral Brain Research, 131, 2002, 151-161\n; and \nKomater, V. A., et al, Psychopharmacology, 167, 2003, 363-372\n). Neuroanatomical, neurochemical, pharmacological and behavioral data support the belief that H3 receptor antagonists may improve cognitive performance in disease states such as mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and may have therapeutic value in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. (ADHD), schlzophrenia, obesity and sleep disorders. To that end, compounds which inhibit the H3 receptor and act as H3 antagonists are samestly sought.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly it has now been found that N-benzoyl- and N-benzylpyrrolidin-3-ylamine compounds of formula I demonstrate H-3 affinity along with significant subtype selectivity and function as H-3 antagonists.

Stably transfected HEK293T cells are grown in DMEM containing 10% heat inactivated FBS and, G-418 (500ug/ml). Cells are scraped from the plate, transferred to centrifuge tubes, washed one time in PBS by centrifugation in a Sorvall RT7 Plus centrifuge (2000rpm 10 minutes, 4°C). The resulting pellets are stored at -80°C until ready for use. Cells are re-suspended in buffer (50mM Tris pH=7.5) and placed in a Dounce homogenizer, douncing ten timers to homogenize cells. The homogenate is spun down by centrifugation (Sorvall RT7 Plus, 1800rpm 10 minutes, 4°C). The supernatant is placed in a Corex tube and spun down by centrifugation (Sorvall RC 5c Plus, 17,000 rpm 20 minutes, 4°C). The pellet is resuspended in buffer (50mM Tris, pH 7.5). Protein concentration (ug/ul) is determined using the Micro-BCA Protein Determination. The binding assay is set up in a 96 well microtiter plate in a total volume of 250 uL. Non-specific binding is determined in the presence of 10 uM clobenpropit. The final radioligand concentration is 1 nM. The test compound is serially diluted using the Beckman Biomek2000 to a final approximate range of 100 uM to 100 pM. Membranes are suspended in buffer, homogenized in 2 bursts of ten seconds using a Vitris mechanical homogenizer set at power setting 5. Ten µg of membranes are added to each well. Following a one hour incubation at 30°C, the reaction is terminated by the addition of ice cold buffer and rapid filtration with a Packard Filtermate Harvester through a GF/B filter pre-soaked with 1% PEI for one hour. The plate is dried for one hour art 37°C and 60 µL Microscint Scintillant is added to each well. The CPM per well is measured on a Packard Top Count NXT. Ki values are determined in nM. The Ki is calculated from the IC\n50\n (i.e. the concentration of competing ligand which displaces 50% of the specific binding of the radioligand). CPM values are expressed as % specific binding and plotted vs compound concentration. A curve is fitted using a four-parameter logistic fit and the IC\n50\n value is determined. The Ki is calculated from this using the Cheng-Prusoff equation: pKi = IC\n50\n/1+(L/Kd) where L = concentration of free radioligand used in the assay, and Kd is the dissociation constant of the radioligand for the receptor. L is determined for each experiment by counting an aliquot of the diluted radioligand (corresponding to that added to each well) and the Kd has previously been determined under identical conditions for this cell line / radioligand.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCyclic AMP assay for histamine receptor H3 antagonism activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nStable H3 cells are maintained in tissue culture flask in DMEM with high glucose, 10 % FBS, 1X pen/strep, 500 ug/ml GY18, until experiment. Culture media is removed and cells are washed twice with PBS w/ Ca++ and Mg++ plus 500 µM IBMX. Cells are then detached by tapping on the side of the flask and resuspend in the same buffer. Two thousand cells/well are incubated with 1 µM histamine plus 10 µM forskolin plus various concentrations of compounds in a total volume of 30 µL in 96 well plates for 30 min at 30°C. Final test compound concentrations range from 10-4M to 10-9.5M at full log dilutions. Cyclic AMP levels are measured using HitHunter cAMP kit from Discoverx, cat# 900041 according to manufacturer's instruction. Chemiluminescence signals are detected using Top Count (Packard). Cyclic AMP levels in control cells receiving 10 µM forskolin plus 100 nM histamine are considered 0%, and in cells receiving 10 uM forskolin plus 100 nM histamine plus 1 µM clobenpropit are considered 100%. Data are expressed as % control and analyzed using Prizm soft ware. The Kb values are calculated using the following equation, KB = EC\n50\n or IC\n50\n/[1 + (ligand/Kd)]. The data are shown in Table VI, below,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor Table VI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nA = ≤ 10 nM\n\n\nB = 10.1 nM -50.0 nM\n\n\nC = 50.1 nM-100 nM\n\n\nD = > 100 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE VI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEx No\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH3 Binding Ki (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncAMP Kb (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nA\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEx No\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH3 Binding KI (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncAMP Kb (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nA\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nA\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nA\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nD\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nB\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\nB\n\n\n-"
