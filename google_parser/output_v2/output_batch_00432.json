The non-natural amino acids, by themselves or as a part of a polypeptide, can include a wide range of functionalities, including but not limited to oxime, carbonyl, and/or hydroxy lamine groups. Also disclosed herein are non-natural amino acid polypeptides that are further modified post-translationally, and methods for detecting such polypeptides.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims benefit of \n \nU.S. Provisional Application No. 60/737,855\n \n, entitled \"Methods of Detecting Non-Natural Amino Acid Polypeptides in vivo and in vitro\" filed on November 16, 2005.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability to incorporate non-genetically encoded amino acids (i.e., \"non-natural amino acids\") into proteins permits the introduction of chemical functional groups that could provide valuable alternatives to the naturally-occurring functional groups, such as the epsilon - NH2 of lysine, the sulfhydryl -SH of cysteine, the imino group of histidine, etc. Certain chemical functional groups are known to be inert to the functional groups found in the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids but react cleanly and efficiently to form stable linkages with functional groups that can be incorporated onto non-natural amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods are now available to selectively introduce chemical functional groups that are not found in proteins, that are chemically inert to all of the functional groups found in the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids and that may be used to react efficiently and selectively with reagents comprising certain functional groups to form stable covalent linkages.\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein and incorporated by reference are methods, compositions, techniques and strategies for making, purifying, detecting, characterizing, and using non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides and modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention provides a method of detecting a polypeptide that comprises detecting a non-naturally encoded amino acid side chain in the polypeptide. In some embodiments, the polypeptide is ribosomally synthesized. The invention also provides methods of detecting a polypeptide that comprise detecting a non-naturally encoded amino acid side chain in the polypeptide that has been post-translationally modified. Also provided are methods of detecting a non-naturally encoded amino acid side chain in said polypeptide that comprise contacting the non-naturally encoded amino acid side chain with a molecule comprising a functional group that specifically interacts with the non-naturally encoded amino acid side chain. Also provided are methods of purifying a polypeptide having a non-naturally encoded amino acid in the polypeptide chain. In some embodiments the method comprises contacting the polypeptide with a substance that interacts with the non-naturally encoded amino acid side chain in the polypeptide. In other embodiments, the method of purifying a polypeptide having a non-naturally encoded amino acid in the polypeptide chain comprises precipitation of the polypeptide, wherein the non-naturally encoded amino acid alters the solubility of the polypeptide when compared to the solubility of the polypeptide without a non-naturally encoded amino acid in the polypeptide chain. Methods of purifying a ribosomally made polypeptide having a non-naturally encoded amino acid in the polypeptide side chain comprises electrophoresis of the polypeptide, wherein the non-naturally encoded amino acid alters the electrophoretic mobility of the polypeptide when compared to the electrophoretic mobility of the polypeptide without a non-naturally encoded amino acid in the polypeptide chain are also provided. In other embodiments, the method of purifying a ribosomally made polypeptide having a non-naturally encoded amino acid in the polypeptide side chain, comprises dialysis of the polypeptide, wherein the non-naturally encoded amino acid alters the diffusion rate of the polypeptide when compared to the diffusion rate of the polypeptide without a non-naturally encoded amino acid in the polypeptide chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a method for screening a library of molecules, comprising: a) combining a polypeptide comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid with the library molecules under conditions to allow interaction of the library molecules with the polypeptide comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid, and b) identifying the library molecules which interact with the polypeptide comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid. In some embodiments, a library of ribosomally made polypeptides comprising a plurality of polypeptides having different amino acid sequences, wherein each polypeptide comprises a non-natural amino acid is screened.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides methoda, comprising: a) substituting a non-naturally encoded amino acid for a naturally encoded amino acid at a single pre-selected site in a pre-selected polypeptide having at least one known biological activity; and b) measuring a biological activity of the pre-selected polypeptide comprising the non-naturally encoded amino acid; and c) comparing the biological activity of the pre-selected polypeptide of step b) with the pre-selected polypeptide having a non-naturally encoded amino acid substituted for a naturally encoded amino acid at a different position in the pre-selected polypeptide chain or with the pre-selected polypeptide without a substituted non-naturally encoded amino acid in the polypeptide chain. In some embodiments, a method for selecting a position for post-translational modification of a pre-selected polypeptide comprises a) substituting a non-naturally encoded amino acid for a naturally encoded amino acid at a single pre-selected site in a pre-selected polypeptide having at least one known biological activity; and b) measuring a biological activity of the pre-selected polypeptide comprising the non-naturally encoded amino acid; and c) comparing the biological activity of the pre-selected polypeptide of step b) with the pre-selected polypeptide having a non-naturally encoded amino acid substituted for a naturally encoded amino acid at a different position in the pre-selected polypeptide chain or with the pre-selected polypeptide without a substituted non-naturally encoded amino acid in the polypeptide chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that the methods and compositions described herein and incorporated by reference are not limited to the particular methodology, protocols, cell lines, constructs, and reagents described herein and as such may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the methods and compositions described herein, which will be limited only by the appended claims.\n\n\n \n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms \"a,\" \"an,\" and \"the\" include plural reference unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which the inventions described herein belong. Although any methods, devices, and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the inventions described herein, the preferred methods, devices and materials are now described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll publications and patents mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing, for example, the constructs and methodologies that are described in the publications, which might be used in connection with the presently described inventions. The publications discussed herein are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the inventors described herein are not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention or for any other reason.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"alkoxy,\" \"alkylamino\" and \"alkylthio\" (or thioalkoxy) are used in their conventional sense, and refer to those alkyl groups attached to the remainder of the molecule via an oxygen atom, an amino group, or a sulfur atom, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"alkyl,\" by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combination thereof, which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e. C\n1\n-C\n10\n means one to ten carbons). Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, cyclohexyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, cyclopropylmethyl, homologs and isomers of, for example, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers. The term \"alkyl,\" unless otherwise noted, is also meant to include those derivatives of alkyl defined in more detail below, such as \"heteroalkyl.\" Alkyl groups which are limited to hydrocarbon groups are termed \"homoalkyl\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"alkylene\" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from an alkane, as exemplified, but not limited, by the structures -CH\n2\nCH\n2\n- and -CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n-, and further includes those groups described below as \"heteroalkylene.\" Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, with those groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being a particular embodiment of the methods and compositions described herein. A \"lower alkyl\" or \"lower alkylene\" is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"amino acid\" refers to naturally occurring and non-natural amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally encoded amino acids are the 20 common amino acids (alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine) and pyrrolysine and selenocysteine. Amino acid analogs refers to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, \ni.e.,\n an α carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, such as, homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups (such as, norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acids may be referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. Nucleotides, likewise, may be referred to by their commonly accepted single-letter codes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"amino terminus modification group\" refers to any molecule that can be attached to the amino terminus of a polypeptide. Similarly, a \"carboxy terminus modification group\" refers to any molecule that can be attached to the carboxy terminus of a polypeptide. Terminus modification groups include but are not limited to various water soluble polymers, peptides or proteins such as serum albumin, or other moieties that increase serum half-life of peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"aryl\" means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, aromatic, hydrocarbon substituent which can be a single ring or multiple rings (including but not limited to, from 1 to 3 rings) which are fused together or linked covalently. The term \"heteroaryl\" refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain from one to four heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1-isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl, and 6-quinolyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor brevity, the term \"aryl\" when used in combination with other terms (including but not limited to, aryloxy, arylthioxy, aralkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above. Thus, the term \"aralkyl\" or \"alkaryl\" is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group (including but not limited to, benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (including but not limited to, a methylene group) has been replaced by, for example, an oxygen atom (including but not limited to, phenoxymethyl, 2-pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(1-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"bifunctional polymer\" refers to a polymer comprising two discrete functional groups that are capable of reacting specifically with other moieties (including but not limited to, amino acid side groups) to form covalent or non-covalent linkages. A bifunctional linker having one functional group reactive with a group on a particular biologically active component, and another group reactive with a group on a second biological component, may be used to form a conjugate that includes the first biologically active component, the bifunctional linker and the second biologically active component. Many procedures and linker molecules for attachment of various compounds to peptides are known. \nSee, e.g.,\n European Patent Application No. \n \n188,256\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 4,671,958\n \n, \n \n4,659,839\n \n, \n \n4,414,148\n \n, \n \n4,699,784\n \n; \n \n4,680,338\n \n; and \n \n4,569,789\n \n which are incorporated by reference herein. A \"multi-functional polymer\" refers to a polymer comprising two or more discrete functional groups that are capable of reacting specifically with other moieties (including but not limited to, amino acid side groups) to form covalent or non-covalent linkages. A bi-functional polymer or multi-functional polymer may be any desired length or molecular weight, and may be selected to provide a particular desired spacing or conformation between one or more molecules linked to the polypeptide and its binding partner or the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"biologically active molecule\", \"biologically active moiety\" or \"biologically active agent\" when used herein means any substance which can affect any physical or biochemical properties of a biological system, pathway, molecule, or interaction relating to an organism, including but not limited to viruses, bacteria, bacteriophage, transposon, prion, insects, fungi, plants, animals, and humans. In particular, as used herein, biologically active molecules include but are not limited to any substance intended for diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in humans or other animals, or to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being of humans or animals. Examples of biologically active molecules include, but are not limited to, peptides, proteins, enzymes, small molecule drugs, hard drugs, soft drugs, carbohydrates, inorganic atoms or molecules, dyes, lipids, nucleosides, radionuclides, oligonucleotides, toxins, cells, viruses, liposomes, microparticles and micelles. Classes of biologically active agents that are suitable for use with the methods and compositions described herein include, but are not limited to, drugs, prodrugs, radionuclides, imaging agents, polymers, antibiotics, fungicides, anti-viral agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-tumor agents, cardiovascular agents, anti-anxiety agents, hormones, growth factors, steroidal agents, microbially derived toxins, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Cofolding,\" as used herein, refers specifically to refolding processes, reactions, or methods which employ at least two polypeptides which interact with each other and result in the transformation of unfolded or improperly folded polypeptides to native, properly folded polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"comparison window,\" as used herein, includes reference to a segment of any one of the number of contiguous positions selected from the group consisting of from 20 to 600, usually about 50 to about 200, more usually about 100 to about 150 in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well-known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, including but not limited to, by the local homology algorithm of \nSmith and Waterman (1970) Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482c\n, by the homology alignment algorithm of \nNeedleman and Wunsch (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48:443\n, by the search for similarity method of \nPearson and Lipman (1988) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444\n, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, WI), or by manual alignment and visual inspection (\nsee, e.g.,\n \nAusubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1995 supplement\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne example of an algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in \nAltschul et al. (1997) Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402\n, and \nAltschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410\n, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) or 10, M=5, N=-4 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (\nsee\n \nHenikoff and Henikoff (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915\n) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=-4, and a comparison of both strands. The BLAST algorithm is typically performed with the \"low complexity\" filter turned off.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences (\nsee, e.g.,\n \nKarlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5787\n). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, less than about 0.01, or less than about 0.001.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"conservatively modified variants\" applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, \"conservatively modified variants\" refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are \"silent variations,\" which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a \"conservatively modified variant\" where the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles of the methods and compositions described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another:\n\n \n \n \n1) Alanine (A), Glycine (G);\n \n2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E);\n \n3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q);\n \n4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K);\n \n5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V);\n \n6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W);\n \n7) Serine (S), Threonine (T); and\n \n8) Cysteine (C), Methionine (M)\n \n\n(\nsee, e.g.,\n \nCreighton, Proteins:Structures and Molecular Properties (W H Freeman & Co.; 2nd edition (December 1993\n)\n    \n \n \n \nThe terms \"cycloalkyl\" and \"heterocycloalkyl\", by themselves or in combination with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of \"alkyl\" and \"heteroalkyl\", respectively. Thus, a cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl include saturated, partially unsaturated and fully unsaturated ring linkages. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, 1-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl, tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1-piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like. Additionally, the term encompasses bicyclic and tricyclic ring structures. Similarly, the term \"heterocycloalkylene\" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heterocycloalkyl, and the term \"cycloalkylene\" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from cycloalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Denaturing agent\" or \"denaturant,\" as used herein, is defined as any compound or material which will cause a reversible unfolding of a protein. The strength of a denaturing agent or denaturant will be determined both by the properties and the concentration of the particular denaturing agent or denaturant. Suitable denaturing agents or denaturants may be chaotropes, detergents, organic, water miscible solvents, phospholipids, or a combination of two or more such agents. Suitable chaotropes include, but are not limited to, urea, guanidine, and sodium thiocyanate. Useful detergents may include, but are not limited to, strong detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, or polyoxyethylene ethers (e.g. Tween or Triton detergents), Sarkosyl, mild non-ionic detergents (\ne.g.,\n digitonin), mild cationic detergents such as N->2,3-(Dioleyoxy)-propyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium, mild ionic detergents (e.g. sodium cholate or sodium deoxycholate) or zwitterionic detergents including, but not limited to, sulfobetaines (Zwittergent), 3-(3-chlolamidopropyl)dimethylammonio-1-propane sulfate (CHAPS), and 3-(3-chlolamidopropyl)dimethylammonio-2-hydroxy-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPSO). Organic, water miscible solvents such as acetonitrile, lower alkanols (especially C\n2\n - C\n4\n alkanols such as ethanol or isopropanol), or lower alkandiols (especially C\n2\n - C\n4\n alkandiols such as ethyleneglycol) may be used as denaturants. Phospholipids useful in the methods and compositions described herein may be naturally occurring phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol or synthetic phospholipid derivatives or variants such as dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine or diheptanoylphosphatidylcholine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"effective amount\" as used herein refers to that amount of the (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disease, condition or disorder being treated. Compositions containing the (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide described herein can be administered for prophylactic, enhancing, and/or therapeutic treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"enhance\" or \"enhancing\" means to increase or prolong either in potency or duration a desired effect. Thus, in regard to enhancing the effect of therapeutic agents, the term \"enhancing\" refers to the ability to increase or prolong, either in potency or duration, the effect of other therapeutic agents on a system. An \"enhancing-effective amount,\" as used herein, refers to an amount adequate to enhance the effect of another therapeutic agent in a desired system. When used in a patient, amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"eukaryote\" refers to organisms belonging to the phylogenetic domain Eucarya such as animals (including but not limited to, mammals, insects, reptiles, birds, \netc\n.), ciliates, plants (including but not limited to, monocots, dicots, algae, \netc.),\n fungi, yeasts, flagellates, microsporidia, protists, \netc.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"functional group\", \"active moiety\", \"activating group\", \"leaving group\", \"reactive site\", \"chemically reactive group\" and \"chemically reactive moiety\" are used in the art and herein to refer to distinct, definable portions or units of a molecule. The terms are somewhat synonymous in the chemical arts and are used herein to indicate the portions of molecules that perform some function or activity and are reactive with other molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"halogen\" includes fluorine, chlorine, iodine, and bromine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"heteroalkyl,\" by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combinations thereof, consisting of the stated number of carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, Si and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) O, N and S and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-O-CH\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-NH-CH\n3\n, - CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-N(CH\n3\n)-CH\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-S-CH\n2\n-CH\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n,-S(O)-CH\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-S(O)\n2\n-CH\n3\n, - CH=CH-O-CH\n3\n, -Si(CH\n3\n)\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-CH=N-OCH\n3\n, and -CH=CH-N(CH\n3\n)-CH\n3\n. Up to two heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, -CH\n2\n-NH-OCH\n3\n and -CH\n2\n-O-Si(CH\n3\n)\n3\n. Similarly, the term \"heteroalkylene\" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-S-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n- and -CH\n2\n-S-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-NH-CH\n2\n-. For heteroalkylene groups, the same or different heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (including but not limited to, alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, aminooxyalkylene, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula - C(O)\n2\nR'- represents both -C(O)\n2\nR'- and -R'C(O)\n2\n-.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"identical\" or percent \"identity,\" in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same. Sequences are \"substantially identical\" if they have a percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same (\ni.e.,\n about 60% identity, optionally about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, or about 95% identity over a specified region), when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window, or designated region as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection. This definition also refers to the complement of a test sequence. The identity can exist over a region that is at least about 50 amino acids or nucleotides in length, or over a region that is 75-100 amino acids or nucleotides in length, or, where not specified, across the entire sequence of a polynucleotide or polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"isolated,\" when applied to a nucleic acid or protein, denotes that the nucleic acid or protein is free of at least some of the cellular components with which it is associated in the natural state, or that the nucleic acid or protein has been concentrated to a level greater than the concentration of its \nin vivo\n or \nin vitro\n production. It can be in a homogeneous state. Isolated substances can be in either a dry or semi-dry state, or in solution, including but not limited to an aqueous solution. It can be a component of a pharmaceutical composition that comprises additional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or excipients. Purity and homogeneity are typically determined using analytical chemistry techniques such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography. A protein which is the predominant species present in a preparation is substantially purified. In particular, an isolated gene is separated from open reading frames which flank the gene and encode a protein other than the gene of interest. The term \"purified\" denotes that a nucleic acid or protein gives rise to substantially one band in an electrophoretic gel. Particularly, it may mean that the nucleic acid or protein is at least 85% pure, at least 90% pure, at least 95% pure, at least 99% or greater pure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"linkage\" or \"linker\" is used herein to refer to groups or bonds that normally are formed as the result of a chemical reaction and typically are covalent linkages. Hydrolytically stable linkages means that the linkages are substantially stable in water and do not react with water at useful pH values, including but not limited to, under physiological conditions for an extended period of time, perhaps even indefinitely. Hydrolytically unstable or degradable linkages mean that the linkages are degradable in water or in aqueous solutions, including for example, blood. Enzymatically unstable or degradable linkages mean that the linkage can be degraded by one or more enzymes. As understood in the art, PEG and related polymers may include degradable linkages in the polymer backbone or in the linker group between the polymer backbone and one or more of the terminal functional groups of the polymer molecule. For example, ester linkages formed by the reaction of PEG carboxylic acids or activated PEG carboxylic acids with alcohol groups on a biologically active agent generally hydrolyze under physiological conditions to release the agent. Other hydrolytically degradable linkages include but are not limited to carbonate linkages; imine linkages resulted from reaction of an amine and an aldehyde; phosphate ester linkages formed by reacting an alcohol with a phosphate group; hydrazone linkages which are reaction product of a hydrazide and an aldehyde; acetal linkages that are the reaction product of an aldehyde and an alcohol; orthoester linkages that are the reaction product of a formate and an alcohol; peptide linkages formed by an amine group, including but not limited to, at an end of a polymer such as PEG, and a carboxyl group of a peptide; and oligonucleotide linkages formed by a phosphoramidite group, including but not limited to, at the end of a polymer, and a 5' hydroxyl group of an oligonucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"medium\" or \"media\" includes any culture medium, solution, solid, semi-solid, or rigid support that may support or contain any host cell, including bacterial host cells, yeast host cells, insect host cells, plant host cells, eukaryotic host cells, mammalian host cells, CHO cells, prokaryotic host cells, \nE\n. \ncoli,\n or Pseudomonas host cells, and cell contents. Thus, the term may encompass medium in which the host cell has been grown, \ne.g.,\n medium into which the polypeptide has been secreted, including medium either before or after a proliferation step. The term also may encompass buffers or reagents that contain host cell lysates, such as in the case where the polypeptide is produced intracellularly and the host cells are lysed or disrupted to release the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"metabolite\" of a (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide disclosed herein is a derivative of that (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide that is formed when the (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide is metabolized. The term \"active metabolite\" refers to a biologically active derivative of a (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide that is formed when the (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide is metabolized. The term \"metabolized\" refers to the sum of the processes (including, but not limited to, hydrolysis reactions and reactions catalyzed by enzymes) by which a particular substance is changed by an organism. Further information on metabolism may be obtained from \nThe Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Edition, McGraw-Hill (1996\n). Metabolites of the (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide disclosed herein can be identified either by administration of (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide to a host and analysis of tissue samples from the host, or by incubation of (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide with hepatic cells in vitro and analysis of the resulting compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"modified,\" as used herein refers to the presence of a post-translational modification on a polypeptide. The form \"(modified)\" term means that the polypeptides being discussed are optionally modified, that is, the polypeptides under discussion can be modified or unmodified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"modulated serum half-life\" means the positive or negative change in circulating half-life of a (modified) polypeptide relative to its non-modified form. Serum half-life is measured by taking blood samples at various time points after administration of the polypeptide, and determining the concentration of that molecule in each sample. Correlation of the serum concentration with time allows calculation of the serum half-life. Increased serum half-life desirably has at least about two-fold, but a smaller increase may be useful, for example where it enables a satisfactory dosing regimen or avoids a toxic effect. In some embodiments, the increase is at least about three-fold, at least about five-fold, or at least about ten-fold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"modulated therapeutic half-life\" as used herein means the positive or negative change in the half-life of the therapeutically effective amount of a (modified) polypeptide, relative to its non-modified form. Therapeutic half-life is measured by measuring pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic properties of the molecule at various time points after administration. Increased therapeutic half-life desirably enables a particular beneficial dosing regimen, a particular beneficial total dose, or avoids an undesired effect. In some embodiments, the increased therapeutic half-life results from increased potency, increased or decreased binding of the modified molecule to its target, incrased or decreased breakdown of the molecule by enzymes such as proteases, or an increase or decrease in another parameter or mechanism of action of the non-modified molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"non-eukaryote\" refers to non-eukaryotic organisms. For example, a non-eukaryotic organism can belong to the Eubacteria (including but not limited to, \nEscherichia coli, Thermus thermophilus, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, etc.)\n phylogenetic domain, or the Archaea (including but not limited to, \nMethanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Halobacterium\n such as \nHaloferax volcanii\n and \nHalobacterium\n species \nNRC-1, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Pyrococcus furiosus, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Aeuropyrum pernix, etc.\n) phylogenetic domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"non-natural amino acid\" refers to an amino acid that is not one of the 20 common amino acids or pyrrolysine or selenocysteine; other terms that may be used synonymously with the term \"non-natural amino acid\" is \"non-naturally encoded amino acid,\" \"unnatural amino acid,\" \"non-naturally-occurring amino acid,\" and variously hyphenated and non-hyphenated versions thereof. The term \"non-natural amino acid\" includes, but is not limited to, amino acids that occur naturally by modification of a naturally encoded amino acid (including but not limited to, the 20 common amino acids or pyrrolysine and selenocysteine) but are not themselves incorporated into a growing polypeptide chain by the translation complex. Examples of naturally-occurring amino acids that are not naturally-encoded include, but are not limited to, \nN\n-acetylglucosaminyl-L-serine, \nN\n-acetylglucosaminyl-L-threonine, and O-phosphotyrosine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"nucleic acid\" refers to deoxyribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleosides, ribonucleosides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. Unless specifically limited, the term encompasses nucleic acids containing known analogues of natural nucleotides which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolized in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides. Unless specifically limited otherwise, the term also refers oligonucleotide analogs including PNA (peptidonucleic acid), analogs of DNA used in antisense technology (phosphorothioates, phosphoroamidates, and the like). Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (including but not limited to, degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (\nBatzer et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081 (1991\n); \nOhtsuka et al., J Biol. Chem. 260:2605-2608 (1985\n); and \nRossolini et al., Mol. Cell. Probes 8:91-98 (1994\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Oxidizing agent,\" as used herein with respect to protein refolding, is defined as any compound or material which is capable of removing an electron from a compound being oxidized. Suitable oxidizing agents include, but are not limited to, oxidized glutathione, cystine, cystamine, oxidized dithiothreitol, oxidized erythreitol, and oxygen. A wide variety of oxidizing agents are suitable for use in the methods and compositions described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"polyalkylene glycol\" refers to polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polybutylene glycol, and derivatives thereof. The term \"polyalkylene glycol\" encompasses both linear and branched polymers and average molecular weights of between 1 kDa and 100 kDa. Other exemplary embodiments are listed, for example, in commercial supplier catalogs, such as Shearwater Corporation's catalog \"Polyethylene Glycol and Derivatives for Biomedical Applications\" (2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"polypeptide,\" \"peptide\" and \"protein\" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. That is, a description directed to a polypeptide applies equally to a description of a peptide and a description of a protein, and vice versa. The terms apply to naturally occurring amino acid polymers as well as amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residues is a non-natural amino acid. As used herein, the terms encompass amino acid chains of any length, including full length proteins, wherein the amino acid residues are linked by covalent peptide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"post-translationally modified\" refers to any modification of a natural or non-natural amino acid that occurs to such an amino acid after it has been incorporated into a polypeptide chain. The term encompasses, by way of example only, co-translational \nin vivo\n modifications, co-translational in vitro modifications (such as in a cell-free translation system), post-translational \nin vivo\n modifications, and post-translational \nin vitro\n modifications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"prodrug\" refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn prophylactic applications, compositions containing the (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease, disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a \"prophylactically effective amount.\" In this use, the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such prophylactically effective amounts by routine experimentation (\ne.g.,\n a dose escalation clinical trial).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"protected\" refers to the presence of a \"protecting group\" or moiety that prevents reaction of the chemically reactive functional group under certain reaction conditions. The protecting group will vary depending on the type of chemically reactive group being protected. For example, if the chemically reactive group is an amine or a hydrazide, the protecting group can be selected from the group of tert-butyloxycarbonyl (t-Boc) and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). If the chemically reactive group is a thiol, the protecting group can be orthopyridyldisulfide. If the chemically reactive group is a carboxylic acid, such as butanoic or propionic acid, or a hydroxyl group, the protecting group can be benzyl or an alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, or tert-butyl. Other protecting groups known in the art may also be used in or with the methods and compositions described herein, including photolabile groups such as Nvoc and MeNvoc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example only, blocking/protecting groups may be selected from:\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther protecting groups are described in \nGreene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY, 1999\n, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"recombinant host cell\" or \"host cell\" refers to a cell that includes an exogenous polynucleotide, regardless of the method used for insertion, for example, direct uptake, transduction, f-mating, or other methods known in the art to create recombinant host cells. The exogenous polynucleotide may be maintained as a nonintegrated vector, for example, a plasmid, or alternatively, may be integrated into the host genome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Reducing agent,\" as used herein with respect to protein refolding, is defined as any compound or material which maintains sulfhydryl groups in the reduced state and reduces intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds. Suitable reducing agents include, but are not limited to, dithiothreitol (DTT), 2-mercaptoethanol, dithioerythritol, cysteine, cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol), and reduced glutathione. A wide variety of reducing agents are suitable for use in the methods and compositions described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Refolding,\" as used herein describes any process, reaction or method which transforms disulfide bond containing polypeptides from an improperly folded or unfolded state to a native or properly folded conformation with respect to disulfide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase \"selectively (or specifically) hybridizes to\" refers to the binding, duplexing, or hybridizing of a molecule only to a particular nucleotide sequence under stringent hybridization conditions when that sequence is present in a complex mixture (including but not limited to, total cellular or library DNA or RNA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase \"stringent hybridization conditions\" refers to conditions of low ionic strength and high temperature as is known in the art. Typically, under stringent conditions a probe will hybridize to its target subsequence in a complex mixture of nucleic acid (including but not limited to, total cellular or library DNA or RNA) but does not hybridize to other sequences in the complex mixture. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in \nTijssen, Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology--Hybridization with Nucleic Probes, \"\nOverview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid assays\n\" (1993\n). Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5-10° C lower than the thermal melting point (T\nm\n) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength pH. The T\nm\n is the temperature (under defined ionic strength, pH, and nucleic concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to the target hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium (as the target sequences are present in excess, at T\nm\n, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium). Stringent conditions may be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M sodium ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M sodium ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30°C for short probes (including but not limited to, 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60° C for long probes (including but not limited to, greater than 50 nucleotides). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. For selective or specific hybridization, a positive signal may be at least two times background, optionally 10 times background hybridization. Exemplary stringent hybridization conditions can be as following: 50% formamide, 5X SSC, and 1% SDS, incubating at 42°C, or 5X SSC, 1% SDS, incubating at 65°C, with wash in 0.2X SSC, and 0.1% SDS at 65°C. Such washes can be performed for 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, or more minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"subject\" as used herein, refers to an animal, in some embodiments a mammal, and in other embodiments a human, who is the object of treatment, observation or experiment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"substantially purified\" refers to a polypeptide that may be substantially or essentially free of components that normally accompany or interact with the protein as found in its naturally occurring environment, i. e. a native cell, or host cell in the case of recombinantly produced polypeptide. A polypeptide that may be substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of protein having less than about 30%, less than about 25%, less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less than about 2%, or less than about 1% (by dry weight) of contaminating protein. When the polypeptide or variant thereof is recombinantly produced by the host cells, the protein may be present at about 30%, about 25%, about 20%, about 15%, about 10%, about 5%, about 4%, about 3%, about 2%, or about 1% or less of the dry weight of the cells. When the polypeptide or variant thereof is recombinantly produced by the host cells, the protein may be present in the culture medium at about 5g/L, about 4g/L, about 3g/L, about 2g/L, about 1g/L, about 750mg/L, about 500mg/L, about 250mg/L, about 100mg/L, about 50mg/L, about 10mg/L, or about 1mg/L or less of the dry weight of the cells. Thus, \"substantially purified\" polypeptide as produced by the methods described herein may have a purity level of at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, specifically, a purity level of at least about 75%, 80%, 85%, and more specifically, a purity level of at least about 90%, a purity level of at least about 95%, a purity level of at least about 99% or greater as determined by appropriate methods such as SDS/PAGE analysis, RP-HPLC, SEC, and capillary electrophoresis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"substituents\" includes but is not limited to \"non-interfering substituents.\" \"Non-interfering substituents\" are those groups that yield stable compounds. Suitable non-interfering substituents or radicals include, but are not limited to, halo, C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl, C\n2\n-C\n10\n alkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n10\n alkynyl, C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkoxy, C\n5\n-C\n12\n aralkyl, C\n3\n-C\n12\n cycloalkyl, C\n4\n-C\n12\n cycloalkenyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl, toluoyl, xylenyl, biphenyl, C\n2\n-C\n12\n alkoxyalkyl, C\n5\n-C\n12\n alkoxyaryl, C\n5\n-C\n12\n aryloxyalkyl, C\n7\n-C\n12\n oxyaryl, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkylsulfinyl, C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkylsulfonyl, - (CH\n2\n)\nm\n-O-(C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl) wherein m is from 1 to 8, aryl, substituted aryl, substituted alkoxy, fluoroalkyl, heterocyclic radical, substituted heterocyclic radical, nitroalkyl, -NO\n2\n, -CN, - NRC(O)-(C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl), -C(O)-(C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl), C\n2\n-C\n10\n alkthioalkyl, -C(O)O-(C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl), -OH, -SO\n2\n, =S, -COOH, -NR\n2\n, carbonyl, -C(O)-(C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl)-CF3, -C(O)-CF3, -C(O)NR2, -(C\n1\n-C\n10\n aryl)-S-(C\n6\n-C\n10\n aryl), -C(O)-(C6-C\n10\n aryl), -(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-O-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-O-(C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl) wherein each m is from 1 to 8, -C(O)NR\n2\n, -C(S)NR\n2\n, -SO\n2\nNR\n2\n, -NRC(O)NR\n2\n, -NRC(S)NR\n2\n, salts thereof, and the like. Each R group in the preceding list is independently selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl or substituted alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl, or alkaryl. Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulas, written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that would result from writing the structure from right to left, for example, -CH\n2\nO- is equivalent to -OCH\n2\n-.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstituents for alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals (including those groups often referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) can be one or more of a variety of groups selected from, but not limited to: -OR, =O, =NR, =N-OR, -NR\n2\n, -SR, -halogen, -SiR\n3\n, -OC(O)R, -C(O)R, -CO\n2\nR, -CONR\n2\n, -OC(O)NR\n2\n, -NRC(O)R, -NR-C(O)NR\n2\n, -NR(O)\n2\nR, -NR-C(NR\n2\n)=NR, -S(O)R, -S(O)\n2\nR, -S(O)\n2\nNR\n2\n, -NRSO\n2\nR, -CN and -NO\n2\n in a number ranging from zero to (2m'+1), where m' is the total number of carbon atoms in such a radical. Each R group in the preceding list is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, including but not limited to, aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or aralkyl groups. When two R groups are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, -NR\n2\n is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term \"alkyl\" is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (including but not limited to, -CF\n3\n and -CH\n2\nCF\n3\n) and acyl (including but not limited to, -C(O)CH\n3\n, -C(O)CF\n3\n, -C(O)CH\n2\nOCH\n3\n, and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for aryl and heteroaryl groups are varied and are selected from, but are not limited to-OR, =O, =NR, =N-OR, -NR\n2\n, -SR, -halogen, -SiR\n3\n, -OC(O)R, -C(O)R, -CO\n2\nR, -CONR\n2\n, -OC(O)NR\n2\n, -NRC(O)R, -NR-C(O)NR\n2\n, -NR(O)\n2\nR, -NR-C(NR\n2\n)=NR, -S(O)R, -S(O)\n2\nR, -S(O)\n2\nNR\n2\n, -NRSO\n2\nR, -CN, - NO\n2\n, -R, -N\n3\n, -CH(Ph)\n2\n, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, and fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and where each R group in the preceding list is independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, heteroalkyl, aryl and heteroaryl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn therapeutic applications, compositions containing the (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease, condition or disorder, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease, disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a \"therapeutically effective amount,\" and will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such therapeutically effective amounts by routine experimentation (\ne.g.,\n a dose escalation clinical trial).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"test ligand\" refers to an agent, which can be a compound, molecule or complex, which is being tested for its ability to bind to a non-natural amino acid polypeptide, such as a protein or-protein complex in its native form is known to be associated with or causative of a disease or condition in a living organism, such as a vertebrate, particularly a mammal and even more particularly a human. Since binding of a ligand to its non-natural amino acid polypeptide must occur for the ligand to have a direct effect on the non-natural amino acid polypeptide, binding as indicated by the present assay method is a strong indication of the therapeutic potential of a ligand identified as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA test ligand which can be assessed by the present method can be virtually any agent, including, but not limited to, metals, polypeptides, proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, polynucleotides and small organic molecules. A test ligand which is shown to bind a non-natural amino acid polypeptide is referred to as a ligand. Complex mixtures of substances, including but not limited to, natural product extracts, which include more than one test ligand can be tested and if there is a positive response (\ni.e.,\n if binding to the non-natural amino acid polypeptide occurs), the ligand which bound the non-natural amino acid polypeptide can be purified from the mixture prior to further assessment of its therapeutic potential.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"treating\" is used to refer to either prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"water soluble polymer\" refers to any polymer that is soluble in aqueous solvents. Linkage of water soluble polymers to a polypeptide can result in changes including, but not limited to, increased or modulated serum half-life, or increased or modulated therapeutic half-life relative to the unmodified form, modulated immunogenicity, modulated physical association characteristics such as aggregation and multimer formation, altered receptor binding, altered binding to one or more binding partners, and altered receptor dimerization or multimerization. The water soluble polymer may or may not have its own biological activity and may be utilized as a linker for attaching the polypeptide to other substances, including but not limited to one or more polypeptides, or one or more biologically active molecules. Suitable polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, mono C1-C10 alkoxy or aryloxy derivatives thereof (described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,252,714\n \n which is incorporated by reference herein), monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyamino acids, divinylether maleic anhydride, \nN\n-(2-Hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide, dextran, dextran derivatives including dextran sulfate, polypropylene glycol, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide copolymer, polyoxyethylated polyol, heparin, heparin fragments, polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, glycans, cellulose and cellulose derivatives, including but not limited to methylcellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose, starch and starch derivatives, polypeptides, polyalkylene glycol and derivatives thereof, copolymers of polyalkylene glycols and derivatives thereof, polyvinyl ethyl ethers, and alpha-beta-poly[(2-hydroxyethyl)-DL-aspartamide, and the like, or mixtures thereof. Examples of such water soluble polymers include but are not limited to polyethylene glycol and serum albumin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise indicated, conventional methods of mass spectroscopy, NMR, HPLC, protein chemistry, biochemistry, recombinant DNA techniques and pharmacology, within the skill of the art are employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds (including, but not limited to non-natural amino acids, (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides and reagents for producing either of the aforementioned compounds) presented herein include isotopically-labelled compounds, which are identical to those recited in the various formulas and structures presented herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the present compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine and chlorine such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH. \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, \n36\nCl, respectively. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds described herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as \n3\nH and \n14\nC are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, \ni.e\n., \n2\nH, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased \nin vivo\n half-life or reduced dosage requirements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the compounds herein (including, but not limited to non-natural amino acids, (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides and reagents for producing either of the aforementioned compounds) have asymmetric carbon atoms and can therefore exist as enantiomers or diastereomers. Diasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (\ne.g.,\n alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (\ne.g\n., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomers, enantiomers, and mixtures thereof are considered as part of the compositions described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn additional or further embodiments, the compounds described herein (including, but not limited to non-natural amino acids, (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides and reagents for producing either of the aforementioned compounds) are used in the form of prodrugs. In additional or further embodiments, the compounds described herein (including, but not limited to non-natural amino acids, (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides and reagents for producing either of the aforementioned compounds) are metabolized upon administration to an organism in need to produce a metabolite that is then used to produce a desired effect, including a desired therapeutic effect. In further or additional embodiments are active metabolites of non-natural amino acids and (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods and formulations described herein include the use of \nN\n-oxides, crystalline forms (also known as polymorphs), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of non-natural amino acids and (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides. In some situations, non-natural amino acids and (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides may exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the scope of the non-natural amino acids and (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides presented herein. In addition, the non-natural amino acids and (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the non-natural amino acids and (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art will recognize that some of the compounds herein (including, but not limited to non-natural amino acids, (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides and reagents for producing either of the aforementioned compounds) can exist in several tautomeric forms. All such tautomeric forms are considered as part of the compositions described herein. Also, for example all enol-keto forms of any compounds (including, but not limited to non-natural amino acids, (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides and reagents for producing either of the aforementioned compounds) herein are considered as part of the compositions described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the compounds herein (including, but not limited to non-natural amino acids, (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides and reagents for producing either of the aforementioned compounds) are acidic and may form a salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Some of the compounds herein (including, but not limited to non-natural amino acids, (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides and reagents for producing either of the aforementioned compounds) can be basic and accordingly, may form a salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable anion. All such salts, including di-salts are within the scope of the compositions described herein and they can be prepared by conventional methods. For example, salts can be prepared by contacting the acidic and basic entities, in either an aqueous, non-aqueous or partially aqueous medium. The salts are recovered by using at least one of the following techniques: filtration, precipitation with a non-solvent followed by filtration, evaporation of the solvent, or, in the case of aqueous solutions, lyophilization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSalts, for example, include: (1) acid addition salts, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; or formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, hexanoic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 4-methylbicyclo-[2.2.2]oct-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid, glucoheptonic acid, 4,4'-methylenebis-(3-hydroxy-2-ene-1 -carboxylic acid), 3-phenylpropionic acid, trimethylacetic acid, tertiary butylacetic acid, lauryl sulfuric acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, hydroxynaphthoic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, muconic acid, and the like; (2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, \ne.g\n., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base. Acceptable organic bases include ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, tromethamine, N-methylglucamine, and the like. Acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that a reference to a salt includes the solvent addition forms or crystal forms thereof, particularly solvates or polymorphs. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are often formed during the process of crystallization. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate.\n\n\n \n\n\nINCORPORATION BY REFERENCE\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAll publications, patents, and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent, or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference for all purposes.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe novel features of the invention are set forth with particularity in the appended claims.

Introduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nRecently, an entirely new technology in the protein sciences has been reported, which promises to overcome many of the limitations associated with site-specific modifications of proteins. Specifically, new components have been added to the protein biosynthetic machinery of the prokaryote \nEscherichia coli\n (\nE. coli\n) (\ne.g.,\n \nL. Wang, et al., (2001), Science 292:498-500\n) and the eukaryote \nSacchromyces cerevisiae\n (\nS. cerevisiae\n) (\ne.g.,\n \nJ. Chin et al., Science 301:964-7 (2003\n)), which has enabled the incorporation of non-natural amino acids to proteins \nin vivo.\n A number of new amino acids with novel chemical, physical or biological properties, including photoaffinity labels and photoisomerizable amino acids, keto amino acids, and glycosylated amino acids have been incorporated efficiently and with high fidelity into proteins in \nE. coli\n and in yeast in response to the amber codon, TAG, using this methodology. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nJ. W. Chin et al., (2002), Journal of the American Chemical Society 124:9026-9027\n (incorporated by reference in its entirety); \nJ. W. Chin, & P. G. Schultz, (2002), ChemBioChem 3(11):1135-1137\n (incorporated by reference in its entirety); \nJ. W. Chin, et al., (2002), PNAS United States of America 99:11020-11024\n (incorporated by reference in its entirety); and, \nL. Wang, & P. G. Schultz, (2002), Chem. Comm., 1:1-11\n (incorporated by reference in its entirety). These studies have demonstrated that it is possible to selectively and routinely introduce chemical functional groups that are not found in proteins, that are chemically inert to all of the functional groups found in the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids and that may be used to react efficiently and selectively to form stable covalent linkages.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nII. Overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFigure 1\n is an overview of the compositions, methods and techniques that are described herein. At one level, incorporated by reference from \n \nU.S. Patent Application Nos. 60/638,418\n \n, \n \n60/638,527\n \n, \n \n60/639,195\n \n, \n \n60/696,210\n \n, \n \n60/696,302\n \n, and \n \n60/696,068\n \n in their entirety are the tools (methods, compositions, techniques) for creating and using a polypeptide comprising at least one non-natural amino acid or modified non-natural amino acid. Such non-natural amino acid polypeptides may contain further functionality, including but not limited to, a label; a dye; a polymer; a water-soluble polymer; a derivative of polyethylene glycol; a photocrosslinker; a cytotoxic compound; a drug; an affinity label; a photoaffinity label; a reactive compound; a resin; a second protein or polypeptide or polypeptide analog; an antibody or antibody fragment; a metal chelator; a cofactor; a fatty acid; a carbohydrate; a polynucleotide; a DNA; a RNA; an antisense polynucleotide; a saccharide, a water-soluble dendrimer, a cyclodextrin, an inhibitory ribonucleic acid; a biomaterial; a nanoparticle; a spin label; a fluorophore, a metal-containing moiety; a radioactive moiety; a novel functional group; a group that covalently or noncovalently interacts with other molecules; a photocaged moiety; an actinic radiation excitable moiety; a photoisomerizable moiety; biotin; a derivative of biotin; a biotin analogue; a moiety incorporating a heavy atom; a chemically cleavable group; a photocleavable group; an elongated side chain; a carbon-linked sugar; a redox-active agent; an amino thioacid; a toxic moiety; an isotopically labeled moiety; a biophysical probe; a phosphorescent group; a chemiluminescent group; an electron dense group; a magnetic group; an intercalating group; a chromophore; an energy transfer agent; a biologically active agent; a detectable label; a small molecule; a quantum dot; a nanotransmitter; and any combination of the above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFigure 1\n, in one aspect are methods for selecting and designing a polypeptide to be modified using the methods, compositions and techniques are further described in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Nos. 60/638,418\n \n, \n \n60/638,527\n \n, \n \n60/639,195\n \n, \n \n60/696,210\n \n, \n \n60/696,302\n \n, and \n \n60/696,068\n \n which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. The new polypeptide may be designed \nde novo,\n including by way of example only, as part of high-throughput screening process (in which case numerous polypeptides may be designed, synthesized, characterized and/or tested) or based on the interests of the researcher. The new polypeptide may also be designed based on the structure of a known or partially characterized polypeptide. By way of example only, the Growth Hormone Gene Superfamily (see infra) has been the subject of intense study by the scientific community; a new polypeptide may be designed based on the structure of a member or members of this gene superfamily. The principles for selecting which amino acid(s) to substitute and/or modify are described separately herein. The choice of which modification to employ is also described herein, and can be used to meet the need of the experimenter or end user. Modifications include, by way of example only, manipulating the therapeutic effectiveness of the polypeptide, improving the safety profile of the polypeptide, adjusting the pharmacokinetics of the polypeptide, providing additional functionality to the polypeptide, incorporating a tag, label or detectable signal into the polypeptide, easing the isolation properties of the polypeptide, and any combination of the aforementioned modifications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, polypeptides comprising at least one non-natural amino acid or modified non-natural amino acid are further provided and described in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Nos. 60/638,418\n \n, \n \n60/638,527\n \n, \n \n60/639,195\n \n, \n \n60/696,210\n \n, \n \n60/696,302\n \n, and \n \n60/696,068\n \n which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. A very wide variety of non-naturally encoded amino acids are suitable for use in the present invention. Any number of non-naturally encoded amino acids can be introduced into a polypeptide. In general, the introduced non-naturally encoded amino acids are substantially chemically inert toward the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids (i.e., alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine). In some embodiments, the non-naturally encoded amino acids include side chain functional groups that react efficiently and selectively with functional groups not found in the 20 common amino acids (including but not limited to, azido, ketone, aldehyde and aminooxy groups) to form stable conjugates. Because the non-naturally encoded amino acids of the invention typically differ from the natural amino acids only in the structure of the side chain, the non-naturally encoded amino acids form amide bonds with other amino acids, including but not limited to, natural or non-naturally encoded, in the same manner in which they are formed in naturally occurring polypeptides. However, the non-naturally encoded amino acids have side chain groups that distinguish them from the natural amino acids. For example, the side chain (R group) optionally comprises an alkyl-, aryl-, acyl-, keto-, azido-, hydroxyl-, hydrazine, cyano-, halo-, hydrazide, alkenyl, alkynl, ether, thiol, seleno-, sulfonyl-, borate, boronate, phospho, phosphono, phosphine, heterocyclic, enone, imine, aldehyde, ester, thioacid, hydroxylamine, amino group, or the like or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther non-naturally occurring amino acids of interest that may be suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, amino acids comprising a photoactivatable cross-linker, spin-labeled amino acids, fluorescent amino acids, metal binding amino acids, metal-containing amino acids, radioactive amino acids, amino acids with novel functional groups, amino acids that covalently or noncovalently interact with other molecules, photocaged and/or photoisomerizable amino acids, amino acids comprising biotin or a biotin analogue, glycosylated amino acids such as a sugar substituted serine, other carbohydrate modified amino acids, keto-containing amino acids, amino acids comprising polyethylene glycol or polyether, heavy atom substituted amino acids, chemically cleavable and/or photocleavable amino acids, amino acids with an elongated side chains as compared to natural amino acids, including but not limited to, polyethers or long chain hydrocarbons, including but not limited to, greater than about 5 or greater than about 10 carbons, carbon-linked sugar-containing amino acids, redox-active amino acids, amino thioacid containing amino acids, and amino acids comprising one or more toxic moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of non-natural amino acids for incorporation into polypeptides are found in \n \nWO 2002/085923\n \n entitled \"In vivo incorporation of unnatural amino acids\" which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Methods and compositions for the in vivo incorporation of non-naturally encoded amino acids are described in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication 2003/0082575\n \n (Serial No. \n \n10/126,927\n \n) which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Methods for selecting an orthogonal tRNA-tRNA synthetase pair for use in \nin vivo\n translation system of an organism are also described in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publications 2003/0082575\n \n (Serial No. \n \n10/126,927\n \n) and \n \n2003/0108885\n \n (Serial No. \n \n10/126,931\n \n) which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. \n \nPCT Publication No. W0 04/035743\n \n entitled \"Site Specific Incorporation of Keto Amino Acids into Proteins,\" which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, describes orthogonal RS and tRNA pairs for the incorporation of keto amino acids. \n \nPCT Publication No. WO 04/094593\n \n entitled \"Expanding the Eukaryotic Genetic Code,\" which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, describes orthogonal RS and tRNA pairs for the incorporation of non-naturally encoded amino acids in eukaryotic host cells. Non-naturally encoded amino acids have side chain groups that distinguish them from the natural amino acids. The side chain may comprises an alkyl-, aryl-, acyl-, keto-, azido-, hydroxyl-, hydrazine, cyano-, halo-, hydrazide, alkenyl, alkynl, ether, thiol, seleno-, sulfonyl-, borate, boronate, phospho, phosphono, phosphine, heterocyclic, enone, imine, aldehyde, ester, thioacid, hydroxylamine, amino group, or the like or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, polypeptides with at least one non-natural amino acid or modified non-natural amino acid group include at least one post-translational modification at some position on the polypeptide. In some embodiments the post-translational modification occurs via the cellular machinery (\ne.g.,\n glycosylation, acetylation, acylation, lipid-modification, palmitoylation, palmitate addition, phosphorylation, glycolipid-linkage modification, and the like), in many instances, such cellular-machinery-based post-translational modifications occur at the naturally occurring amino acid sites on the polypeptide, however, in certain embodiments, the cellular-machinery-based post-translational modifications occur on the non-natural amino acid site(s) on the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments the post-translational modification does not utilize the cellular machinery, but is instead providing by attachment of a molecule (including but not limited to, a label; a dye; a polymer; a water-soluble polymer; a derivative of polyethylene glycol; a photocrosslinker; a cytotoxic compound; a drug; an affinity label; a photoaffinity label; a reactive compound; a resin; a second protein or polypeptide or polypeptide analog; an antibody or antibody fragment; a metal chelator; a cofactor; a fatty acid; a carbohydrate; a polynucleotide; a DNA; a RNA; an antisense polynucleotide; a saccharide, a water-soluble dendrimer, a cyclodextrin, an inhibitory ribonucleic acid; a biomaterial; a nanoparticle; a spin label; a fluorophore, a metal-containing moiety; a radioactive moiety; a novel functional group; a group that covalently or noncovalently interacts with other molecules; a photocaged moiety; an actinic radiation excitable moiety; a photoisomerizable moiety; biotin; a derivative of biotin; a biotin analogue; a moiety incorporating a heavy atom; a chemically cleavable group; a photocleavable group; an elongated side chain; a carbon-linked sugar; a redox-active agent; an amino thioacid; a toxic moiety; an isotopically labeled moiety; a biophysical probe; a phosphorescent group; a chemiluminescent group; an electron dense group; a magnetic group; an intercalating group; a chromophore; an energy transfer agent; a biologically active agent; a detectable label; a small molecule, a quantum dot; a nanotransmitter; and any combination of the above) comprising a second reactive group to the at least one non-natural amino acid comprising a first reactive group (including but not limited to, non-natural amino acid containing a ketone, aldehyde, acetal, hemiacetal, oxime, or hydroxylamine functional group) utilizing chemistry methodology that is known to one of ordinary skill in the art to be suitable for the particular reactive groups.

In general, the resulting post-translationally modified non-natural amino acid will contain at least one non-natural amino acid which may undergo subsequent modification reactions. Also included with this aspect are methods for producing, purifying, characterizing and using such reagents that are capable of any such post-translational modifications of such non-natural amino acid(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the protein includes at least one post-translational modification that is made \nin vivo\n by one host cell, where the post-translational modification is not normally made by another host cell type. In certain embodiments, the protein includes at least one post-translational modification that is made \nin vivo\n by a eukaryotic cell, where the post-translational modification is not normally made by a non-eukaryotic cell. Examples of post-translational modifications include, but are not limited to, glycosylation, acetylation, acylation, lipid-modification, palmitoylation, palmitate addition, phosphorylation, glycolipid-linkage modification, and the like. In one embodiment, the post-translational modification comprises attachment of an oligosaccharide to an asparagine by a GlcNAc-asparagine linkage (including but not limited to, where the oligosaccharide comprises (GlcNAc-Man)\n2\n-Man-GlcNAc-GlcNAc, and the like).

Location of non-natural amino acids in polypeptides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe non-natural amino acid polypeptides or a fragment thereof disclosed herein, include incorporation of one or more non-natural amino acids into a polypeptide. One or more non-natural amino acids may be incorporated at a particular position which does not disrupt activity of the polypeptide. This can be achieved by making \"conservative\" substitutions, including but not limited to, substituting hydrophobic amino acids with hydrophobic amino acids, bulky amino acids for bulky amino acids, hydrophilic amino acids for hydrophilic amino acids and/or inserting the non-natural amino acid in a location that is not required for activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of biochemical and structural approaches can be employed to select the desired sites for substitution with a non-natural amino acid within the polypeptide. Any position of the polypeptide chain is suitable for selection to incorporate a non-natural amino acid, and selection may be based on rational design or by random selection for any or no particular desired purpose. Selection of desired sites may be for producing a non-natural amino acid polypeptide (which may be further modified or remain unmodified) having any desired property or activity, including but not limited to agonists, super-agonists, inverse agonists, antagonists, receptor binding modulators, receptor activity modulators, modulators of binding to one or more binding partners, binding partner activity modulators, binding partner conformation modulators, dimer or multimer formation, no change to activity or property compared to the native molecule, or manipulating any physical or chemical property of the polypeptide such as solubility, aggregation, or stability. For example, locations in the polypeptide required for biological activity of a polypeptide can be identified using point mutation analysis, alanine scanning or homolog scanning methods known in the art. Methods similar to those described in \nCunningham, B. and Wells, J., Science, 244:1081-1085 (1989\n) and \nCunningham, B., et al. Science 243: 1330-1336 (1989\n) may be used to identify residues that are critical for bioactivity and/or may be used to identify antibody and receptor epitopes. \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,580,723\n \n; \n \n5,834,250\n \n; \n \n6,013,478\n \n; \n \n6,428,954\n \n; and \n \n6,451,561\n \n, which are incorporated by reference herein, describe methods for the systematic analysis of the structure and function of polypeptides by identifying active domains which influence the activity of the polypeptide with a target substance. Residues other than those identified as critical to biological activity by alanine or homolog scanning mutagenesis may be good candidates for substitution with a non-natural amino acid depending on the desired activity sought for the polypeptide. Alternatively, the sites identified as critical to biological activity may also be good candidates for substitution with a non-natural amino acid, again depending on the desired activity sought for the polypeptide. Another alternative would be to simply make serial substitutions in each position on the polypeptide chain with a non-natural amino acid and observe the effect on the activities of the polypeptide. It is readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that any means, technique, or method for selecting a position for substitution with a non-natural amino acid into any polypeptide is suitable for use in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure and activity of naturally-occurring mutants of a polypeptide that contain deletions can also be examined to determine regions of the protein that are likely to be tolerant of substitution with a non-natural amino acid. Once residues that are likely to be intolerant to substitution with non-natural amino acids have been eliminated, the impact of proposed substitutions at each of the remaining positions can be examined from the three-dimensional structure of the relevant polypeptide, and any associated ligands or binding proteins. X-ray crystallographic and NMR structures of many polypeptides are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB, www.rcsb.org), a centralized database containing three-dimensional structural data of large molecules of proteins and nucleic acids. Thus, those of ordinary skill in the art can readily identify amino acid positions that can be substituted with non-natural amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary sites of incorporation of a non-natural amino acid include, but are not limited to, those that are excluded from potential receptor binding regions, regions for binding to one or more binding partners, may be fully or partially solvent exposed, have minimal or no hydrogen-bonding interactions with nearby residues, may be minimally exposed to nearby reactive residues, may be on one or more of the exposed faces of the polypeptide, may be in regions that are highly flexible or structurally rigid as predicted by the three-dimensional, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of the polypeptide, bound or unbound to its associated receptor, ligand or binding proteins., or coupled or not coupled to another polypeptide or other biologically active molecule, or may modulate the conformation of the polypeptide itself or a dimer or multimer comprising one or more polypeptide, by altering the flexibility or rigidity of the complete structure as desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of non-natural amino acids can be substituted for, or incorporated into, a given position in a polypeptide. In general, a particular non-natural amino acid may be selected for incorporation based on an examination of the three dimensional crystal structure of a polypeptide with its associated ligand, receptor and/or binding proteins, secondary, tertiary or quaternary structure, a preference for conservative substitutions (\ni.e.,\n aryl-based non-natural amino acids, such as p-acetylphenylalanine or O-propargyltyrosine substituting for Phe, Tyr or Trp), and the specific conjugation chemistry that one desires to introduce into the polypeptide protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method further includes incorporating into the protein the non-natural amino acid, where the non-natural amino acid comprises a first reactive group; and contacting the protein with a molecule (including but not limited to a label; a dye; a polymer; a water-soluble polymer; a derivative of polyethylene glycol; a photocrosslinker; a cytotoxic compound; a drug; an affinity label; a photoaffinity label; a reactive compound; a resin; a second protein or polypeptide or polypeptide analog; an antibody or antibody fragment; a metal chelator; a cofactor; a fatty acid; a carbohydrate; a polynucleotide; a DNA; a RNA; an antisense polynucleotide; a saccharide; a water-soluble dendrimer; a cyclodextrin; an inhibitory ribonucleic acid; a biomaterial; a nanoparticle; a spin label; a fluorophore, a metal-containing moiety; a radioactive moiety; a novel functional group; a group that covalently or noncovalently interacts with other molecules; a photocaged moiety; an actinic radiation excitable moiety; a photoisomerizable moiety; biotin; a derivative of biotin; a biotin analogue; a moiety incorporating a heavy atom; a chemically cleavable group; a photocleavable group; an elongated side chain; a carbon-linked sugar; a redox-active agent; an amino thioacid; a toxic moiety; an isotopically labeled moiety; a biophysical probe; a phosphorescent group; a chemiluminescent group; an electron dense group; a magnetic group; an intercalating group; a chromophore; an energy transfer agent; a biologically active agent; a detectable label; a small molecule; a quantum dot; a nanotransmitter; and any combination of the above) that comprises a second reactive group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, the non-natural amino acid substitution(s) or incorporation(s) will be combined with other additions, substitutions, or deletions within the polypeptide to affect other biological traits. In some cases, the other additions, substitutions or deletions may increase the stability (including but not limited to, resistance to proteolytic degradation) of the polypeptide or increase affinity of the polypeptide for its appropriate receptor, ligand and/or binding proteins. In some cases, the other additions, substitutions or deletions may increase the solubility (including but not limited to, when expressed in \nE.\n \ncoli\n or other host cells) of the polypeptide. In some cases, sites are selected for substitution with a naturally encoded or non-natural amino acid in addition to another site for incorporation of a non-natural amino acid for the purpose of increasing the polypeptide solubility following expression in \nE.\n \ncoli\n recombinant host cells. In some cases, the polypeptides comprise another addition, substitution, or deletion that modulates affinity for the associated ligand, binding proteins, and/or receptor, modulates (including but not limited to, increases or decreases) receptor dimerization, stabilizes receptor dimers, modulates circulating half-life, modulates release or bio-availability, facilitates purification, or improves or alters a particular route of administration. Similarly, polypeptide can comprise chemical or enzyme cleavage sequences, protease cleavage sequences, reactive groups, antibody-binding domains (including but not limited to, FLAG or poly-His) or other affinity based sequences (including but not limited to, FLAG, poly-His, GST, \netc.)\n or linked molecules (including but not limited to, biotin) that improve detection (including but not limited to, GFP), purification, transport through tissues or cell membranes, prodrug release or activation, size reduction, or other traits of the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIV.

Antibody fragments include but are not limited to Fv, Fc, Fab, and (Fab') 2, single chain Fv (scFv), diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, bifunctional hybrid antibodies, CDR1, CDR2, CDR3, combinations of CDR's, variable regions, framework regions, constant regions, and the like (\nMaynard & Georgiou, 2000, Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2:339-76\n; \nHudson, 1998, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 9:395-402\n). Another functional substructure is a single chain Fv (scFv), comprised of the variable regions of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain, covalently connected by a peptide linker (\nS-z Hu et al., 1996, Cancer Research, 56, 3055-3061\n). These small (Mr 25,000) proteins generally retain specificity and affinity for antigen in a single polypeptide and can provide a convenient building block for larger, antigen-specific molecules. Polypeptides also include the antibody heavy chain, light chain, variable region, alternative scaffold non-antibody molecules, and bispecific antibodies, as well as other antigen-binding polypeptides or fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the following description of the growth hormone supergene family is provided for illustrative purposes and by way of example only and not as a limit on the scope of the methods, compositions, strategies and techniques described herein. Further, reference to GH polypeptides in this application is intended to use the generic term as an example of any member of the GH supergene family. Thus, it is understood that the modifications and chemistries described herein with reference to GH polypeptides or protein can be equally applied to any member of the GH supergene family, including those specifically listed herein or incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following proteins include those encoded by genes of the growth hormone (GH) supergene family (\nBazan, F., Immunology Today 11: 350-354 (1990\n); \nBazan, J. F. Science 257: 410-413 (1992\n); \nMott, H. R. and Campbell, I. D., Current Opinion in Structural Biology 5: 114-121 (1995\n); \nSilvennoinen, O. and Ihle, J. N., SIGNALLING BY THE HEMATOPOIETIC CYTOKINE RECEPTORS (1996\n)): growth hormone, prolactin, placental lactogen, erythropoietin (EPO), thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12 (p35 subunit), IL-13, IL-15, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, alpha interferon, beta interferon, gamma interferon, omega interferon, tau interferon, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) (\"the GH supergene family\"). It is anticipated that additional members of this gene family will be identified in the future through gene cloning and sequencing. Members of the GH supergene family have similar secondary and tertiary structures, despite the fact that they generally have limited amino acid or DNA sequence identity. The shared structural features allow new members of the gene family to be readily identified and the non-natural amino acid methods and compositions described herein and incorporated by reference similarly applied.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStructures of a number of cytokines, including G-CSF (\nZink et al., FEBS Lett. 314:435 (1992\n); \nZink et al., Biochemistry 33:8453 (1994\n); \nHill et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5167 (1993\n)), GM-CSF (\nDiederichs, K., et al. Science 154: 1779-1782 (1991\n); \nWalter et al., J. Mol. Biol. 224:1075-1085 (1992\n)), IL-2 (\nBazan, J. F. and McKay, D. B. Science 257: 410-413 (1992\n)), IL-4 (\nRedfield et al., Biochemistry 30: 11029-11035 (1991\n); \nPowers et al., Science 256:1673-1677 (1992\n)), and IL-5 (\nMilburn et al., Nature 363: 172-176 (1993\n)) have been determined by X-ray diffraction and NMR studies and show striking conservation with the GH structure, despite a lack of significant primary sequence homology. IFN is considered to be a member of this family based upon modeling and other studies (\nLee et al., J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 15:341 (1995\n); \nMurgolo et al., Proteins 17:62 (1993\n); \nRadhakrishnan et al., Structure 4:1453 (1996\n);\n Klavs et al., J. Mol. Biol. 274:661 (1997\n)). EPO is considered to be a member of this family based upon modeling and mutagenesis studies (\nBoissel et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 15983-15993 (1993\n); \nWen et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269: 22839-22846 (1994\n)). A large number of additional cytokines and growth factors including ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), thrombopoietin (TPO), oncostatin M, macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), IL-3, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), as well as the IFN's such as alpha, beta, omega, tau, epsilon, and gamma interferon belong to this family (reviewed in \nMott and Campbell, Current Opinion in Structural Biology 5: 114-121 (1995\n); \nSilvennoinen and Ihle (1996) SIGNALLING BY THE HEMATOPOIETIC CYTOKINE RECEPTORS\n). All of the above cytokines and growth factors are now considered to comprise one large gene family.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to sharing similar secondary and tertiary structures, members of this family share the property that they must oligomerize cell surface receptors to activate intracellular signaling pathways. Some GH family members, including but not limited to; GH and EPO, bind a single type of receptor and cause it to form homodimers. Other family members, including but not limited to, IL-2, IL4. and IL-6, bind more than one type of receptor and cause the receptors to form heterodimers or higher order aggregates (\nDavis et al., (1993) Science 260: 1805-1808\n; \nPaonessa et al., 1995) EMBO J. 14: 1942-1951\n; \nMott and Campbell, Current Opinion in Structural Biology 5: 114-121 (1995\n)). Mutagenesis studies have shown that, like GH, these other cytokines and growth factors contain multiple receptor binding sites, typically two, and bind their cognate receptors sequentially (\nMott and Campbell, Current Opinion in Structural Biology 5: 114-121 (1995\n); \nMatthews et al., (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93: 9471-9476\n). Like GH, the primary receptor binding sites for these other family members occur primarily in the four alpha helices and the A-B loop. The specific amino acids in the helical bundles that participate in receptor binding differ amongst the family members. Most of the cell surface receptors that interact with members of the GH supergene family are structurally related and comprise a second large multi-gene family. \nSee, e.g.\n \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,608,183\n \n, which is incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA general conclusion reached from mutational studies of various members of the GH supergene family is that the loops joining the alpha helices generally tend to not be involved in receptor binding. In particular the short B-C loop appears to be non-essential for receptor binding in most, if not all, family members. For this reason, the B-C loop may be substituted with non-natural amino acids as described herein in members of the GH supergene family. The A-B loop, the C-D loop (and D-E loop of interferon/ IL-10-like members of the GH superfamily) may also be substituted with a non-natural amino acid. Amino acids proximal to helix A and distal to the final helix also tend not to be involved in receptor binding and also may be sites for introducing non-natural amino acids. In some embodiments, a non-natural amino acid is substituted at any position within a loop structure including but not limited to the first 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or more amino acids of the A-B, B-C, C-D or D-E loop. In some embodiments, a non-natural amino acid is substituted within the last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or more amino acids of the A-B, B-C, C-D or D-E loop.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain members of the GH family, including but not limited to, EPO, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IFN, GM-CSF, TPO, IL-10, IL-12 p35, IL-13, IL-15 and beta interferon contain N-linked and/or O-linked sugars. The glycosylation sites in the proteins occur almost exclusively in the loop regions and not in the alpha helical bundles. Because the loop regions generally are not involved in receptor binding and because they are sites for the covalent attachment of sugar groups, they may be useful sites for introducing non-natural amino acid substitutions into the proteins. Amino acids that comprise the N- and O-linked glycosylation sites in the proteins may be sites for non-natural amino acid substitutions because these amino acids are surface-exposed. Therefore, the natural protein can tolerate bulky sugar groups attached to the proteins at these sites and the glycosylation sites tend to be located away from the receptor binding sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional members of the GH gene family are likely to be discovered in the future. New members of the GH supergene family can be identified through computer-aided secondary and tertiary structure analyses of the predicted protein sequences. Members of the GH supergene family typically possess four or five amphipathic helices joined by non-helical amino acids (the loop regions). The proteins may contain a hydrophobic signal sequence at their N-terminus to promote secretion from the cell. Such later discovered members of the GH supergene family also are included within the methods and compositions described herein. International Patent Application entitled \"Modified Four Helical Bundle Polypeptides and Their Uses\" (\n \nWO 05/074650 on August 18, 2005\n \n), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, provides methods for site selection and incorporation of non-natural amino acids into polypeptides.\n\n\n \n\n\n \nV\n. \nNon-natural Amino Acids\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA very wide variety of non-natural amino acids are suitable for use in the methods and compositions described herein as long as the non-natural amino acid has at least one of the following four properties: (1) at least one functional group on the sidechain of the non-natural amino acid with at least one characteristic and/or activity and/or reactivity orthogonal to the chemical reactivity of the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids (\ni.e.,\n alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine), or at least orthogonal to the chemical reactivity of the naturally occurring amino acids present in the polypeptide that includes the non-natural amino acid; (2) the introduced non-natural amino acid is substantially chemically inert toward the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids; (3) the non-natural amino acid can be stably incorporated into a polypeptide; the stability may be commensurate with the naturally-occurring amino acids or under typical physiological conditions, and such incorporation may occur via an \nin vivo\n system; and (4) the non-natural amino acid includes an oxime functional group or a functional group that can be transformed into an oxime group by reacting with a reagent, and may be reacted under conditions that do not destroy the biological properties of the polypeptide that includes the non-natural amino acid (unless of course such a destruction of biological properties is the purpose of the modification/transformation), or preferably where the transformation can occur under aqueous conditions at a pH between about 2 and about 10 or a pH between about 4 and about 8, and the reactive site on the non-natural amino acid may be an electrophilic site. Illustrative, non-limiting examples of amino acids that satisfy these four properties for non-natural amino acids that can be used with the compositions and methods further described in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Nos. 60/638,418\n \n, \n \n60/638,527\n \n, \n \n60/639,195\n \n, \n \n60/696,210\n \n, \n \n60/696,302\n \n, and \n \n60/696,068\n \n which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. Any number of non-natural amino acids can be introduced into the polypeptide. Non-natural amino acids may also include protected or masked oximes or protected or masked groups that can be transformed into an oxime group after deprotection of the protected group or unmasking of the masked group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-natural amino acids of interest that may be suitable for use in the methods and compositions described herein include, but are not limited to, amino acids comprising a photoactivatable cross-linker, spin-labeled amino acids, fluorescent amino acids, metal binding amino acids, metal-containing amino acids, radioactive amino acids, amino acids with novel functional groups, amino acids that covalently or noncovalently interact with other molecules, photocaged and/or photoisomerizable amino acids, amino acids comprising biotin or a biotin analogue, glycosylated amino acids such as a sugar substituted serine, other carbohydrate modified amino acids, keto-containing amino acids, amino acids comprising polyethylene glycol or polyether, heavy atom substituted amino acids, chemically cleavable and/or photocleavable amino acids, amino acids with an elongated side chains as compared to natural amino acids, including but not limited to, polyethers or long chain hydrocarbons, including but not limited to, greater than about 5 or greater than about 10 carbons, carbon-linked sugar-containing amino acids, redox-active amino acids, amino thioacid containing amino acids, and amino acids comprising one or more toxic moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, non-natural amino acids comprise a saccharide moiety. Examples of such amino acids include \nN\n-acetyl-L-glucosaminyl-L-serine, N-acetyl-L-galactosaminyl-L-serine, \nN\n-acetyl-L-glucosaminyl-L-threonine, \nN\n-acetyl-L-glucosaminyl-L-asparagine and \nO\n-mannosaminyl-L-serine. Examples of such amino acids also include examples where the naturally-occurring N- or O- linkage between the amino acid and the saccharide is replaced by a covalent linkage not commonly found in nature - including but not limited to, an alkene, an oxime, a thioether, an amide and the like. Examples of such amino acids also include saccharides that are not commonly found in naturally-occurring proteins such as 2-deoxy-glucose, 2-deoxygalactose and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chemical moieties via non-natural amino acids that can be incorporated into proteins offer a variety of advantages and manipulations of the protein. For example, the unique reactivity of a carbonyl functional group (including a keto functional group) allows selective modification of proteins with any of a number of hydrazine- or hydroxylamine-containing reagents \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo.\n A heavy atom non-natural amino acid, for example, can be useful for phasing X-ray structure data. The site-specific introduction of heavy atoms using non-natural amino acids also provides selectivity and flexibility in choosing positions for heavy atoms. Photoreactive non-natural amino acids (including but not limited to, amino acids with benzophenone and arylazides (including but not limited to, phenylazide) side chains), for example, allow for efficient \nin vivo\n and \nin vitro\n photocrosslinking of protein. Examples of photoreactive non-natural amino acids include, but are not limited to, p-azido-phenylalanine and p-benzoyl-phenylalanine. The protein with the photoreactive non-natural amino acids can then be crosslinked at will by excitation of the photoreactive group-providing temporal control. In one example, the methyl group of a non-natural amino can be substituted with an isotopically labeled, including but not limited to, methyl group, as a probe of local structure and dynamics, including but not limited to, with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance and vibrational spectroscopy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany non-naturally encoded amino acids are commercially available, e.g., from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), Novabiochem (a division of EMD Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany), or Peptech (Burlington, MA, USA). Those that are not commercially available are optionally synthesized. For organic synthesis techniques, see, e.g., \nOrganic Chemistry by Fessendon and Fessendon, (1982, Second Edition, Willard Grant Press, Boston Mass\n.); \nAdvanced Organic Chemistry by March (Third Edition, 1985, Wiley and Sons, New York\n); and \nAdvanced Organic Chemistry by Carey and Sundberg (Third Edition, Parts A and B, 1990, Plenum Press, New York\n). Many non-natural amino acids are based on natural amino acids, such as tyrosine, glutamine, phenylalanine, and the like.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA. Cellular uptake of non-natural amino acids\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nNon-natural amino acid uptake by a eukaryotic cell is one issue that is typically considered when designing and selecting non-natural amino acids, including but not limited to, for incorporation into a protein. For example, the high charge density of α-amino acids suggests that these compounds are unlikely to be cell permeable. Natural amino acids are taken up into the eukaryotic cell via a collection of protein-based transport systems. A rapid screen can be done which assesses which non-natural amino acids, if any, are taken up by cells. \nSee, e.g.,\n the toxicity assays in, \ne.g.,\n U.S. Patent Publication No. \n \nUS 2004/0198637\n \n entitled \"Protein Arrays,\" which is incorporated by reference; and\n Liu, D.R. & Schultz, P.G. (1999) Progress toward the evolution of an organism with an expanded genetic code. PNAS United States 96:4780-4785\n. Although uptake is easily analyzed with various assays, an alternative to designing non-natural amino acids that are amenable to cellular uptake pathways is to provide biosynthetic pathways to create amino acids \nin vivo.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nB. Biosynthesis of Non-natural Amino Acids\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMany biosynthetic pathways already exist in cells for the production of amino acids and other compounds. While a biosynthetic method for a particular non-natural amino acid may not exist in nature, including but not limited to, in a eukaryotic cell, the methods and compositions described herein include such methods. For example, biosynthetic pathways for non-natural amino acids are optionally generated in host cell by adding new enzymes or modifying existing host cell pathways. Additional new enzymes are optionally naturally occurring enzymes or artificially evolved enzymes. For example, the biosynthesis of p-aminophenylalanine (as presented in an example in \n \nWO 2002/085923\n \n entitled \"\nIn vivo\n incorporation of unnatural amino acids\") relies on the addition of a combination of known enzymes from other organisms. The genes for these enzymes can be introduced into a eukaryotic cell by transforming the cell with a plasmid comprising the genes. The genes, when expressed in the cell, provide an enzymatic pathway to synthesize the desired compound. Examples of the types of enzymes that are optionally added are provided in the examples below. Additional enzymes sequences are found, for example, in Genbank. Artificially evolved enzymes are also optionally added into a cell in the same manner. In this manner, the cellular machinery and resources of a cell are manipulated to produce non-natural amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of methods are available for producing novel enzymes for use in biosynthetic pathways or for evolution of existing pathways. For example, recursive recombination, including but not limited to, as developed by Maxygen, Inc. (available on the World Wide Web at www.maxygen.com), is optionally used to develop novel enzymes and pathways. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nStemmer (1994), Rapid evolution of a protein in vitro by DNA shuffling, Nature 370(4):389-391\n; and, \nStemmer, (1994), DNA shuffling by random fragmentation and reassembly: In vitro recombination for molecular evolution, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 91:10747-10751\n. Similarly DesignPath™, developed by Genencor (available on the World Wide Web at genencor.com) is optionally used for metabolic pathway engineering, including but not limited to, to engineer a pathway to create O-methyl-L-tyrosine in a cell. This technology reconstructs existing pathways in host organisms using a combination of new genes, including but not limited to, identified through functional genomics, and molecular evolution and design. Diversa Corporation (available on the world wide web at diversa.com) also provides technology for rapidly screening libraries of genes and gene pathways, including but not limited to, to create new pathways.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, the non-natural amino acid produced with an engineered biosynthetic pathway is produced in a concentration sufficient for efficient protein biosynthesis, including but not limited to, a natural cellular amount, but not to such a degree as to affect the concentration of the other amino acids or exhaust cellular resources. Typical concentrations produced \nin vivo\n in this manner are about 10 mM to about 0.05 mM. Once a cell is transformed with a plasmid comprising the genes used to produce enzymes desired for a specific pathway and a non-natural amino acid is generated, \nin vivo\n selections are optionally used to further optimize the production of the non-natural amino acid for both ribosomal protein synthesis and cell growth.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVI.

Compositions and Methods Comprising Nucleic Acids and Oligonucleotides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. General Recombinant Nucleic Acid Methods For Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. Patent Application Nos. 60/638,418\n \n, \n \n60/638,527\n \n, \n \n60/639,195\n \n, \n \n60/696,210\n \n, \n \n60/696,302\n \n, and \n \n60/696,068\n \n; and \n \nPCT Publication WO 05/074650\n \n entitled \"Modified Four Helical Bundle Polypeptides and Their Uses,\" which are incorporated by reference herein, discuss nucleic acids encoding a polypeptide of interest (including by way of example a GH polypeptide), and how it may be isolated, cloned and often altered using recombinant methods. Such embodiments are used, including but not limited to, for protein expression or during the generation of variants, derivatives, expression cassettes, or other sequences derived from a polypeptide. In some embodiments, the sequences encoding the polypeptides are operably linked to a heterologous promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide comprising a non-natural amino acid may be synthesized on the basis of the amino acid sequence of the parent polypeptide, and then changing the nucleotide sequence so as to effect introduction (\ni.e.,\n incorporation or substitution) or removal (\ni.e.,\n deletion or substitution) of the relevant amino acid residue(s). The nucleotide sequence may be conveniently modified by site-directed mutagenesis in accordance with conventional methods. Alternatively, the nucleotide sequence may be prepared by chemical synthesis, including but not limited to, by using an oligonucleotide synthesizer, wherein oligonucleotides are designed based on the amino acid sequence of the desired polypeptide, and preferably selecting those codons that are favored in the host cell in which the recombinant polypeptide will be produced. For example, several small oligonucleotides coding for portions of the desired polypeptide may be synthesized and assembled by PCR, ligation or ligation chain reaction. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nBarany, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 88: 189-193 (1991\n); \n \nU.S. 6,521,427\n \n which are incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nB. Selector Codons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSelector codons encompassed within the methods and compositions further described in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Nos. 60/638,418\n \n, \n \n60/638,527\n \n, \n \n60/639,195\n \n, \n \n60/696,210\n \n, \n \n60/696,302\n \n, and \n \n60/696,068\n \n; and \n \nPCT Publication WO 05/074650\n \n entitled \"Modified Four Helical Bundle Polypeptides and Their Uses,\" which are incorporated by reference in their entirety expand the genetic codon framework of protein biosynthetic machinery. For example, a selector codon includes, but is not limited to, a unique three base codon, a nonsense codon, such as a stop codon, including but not limited to, an amber codon (UAG), or an opal codon (UGA), an ochre codon, a unnatural codon, a four or more base codon, a rare codon, or the like. There is a wide range in the number of selector codons that can be introduced into a desired gene, including but not limited to, one or more, two or more, three or more, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more in a single polynucleotide encoding at least a portion of a polypeptide of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, it involves the use of a selector codon that is a stop codon for the incorporation of one or more non-natural amino acids \nin vivo.\n The incorporation of non-natural amino acids \nin vivo\n can be done without significant perturbation of the eukaryotic host cell. Selector codons also comprise extended codons, including but not limited to, four or more base codons, such as, four, five, six or more base codons. For a given system, a selector codon can also include one of the natural three base codons, where the endogenous system does not use (or rarely uses) the natural base codon. Selector codons optionally include unnatural base pairs. These unnatural base pairs further expand the existing genetic alphabet. For \nin vivo\n usage, the unnatural nucleoside is membrane permeable and is phosphorylated to form the corresponding triphosphate. In addition, the increased genetic information is stable and not destroyed by cellular enzymes. A translational bypassing system can also be used to incorporate a non-natural amino acid in a desired polypeptide. In certain embodiments, the protein or polypeptide of interest (or portion thereof) is encoded by a nucleic acid. Typically, the nucleic acid comprises at least one selector codon, at least two selector codons, at least three selector codons, at least four selector codons, at least five selector codons, at least six selector codons, at least seven selector codons, at least eight selector codons, at least nine selector codons, ten or more selector codons.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVIII. In vivo generation of polypeptides comprising non-natural amino acids\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe polypeptides can be generated \nin vivo\n using modified tRNA and tRNA synthetases to add to or substitute amino acids that are not encoded in naturally-occurring systems.

These methods involve generating a translational machinery that functions independently of the synthetases and tRNAs endogenous to the translation system (and are therefore sometimes referred to as \"orthogonal\"). In further or additional embodiments, the translation system comprises an orthogonal tRNA (O-tRNA) and an orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (O-RS). A wide variety of orthogonal tRNAs and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases have been described in the art for inserting particular synthetic amino acids into polypeptides, and are generally suitable for in the methods to produce the non-natural amino acid polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUse of O-tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases involves selection of a specific codon which encodes the non-natural amino acid. While any codon can be used, it is generally desirable to select a codon that is rarely or never used in the cell in which the O-tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is expressed. Specific selector codon(s) can be introduced into appropriate positions in the polynucleotide coding sequence using mutagenesis methods known in the art (including but not limited to, site-specific mutagenesis, cassette mutagenesis, restriction selection mutagenesis, \netc.).\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA. Expression in Non-eukaryotes and Eukaryotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo obtain high level expression of a cloned polynucleotide, one typically subclones polynucleotides encoding a desired polypeptide into an expression vector that contains a strong promoter to direct transcription, a transcription/translation terminator, and if for a nucleic acid encoding a protein, a ribosome binding site for translational initiation.

For example, the post-translation modification is further described in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Nos. 60/638,418\n \n, \n \n60/638,527\n \n, \n \n60/639,195\n \n, \n \n60/696,210\n \n, \n \n60/696,302\n \n, and \n \n60/696,068\n \n; and \n \nWO 05/074650\n \n entitled \"Modified Four Helical Bundle Polypeptides and Their Uses which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne advantage of a non-natural amino acid is that it presents additional chemical moieties that can be used to add additional molecules. These modifications can be made \nin vivo\n in a eukaryotic or non-eukaryotic cell, or \nin vitro.\n Thus, in certain embodiments, the post-translational modification is through the non-natural amino acid.\n\n\n \n\n\n \nIX\n. \nExpression in Alternate Systems\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSeveral strategies have been employed to introduce unnatural amino acids into proteins in non-recombinant host cells, mutagenized host cells, or in cell-free systems. These systems are also suitable for use in making the non-natural amino acid polypeptides. Derivatization of amino acids with reactive side-chains such as Lys, Cys and Tyr resulted in the conversion of lysine to N\n2\n-acetyl-lysine. Chemical synthesis also provides a straightforward method to incorporate unnatural amino acids. With the recent development of enzymatic ligation and native chemical ligation of peptide fragments, it is possible to make larger proteins. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nP. E. Dawson and S. B. H. Kent, Annu. Rev. Biochem, 69:923 (2000\n). Chemical peptide ligation and native chemical ligation are described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,184,344\n \n, \n \nU.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0138412\n \n, \n \nU.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0208046\n \n, \n \nWO 02/098902\n \n, and \n \nWO 03/042235\n \n, which are incorporated by reference herein. A general in vitro biosynthetic method in which a suppressor tRNA chemically acylated with the desired unnatural amino acid is added to an in vitro extract capable of supporting protein biosynthesis, has been used to site-specifically incorporate over 100 unnatural amino acids into a variety of proteins of virtually any size. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nV. W. Cornish, D. Mendel and P. G. Schultz, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 1995, 34:621 (1995\n); \nC.J. Noren, S.J. Anthony-Cahill, M.C. Griffith, P.G. Schultz, A general method for site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins, Science 244:182-188 (1989\n); and, \nJ.D. Bain, C.G. Glabe, T.A. Dix, A.R. Chamberlin, E.S. Diala, Biosynthetic site-specific incorporation of a non-natural amino acid into a polypeptide, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111:8013-8014 (1989\n). A broad range of functional groups has been introduced into proteins for studies of protein stability, protein folding, enzyme mechanism, and signal transduction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn in vivo method, termed selective pressure incorporation, was developed to exploit the promiscuity of wild-type synthetases. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nN. Budisa, C. Minks, S. Alefelder, W. Wenger, F. M. Dong, L. Moroder and R. Huber, FASEB J., 13:41 (1999\n). An auxotrophic strain, in which the relevant metabolic pathway supplying the cell with a particular natural amino acid is switched off, is grown in minimal media containing limited concentrations of the natural amino acid, while transcription of the target gene is repressed. At the onset of a stationary growth phase, the natural amino acid is depleted and replaced with the unnatural amino acid analog. Induction of expression of the recombinant protein results in the accumulation of a protein containing the unnatural analog. For example, using this strategy, o, m and p-fluorophenylalanines have been incorporated into proteins, and exhibit two characteristic shoulders in the UV spectrum which can be easily identified, \nsee, e.g.,\n \nC. Minks, R. Huber, L. Moroder and N. Budisa, Anal. Biochem., 284:29 (2000\n); trifluoromethionine has been used to replace methionine in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme to study its interaction with chitooligosaccharide ligands by \n19\nF NMR, \nsee, e.g.,\n \nH. Duewel, E. Daub, V. Robinson and J. F. Honek, Biochemistry, 36:3404 (1997\n); and trifluoroleucine has been incorporated in place of leucine, resulting in increased thermal and chemical stability of a leucine-zipper protein. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nY. Tang, G. Ghirlanda, W. A. Petka, T. Nakajima, W. F. DeGrado and D. A. Tirrell, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 40:1494 (2001\n). Moreover, selenomethionine and telluromethionine are incorporated into various recombinant proteins to facilitate the solution of phases in X-ray crystallography. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nW. A. Hendrickson, J. R. Horton and D. M. Lemaster, EMBO J., 9:1665 (1990\n);\n J. O. Boles, K. Lewinski, M. Kunkle, J. D. Odom, B. Dunlap, L. Lebioda and M. Hatada, Nat. Struct. Biol., 1:283 (1994\n); \nN. Budisa, B. Steipe, P. Demange, C. Eckerskorn, J. Kellermann and R. Huber, Eur. J. Biochem., 230:788 (1995\n); and, \nN. Budisa, W. Karnbrock, S. Steinbacher, A. Humm, L. Prade, T. Neuefeind, L. Moroder and R. Huber, J. Mol. Biol., 270:616 (1997\n). Methionine analogs with alkene or alkyne functionalities have also been incorporated efficiently, allowing for additional modification of proteins by chemical means. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nJ. C. van Hest and D. A. Tirrell, FEBS Lett., 428:68 (1998\n); \nJ. C.. van Hest, K. L. Kiick and D. A. Tirrell, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 122:1282 (2000\n); and, \nK. L. Kiick and D. A. Tirrell, Tetrahedron, 56:9487 (2000\n); \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,586,207\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent Publication 2002/0042097\n \n, which are incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe success of this method depends on the recognition of the unnatural amino acid analogs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which, in general, require high selectivity to insure the fidelity of protein translation. One way to expand the scope of this method is to relax the substrate specificity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which has been achieved in a limited number of cases. For example, replacement of Ala\n294\n by Gly in \nEscherichia coli\n phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) increases the size of substrate binding pocket, and results in the acylation of tRNAPhe by p-Cl-phenylalanine (p-Cl-Phe). \nSee,\n \nM. Ibba, P. Kast and H. Hennecke, Biochemistry, 33:7107 (1994\n). An \nEscherichia coli\n strain harboring this mutant PheRS allows the incorporation of p-Cl-phenylalanine or p-Br-phenylalanine in place of phenylalanine. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nM. Ibba and H. Hennecke, FEBS Lett., 364:272 (1995\n); and, \nN. Sharma, R. Furter, P. Kast and D. A. Tirrell, FEBS Lett., 467:37 (2000\n). Similarly, a point mutation Phe130Ser near the amino acid binding site of \nEscherichia coli\n tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was shown to allow azatyrosine to be incorporated more efficiently than tyrosine. \nSee,\n \n F. Hamano-Takaku, T. Iwama, S. Saito-Yano, K. Takaku, Y. Monden, M. Kitabatake, D. Soll and S. Nishimura, J. Biol. Chem., 275:40324 (2000\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother strategy to incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins in vivo is to modify synthetases that have proofreading mechanisms. These synthetases cannot discriminate and therefore activate amino acids that are structurally similar to the cognate natural amino acids. This error is corrected at a separate site, which deacylates the mischarged amino acid from the tRNA to maintain the fidelity of protein translation. If the proofreading activity of the synthetase is disabled, structural analogs that are misactivated may escape the editing function and be incorporated. This approach has been demonstrated recently with the valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS). \nSee,\n \nV. Doring, H. D. Mootz, L. A. Nangle, T. L. Hendrickson, V. de Crecy-Lagard, P. Schimmel and P. Marliere, Science, 292:501 (2001\n). ValRS can misaminoacylate tRNAVal with Cys, Thr, or aminobutyrate (Abu); these noncognate amino acids are subsequently hydrolyzed by the editing domain. After random mutagenesis of the \nEscherichia coli\n chromosome, a mutant \nEscherichia coli\n strain was selected that has a mutation in the editing site of VaIRS. This edit-defective ValRS incorrectly charges tRNAVal with Cys. Because Abu sterically resembles Cys (-SH group of Cys is replaced with -CH3 in Abu), the mutant ValRS also incorporates Abu into proteins when this mutant \nEscherichia coli\n strain is grown in the presence of Abu. Mass spectrometric analysis shows that about 24% of valines are replaced by Abu at each valine position in the native protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid-phase synthesis and semisynthetic methods have also allowed for the synthesis of a number of proteins containing novel amino acids. For example, see the following publications and references cited within, which are as follows: \nCrick, F.H.C., Barrett, L. Brenner, S. Watts-Tobin, R.

See the following publications and references cited within: \nBrunner, J. New Photolabeling and crosslinking methods, Annu.

Sci, 83(22):8604-8608 (1986\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreviously, it has been shown that unnatural amino acids can be site-specifically incorporated into proteins in vitro by the addition of chemically aminoacylated suppressor tRNAs to protein synthesis reactions programmed with a gene containing a desired amber nonsense mutation. Using these approaches, one can substitute a number of the common twenty amino acids with close structural homologues, e.g., fluorophenylalanine for phenylalanine, using strains auxotropic for a particular amino acid. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nNoren, C.J., Anthony-Cahill, Griffith, M.C., Schultz, P.G. A general method for site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins, Science, 244: 182-188 (1989\n); \nM.W.

Site-Directed Mutagenesis with an Expanded Genetic Code, Annu Rev Biophys. Biomol Struct. 24, 435-62 (1995\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a suppressor tRNA was prepared that recognized the stop codon UAG and was chemically aminoacylated with an unnatural amino acid. Conventional site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the stop codon TAG, at the site of interest in the protein gene. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nSayers, J.R., Schmidt, W. Eckstein, F. 5'\n-3\n' Exonucleases in phosphorothioate-based olignoucleotide-directed mutagensis, Nucleic Acids Res, 16(3):791-802 (1988\n). When the acylated suppressor tRNA and the mutant gene were combined in an in vitro transcription/translation system, the unnatural amino acid was incorporated in response to the UAG codon which gave a protein containing that amino acid at the specified position. Experiments using [\n3\nH]-Phe and experiments with α-hydroxy acids demonstrated that only the desired amino acid is incorporated at the position specified by the UAG codon and that this amino acid is not incorporated at any other site in the protein. \nSee, e.g.,\n Noren, et al, \nsupra;\n \nKobayashi et al., (2003) Nature Structural Biology 10(6):425-432\n; and, \nEllman, J.A., Mendel, D., Schultz, P.G. Site-specific incorporation of novel backbone structures into proteins, Science, 255(5041):197-200 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA tRNA may be aminoacylated with a desired amino acid by any method or technique, including but not limited to, chemical or enzymatic aminoacylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAminoacylation may be accomplished by aminoacyl tRNA synthetases or by other enzymatic molecules, including but not limited to, ribozymes. The term \"ribozyme\" is interchangeable with \"catalytic RNA.\" Cech and coworkers (\nCech, 1987, Science, 236:1532-1539\n; \nMcCorkle et al., 1987, Concepts Biochem. 64:221-226\n) demonstrated the presence of naturally occurring RNAs that can act as catalysts (ribozymes). However, although these natural RNA catalysts have only been shown to act on ribonucleic acid substrates for cleavage and splicing, the recent development of artificial evolution of ribozymes has expanded the repertoire of catalysis to various chemical reactions. Studies have identified RNA molecules that can catalyze aminoacyl-RNA bonds on their own (2')3'-termini (\nIllangakekare et al., 1995 Science 267:643-647\n), and an RNA molecule which can transfer an amino acid from one RNA molecule to another (\nLohse et al., 1996, Nature 381:442-444\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication 2003/0228593\n \n, which is incorporated by reference herein, describes methods to construct ribozymes and their use in aminoacylation of tRNAs with naturally encoded and non-naturally encoded amino acids. Substrate-immobilized forms of enzymatic molecules that can aminoacylate tRNAs, including but not limited to, ribozymes, may enable efficient affinity purification of the aminoacylated products. Examples of suitable substrates include agarose, sepharose, and magnetic beads. The production and use of a substrate-immobilized form of ribozyme for aminoacylation is described in \nChemistry and Biology 2003, 10:1077-1084\n and \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication 2003/0228593\n \n, which is incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemical aminoacylation methods include, but are not limited to, those introduced by Hecht and coworkers (\nHecht, S. M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1992, 25, 545\n; \nHeckler, T. G.; Roesser, J. R.; Xu, C.; Chang, P.; Hecht, S. M. Biochemistry 1988, 27, 7254\n; \nHecht, S. M.; Alford, B. L.; Kuroda, Y.; Kitano, S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996, 271, 23169\n; \nHohsaka, T. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 34\n), to avoid the use of synthetases in aminoacylation. Such methods or other chemical aminoacylation methods may be used to aminoacylate tRNA molecules of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for generating catalytic RNA may involve generating separate pools of randomized ribozyme sequences, performing directed evolution on the pools, screening the pools for desirable aminoacylation activity, and selecting sequences of those ribozymes exhibiting desired aminoacylation activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRibozymes can comprise motifs and/or regions that facilitate acylation activity, such as a GGU motif and a U-rich region. For example, it has been reported that U-rich regions can facilitate recognition of an amino acid substrate, and a GGU-motif can form base pairs with the 3' termini of a tRNA. In combination, the GGU and motif and U-rich region facilitate simultaneous recognition of both the amino acid and tRNA simultaneously, and thereby facilitate aminoacylation of the 3' terminus of the tRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRibozymes can be generated by \nin vitro\n selection using a partially randomized r24mini conjugated with tRNA\nAsn\n \nCCCG\n, followed by systematic engineering of a consensus sequence found in the active clones. An exemplary ribozyme obtained by this method is termed \"Fx3 ribozyme\" and is described in \n \nU.S. Pub. App. No. 2003/0228593\n \n, the contents of which is incorporated by reference herein, acts as a versatile catalyst for the synthesis of various aminoacyl-tRNAs charged with cognate non-natural amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAminoacylate tRNAs ribozymes can be immobilized on a substrate so as to enable efficient affinity purification of the aminoacylated tRNAs. Examples of suitable substrates include, but are not limited to, agarose, sepharose, and magnetic beads. Ribozymes can be immobilized on resins by taking advantage of the chemical structure of RNA, such as the 3'-cis-diol on the ribose of RNA can be oxidized with periodate to yield the corresponding dialdehyde to facilitate immobilization of the RNA on the resin. Various types of resins can be used including inexpensive hydrazide resins wherein reductive amination makes the interaction between the resin and the ribozyme an irreversible linkage. Synthesis of aminoacyl-tRNAs can be significantly facilitated by this on-column aminoacylation technique. \nKourouklis et al. Methods 2005; 36:239-4\n describe a column-based aminoacylation system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsolation of the aminoacylated tRNAs can be accomplished in a variety of ways. One suitable method is to elute the aminoacylated tRNAs from a column with a buffer such as a sodium acetate solution with 10 mM EDTA, a buffer containing 50 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N'-(3-propanesulfonic acid), 12.5 mM KCl, pH 7.0, 10 mM EDTA, or simply an EDTA buffered water (pH 7.0).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aminoacylated tRNAs can be added to translation reactions in order to incorporate the amino acid with which the tRNA was aminoacylated in a position of choice in a polypeptide made by the translation reaction. Examples of translation systems in which the aminoacylated tRNAs of the present invention may be used include, but are not limited to cell lysates. Cell lysates provide reaction components necessary for in vitro translation of a polypeptide from an input mRNA. Examples of such reaction components include but are not limited to ribosomal proteins, rRNA, amino acids, tRNAs, GTP, ATP, translation initiation and elongation factors and additional factors associated with translation. Additionally, translation systems may be batch translations or compartmentalized translation. Batch translation systems combine reaction components in a single compartment while compartmentalized translation systems separate the translation reaction components from reaction products that can inhibit the translation efficiency. Such translation systems are available commercially.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, a coupled transcription/translation system may be used. Coupled transcription/translation systems allow for both transcription of an input DNA into a corresponding mRNA, which is in turn translated by the reaction components. An example of a commercially available coupled transcription/translation is the Rapid Translation System (RTS, Roche Inc.). The system includes a mixture containing E. coli lysate for providing translational components such as ribosomes and translation factors. Additionally, an RNA polymerase is included for the transcription of the input DNA into an mRNA template for use in translation. RTS can use compartmentalization of the reaction components by way of a membrane interposed between reaction compartments, including a supply/waste compartment and a transcription/translation compartment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAminoacylation of tRNA may be performed by other agents, including but not limited to, transferases, polymerases, catalytic antibodies, multi-functional proteins, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStephan in Scientist 2005 \n describes additional methods to incorporate non-naturally encoded amino acids into proteins. \nLu et al. in Mol Cell. 2001 Oct;8(4):759-69\n describe a method in which a protein is chemically ligated to a synthetic peptide containing unnatural amino acids (expressed protein ligation).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroinjection techniques have also been use incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nM. W. Nowak, P. C. Kearney, J. R. Sampson, M. E. Saks, C. G. Labarca, S. K. Silverman, W. G. Zhong, J. Thorson, J. N. Abelson, N. Davidson, P. G. Schultz, D. A. Dougherty and H. A. Lester, Science, 268:439 (1995\n); and, \nD. A. Dougherty, Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., 4:645 (2000\n). A Xenopus oocyte was coinjected with two RNA species made in vitro: an mRNA encoding the target protein with a UAG stop codon at the amino acid position of interest and an amber suppressor tRNA aminoacylated with the desired unnatural amino acid. The translational machinery of the oocyte then inserts the unnatural amino acid at the position specified by UAG. This method has allowed in vivo structure-function studies of integral membrane proteins, which are generally not amenable to in vitro expression systems. Examples include the incorporation of a fluorescent amino acid into tachykinin neurokinin-2 receptor to measure distances by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, see, e.g., \nG. Turcatti, K. Nemeth, M. D. Edgerton, U. Meseth, F. Talabot, M. Peitsch, J. Knowles, H. Vogel and A. Chollet, J. Biol. Chem., 271:19991 (1996\n); the incorporation of biotinylated amino acids to identify surface-exposed residues in ion channels, see, e.g., \nJ. P. Gallivan, H. A. Lester and D. A. Dougherty, Chem. Biol., 4:739 (1997\n); the use of caged tyrosine analogs to monitor conformational changes in an ion channel in real time, see, e.g., \nJ. C. Miller, S. K. Silverman, P. M. England, D. A. Dougherty and H. A. Lester, Neuron, 20:619 (1998\n); and, the use of alpha hydroxy amino acids to change ion channel backbones for probing their gating mechanisms. \nSee, e.g\n., \nP. M. England, Y. Zhang, D. A. Dougherty and H. A. Lester, Cell, 96:89 (1999\n); and, \nT. Lu, A. Y. Ting, J. Mainland, L. Y. Jan, P. G. Schultz and J. Yang, Nat. Neurosci., 4:239 (2001\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability to incorporate unnatural amino acids directly into proteins in vivo offers the advantages of high yields of mutant proteins, technical ease, the potential to study the mutant proteins in cells or possibly in living organisms and the use of these mutant proteins in therapeutic treatments. The ability to include unnatural amino acids with various sizes, acidities, nucleophilicities, hydrophobicities, and other properties into proteins can greatly expand our ability to rationally and systematically manipulate the structures of proteins, both to probe protein function and create new proteins or organisms with novel properties. However, the process is difficult, because the complex nature of tRNA-synthetase interactions that are required to achieve a high degree of fidelity in protein translation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one attempt to site-specifically incorporate para-F-Phe, a yeast amber suppressor tRNAPheCUA /phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase pair was used in a p-F-Phe resistant, Phe auxotrophic \nEscherichia coli\n strain. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nR. Furter, Protein Sci., 7:419 (1998\n). It may also be possible to obtain expression of a polynucleotide using a cell-free (in-vitro) translational system. Translation systems may be cellular or cell-free, and may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Cellular translation systems include, but are not limited to, whole cell preparations such as permeabilized cells or cell cultures wherein a desired nucleic acid sequence can be transcribed to mRNA and the mRNA translated. Cell-free translation systems are commercially available and many different types and systems are well-known. Examples of cell-free systems include, but are not limited to, prokaryotic lysates such as \nEscherichia coli lysates,\n and eukaryotic lysates such as wheat germ extracts, insect cell lysates, rabbit reticulocyte lysates, rabbit oocyte lysates and human cell lysates. Eukaryotic extracts or lysates may be preferred when the resulting protein is glycosylated, phosphorylated or otherwise modified because many such modifications are only possible in eukaryotic systems. Some of these extracts and lysates are available commercially (Promega; Madison, Wis.; Stratagene; La Jolla, Calif.; Amersham; Arlington Heights, III.; GIBCO/BRL; Grand Island, N.Y.). Membranous extracts, such as the canine pancreatic extracts containing microsomal membranes, are also available which are useful for translating secretory proteins. In these systems, which can include either mRNA as a template (in-vitro translation) or DNA as a template (combined in-vitro transcription and translation), the in vitro synthesis is directed by the ribosomes. Considerable effort has been applied to the development of cell-free protein expression systems. See, e.g., \nKim, D.M. and J.R. Swartz, Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 74 :309-316 (2001\n); \nKim, D.M. and J.R. Swartz, Biotechnology Letters, 22, 1537-1542, (2000\n); \nKim, D.M., and J.R. Swartz, Biotechnology Progress, 16, 385-390, (2000\n); \nKim, D.M., and J.R. Swartz, Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 66, 180-188, (1999\n); and \nPatnaik, R. and J.R. Swartz, Biotechniques 24, 862-868, (1998\n); \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,337,191\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0081660\n \n; \n \nWO 00/55353\n \n; \n \nWO 90/05785\n \n, which are incorporated by reference herein. Another approach that may be applied to the expression of non-natural amino acid polypeptides includes the mRNA-peptide fusion technique. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nR. Roberts and J. Szostak, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. (USA) 94:12297-12302 (1997\n); \nA. Frankel, et al., Chemistry & Biology 10:1043-1050 (2003\n). In this approach, an mRNA template linked to puromycin is translated into peptide on the ribosome. If one or more tRNA molecules has been modified, non-natural amino acids can be incorporated into the peptide as well. After the last mRNA codon has been read, puromycin captures the C-terminus of the peptide. If the resulting mRNA-peptide conjugate is found to have interesting properties in an in vitro assay, its identity can be easily revealed from the mRNA sequence. In this way, one may screen libraries of non-natural amino acid polypeptides to identify polypeptides having desired properties. More recently, in vitro ribosome translations with purified components have been reported that permit the synthesis of peptides substituted with non-naturally encoded amino acids. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nA. Forster et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. (USA) 100:6353 (2003\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReconstituted translation systems may also be used. Mixtures of purified translation factors have also been used successfully to translate mRNA into protein as well as combinations of lysates or lysates supplemented with purified translation factors such as initiation factor-1 (IF-1), IF-2, IF-3 (α or β), elongation factor T (EF-Tu), or termination factors. Cell-free systems may also be coupled transcription/translation systems wherein DNA is introduced to the system, transcribed into mRNA and the mRNA translated as described in \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology (F. M. Ausubel et al. editors, Wiley Interscience, 1993\n), which is hereby specifically incorporated by reference. RNA transcribed in eukaryotic transcription system may be in the form of heteronuclear RNA (hnRNA) or 5'-end caps (7-methyl guanosine) and 3`-end poly A tailed mature mRNA, which can be an advantage in certain translation systems. For example, capped mRNAs are translated with high efficiency in the reticulocyte lysate system.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPost-Translational Modifications of Non-Natural Amino Acid Components of a Polypeptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods, compositions, techniques and strategies have been developed to site-specifically incorporate non-natural amino acids during the \nin vivo\n translation of proteins. By incorporating a non-natural amino acid with a sidechain chemistry that is orthogonal to those of the naturally-occurring amino acids, this technology makes possible the site-specific derivatization of recombinant proteins. As a result, a major advantage of the methods, compositions, techniques and strategies is that derivatized proteins can now be prepared as defined homogeneous products.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe non-natural amino acid polypeptides described above are useful for, including but not limited to, novel therapeutics, diagnostics, catalytic enzymes, industrial enzymes, binding proteins and including but not limited to, the study of protein structure and function. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nDougherty, (2000) Unnatural Amino Acids as Probes of Protein Structure and Function, Current Opinion in Chemical Biology, 4:645-652\n. Other uses for the non-natural amino acid polypeptides described above include, by way of example only, assay-based, cosmetic, plant biology, environmental, energy-production, and/or military uses. However, the non-natural amino acid polypeptides described above can undergo further modifications so as to incorporate new or modified functionalities, including manipulating the therapeutic effectiveness of the polypeptide, improving the safety profile of the polypeptide, adjusting the pharmacokinetics, pharmacologics and/or pharmacodynamics of the polypeptide (e.g., increasing water solubility, bioavailability, increasing serum half-life, increasing therapeutic half-life, modulating immunogenicity, modulating biological activity, or extending the circulation time), providing additional functionality to the polypeptide, incorporating a tag, label or detectable signal into the polypeptide, easing the isolation properties of the polypeptide, and any combination of the aforementioned modifications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods, compositions, strategies and techniques described herein are not limited to a particular type, class or family of polypeptides or proteins. Indeed, virtually any polypeptides may include at least one non-natural amino acid. A composition may include at least one protein with at least one, including but not limited to, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, at least seven, at least eight, at least nine, or at least ten or more non-natural amino acids that have been post-translationally modified. The post-translationally-modified non-natural amino acids can be the same or different, including but not limited to, there can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 or more different sites in the protein that comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 or more different post-translationally-modified non-natural amino acids. A composition may include a protein with at least one, but fewer than all, of a particular amino acid present in the protein as substituted with the post-translationally-modified non-natural amino acid. For a given protein with more than one post-translationally-modified non-natural amino acids, the post-translationally-modified non-natural amino acids can be identical or different (including but not limited to, the protein can include two or more different types of post-translationally-modified non-natural amino acids, or can include two of the same post-translationally-modified non-natural amino acid). For a given protein with more than two post-translationally-modified non-natural amino acids, the post-translationally-modified non-natural amino acids can be the same, different or a combination of a multiple post-translationally-modified non-natural amino acid of the same kind with at least one different post-translationally-modified non-natural amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the post-translational modification can be through a nucleophilic electrophilic reaction. Most reactions currently used for the selective modification of proteins involve covalent bond formation between nucleophilic and electrophilic reaction partners, including but not limited to the reaction of α-haloketones with histidine or cysteine side chains. Selectivity in these cases is determined by the number and accessibility of the nucleophilic residues in the protein. In proteins of the invention, other more selective reactions can be used such as the reaction of an unnatural keto-amino acid with hydrazides or aminooxy compounds, in vitro and in vivo. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nCornish, et al., (1996) J. Am. Chem. Soc., 118:8150-8151\n; \nMahal, et al., (1997) Science, 276:1125-1128\n; \nWang, et al., (2001) Science 292:498-500\n; \nChin, et al., (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124:9026-9027\n; \nChin, et al., (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 99:11020-11024\n; \nWang, et al., (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 100:56-61\n; \nZhang, et al., (2003) Biochemistry, 42:6735-6746\n; and, \nChin, et al., (2003) Science, 301:964-7\n. This allows the selective labeling of virtually any protein with a host of reagents including fluorophores, crosslinking agents, saccharide derivatives and cytotoxic molecules. \nSee also,\n \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,927,042\n \n entitled \"Glycoprotein synthesis,\" which is incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA.

Such reactions may further occur with the amino acid functionality (A) on a polymer (including, by way of example, a polynucleotide, a polynucleoside, a polysaccharide, or combinations thereof), wherein reaction with reactant (B) yields a modified polymer. For convenience, the modifications described in this section and other parts herein use \"polypeptide\" or \"polypeptides,\" by way of example, to illustrate the various modifications. However, the modifications described herein apply equally well to nonnatural amino acids incorporated into other molecules, including, but not limited to, polynucleotide(s), polynucleoside(s), polysaccharide(s), synthetic polymer(s), or combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"components\", as used herein, refers to nonnatural amino acids, nonnatural amino acid polypeptides, polymers which contain nonnatural amino acids, nucleic acid sequences which contain selector codons, nonnatural amino acid polypeptides linked to polymers, nonnatural amino acid polypeptides linked to polymers which contain nonnatural amino acids, nonnatural amino acid polypeptides linked to nucleic acid sequences, nonnatural amino acid polypeptides linked to nucleic acid sequences; each of which may independently be a part of, or incorporated into, a polypeptide, a nonnatural amino acid polypeptide, nucleic acid sequence, or a polymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDescription of these various reaction schemes have been disclosed in \n \nU.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 60/638,418\n \n, \n \n60/638,527\n \n, \n \n60/639,195\n \n, \n \n60/696,210\n \n, \n \n60/696,302\n \n, and \n \n60/696,068\n \n, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Use of Linking Groups and Applications, Including Polypeptide Dimers and Multimers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn addition to adding functionality directly to the non-natural amino acid polypeptide, the non-natural amino acid portion of the polypeptide may first be modified with a multifunctional (\ne.g.\n, bi-, tri, tetra-) linker molecule that then subsequently is further modified. That is, at least one end of the multifunctional linker molecule reacts with at least one non-natural amino acid in a polypeptide and at least one other end of the multifunctional linker is available for further functionalization. If all ends of the multifunctional linker are identical, then (depending upon the stoichiometric conditions) homomultimers of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide may be formed. If the ends of the multifunctional linker have distinct chemical reactivities, then at least one end of the multifunctional linker group will be bound to the non-natural amino acid polypeptide and the other end can subsequently react with a different functionality, including by way of example only: a label; a dye; a polymer; a water-soluble polymer; a derivative of polyethylene glycol; a photocrosslinker; a cytotoxic compound; a drug; an affinity label; a photoaffinity label; a reactive compound; a resin; a second protein or polypeptide or polypeptide analog; an antibody or antibody fragment; a metal chelator; a cofactor; a fatty acid; a carbohydrate; a polynucleotide; a DNA; a RNA; an antisense polynucleotide; a saccharide; a water-soluble dendrimer; a cyclodextrin; an inhibitory ribonucleic acid; a biomaterial; a nanoparticle; a spin label; a fluorophore, a metal-containing moiety; a radioactive moiety; a novel functional group; a group that covalently or noncovalently interacts with other molecules; a photocaged moiety; an actinic excitable moiety; a photoisomerizable moiety; biotin; a biotin analogue; a moiety incorporating a heavy atom; a chemically cleavable group; a photocleavable group; an elongated side chain; a carbon-linked sugar; a redox-active agent; an amino thioacid; a toxic moiety; an isotopically labeled moiety; a biophysical probe; a phosphorescent group; a chemiluminescent group; an electron dense group; a magnetic group; an intercalating group; a chromophore; an energy transfer agent; a biologically active agent; a detectable label; a small molecule; a quantum dot; a nanotransmitter; and any combination of the above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFuther use of linking groups and applications, including polypeptide dimers and multimers are further described in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Nos. 60/638,418\n \n, \n \n60/638,527\n \n, \n \n60/639,195\n \n, \n \n60/696,210\n \n, \n \n60/696,302\n \n, and \n \n60/696,068\n \n; \n \nPCT Publication WO 05/074650\n \n entitled \"Modified Four Helical Bundle Polypeptides and Their Uses,\" which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nE.

Example of Adding Functionality: Improving the Therapeutic Properties of a Polypeptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA naturally-occurring or non-natural amino acid polypeptide will be able to provide a certain therapeutic benefit to a patient with a particular disorder, disease or condition. Such a therapeutic benefit will depend upon a number of factors, including by way of example only: the safety profile of the polypeptide, and the pharmacokinetics, pharmacologics and/or pharmacodynamics of the polypeptide (e.g., water solubility, bioavailability, serum half-life, therapeutic half-life, immunogenicity, biological activity, or circulation time). In addition, it may be advantageous to provide additional functionality to the polypeptide, such as an attached cytotoxic compound or drug, or it may be desirable to attach additional polypeptides to form the homo- and heteromultimers described herein.

Therapeutic Uses of Modified Polypeptides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides described herein, including homo- and hetero-multimers thereof find multiple uses, including but not limited to: therapeutic, diagnostic, assay-based, industrial, cosmetic, plant biology, environmental, energy-production, and/or military uses. As a non-limiting illustration, the following therapeutic uses of (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides are provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides described herein are useful for treating a wide range of disorders. Administration of the (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide products described herein results in any of the activities demonstrated by commercially available polypeptide preparations in humans. Average quantities of the (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide product may vary and in particular should be based upon the recommendations and prescription of a qualified physician. The exact amount of the (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide is a matter of preference subject to such factors as the exact type of condition being treated, the condition of the patient being treated, as well as the other ingredients in the composition. The amount to be given may be readily determined by one skilled in the art based upon therapy with the (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA. Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, as described herein (including but not limited to, synthetases, proteins comprising one or more non-natural amino acid, \netc\n.) are optionally employed for therapeutic uses, including but not limited to, in combination with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier. Such compositions, for example, comprise a therapeutically effective amount of the non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Such a carrier or excipient includes, but is not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and/or combinations thereof. The formulation is made to suit the mode of administration. In general, methods of administering proteins are well known in the art and can be applied to administration of the non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic compositions comprising one or more of the non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, as described herein are optionally tested in one or more appropriate \nin vitro\n and/or \nin vivo\n animal models of disease, to confirm efficacy, tissue metabolism, and to estimate dosages, according to methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In particular, dosages can be initially determined by activity, stability or other suitable measures of non-natural to natural amino acid homologues (including but not limited to, comparison of a polypeptide (modified) to include one or more non-natural amino acids to a natural amino acid polypeptide), i.e., in a relevant assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration is by any of the routes normally used for introducing a molecule into ultimate contact with blood or tissue cells. The non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, as described herein, are administered in any suitable manner, optionally with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable methods of administering the non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, as described herein, to a patient are available, and, although more than one route can be used to administer a particular composition, a particular route can often provide a more immediate and more effective action or reaction than another route.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable carriers are determined in part by the particular composition being administered, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of pharmaceutical compositions described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-natural amino acid polypeptides may be administered by any conventional route suitable for proteins or peptides, including, but not limited to parenterally, e.g. injections including, but not limited to, subcutaneously or intravenously or any other form of injections or infusions. Polypeptide compositions (including the various polypeptides described herein) can be administered by a number of routes including, but not limited to oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, transdermal, subcutaneous, topical, sublingual, or rectal means. Compositions comprising non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, as described herein, can also be administered via liposomes. Such administration routes and appropriate formulations are generally known to those of skill in the art. The non-natural amino acid polypeptide may be used alone or in combination with other suitable components such as a pharmaceutical carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, as described herein, alone or in combination with other suitable components, can also be made into aerosol formulations (i.e., they can be \"nebulized\") to be administered via inhalation. Aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations suitable for parenteral administration, such as, for example, by intraarticular (in the joints), intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous routes, include aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions, which can contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. The formulations of packaged nucleic acid can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampules and vials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParenteral administration and intravenous administration are preferred methods of administration. In particular, the routes of administration already in use for natural amino acid homologue therapeutics (including but not limited to, those typically used for EPO, IFN, GM-CSF, IFNs, interleukins, antibodies, and/or any other pharmaceutically delivered protein), along with formulations in current use, provide preferred routes of administration and formulation for the non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose administered to a patient, in the context compositions and methods described herein, is sufficient to have a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time. The dose is determined by the efficacy of the particular formulation, and the activity, stability or serum half-life of the non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, employed and the condition of the patient, as well as the body weight or surface area of the patient to be treated. The size of the dose is also determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration of a particular formulation, or the like in a particular patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn determining the effective amount of the formulation to be administered in the treatment or prophylaxis of disease (including but not limited to, cancers, inherited diseases, diabetes, AIDS, or the like), the physician evaluates circulating plasma levels, formulation toxicities, progression of the disease, and/or where relevant, the production of anti-non-natural amino acid polypeptide antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose administered, for example, to a 70 kilogram patient, is typically in the range equivalent to dosages of currently-used therapeutic proteins, adjusted for the altered activity or serum half-life of the relevant composition. The pharmaceutical formulations described herein can supplement treatment conditions by any known conventional therapy, including antibody administration, vaccine administration, administration of cytotoxic agents, natural amino acid polypeptides, nucleic acids, nucleotide analogues, biologic response modifiers, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor administration, the pharmaceutical formulations described herein are administered at a rate determined by the LD-50 or ED-50 of the relevant formulation, and/or observation of any side-effects of the non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, at various concentrations, including but not limited to, as applied to the mass and overall health of the patient. Administration can be accomplished via single or divided doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a patient undergoing infusion of a formulation develops fevers, chills, or muscle aches, he/she receives the appropriate dose of aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen or other pain/fever controlling drug. Patients who experience reactions to the infusion such as fever, muscle aches, and chills are premedicated 30 minutes prior to the future infusions with either aspirin, acetaminophen, or, including but not limited to, diphenhydramine. Meperidine is used for more severe chills and muscle aches that do not quickly respond to antipyretics and antihistamines. Cell infusion is slowed or discontinued depending upon the severity of the reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, as described herein, can be administered directly to a mammalian subject. Administration is by any of the routes normally used for introducing a polypeptide to a subject. The non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, as described herein, include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, inhalation (including but not limited to, via an aerosol), buccal (including but not limited to, sub-lingual), vaginal, parenteral (including but not limited to, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, intraarticular, intrapleural, intraperitoneal, inracerebral, intraarterial, or intravenous), topical (\ni.e.\n, both skin and mucosal surfaces, including airway surfaces) and transdermal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated. Administration can be either local or systemic. The formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampoules and vials. The non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, as described herein, can be prepared in a mixture in a unit dosage injectable form (including but not limited to, solution, suspension, or emulsion) with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, as described herein, can also be administered by continuous infusion (using, including but not limited to, minipumps such as osmotic pumps), single bolus or slow-release depot formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations suitable for administration include aqueous and non-aqueous solutions, isotonic sterile solutions, which can contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. Solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind previously described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFreeze-drying is a commonly employed technique for presenting proteins which serves to remove water from the protein preparation of interest. Freeze-drying, or lyophilization, is a process by which the material to be dried is first frozen and then the ice or frozen solvent is removed by sublimation in a vacuum environment. An excipient may be included in prelyophilized formulations to enhance stability during the freeze-drying process and/or to improve stability of the lyophilized product upon storage. \nPikal, M. Biopharm. 3(9)26-30 (1990\n) and \nArakawa et al. Pharm. Res. 8(3):285-291 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe spray drying of pharmaceuticals is also known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, see \nBroadhead, J. et al., \"\nThe Spray Drying of Pharmaceuticals,\n\" in Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm, 18 (11 & 12), 1169-1206 (1992\n). In addition to small molecule pharmaceuticals, a variety of biological materials have been spray dried and these include: enzymes, sera, plasma, micro-organisms and yeasts. Spray drying is a useful technique because it can-convert a liquid pharmaceutical preparation into a fine, dustless or agglomerated powder in a one-step process. The basic technique comprises the following four steps: a) atomization of the feed solution into a spray; b) spray-air contact; c) drying of the spray; and d) separation of the dried product from the drying air. \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 6,235,710\n \n and \n \n6,001,800\n \n, which are incorporated by reference herein, describe the preparation of recombinant erythropoietin by spray drying.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions described herein may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are determined in part by the particular composition being administered, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of pharmaceutical compositions (including optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers) for the non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, described herein, (\nsee, e.g.,\n \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed. 1985\n)). Suitable carriers include buffers containing succinate, phosphate, borate, HEPES, citrate, imidazole, acetate, bicarbonate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including but not limited to, ascorbic acid; low molecular weight polypeptides including but not limited to those less than about 10 residues; proteins, including but not limited to, serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers including but not limited to, polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids including but not limited to, glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine, histidine or histidine derivatives, methionine, glutamate, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates, including but not limited to, trehalose, sucrose, glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents including but not limited to, EDTA; divalent metal ions including but not limited to, zinc, cobalt, or copper; sugar alcohols including but not limited to, mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counter ions including but not limited to, sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants including but not limited to Tween™ (including but not limited to, Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) and Tween 20 (polysorbate 20), Pluronics™ and other pluronic acids, including but not limited to, and other pluronic acids, including but not limited to, pluronic acid F68 (poloxamer 188), or PEG. Suitable surfactants include for example but are not limited to polyethers based upon poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide), i.e., (PEO-PPO-PEO), or poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide), i.e., (PPO-PEO-PPO), or a combination thereof. PEO-PPO-PEO and PPO-PEO-PPO are commercially available under the trade names Pluronics\n™\n, R-Pluronic\n™\n, Tetronics\n™\n and R-Tetronics\n™\n (BASF Wyandotte Corp., Wyandotte, Mich.) and are further described in \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,820,352\n \n incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Other ethylene/polypropylene block polymers may be suitable surfactants. A surfactant or a combination of surfactants may be used to stabilize a (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide against one or more stresses including but not limited to stress that results from agitation. Some of the above may be referred to as \"bulking agents.\" Some may also be referred to as \"tonicity modifiers.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, as described herein, including those linked to water soluble polymers such as PEG can also be administered by or as part of sustained-release systems. Sustained-release compositions include, including but not limited to, semi-permeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, including but not limited to, films, or microcapsules. Sustained-release matrices include from biocompatible materials such as poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (\nLanger et al., J Biomed. Mater. Res., 15: 267-277 (1981\n); \nLanger, Chem.

Composition and size of liposomes are well known or able to be readily determined empirically by one of ordinary skill in the art. Some examples of liposomes as described in, \ne.g\n., \nPark JW, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:1327-1331 (1995\n); \nLasic D and Papahadjopoulos D (eds): MEDICAL APPLICATIONS OF LIPOSOMES (1998\n); \nDrummond DC, et al., Liposomal drug delivery systems for cancer therapy, in Teicher B (ed): CANCER DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT (2002\n); \nPark JW, et al., Clin.

All references and patents cited are incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose administered to a patient in the context of the compositions, formulations and methods described herein, should be sufficient to cause a beneficial response in the subject over time. Generally, the total pharmaceutically effective amount of the non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, as described herein, administered parenterally per dose is in the range of about 0.01 µg/kg/day to about 100 µg/kg, or about 0.05 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg, of patient body weight, although this is subject to therapeutic discretion. The frequency of dosing is also subject to therapeutic discretion, and may be more frequent or less frequent than the commercially available products approved for use in humans. Generally, a polymer:polypeptide conjugate, including by way of example only, a PEGylated polypeptide, as described herein, can be administered by any of the routes of administration described above.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nXI. Isolation Aud Purification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Chromatography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn any of the embodiments herein, the isolation of peptides, (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides, binding partners or receptors to polypeptides can occur by chromatography. Chromatography is based on the differential absorption and elution of polypeptides. The sample is dissolved in a mobile phase, which may be a gas, a liquid or a supercritical fluid. This mobile phase is then forced through an immiscible stationary phase, which is fixed in a column or on a solid surface. Examples of stationary phases include liquids adsorbed on a solid, organic species bonded to a solid surface, solid, ion exchange resin and liquid in interstices of a polymeric solid. The ability of a polypeptide to be purified by different chromatographic or other isolation/purification methods may be modulated by the addition or substitution of one or more non-natural amino acids with a non-natural amino acid optionally in combination with one or more natural amino acid substitutions. Thus, the properties of a polypeptide may be modified by altereing the amino acid composition enabling an increase or decrease in its interaction with known matrices. Changes to the amino acid composition include, but are not limited to, hydrophobic amino acid content, hydrophilic amino acid content, and change in charge, pI, or other characteristics of the polypeptide. Such modifications may be useful in isolating membrane proteins which are difficult to isolate since they are hydrophobic in nature and keep in their native conformation.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGas Chromatography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolation of polypeptides can occur by gas chromatography (GC). The sample is vaporized and injected onto the head of a chromatographic column. Examples of mobile gas phases include but are not limited to helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. In one embodiment, the sample is isolated by gas-solid chromatography, where the stationary phase is a solid. Examples of solid stationary phase are molecular sieves and porous polymers. In another embodiment the polypeptide is isolated by gas-liquid chromatography, where the stationary phase is a liquid immobilized on the surface of an inert solid. Examples of liquid stationary phases include Polydimethyl siloxane, Poly (phenylmethyldimethyl) siloxane (10% phenyl), Poly(phenylmethyl) siloxane (50% phenyl), Poly(trifluoropropyldimethyl) siloxane, Polyethylene glycol and Poly(dicyanoallyldimethyl) siloxane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConventional GC columns are either packed and open tubular or capillary. GC-chromatographic columns vary in length from less than 2 m to 50 m or more. Examples of material for their construction include stainless steel, metal, glass, fused silica and Teflon. Typically GC columns have an in inner diameter of roughly of 2 to 4 mm. Micro-GC has an inner diameter of roughly 1 mm. Capillary GC utilizes a capillary with an inner diameter of roughly 100 to 750 um. Nano-GC is available with an inner diameter of 50 um -1 mm\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLiquid Chromatography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolation of polypeptides can occur by liquid chromatography (LC). LC involves the use of fluid carrier over a stationary phase. The majority of LC-columns range in length from 10 to 30 cm. LC columns are ordinarily constructed from smooth-bore stainless steel tubing, although heavy glass tubing in occasionally encountered. Conventional LC columns have an inner diameter of roughly 4.6 mm and a flow rate of roughly 1 ml/min. Micro-LC has an inner diameter of roughly 1.0 mm and a flow rate of roughly 40 µl/min. Capillary LC utilizes a capillary with an inner diameter of roughly 300 µm and a flow rate of approximately 5 µl/min. Nano-LC is available with an inner diameter of 50 µm -1 mm and flow rates of 200 nl/min. Nano-LC can vary in length, e.g., 5, 15, or 25 cm. Nano-LC stationary phase may also be a monolithic material, such as a polymeric monolith or a sol-gel monolith. Two basic types of packing material have been used in liquid chromatography, non-porous and porous particles. The beads or particles are generally characterized by particle and pore size. Particle sizes generally range between 3 and 50 microns. Larger particles will generate less system pressure and smaller particles will generate more pressure. The smaller particles generally give higher separation efficiencies. The particle pore size is measured in angstroms and generally range between 100-1000 Å. These can be covered with a porous layer of silica, alumina, ion exchange resin, organic surface layer, polymers, ligands, carbohydrates or a specific cofactor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the polypeptides can be isolated using HPLC technology. In another embodiment of the invention, the polypeptide can be isolated using column chromatography. In column chromatography, the solid medium is packed onto a chromatography column, and the initial mixture containing the polypeptide is run through the column to allow binding. A wash buffer is then run through the column, and the elution buffer is subsequently applied to the column for sample collection. These steps may be performed at ambient pressure. In another embodiment, binding of the polypeptides to a solid phase may be achieved using a Batch treatment, by adding the initial mixture to the solid phase in a vessel, mixing the two together, separating the solid phase (i.e. by centrifugation), removing the liquid phase, washing, re-centrifuging, adding the elution buffer, re-centrifuging and removing the eluate. In another embodiment of the invention, a hybrid method is employed in which the binding is done by the Batch method, the solid phase with the target molecule bound is then packed onto a column, and washing and elution are performed on the column. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the isolation of peptides occur in a microfluidic device. In another embodiment of the invention, the isolation of peptides occur in a nanofluidic device.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPartition Chromatography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolation of polypeptides occurs by partition chromatography. In one embodiment the isolation of the polypeptides occurs by liquid-liquid partition chromatography. With liquid-liquid partition chromatography, a liquid stationary phase is retained on the surface of the packing by physical adsorption. In another embodiment, the isolation of the polypeptides can occur by bonded-phase partition chromatography. With bonded-phase partition chromatography, the stationary phase is bonded chemically to the support surfaces.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, normal-phase chromatography is used to isolate the polypeptides. In normal-phase chromatography, a polar stationary phase is used together with a non-polar solvent. Examples of the stationary phase for normal phase chromatography include but are not limited to, water, alcohols and triethylene glycol. Examples of non-polar solvents for normal phase chromatography include but are not limited to, ethyl, ether, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, flouroalkanes, cyclohexane, 1-chlorobutane, carbon tetrachloride, toluene, diethyl ether, hexane and i-propylether. In one embodiment the partition chromatography uses reversed-phase packings; this is referred as reversed-phase chromatography. In reversed-phase chromatography, a non-polar stationary phase is used together with a polar mobile phase. Examples of stationary phases for reversed-phased chromatography include but are not limited to, hydrocarbons, ether, esters, ketones, aldehydes, amides, and amines. Examples of mobile stationary phases for reversed-phased chromatography include water, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, dioxane, nitromethane, ethylene glycol, tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the type of reversed chromatography that can be use to isolate polypeptides is ion-pair chromatography. The mobile phase in ion-pair chromatography consists of an aqueous buffer containing an organic solvent such as methanol or acetonitrile and an ionic compound containing a counter ion of opposite charge to the polypeptides. The counter ion binds to the polypeptide to form an ion pair, which is a neutral species that is retained by a reversed-phase packing. Elution of the ion pairs is then accomplished with an aqueous solution of methanol or another water soluble organic solvent like the one described above. Examples of counter-ions are ClO\n4\n \n-\n, C\n12\nH\n25\nSO\n3\n \n-\n, (C\n4\nH\n9\n)\n4\nN\n+\n, (C\n16\nH\n33\n)(CH\n3\n)\n3\nN\n+\n, (C\n4\nH\n9\n)\n4\nN\n+\n, Bis-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate, and (C\n4\nH\n9\n)4N\n+\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the polypeptides can be isolated using partition chromatography with a chiral stationary phase. Examples of types of chiral stationary phases include but are not limited to, protein based stationary phases, small molecular weight chiral, polymers of cellulose and amylose, macrocyclic glycopeptides and cyclodextrin based materials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nAdsorption Chromatography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolation of polypeptides can occur by adsorption chromatography. Adsorption is a process whereby material (contained in the mobile phase) interacts by physical forces (dispersive, polar or ionic) with a stationary phase, thereby, causing a layer (or layers) of the material to adhere to that stationary phase. The stationary phase in most cases will be a solid (e.g. silica gel, alumina, charcoal, etc.) or sometimes a liquid (e.g. surfactants on water surfaces). The surface layer(s) may be single, double or multiple. Examples of solvents that can be use in adsorption chromatography include water, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, dioxane, nitromethane, ethylene glycol, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, ethyl, ether, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, flouroalkanes, cyclohexane, 1-chlorobutane, carbon tetrachloride, toluene, diethyl ether, hexane and i-propylether.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nIon Exchange Chromatogrphy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolation of polypeptides can occur by ion-exchange chromatography. In ion-exchange chromatography the isolation of polypeptides is based upon ion-exchange resin. The ion exchange resin can be an anion exchange resin or a cation exchange resin. The ion-exchange resin can be made by natural ion exchangers, such as clays and zeolites, or from synthetic ion exchangers. Examples of common active sites for cation exchange resins are the sulfonic acid group -SO\n3\n \n-\nH\n+\n, the carboxylic acid group -COO\n-\nH\n+\n and phosphoric acid -PO\n32\n \n+\nH\n2\n. Examples of common active sites for anion exchange resins are quaternary amine groups -N(CH\n3\n)\n+\nOH\n-\n or primary amine groups -NH\n3\n \n+\nOR\n-\n. The mobile phase in ion-exchange chromatography is generally an aqueous solution that may contain moderate amounts of methanol or other water miscible organic solvents; these mobile phases also contain ionic species in the form of a buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the ion exchange column is eluted with a gradient of salt concentrations. In one example, pumps add increasing amounts of salt to the buffer as it goes onto the column so that there is a continuous steady increase in the ionic concentration going through the column. The proteins then \"elute\" or come off the column stationary phase when the ionic strength of the buffer neutralizes their charge. The least charged molecules come off first, and the most highly charged come off last. In another example, the column is thoroughly rinsed with buffers of increasing ionic strength until the desired protein elutes; this exact same sequence is repeated each time with the same amounts of buffer to give reproducible yields and purification of the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the sample will be subject removal of high salt concentrations after isolation the polypeptide of interest by ion exchange chromatography. In one embodiment the removal of high salt concentration will be performed by dialysis. Dialysis makes use of semi-permeable membranes. The main feature of the dialysis membrane is that it is porous. However, the pore size is such that while small salt ions can freely pass through the membrane, larger protein molecules cannot (i.e. they are retained). Thus, dialysis membranes are characterized by the molecular mass of the smallest typical globular protein which it will retain. Removal of high salt concentration can be achieved in a single or multiple dialysis steps. In another embodiment, the removal of high salt concentration is performed by electrodialysis. Electrodialysis is an electromembrane process in which ions are transported through ion permeable membranes from one solution to another under the influence of a potential gradient. Since the membranes used in electrodialysis have the ability to selectively transport ions having positive or negative charge and reject ions of the opposite charge, electrodialysis is useful for concentration, removal, or separation of electrolytes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the removal of high concentration of salt is achieved by using desalting columns in gravity-flow gel filtration. Gravity-flow gel filtration involves the chromatographic separation of molecules of different dimensions based on their relative abilities to penetrate into a suitable stationary phase. Desalting columns are packed with small, porous cellulose beads. These columns have a wet bead with specific diameters. The diameter of the beads used will depend on the molecular weight of the peptide of interest. Different levels of separation can be achieved based on the pore size of the medium packed into the column. The medium can be chosen to totally exclude proteins or large molecules, while still including small solutes. Large molecules are excluded from the internal pores of the gel and emerge first from the column. The smaller molecules are able to penetrate the pores, and then progress through the column at a slower rate. These smaller molecules are subsequently flushed through the column with additional buffer volume.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nSize-Exclusion Chromatography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolation of polypeptides can occur by size-exclusion chromatography, also known as gel permeation, or gel filtration chromatography. Molecules that are larger than the average pore size of the packing are excluded and thus suffer no retention. Examples of packings for size exclusion chromatography include silica, cellulose beads and polymer particles. Conventionally, porous glasses and silica particles have an average pore size ranging from 40 Å to 2500 Å. In some embodiments, the molecular weight exclusion limit of a polymer packing with an average pore size of 102 Å is 700. In another embodiment the molecular weight exclusion limit of a polymer packing with an average pore size of 103 Å is (0.1 to 20) x 10\n4\n. In another embodiment the molecular weight exclusion limit of a polymer packing with an average pore size of 104 Å is (1 to 20) x 10\n4\n. In another embodiment the molecular weight exclusion limit of a polymer packing with an average pore size of 10\n5\n Å is (1 to 20) x 10\n5\n. In yet another embodiment the molecular weight exclusion limit of a polymer packing with an average pore size of 10\n6\n Å is (5 to 10) x 10\n6\n. In some embodiments, the molecular weight exclusion limit of silica packing with an average pore size of 125 Å is (0.2 to 5) x 10\n4\n. In another embodiment, the molecular weight exclusion limit of silica packing with an average pore size of 300 Å is (0.03 to 1) x 10\n5\n. In another embodiment, the molecular weight exclusion limit of silica packing with an average pore size of 500 Å is (0.05 to 5) x 10\n5\n. In yet another embodiment, the molecular weight exclusion limit of silica packing with an average pore size of 1000 Å is (5 to 20) x 10\n5\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nThin-Layer Chromatography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolation of polypeptides can occur by thin-layer chromatography. Thin-layer chromatographic methods include paper chromatography, thin-layer chromatography and electrochromatography. Each makes use of a flat, thin layer of material that is either self supporting or that is coated on a glass, plastic, or metal surface. The mobile phase moves through the stationary phase by capillary action, sometimes assisted by gravity or electrical potential. In one embodiment, planar separation is performed on flat glass or plastic plates that are coated with a thin and adherent layer of finely divided particles; this layer constitutes the stationary phase. The stationary phase and mobile phase are similar to those discussed in adsorption, normal- and reversed-phase partition, ion-exchange, and size exclusion chromatography. In one embodiment, the polypeptides are located in the plate by spraying a solution that will react with organic compounds to yield dark products. Examples of this type of solution include ninhydrin, iodine solutions and sulfuric acid solution. In another embodiment, the polypeptides are located by incorporating a fluorescent material to the stationary phase. The plate is examined under ultraviolet light. The sample components quench the fluorescent material so that all of the plate fluoresces except where the non-fluorescing sample components are located.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nAffinity Chromatography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolation of polypeptides can occur by affinity chromatography. Affinity chromatography relies on the ability to design a stationary phase that reversibly binds to a known subset of molecules. Affinity purification generally involves the following steps: 1) incubate crude sample with the immobilized ligand support material to allow the target molecule in the sample to bind to the immobilized ligand, 2) wash away nonbound sample components from solid support and 3) elute (dissociate and recover) the target molecule from the immobilized ligand by altering the buffer conditions so that the binding interaction no longer occurs. Examples of elution buffers used in affinity chromatography include but are not limited to 100 mM glycine•HCl, 100 mM citric acid, 50-100 mM triethylamine or triethanolamine, 150 mM ammonium hydroxide, 3.5-4.0 M magnesium chloride in 10 mM Tris, 5 M lithium chloride in 10 mM phosphate buffer, 2.5 M sodium iodide, 0.2-3.0 sodium thiocyanate, 2-6 M guanidine•HCl, 2-8 M urea, 1% deoxycholate, 1 % SDS , 10% dioxane, 50% ethylene glycol, 0.1 M Glycine-NaOH, 0.1 M Glycine-NaOH with 50% ethyleneglycol, 3.0 M Potassium chloride, 0.1 M Tris-acetate with 2.0 M NaCl, 5.0 M Potassium iodide, 1% SDS, 1% Sodium deoxycholate, 2.0 M Urea, 6.0 M Urea, 2.0 M Guanadine-HCl, 1.0 M Ammonium thiocyanate and >0.1 M counter ligand or analog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the stationary phase includes a ligand including but not limited to, a specific carbohydrate or a cofactor. In one embodiment, the polypeptides can then be eluted with a high concentration of the carbohydrate or a specific cofactor. Mimics for binding sites can sometimes be used as affinity stationary phases. The specific sugars, inhibitor or cofactors used in the stationary phase will vary according to the properties of the polypeptide. The embodiments of the invention include any ligand, carbohydrate or cofactor known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the immobilized stationary phase includes a dye. Examples of dyes commonly used for dye-ligand chromatography include Reactive Blue 2 (Cibacron\n©\n Blue 3GA), Reactive Red 120 (Procion\n©\n Red HE3B), Reactive Blue 4 (Reactive Blue MRB)\nTC\n, Reactive Green 5 (Reactive Green H4G)\nTC\n, Reactive Green 19 (Reactive Green HE4BD)\nTC\n, Green 19A (Reactive Green HE4BD)\nTC\n, Reactive Yellow 86 (Reactive Yellow M8G)\nTC\n and Reactive Brown 10 (Reactive Brown M4R )\nTC\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the stationary phase includes a metal chelate resin. In metal chelate chromatography metal ions such as Zn\n2+\n, Cu\n2+\n and Ni\n2+\n are immobilized to a chromatography stationary phase by chelate bonding take part in a reversible interaction with electron donor groups situated in the surface of polypeptides. At a pH value at which the electron group donor is present at least partially in non-protonized form the polypeptide is bonded to the stationary phase and can be subsequently eluted by means of a buffer with lower pH value at which the electron group is protonized. Examples of chelate resins include 8-hydroxyquinoline, salicylic acid, diethylenetriamine, diethylenetriaminetetraacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), iminodiacetic acid and nitrilo-triacetic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the isolation of polypeptides can occur by immunoaffinity chromatography. The principle of immunoaffinity or immunoadsorption chromatography is based on the highly specific interaction of an antigen with its antibody. Immunoaffinity chromatography utilizes an antibody or antibody fragment as a ligand immobilized onto the stationary phase in a manner that retains its binding capacity. Elution of the retained polypeptide is achieved by alterations to the mobile-phase conditions that weaken the antibody-antigen interaction. Elution conditions are intended to break the ionic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds that hold the antigen and antibody together. Successful eluting conditions will be dependent upon the specific antigen-antibody interaction that is occurring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies may be generated that recognize the non-natural amino acid present in the polypeptide. Such antibodies may be used in affinity chromatography to purify the non-natural amino acid polypeptides from a complex mixture or enable conjugation of the polypeptide with other molecules on a support such as a resin, in immunoassays to detect the presence of non-natural amino acid polypeptides, and other assays that use antibodies. Antibodies may be generated that recognize one or more non-natural amino acids present at the N or C terminus of a polypeptide or other portions of the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-natural amino acid polypeptides may be antibodies, antibody fragments, or antigen-binding polypeptides or fragments thereof, and used to isolate antigens by affinity chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolation of polypeptides can occur by hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. Polyeptides may contain hydrophilic and hydrophobic natural amino acids and hydrophilic and hydrophobic non-natural amino acids. Polypeptides are separated according to their relative hydrophobicity by their ability to reversibly bind to hydrophobic compounds. The polypeptides are eluted from the column with decreasing concentrations of salt in buffer. Examples of hydrophobic compounds include but are not limited to, hydrophobic fatty acid chains, compounds with n-butyl functional groups, compounds with n-octyl functional groups and compounds with phenyl functional groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nSupercritical Fluid Chromatography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolation of polypeptides can occur by supercritical chromatography (SFC). In SFC, the sample is carried through a separating column by a supercritical fluid where the mixture is divided into unique bands based on the amount of interaction between the individual analytes and the stationary phase in the column. Conventional SFC columns are either packed and open tubular or capillary. Open-tubular columns vary in length from 10 m to 20 m or more. Typically open-tubular columns have an inner diameter of roughly of 0.05 to 4 mm. Pack columns vary in diameter from 0.5 mm or less to 4.6 mm, with particle diameter ranging from 3 to 10 um. Packed columns contain small deactivated particles to which the stationary phases adhere. The columns are conventionally stainless steel. Capillary columns are open tubular columns of narrow internal diameter made of fused silica, with the stationary phase bonded to the wall of the column. The coatings are similar to those used in partition chromatography. Examples of supercritical fluids used in SFC include but are not limited to, carbon dioxide, ethane, pentane, nitrous oxide, dichlorodifluoromethane, diethyl ether, ammonia, and tetrahydrofuran. In some applications, polar organic modifiers such as methanol are introduced in small concentrations (1-5%).\n\n\n \n\n\nB. \nPrecipitation\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolation of peptides, (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides, binding partners or receptors to polypeptides can occur by precipitation. The solubility of polypeptides is a function of the ionic strength and pH of the solution. Polypeptides have isoelectric points at which the charges of their amino acid side groups balance each other. If the ionic strength of a solution is either very high or very low, proteins will tend to precipitate at their isoelectric point. In one embodiment, the ionic strength of the solution will be increased by adding salt. Examples of salts used in precipitation methods include but are not limited to ammonium sulfate and sodium sulfate. Any salt known in the art for protein precipitation can be used in any of the embodiments of the inventions. In another embodiment, polypeptides will be forced out of solution with polymers. One example of a polymer commonly used to precipitate polypeptides is polyethylene glycol. Any polymer known in the art for protein precipitation can be used in any of the embodiments of the inventions. In one embodiment the precipitated polypeptides are removed by centrifugation or filtration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, after precipitation of the peptide of interest by the addition salts to the solution the sample will be subject removal of high salt concentrations. Desalting methods are discussed in the ion-exchange chromatography section.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nImmunoprecipitation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention the isolation of polypeptides can occur by immunoprecipitation (IP). IP refers to the small-scale affinity purification of antigen using a specific antibody. Classical immunoprecipitation involves the following steps: 1)incubate specific antibody with a sample containing antigen, 2) capture antibody-antigen complex with immobilized Protein A or G agarose gel (Protein A or G binds the antibody, which is bound to its antigen), 3)Wash the gel with buffer to remove non-bound sample components, 4)Elute the antigen (and antibody).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, classical IP is performed in a microcentrifuge tube with the polypeptide-containing sample using immobilized Protein A or G gel. The gel is pelleted by centrifugation after each step (washes and elution), and the supernatant is removed. Usually the eluted sample will always contain both antigen and antibody, and reducing gel electrophoresis of the eluted sample will yield both antigen bands and heavy and light chain antibody fragment bands. Methods to obtain polypeptides from electrophoresis gel separated are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the invention, to avoid antibody contamination of the eluted antigen, modifications to the classical IP method can be made so that the antibody is permanently immobilized and will not elute with the antigen. In one example, the antibody is first bound to the Protein A or G gel and then the antibody is covalently cross-linked to the Protein A or G. In another example the antibody is directly coupled to an activated affinity support. Non-natural amino acid polypeptides may be antigen-binding polypeptides and used in immunoprecipitation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the support material is a porous gel such as cross-linked beaded agarose or co-polymer of cross-linked bis-acrylamide and azlactone. In one embodiment of the invention polypeptides can be isolated by magnetic affinity separation. Samples containing the molecule of interest are incubated with magnetic beads that are derivatized with an antibody or other binding partner. A magnetic field is used to pull the magnetic beads out of solution and onto a surface. The buffer can be carefully removed, containing any nonbound molecules. Protocols using magnetic beads for isolation of molecules of interest are well known in the art. Magnetic beads can be derivatized to contain active groups, including but not limited to, carboxylic acids or primary amines, or specific affinity molecules such as streptavidin or goat anti-mouse, anti-rabbit or anti-rat IgG or Protein A or G. In another embodiment the support is a microplate.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nC. Electrophoresis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn any of the embodiments herein, isolation of polypeptides can occur by electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is the separation of ionic molecules such as polypeptides by differential migration patterns through a gel based on the size and ionic charge of the molecules in an electric field. Electrophoresis can be conducted in a gel, capillary or on a chip. Examples of gels used for electrophoresis include starch, acrylamide, agarose or combinations thereof. A gel can be modified by its cross-linking, addition of detergents, immobilization of enzymes or antibodies (affinity electrophoresis) or substrates (zymography) and pH gradient. Methods to obtain polypeptides from electrophoresis gels are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCapillary Electrophoresis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolation of peptides, (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides, binding partners or receptors to polypeptides can occur by capillary electrophoresis (CE). CE may be used for separating complex hydrophilic molecules and highly charged solutes. Advantages of CE include its use of small samples (sizes ranging from 0.001 to 10 µL), fast separation, easy reproducibility, very high efficiencies, meaning hundreds of components can be separated at the same time, is easily automated, can be used quantitatively and consumes limited amounts of reagents. CE technology, in general, relates to separation techniques that use narrow bore fused-silica capillaries to separate a complex array of large and small molecules. High voltages are used to separate molecules based on differences in charge, size and hydrophobicity. Depending on the types of capillary and buffers used, CE can be further segmented into separation techniques such as capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) and capillary electrochromatography (CEC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCapillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), also known as free-solution CE (FSCE), is the simplest form of CE. The separation mechanism of CZE is based on differences in the charge-to-mass ratio of the analytes. Fundamental to CZE are homogeneity of the buffer solution and constant field strength throughout the length of the capillary. The separation relies principally on the pH-controlled dissociation of acidic groups on the solute or the protonation of basic functions on the solute.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCapillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) allows amphoteric molecules, such as polypeptides, to be separated by electrophoresis in a pH gradient generated between the cathode and anode. A solute will migrate to a point where its net charge is zero. At this isoelectric point (the solute's pI), migration stops and the sample is focused into a tight zone. In CIEF, once a solute has focused at its pI, the zone is mobilized past the detector by either pressure or chemical means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCEC is a hybrid technique between traditional liquid chromatography (HPLC) and CE. In essence, CE capillaries are packed with HPLC packing and a voltage is applied across the packed capillary, which generates an electro-osmotic flow (EOF). The EOF transports solutes along the capillary towards a detector. Both differential partitioning and electrophoretic migration of the solutes occurs during their transportation towards the detector, which leads to CEC separations. It is therefore possible to obtain unique separation selectivities using CEC compared to both HPLC and CE. The beneficial flow profile of EOF reduces flow related band broadening and separation efficiencies of several hundred thousand plates per meter are often obtained in CEC. CEC also makes it is possible to use small-diameter packings and achieve very high efficiencies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECC) is a capillary electropheretic method that allows the separation of uncharged solutes. In this technique, surfactants, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, are added to the operating buffer in amounts that exceed the critical micelle concentration at which micelles form. The surface of anionic micelles of this type has a large negative charge, which give them a large electrophoretic mobility toward the positive electrode. Most buffers, however, exhibit such a high electroosmotic rate toward the negative electrode that the anionic micelles are carried toward the negative electrode, but at a much reduced rate. This form a fast moving aqueous phase and a slower moving micellar phase. When the sample is introduced into the system, the components distribute themselves between the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon phase at the interior of the micelles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, isotachophoresis (ITP) is a method of concentrating samples by electrophoretic separation using a discontinuous buffer. In isotachophoresis, two different buffer systems are used to create zones which the analytes separate into. During an isotachophoresis experiment it is possible to separate either cations or anions, not both. In ITP, a large volume of sample is placed between a leading electrolyte and a terminating electrolyte. Analytes in the sample stack into narrow bands one after another according to their mobility. The technique can be used in conjunction with capillary electrophoresis where a discontinuous electrolyte system is employed at the site of sample injection into the capillary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, transient isotachophoresis (tITP) is a variation of this technique commonly used in conjunction with capillary electrophoresis (CE). \nForet, F., et al. in \"\nTrace Analysis of Proteins by Capillary Zone Electrophoresis with On-Column Transient Isotachophoretic Preconcentration\n\". Electrophoresis 1993, 14, 417-428 (1993\n) describe two electrolyte arrangements for performing tITP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne configuration employs two reservoirs connected by a capillary. The capillary and one reservoir are filled with a leading electrolyte (LE), while the second reservoir is filled with terminating electrolyte (TE). The sample for analysis is first injected into the capillary filled with LE and the injection end of the capillary is inserted into the reservoir containing TE. Voltage is applied and those components of the sample which have mobilities intermediate to those of the LE and TE stack into sharp ITP zones and achieve a steady state concentration. The concentration of such zones is related to the concentration of the LE co-ion but not to the concentration of the TE. Once a steady state is reached, the reservoir containing TE is replaced with an LE containing reservoir. This causes a destacking of the sharp ITP zones, which allows individual species to move in a zone electrophoretic mode.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe other configuration discussed by Foret, F., et al. employs a similar approach but uses a single background electrolyte (BGE) in each reservoir. The mobility of the BGE co-ion is low such that it can serve as the terminating ion. The sample for analysis contains additional co-ions with high electrophoretic mobility such that it can serve as the leading zone during tITP migration. After sample is injected into the capillary and voltage is applied, the leading ions of higher mobility in the sample form an asymmetric leading and sharp rear boundary. Just behind the rear boundary, a conductivity discontinuity forms, and this results in a non-uniform electric field, and thus stacking of the sample ions. As migration progresses, the leading zone will broaden due to electromigration dispersion and the concentration of higher mobility salt will decrease. The result is decreasing differences of the electric field along the migrating zones. At a certain concentration of the leading zone, the sample bands will destack and move with independent velocities in a zone electrophoretic mode. Isolation of peptides can involve any procedure known in the art, such as capillary electrophoresis (e.g., in capillary or on-chip), or chromatography (e.g., in capillary, column or on a chip).\n\n\n \n\n\n \nD\n. \nProcedures for Removal of Contaminants\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention following the primary purification procedure to obtain a polypeptide of interest, secondary purification steps to remove contaminants may be required. The contaminants can be inhibitors, interfering substances or inappropriate buffers. In one embodiment of the invention removal of contaminants will be achieved by specifically purifying their protein of interest away from a complex mixture of biological molecules. In another embodiment of the invention the removal of contaminants will be achieved by specifically removing contaminants from a sample containing a protein of interest. For example, immobilized Protein A can be used to selectively remove immunoglobulins from a sample where they are considered to be a contaminant. In yet another embodiment filters can be used to remove undesired components from a sample. Examples include but are not limited to size exclusion chromatography and ultrafiltration membranes that separate molecules on the basis of size and molecular weight. In yet another embodiment, ultracentrifugation is used for removing undesired components from a sample. Ultracentrifugation can involve centrifugation of a sample while monitoring with an optical system the sedimentation (or lack thereof) of particles. In another embodiment of the invention, electrodialysis is used to remove undesired components from the sample. Electrodialysis is an electromembrane process in which ions are transported through ion permeable membranes from one solution to another under the influence of a potential gradient. Since the membranes used in electrodialysis have the ability to selectively transport ions having positive or negative charge and reject ions of the opposite charge, electrodialysis is useful for concentration, removal, or separation of electrolytes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nRemoval of Endotoxin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention it may be necessary to remove endotoxins from the sample. Endotoxins are pyrogenic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) components of Gram-negative bacteria. Because these bacteria are ubiquitous, it is not surprising that endotoxins are frequent contaminants of biochemical preparations. Endotoxin contamination usually is measured as endotoxin units (EU), where 1 EU corresponds to a concentration of endotoxin (usually about 0.1 ng/kg body weight) sufficient to generate a pyrogenic reaction. In one embodiment removal of endotoxin is performed by ultracentrifugation. In another embodiment removal of endotoxin is performed by using immobilized polymixin B. Methods for reducing endotoxin levels are known to one of ordinary skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, purification techniques using silica supports, glass powder or hydroxyapatite, reverse-phase, affinity, size-exclusion, anion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, a combination of these methods, and the like. Methods for measuring endotoxin levels are known to one of ordinary skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nRemoval of Detergent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention it may be necessary to remove some or all of the detergent in the sample. For example, although many water-soluble polypeptides are functional in detergent-solubilized form, other polypeptides may be modified and inactivated by detergent solubilization. In one embodiment detergent removal can occur by dialysis. Dialysis is effective for removal of detergents that have high CMCs (critical micelle concentrations) and/or small aggregation numbers, such as the N-octyl glucosides. In another embodiment removal of detergent from the sample can occur by sucrose density gradient separation. In yet another embodiment, detergents can be removed from the sample by size exclusion chromatography.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nE. Recombinant polypeptides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention isolation of polypeptides may use genetic engineering techniques to synthesize of hybrid proteins. By fusing the coding sequence of a polypeptide of interest with the coding sequence of a polypeptide with high affinity to a ligand, a hybrid protein with an affinity tag can be produced directly by a microorganism. Examples of expression systems are \nEscherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida,\n yeast, mammalian cells and the baculovirus system in insect cells. The affinity tag can then be used to recover the product from a culture medium, cell lysate, estract, inclusion bodies, periplasmic space of the host cells, cytoplasm of the host cells, or other material by affinity chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention non-natural amino acid polypeptides which are secreted into the medium can be obtained by centrifugation or filtration. These solutions may be suitable for direct application to chromatography columns. In another embodiment of the invention polypeptides which are accumulated intracellularly are extracted prior to purification by chromatography. In one embodiment polypeptides are extracted by cell disruption. Examples of cell disruption techniques include mechanical desintegrators, such as glass bead mills and high-pressure homoganizers. In another embodiment of the invention polypeptides are extracted by cell permeabilization. Examples of permeabilization agents include but are not limited to guanidine hydrochloride and Triton X-100. In addition to chemical permeabilization cells can be permeabilized by enzymatic lysis. The clarification of the cell homogenate or crude extract obtained after cell permeabilization can be done by centrifugation or by different filtration methods, such as microfiltration or ultrafiltration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification tags have been developed to be applied in ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, affinity, immunoaffinity, and metal-chelate chromatography. For example, hybrid polypeptides with a polyarginine tag can be purified by ion exchange chromatography, hybrid peptides with a polyphenylalanine tag can be isolated by hydrophobic chromatography, hybrid peptides with a β- Galactosidase tag can be isolated by affinity chromatography, hybrid peptides with a protein A tag can be isolated by IgG- affinity chromatography, hybrid peptides with an antigenic tag can be isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography and hybrid peptides with a polyhistidine can be isolated by metal chelate chromatography. Tags may be removed by chemical or enzymatic means. In some embodiments, the tag is removed via an intramolecular reaction. A linker molecule may or may not be released.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, non-natural amino acids may be used to generate purification tags and hybrid polypeptides with these tags can be purified using chromatography or other techniques. In one embodiment, multiple non-natural amino acids are included at a terminus of the polypeptide. Purification of this polypeptide with multiple non-natural amino acids may be purified by affinity chromatography or by other means depending on the properties of the non-natural amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo conjugate polypeptides with multiple non-natural amino acid tags with another molecule, the following procedure may be performed. After the binding of the polypeptide to a resin that binds to the non-natural amino acid tag, a reaction is performed to conjugate the polypeptide to another molecule such as PEG. The conjugated product may be released from the resin as a result of the conjugation or after the conjugation is complete. The conjugation may be performed under denaturing conditions and refolding of the polypeptide may be performed on the resin. The second molecule may be conjugated to the polypeptide at a natural or non-natural amino acid present in the polypeptide. The second molecule may be conjugated to the polypeptide at a natural or non-natural amino acid present in the non-natural amino acid tag.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the multiple non-natural amino acids included at a terminus of the polypeptide are metal-binding amino acids. Purification of this polypeptide may be performed using methods similar to those used for His-tagged proteins. In another embodiment, the polypeptide comprises two or more non-natural amino acids in that one or more non-natural amino acid is used to bind the polypeptide to a resin and the second non-natural amino acid is used to conjugate the polypeptide to another molecule, including but not limited to, PEG. Other materials useful in purification techniques may be used instead of resins. Tags may be removed by chemical or enzymatic means. In some embodiments, the tag is removed via an intramolecular reaction. A linker may or may not be released.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a hybrid polypeptide may have a non-natural amino acid at the junction of the polypeptide and the tag. This non-natural amino acid may be used to separate the polypeptide from the tag by chemical cleavage, for example during or after the binding of the tag to a column. This non-natural amino acid may be used to separate the polypeptide from the tag by enzymatic cleavage or by an intramolecular chemical reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a \"prodrug\" type approach is used. A non-natural amino acid polypeptide is bound to a purification matrix, and a portion or all of the polypeptide is released after an event, including but not to, an intramolecular reaction, exposure to UV light (light activated molecule for release), chemical cleavage, or enzymatic cleavage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment a specific cleavage site at the junction between parts of a polypeptide could be introduced. This enables, for example, cleavage of the hybrid molecule to yield the protein of interest free of an affinity tag.. Removal of a fusion sequence may be accomplished by enzymatic or chemical cleavage. To split off the affinity tag from the polypeptide of interest, a specific chemical or enzymatic cleavage site may be engineered into the fusion proteins. Enzymatic removal of fusion sequences may be accomplished using methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The choice of enzyme for removal of the fusion sequence will be determined by the identity of the fusion, and the reaction conditions will be specified by the choice of enzyme as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Chemical cleavage may be accomplished using reagents known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including but not limited to, cyanogen bromide, TEV protease, and other reagents. Examples of cleavage reagents include but are not limited to, formic acid, hydroxylamine, collagenase, factor Xa, enterokinase, renin, carboxypeptidase A and carboxypeptidase B. The cleaved hGH polypeptide may be purified from the cleaved fusion sequence and cleavage reagents by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Such methods will be determined by the identity and properties of the fusion sequence and the polypeptide, as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Methods for purification may include, but are not limited to, size-exclusion chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography or dialysis or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith an increasing number of protein and peptide therapeutics in development, there is a demand for an efficient, economic, and large-scale protein purification method that is not costly and difficult to scale up. Resins or other materials known to those skilled in the art may be used to isolate polypeptides. \nFigure 10\n shows an example of a purification method for a non-natural amino acid polypeptide utilizing a resin that reacts with the non-natural amino acid. A covalent linkage is formed between a chemically specific affinity tag on the resin and a non-natural amino acid present in the protein. Such linkages are stable under a broad range of pH and purification conditions. The separation step may be performed in alternate modes, including but not limited to a bath mode, enabling the large-scale purifications. The resin and the affinity tags are physically and chemically stable, and thus, can be reused to reduce the cost of protein purification upon scale-up. The separation can be performed in conjunction with conjugation of the polypeptide to molecules including but not limited to, PEG. This \"one-pot\" method further simplifies the conjugation process and reduces the cost of production of proteins, including but not limited to target therapeutic proteins (\nFigure 11\n). Resins can be selected and functionalized according to the non-natural amino acid present in the polypeptide. \nFigure 12\n shows an example of resin selection and functionalization. Resins or other matrixes for purification can be functionalized with different functional groups depending on the non-natural amino acid in the polypeptide. For example, \nFIG. 13\n shows an example of affinity purification of a non-natural amino acid polypeptide using hydroxylamine resin. \nFIG. 14\n shows an example of purification of a non-natural amino acid polypeptide using an aldehyde resin. The ability to regenerate the matrix used in purification methods also provides advantages for large-scale production.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the purification process changes one or more non-natural amino acids present in the polypeptide to one or more natural amino acids. \nFIG. 15\n shows an example of purification of native proteins from a non-natural amino acid precursor. The non-natural amino acid is converted to tyrosine after release from the resin used in the purification process. \nFIG. 16\n shows non-limiting examples of non-natural amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-natural amino acids present in a set of two or more proteins may be used to purify complexes of polypeptides. The non-natural amino acids may be bonded to each other or joined via a linker, a polymer, or another molecule to enable purification of a complex of polypeptides. Polypeptides that may be isolated in this fashion include but are not limited to multiple subunit receptors or enzymes. Techniques used to isolate complexes may utilize one or more additional non-natural amino acids present in one or more of the polypeptides. Techniques for isolating large proteins are known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Dissociation of the polypeptide complex may be performed using one or more non-natural amino acids present in one or more of the polypeptides. One or more of the non-natural amino acids may be reacted with another molecule with a functional group that causes separation of the polypeptides in the complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the polypeptides may form a complex due to non-covalent interactions that involve one or more non-natural amino acids present in the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, electro/chemical interaction such as electrical or magnetic fields may be used to purify polypeptides due to one or more non-natural amino acids present in the polypeptide. In other embodiments, single cell purification or isolation may be achieved using non-natural amino acid polypeptide.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nXII. \nLibrary Screening\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. High Throughput Screening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe technological approaches for the screening process of the non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof disclosed herein, include, but not limited to, multiwell-plate based screening systems, cell-based screening systems, microfluidics-based screening systems, and screening of soluble targets against solid-phase synthesized drug components.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAutomated multiwell formats are developed high-throughput screening systems. Automated 96-well plate-based screening systems are widely used. The plate based screening systems can be made to reduce the volume of the reaction wells further, thereby increasing the density of the wells per plate. Other types of high-throughput assays, such as miniaturized cell-based assays can also be used in the present invention. Miniaturized cell-based assays have the potential to generate screening data of quality and accuracy, due to their in vivo nature. Microfluidics-based screening systems that measure in vitro reactions in solution make use of ten to several-hundred micrometer wide channels. Micropumps, electroosmotic flow, integrated valves and mixing devices control liquid movement through the channel network.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLibraries for screening can be grouped as, by way of example only, General Screening or Template-Based such as Groups with common heterocyclic lattices; Targeted such as Mechanism based selections, for example, Kinase Modulators, GPCR Ligands, Antiinfectives, Potassium Channel Modulators, and Protease Inhibitors; Privileged Structure such as Compounds containing chemical motifs that are more frequently associated with higher biological activity than other structures; Diversity such as Compounds pre-selected from available stock with maximum chemical diversity; Plant Extracts; Natural Products / Natural Product-Derived, etc.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA. Chemical Libraries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCombinatorial chemical libraries are a means to assist in the generation of new chemical compound leads. A combinatorial chemical library is a collection of diverse chemical compounds generated by either chemical synthesis or biological synthesis by combining a number of chemical \"building blocks\" such as reagents. Millions of chemical compounds can be synthesized through such combinatorial mixing of chemical building blocks. LogP, molecular weight, number of H-bond donors and acceptors, as set forth in the Lipinski \"rule of five\" requirements, help to determine strong candidates for drug-like characteristics. Lipinski \"rule of five\" requires the compound to have these properties: five or fewer hydrogen bond donors, molecular weight less than or equal to 500 Da, calculated LogP less than or equal to 5), and ten or fewer hydrogen bonding acceptors. High throughput screening technologies coupled with compound libraries obtained through combinatorial chemistry and/or high throughput synthesis methods can be utilized to rapidly identify and optimize ligands for non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof, as disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemical diversity libraries of organic compounds include, but are not limited to: benzodiazepines, diversomers such as hydantoins, benzodiazepines and, analogous organic syntheses of small compound libraries, oligomeric libraries such as peptide, N-alkyl glycine, polycarbamate and polyureas, oligocarbamates, and/or peptidyl phosphonates, carbohydrate libraries, chiral compound libraries, and small organic molecule libraries. A wide variety of heterocyclic compound libraries have been synthesized by solid phase methods. These include, by way of example only, benzodiazepins, pyrrolidines, hydantoins, 1,4-dihydropyridines, isoquinolinones, diketopiperazines, benzylpiperazines, quinolones, dihydro- and tetrahydroisoquinolines, 4-thiazolidinones, b-lactams, benzisothiazolones, pyrroles and imidazoles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombinatorial libraries of inorganic compounds include, but not limited to, (a) Oxides of metals and main group elements, including transition metal oxides such as zirconia, titania, manganese oxide, rare earth oxides such as ceria and lanthanum oxide; binary, ternary, and more complex solid state oxides and ceramic phases; various forms of alumina, silica, aluminosilicates and aluminophosphates; (b) Natural and synthetic forms of aluminosilicate and silicate zeolites such as ZSM-5, Beta, zeolite Y, and ferrierite, various forms of molecular sieves such as aluminophosphates and titanosilicates; natural or synthetic clays and related minerals such as kaolin, attapulgite, talc, montmorillonite, and Laponite®; (c) Non-oxide ceramics such as metal carbides and nitrides; (d) Various forms of carbons such as activated carbon, carbon molecular sieves, graphite, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and carbon black; (e) Various organic polymers, oligomers, or resins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyamides, halo hydrocarbon polymers, polyesters, etc.; (f) Metals such as precious metals and/or transition metals deposited, mixed with, or exchanged into any support such as any of the materials described in (a)-(e) above. Examples of such phases include Pt/alumina, Pd/alumina, and Cu-ZSM-5.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nB. Biological Libraries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide library by using microorganisms -\n Antibodies and immune cell receptors of the immune system are representative biological libraries. In the immune system, all the processes of library design, synthesis, and optimization are controlled by the organism itself. Only structures of antigens and genetic information to form embryonic factors are external conditions, but the rest is controlled spontaneously by internal factors. Because the immune system uses protein structure libraries, they are libraries using amino acids as basic factors. Because peptides or proteins made of amino acids are the first products of synthesis by translating genetic information, through genetic engineering technologies, proteins of desired sequences can be easily obtained by inserting modified genetic information into microorganisms like bacteria or virus. Microorganism library synthesis brings several advantages. It is possible to clone microorganisms to make only one kind of proteins per microorganism, and even though only one cell is acquired, the number of clones can be easily increased by cell multiplication. The other advantage of using microorganisms is that they can self-propagate whenever there is enough supply. After synthesizing a DNA strand that makes the desired protein sequence, its complementary strand is synthesized, by enzymes if needed. For synthesized DNA to replicate and translate properly in microorganisms, it needs to be packed with vector and inserted into microorganisms. Proteins expressed on the surface of the microorganism, and to find desired proteins is the next step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo make library various genetic information is needed. Random DNA synthesis or cutting cDNA or the whole genomic DNA of a particular organism can be used. A portion of DNA sequence that makes particular protein can be modified to make mutated protein library. Considering volume limitations and expression rates of microorganism incubation, 10\n9\n (one billion) kinds of libraries can be made. Compared to 10\n6\n to 10\n7\n kinds of synthesis libraries, it is a huge number. The number of 5-unit peptides is 20\n5\n (3.2 millions), that of 6-unit ones is 64 millions, and for 7-unit peptides the number passes one billion. Therefore, if more than 7 amino acids are changed incomplete library that does not contain all the possible combinations is made. For long proteins, 7 different amino acids can be selected separately and replaced. When DNA is randomly synthesized, DNA codes can be repeated and designate the same amino acid, and generation frequency changes. Therefore, to make all the possible combinations, much more quantities of clones are required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA linear combinatorial biological library such as a polypeptide library is formed by combining a set of chemical building blocks called amino acids in every possible way for a given compound length (i.e., the number of amino acids in a polypeptide compound). The proteins may be members of a protein family such as a receptor family (examples: growth factor receptors, catecholamine receptors, amino acid derivative receptors, cytokine receptors, lectins), ligand family (examples: cytokines, serpins), enzyme family (examples: proteases, kinases, phosphatases, ras-like GTPases, hydrolases), transcription factors (examples: steroid hormone receptors, heat-shock transcription factors, zinc-finger, leucine-zipper, homeodomain), HIV proteases or hepatitis C virus (HCV) proteases, and antibody or antibody fragment (Fab, for example). Other examples are, such as, peptoids, encoded peptides, random biooligomers, dipeptides, vinylogous polypeptides, nonpeptidal peptidomimetics with Beta D Glucose scaffolding, antibody libraries, and peptide nucleic acid libraries.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nBacteriophage library\n - It is one of a number of protein library methods. Bacteriophage is living in a host bacterium and a kind of virus with genetic materials and capsids. M13 and Lambda viruses are the most famous.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA M13 is a thin, long virus and due to its small genome size, numerous libraries can be made easily. Different from other viruses, it can come out to outside of host cells without damaging them or inhibiting their growth. It is known that M13 amplifies its genetic information in the host cell and wears the capsid when emerging. It makes 10 kinds of proteins and pVIII and pIII capsids are commonly used in library synthesis among them. A pVIII protein surrounds the whole body and has about 50 amino acids. Usually 2700 per a virus are expressed. Because its amino end protrudes toward outside of the capsid, it can be modified to express a different peptide on it. Usually a long peptide cannot be expressed, but it is possible for 6-unit peptides. Because large amount of the same library molecules are expressed at the same time, in spite of its relatively short size, it is appropriate for a reaction with various ligands. A pIII protein is expressed at the end of a virus, and usually 3 to 5 proteins of 406 amino acids are expressed. It can express quite large proteins so that it is used for the whole protein or antibody molecule libraries. A normal antibody uses Fab, an antigen recognition region, or a Fvs chain. Bacteriophage Library and hybridoma are the most famous methods to make antibodies. M13 is ideal to make random peptide libraries and the virus is stable enough to be precipitated and concentrated so that screening 10\n9\n libraries in a volume of 1 - 10 µL is possible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferent from the M13, a Lambda virus coats itself with a capsid in the cytoplasm and comes out of its host cell when there is an enough number, instead of wearing a capsid when emerging. In other words, if a different protein is expressed, it will probably emerge in a folded shape with proper functions. A pV and D proteins are commonly used for the library synthesis. As proteins that can be expressed on a bacteriophage surface, there are random peptide, natural protein fragments, mutated particular protein libraries, and partial antibody fragments and they are used for chromatography materials, protein-protein mutual reactions, receptor binding site searching, and drug discoveries.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage display is a widely utilized technique to make peptide libraries. These peptide libraries are useful for screening to identify peptides that have a particular desired activity, such as binding to another polypeptide or other molecule. In phage display the peptide library is fused to a bacteriophage protein, typically a coat protein,that is displayed on the surface of the phage. The library of peptide bearing phage is contacted with an immobilized binding partner, such as a cell surface or a purified protein, and specific binders are then isolated. Phage display techniques and libraries are described in \n \nUS Patents No. 5580717\n \n, \n \n5702892\n \n, \n \n5750344\n \n, \n \n5821047\n \n, \n \n5962255\n \n, \n \n6140471\n \n, \n \n6475806\n \n, \n \n5427908\n \n, \n \n5667988\n \n, \n \n5733743\n \n, \n \n5750373\n \n, \n \n5824520\n \n, \n \n6096551\n \n, \n \n6225447\n \n, \n \n6492160\n \n, which are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein. \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,750,373\n \n, which is incorporated by reference herein, describes a method for selecting novel proteins such as growth hormone and antibody fragment variants having altered binding properties for their respective receptor molecules. The method comprises fusing a gene encoding a protein of interest to the carboxy terminal domain of the gene III coat protein of the filamentous phage M13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nBacteria and yeast libraries\n - Not only viruses with capsids, but also bacteria with cell walls and membranes can be used for library expression as well. Both the gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria can be used to express proteins on cell surfaces, and E. coli, a gram-negative bacterium, is commonly used. Bacteria library can find an antigen that strongly binds to a certain antibody and use it as a vaccine, or it can express diagnostic antibodies or receptor libraries for analysis of particular materials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is called translational modification that the higher animal's protein is modified by phosphorylation or sugar addition after the protein synthesis. But a bacterium, a prokaryote, does not have such a function, and when even a protein is synthesized, it either precipitates due to its bad solubility or is inactivated in most cases. Therefore, S. cerevisiae, a eukaryote, is used. Even though S. cerevisiae is unicellular like bacteria, it has translational modification function and very similar proteins to the original can be made.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferent from viruses, it has a micron size cell so that FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) can be used. Fluorescence labeled target molecules are added to the library of proteins expressed on a cell surface and flow through thin tubes of FACS machine. FACS sorts each cells by fluorescent colors and intensities as alive. It is possible to screen different target molecules with different colors and also possible to sort cells of different intensities and selectivity. Another advantage is a liquid-phase screening. It is not necessary to separate strongly clung molecules. Sorted cells multiply again and they are re-screened.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYeast surface display techniques are also widely utilized to product and display peptide libraries. Yeast surface display may be utilized in combination with fluorescence activated cell sorting to select cells displaying the desired peptides. Yeast surface display techniques and libraries are described in \n \nUS Patents No. 6083693\n \n, \n \n6406863\n \n, \n \n6410271\n \n, \n \n6232074\n \n, \n \n6410246\n \n, \n \n6610472\n \n, which are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBacterial surface display has been used in a variety of forms to display peptides on the cell surface or in the periplasm. A variety of bacterial hosts are available for use in this system, as are a variety of polypeptide anchoring domains to anchor the displayed peptide to the cell surface. Bacterial surface display techniques and libraries are described in \n \nUS Patents No. 5348867\n \n, \n \n5866344\n \n, \n \n6277588\n \n, \n \n5635182\n \n, \n \n6180341\n \n, which are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther in vivo systems are utilized to make libraries of polypeptides and identify changes in activities, such as target protein binding modulation, resulting from changes in amino acid sequences. Examples of in vivo systems include, but are not limited to, the yeast two hybrid system (\nSchneider, S et al., Nat. Biotechnol., 17, 170-175 (1990\n)), and the dihydrofolate reductase protein-fragment complementation assay (\nPellitier, N.J. et al., Nat. Biotechnol., 17, 683-690, (1990\n)), which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nBio-panning\n - A synthesized microorganism library may be used to find a peptide that binds to a particular molecule with high affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTarget molecules, such as non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof as disclosed herein, may be evenly placed on a test plate. The prepared microorganism library may be added to the plate. Only the microorganisms that strongly bind to the target molecules will remain and the rest will be in the solution. After a while, unbound microorganisms may be discarded, and then weakly or accidentally bound microorganisms may be washed with appropriate solutions. The target molecule's binding affinity determines the washing process. Still remaining microorganisms can be taken apart by addition of low pH or high concentrated target molecules, and the quantity is amplified by re-incubation. Sometimes it may be difficult to separate them without killing bacteria when the affinity is too strong. If it is a bacteriophage, instead of separation, one can infect its host cell directly. Because there still can be some undesired microorganisms bound accidentally, the first amplified microorganisms may go through repeated screening and amplification processes to increase the number of clones containing active proteins. Finally after they are incubated in low concentration, each clone may be separated and usually tens of clones may be selected and used for DNA sequence analysis. It is successful if peptide structures from DNA information are recognizable and most of clones show accord peptide sequences. However, because proteins can have toxicity up to kinds of clones and DNA expression rate can vary, there may be a possibility that faster multiplying and well-expressed clones are selected than desired screening results. Therefore, a confirmation step is necessary by measurement of peptide synthesis and binding affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe microorganism protein library technology fundamentally uses a living organism's self-reproduction ability. That is, by amplifying (feeding) a small quantity of obtained candidate molecules, one can increase purity and quantity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nRibosome display\n---Ribosome display and mRNA display techniques are also widely utilized to make peptide libraries. Ribosome display and mRNA display are in vitro techniques that couple the mRNA encoding a peptide to the encoded peptide either on the ribosome or by using puromycin. Ribosome display and mRNA display techniques and libraries are described in \n \nUS Patents No. 6416950\n \n, \n \n6436665\n \n, \n \n6602685\n \n, \n \n6660473\n \n, \n \n6429300\n \n, \n \n6489116\n \n, \n \n6623926\n \n, \n \n6589741\n \n, \n \n6348315\n \n, \n \n6207446\n \n, \n \n6258558\n \n, \n \n6416950\n \n, \n \n6440695\n \n, \n \n6228994\n \n, \n \n6281344\n \n, \n \n6429300\n \n, \n \n6660473\n \n, \n \n5580717\n \n, \n \n5688670\n \n, \n \n6238865\n \n, \n \n6261804\n \n, \n \n6518018\n \n, \n \n6281344\n \n, \n \n6258558\n \n, \n \n6214553\n \n, which are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nDNA, RNA library -\n Development of PCR, DNA amplification technology, has enabled using nucleic acids as libraries. Because DNA and RNA are made of 4 units, 10 oligomers have 410 (about 10\n6\n = a million) kinds and 20 oligomer library can have about 1012. By using automated solid-phase DNA synthesizer, 5' end and 3' end are fixed in a sequence and A, T, C, and G are randomly placed as each take about 25% of the sequence. When one strand is made, it may be replicated by using enzymes or amplified by PCR. Commonly about 1014-15 molecules are made and used, but occasionaly there are about 40 places (1024 kinds) for random introduction, sometimes they start with incomplete set of library. For DNA library, DNA themselves are simply used, but for RNA library, T7 RNA Polymerase is needed to transcript.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrepared libraries are sorted by target molecule binding screening; amplified by PCR for DNA and by RT-PCR for RNA. Non-natural aminoacids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof as disclosed herein, can be used as target molecules. Screening and amplification of the amplified library is repeated until the beginning number of 10\n14-15\n is narrowed to several hundreds, and then sequences of acquired candidate molecules are analyzed and each binding affinity is measured. Such acquired DNA and RNA are called aptamers, and they show strong affinity toward protein target molecules. The aptamer inhibits the target molecule's function in vivo, but it is quickly destroyed by in vivo nucleases. To solve the problem, some parts of library are substituted with artificial nucleic aids to increase resistance against nucleases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFew examples of biological libraries include, but not limited to, Bioactive Lipid Library; Endocannabinoid Library- compounds having activity at cannabinoid (CB) and vanniloid (VR) receptors which includes various classes of ligands, for example, Amides, Ethanolamides, Lipo-amino acids, Acyl-GABAs, and Acyl-dopamines etc.; Known Bioactives Library, such as, GPCR ligands, second messenger modulators, nuclear receptor ligands, actin & tubulin modulators, kinase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, ion channel blockers, gene regulation agents, lipid biosynthesis inhibitors, etc. ; Ion Channel Ligand Library; Kinase/Phosphatase Inhibitor Library; Natural Products Library- Natural products are an unsurpassed source of chemical diversity and are an ideal starting point for any screening program for pharmacologically active small molecules; Neurotransmitter Library- CNS Receptor Ligands, such as, Adrenergics, Dopaminergics, Serotonergics, Opioids(& Sigma ligands), Cholinergics, Histaminergics(& Melatonin Ligands), Ionotropic Glutamatergics, Metabotropic Glutamatergics, GABAergics, and Purinergics (& Adenosines) etc.; Nuclear Receptor Ligand Library- Nuclear Receptor Ligand Library contains compounds with at nuclear receptors. Receptor agonists and antagonists may be included; Orphan Ligand Library-Orphan ligand library contains compounds with biological activity but whose protein binding partners have not been identified. For example, trace Amines, neurotransmitter metabolites, endogenouse β-carbolines, urinary metabolites, nicotine congeners, and D-Amino Acids etc.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n2. Methods of Screening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods to identify candidate agents that bind to a protein or act as a modulator of the binding characteristics or biological activity of a protein. Assays may be conducting in a variety of ways including screening a library of non-natural amino acid polypeptides with a known molecule or vice versa. In one embodiment, the method is performed in single test tubes or on a modest scale. In another embodiment, the method is performed in plurality simultaneously. For example, the method can be performed at the same time on multiple assay mixtures in a multi-well screening plate. Thus, in one aspect, the invention provides a high throughput screening system. With regards to assaying for interactions in one embodiment, fluorescence or absorbance readouts are utilized to determine activity. Other biological activities to assays by way of example only are acetylation, carboxylation, acylation, phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, ubiquitination, glycosylation, lipid modification, ADP-ribosylation, bioavailability and half-life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are many methods known to those skilled in the art which can also be used to detecting interaction between a non-natural amino acid polypeptide and another molecule within a screening assay. These methods may include by way of example only, fluorescent bind-binding assays, thermal shift assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, protein-protein binding assays , biochemical screening assays, immunoassays (\ni.e\n. immunoprecipitation) and cell based assays (\ni.e\n. two- or three-hybrid screens, GST pull down, TAP-TAG system), expression assays, protein-DNA binding assays, functional assays (phosphorylation assays, etc.) and the like. See, \ne.g.,\n \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 6,495,337\n \n, incorporated herein by reference. Other methods may also include protein chip systems which can screen enzymes, receptor proteins or antibodies which aid conducting protein-protein interaction studies, ligand binding sutdies, or immunoassays (\nMacBeath and Schreiber, Science 2000 289: 1760-1763\n). Another embodiment may involve, profiling drug which can effect in intact cells, that are introduced with functional non-natural amino acid polypeptides, by probing the cell physiology using fluorescent stains for DNA and other proteins known to interact with the non-natural amino acid polypeptide and using fluorescent microscopes generated pictures so as to measure changes in the cells' behavior (\nMayer, T.U., Kapoor, T.M., Haggarty, S.J., King, R.W., Schreiber, S.L., Mitchison, T.J. (1999). Science.286, 971-4\n.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, there are numerous methods by which detection of binding of a test ligand to a non-natural amino acid polypeptide (and, thus, by which identification of a ligand of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide) can be carried out. Useful methods are those by which the folded non-natural amino acid polypeptide can be distinguished from unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide. The methods described below are by way of example only some of the means by which this can be done. In each case, the detection method is carried out on a test combination (test ligand-non-natural amino acid polypeptide combination) after sufficient time has passed for binding of a non-natural amino acid polypeptide to its ligand and on a control combination (which is the same as the test combination except that no test ligand is present).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA. Methods for Determining the Presence of Folded Non-Natural Amino Acid Polypeptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the present method, a test ligand may be combined with a non-natural amino acid polypeptide for which a ligand (\ni.e\n., an agent which binds the non-natural amino acid polypeptide) is to be identified. The resulting combination is a test ligand- non-natural amino acid polypeptide combination or test combination. In general, the test ligand is present in excess molar amounts, relative to the non-natural amino acid polypeptide. The present method can be carried out in solution or, in some embodiments of the method, the non-natural amino acid polypeptide can be present on a solid phase (\ne.g\n., linked covalently through a linker or otherwise to a bead). The test ligand and non-natural amino acid polypeptide are combined under conditions (\ne.g\n., temperature, pH, salt concentration, time) appropriate for binding of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide to a ligand. In addition, conditions under which test ligand and non-natural amino acid polypeptide are combined are generally such that, for non-natural amino acid polypeptide that unfolds reversibly, a substantial fraction of non-natural amino acid polypeptide is present in the absence of the test ligand in the unfolded form, although the fraction can vary, depending on the detection method used. In the case of non-natural amino acid polypeptide which unfold irreversibly, conditions are generally such that the non-natural amino acid polypeptide unfolds at a substantial rate in the absence of ligand. These conditions are chosen to ensure that the non-natural amino acid polypeptide unfolds to an appropriate extent; thus, the observed signal (\ne.g\n., digestion by a protease; binding to antibody, chaperonin or surface) can be measured conveniently. If too little non-natural amino acid polypeptide is unfolded, the observed signal will occur at too low a level or rate to be conveniently measured. For each test ligand- non-natural amino acid polypeptide combination assessed, the conditions under which the present method is carried out will be determined empirically, using known methods. Such conditions include reaction temperature and the chaotropic agent(s) or denaturant(s) used. The temperature at which the method is carried out is determined by the non-natural amino acid polypeptide being used and can be determined empirically using known methods. To adjust or optimize the fraction of unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide, denaturing conditions may be required for some non-natural amino acid polypeptide. Such denaturing conditions might include the use of elevated temperatures, the addition of protein denaturants (\ne.g\n., urea, guanidine) to the incubation mixture or use of both. In addition, the stability of some non-natural amino acid polypeptide might be adjusted through engineering destabilizing or stabilizing amino acid substitutions in the non-natural amino acid polypeptide. The test ligand and non-natural amino acid polypeptide are combined, maintained under appropriate conditions and for sufficient time for binding of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide to a ligand. The time necessary for binding of non-natural amino acid polypeptide to ligand will vary depending on the test ligand, non-natural amino acid polypeptide and other conditions used. In some cases, binding will occur instantaneously (\ne.g\n., essentially simultaneous with combination of test ligand and non-natural amino acid polypeptide), while in others, the resulting test ligand- non-natural amino acid polypeptide combination is maintained for a longer time before binding is detected. In the case of non-natural amino acid polypeptide which unfolds irreversibly, the rate of unfolding must also be taken into consideration in determining an appropriate time for binding of test ligand. Binding of a test ligand to the non-natural amino acid polypeptide is assessed in one of several ways: by determining the extent to which folded non-natural amino acid polypeptide is present in the test ligand- non-natural amino acid polypeptide combination; by determining the extent to which unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide is present in the test ligand- non-natural amino acid polypeptide combination or by determining the ratio of folded non-natural amino acid polypeptide to unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide in the combination. That is, the difference between the amount of folded non-natural amino acid polypeptide, the amount of unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide or the ratio of folded non-natural amino acid polypeptide to unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide in the presence of the test ligand and in its absence is determined. If a test ligand binds the non-natural amino acid polypeptide (\ni.e\n., if the test ligand is a ligand for the non-natural amino acid polypeptide), there will be more folded non-natural amino acid polypeptide and less unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide (and, thus, a higher ratio of folded to unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide and a lower ratio of unfolded to folded non-natural amino acid polypeptide) than is present in the absence of a test ligand which binds the non-natural amino acid polypeptide. It is not necessary to determine the quantity or fraction of a folded and unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide. It is only necessary to know that there is a difference in the amount of folded or unfolded protein (a change in equilibrium of the two forms) in the presence and absence of a ligand or a change in the rate of unfolding. This difference can be determined by comparing the extent to which folded and/or unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide is present in a test combination (test ligand- non-natural amino acid polypeptide combination) With the extent to which they are present in a control combination (non-natural amino acid polypeptide in the absence of test ligand). Alternatively, for reversible unfolding, the difference between the extent to which the two forms occur in the absence of a test ligand can be assessed by determining their occurrence initially (\ne.g\n., prior to addition of a test ligand to a solution of non-natural amino acid polypeptide or to solid support-bound test protein) and then after the test ligand has been combined with the non-natural amino acid polypeptide under conditions appropriate for non-natural amino acid polypeptide -ligand binding to occur. In either case, determination of the two forms of non-natural amino acid polypeptide can be carried out using a variety of known methods, which are described below. A test ligand which is shown by the present method to bind a non-natural amino acid polypeptide is referred to as a ligand of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n1. Determining Ligand Binding Using Proteolysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present method, binding of test ligand to non-natural amino acid polypeptide is detected through the use of proteolysis. In this embodiment, a protease which acts preferentially upon unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide is combined with the test ligand-non-natural amino acid polypeptide combination (test combination) and the resulting test combination-protease mixture is assayed after an appropriate period of incubation, using one of the methods described in detail below, to determine the difference between intact or degraded non-natural amino acid polypeptide in the presence and in the absence of the test ligand. An identical assay is performed on a test ligand-non-natural amino acid polypeptide combination and on a control combination and results of the two assays are compared. More intact protein or less degraded protein in the test combination than in the control combination indicates that the test ligand has bound the non-natural amino acid polypeptide and, thus, indicates that the test ligand is a ligand of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide. Similarly, a higher ratio of intact non-natural amino acid polypeptide to degraded protein in the test combination than in the control indicates the test ligand is a ligand of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of proteases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, V8 protease, elastase, carboxypeptidase, proteinase K, thermolysin and subtilisin, can be used in this embodiment. It is only necessary that the protease used be able to act upon (hydrolyze the peptide bonds of) the non-natural amino acid polypeptide used under the chosen incubation conditions and that this action be preferentially directed toward the unfolded form of the protein. To avoid interference by target ligands which directly inhibit the protease, more than one protease can be used simultaneously or in parallel assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to be efficiently digested the peptide bonds, the peptide substrate--the non-natural amino acid polypeptide--must have access to the enzyme active site of the chosen protease. Because the atoms in a folded protein molecule are tightly packed, the majority of the susceptible peptide bonds are sterically blocked from entering a protease active site when the protein is in the folded state. In the unfolded state, the peptide bonds are more exposed and are therefore relatively more susceptible to protease action.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsequently, the addition of a test ligand which binds the folded non-natural amino acid polypeptide, stabilizing it in the protease-resistant form, changes the rate of proteolysis. Thus, by incubating the test ligand with the non-natural amino acid polypeptide, adding a protease to preferentially degrade the unfolded proteins, and then employing an assay to quantify the intact or the degraded non-natural amino acid polypeptide, it is possible to ascertain whether the test ligand bound the non-natural amino acid polypeptide and, thus, is a ligand of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide, indicating that it is potentially therapeutically useful.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the protease may be intrinsic to the unpurified or partially purified non-natural amino acid polypeptide sample.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n2. Determining Ligand Binding Through Detection of Surface Binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present method, the propensity of unfolded proteins to adhere to surfaces is utilized. This embodiment relies on the fact that folded proteins are held in specific three dimensional arrangements and, thus, are not as likely as their unfolded counterparts to bind a surface. If a test ligand binds a non-natural amino acid polypeptide (\ni.e\n., is a ligand of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide), it will stabilize the folded form of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide. Thus, the ability of a test ligand to bind a non-natural amino acid polypeptide can be determined by assessing the extent to which non-natural amino acid polypeptide is bound to an appropriate solid surface in the presence and in the absence of the test ligand. The methods described in detail below can be used for this purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this embodiment, the non-natural amino acid polypeptide, a test ligand and a surface that preferentially binds unfolded protein are combined and maintained under conditions appropriate for binding of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide to a ligand and binding of unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide to the surface. There are numerous suitable surfaces for this purpose, including microtiter plates constructed from a variety of treated or untreated plastics, plates treated for tissue culture or for high protein binding, nitrocellulose filters and PVDF filters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a test ligand binds the non-natural amino acid polypeptide, more folded non-natural amino acid polypeptide and less unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide is present in the test ligand-non-natural amino acid polypeptide combination than is present in a comparable control combination. That is, in the presence of a test ligand that is a ligand for a non-natural amino acid polypeptide, less unfolded protein is available to bind a surface that preferentially binds unfolded protein than in the absence of a ligand for the non-natural amino acid polypeptide. Determination of the amount of surface-bound non-natural amino acid polypeptide or the amount of non-natural amino acid polypeptide remaining in solution can be carried out using one of the methods described below. If more non-natural amino acid polypeptide is not surface bound (\ni.e\n., if more non-natural amino acid polypeptide is in solution) in the presence of a test ligand than in the absence of the test ligand, the test ligand is a ligand of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide. The ratio of non-natural amino acid polypeptide in solution to surface-bound non-natural amino acid polypeptide is greater if a test ligand is a ligand for the non-natural amino acid polypeptide than if it is not. Conversely, the ratio of surface-bound non-natural amino acid polypeptide to non-natural amino acid polypeptide in solution is less if a test ligand is a ligand for the non-natural amino acid polypeptide than if it is not.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n3. Determining Ligand Binding Using Antibody Binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a third embodiment, the extent to which folded and unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide are present and, thus, binding of test ligand to non-natural amino acid polypeptide, are assessed through the use of specific antibodies directed against only the unfolded state (\"denatured-specific antibodies\" or \"DS antibodies\") or only the folded state (\"nature specific antibodies\" or \"NS antibodies\"). When a non-natural amino acid polypeptide is in the folded state, and stabilized in that state by test ligand which is a ligand for the non-natural amino acid polypeptide, the DS antibody's apparent binding affinity will be reduced (\nBreyer, (1989) \"\nProduction and Characterization of Mono-clonal Antibodies to the N-terminal Domain of the Lambda Repressor\n\", J. Biol. Chem., 264(5):13348-13354\n) and that of the NS antibody will be enhanced. If DS antibody binding to non-natural amino acid polypeptide is less or if NS antibody binding is greater in the presence of a test ligand than in its absence the test ligand is a ligand for the non-natural amino acid polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are numerous methods known in the art for producing antibody that binds to a particular protein (\nHarlow, E. & D. Lane, ANTIBODIES: A LABORATORY MANUAL, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1988\n, incorporated herein by reference). To prepare antibody specific for the denatured state, animals can be immunized with a peptide from a region of the protein that is buried in the native state. If the structure of the protein is unknown, antibodies can be prepared against several peptides and then the antibodies can be screened for preferential binding to the denatured state. Antibody production is by standard techniques, such as the technique for production of mono-clonal antibodies described in detail in \nZola, Monoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques, CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Fla. (1987\n), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are at least three basic methods by which DS or NS antibodies can be utilized to detect a ligand-induced change in the occurrence of folded non-natural amino acid polypeptide, the occurrence of unfolded proteins or the ratio of one to the other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one approach, a test solution containing the DS antibody directed against the unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide, the non-natural amino acid polypeptide, and the test ligand is incubated, such as in a microtiter plate coated with the denatured non-natural amino acid polypeptide or a peptide fragment thereof, under conditions appropriate for binding of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide with its ligand and binding of the DS antibody to unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide. A control solution, which is the same as the test solution except that it does not contain test ligand, is processed in the same manner as the test solution. By comparing the amount of antibody bound to the plate or the amount remaining in solution in the test and control solutions, the difference in non-natural amino acid polypeptide folding is detected. The amount of antibody bound to the plate or remaining in solution can be measured as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a second approach, a test solution containing the DS antibody, the test ligand, and the non-natural amino acid polypeptide is incubated in a plate coated with a second antibody, referred to as a solid phase antibody, which cannot bind to the non-natural amino acid polypeptide simultaneously with the DS antibody, and is specific for the non-natural amino acid polypeptide, but is either specific for the folded state (\"native specific\" or \"NS antibody\") or unable to differentiate between the native and denatured states (\"non-differentiating\" or \"ND antibody\"). The resulting test combination or solution is maintained under conditions appropriate for binding of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide with a ligand of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide and for binding of the antibodies to the proteins they recognize (are specific for). A control solution, which is the same as the test solution except that it does not contain test ligand, is processed in the same manner as the test solution. In both solutions, denatured (unfolded) non-natural amino acid polypeptide binds the DS antibody and is inhibited from binding the solid phase antibody. The ability of the test ligand to bind the non-natural amino acid polypeptide can be gauged by determining the amount of non-natural amino acid polypeptide that binds to the solid phase antibody in the test solution and comparing it with the extent to which non-natural amino acid polypeptide binds to the solid phase antibody in the absence of test ligand, which in turn reflects the amount of non-natural amino acid polypeptide in the folded state. The amount of non-natural amino acid polypeptide bound to the plate via the second antibody or remaining in solution can be detected by the methods described below. This approach may be used in a comparable manner with NS antibody as the in solution antibody and DS or ND antibody on the solid phase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a third approach, a test solution containing the non-natural amino acid polypeptide and the test ligand is incubated in a container, such as a microtiter well which has been coated with a DS or NS antibody and maintained under conditions appropriate for binding of non-natural amino acid polypeptide to its ligand and for binding of the antibody to non-natural amino acid polypeptide. Alternatively, the antibody can be present on the surfaces of beads. The ability of the test ligand to bind the non-natural amino acid polypeptide is gauged by determining the extent to which non-natural amino acid polypeptide remains in solution (unbound to the antibody) or on the solid surface (bound to the antibody), or the ratio of the two, in the presence and in the absence of test ligand. If the test ligand binds the non-natural amino acid polypeptide (is a ligand of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide), there will be less non-natural amino acid polypeptide bound to a DS antibody or more bound to an NS antibody (\ni.e\n., more non-natural amino acid polypeptide will be in solution in the case of DS antibody or less in solution for NS antibody) than is bound to the antibody in the control solution. In a further embodiment, the antibody can be present in solution and the non-natural amino acid polypeptide can be attached to a solid phase, such as a plate surface or bead surface.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n4. Determining Ligand Binding Using Molecular Chaperones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a fourth embodiment, molecular chaperones are used to determine binding of a test ligand to a non-natural amino acid polypeptide. Chaperones are a variety of protein that bind unfolded proteins as part of their normal physiological function. They are generally involved in assembling oligomeric proteins, in ensuring that certain proteins fold correctly, in facilitating protein localization, and in preventing the formation of proteinaceous aggregates during physiological stress. \nHardy, (1991) \"\nA Kinetic Partitioning Model of Selective Binding of Nonnative Proteins by the Bacterial Chaperone SecB\n\", Science 251:439-443\n These proteins have the ability to interact with many unfolded or partially denatured proteins without specific recognition of defined sequence motifs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne molecular chaperone, found in \nE\n. \ncoli,\n is SecB. SecB has a demonstrated involvement in export of a subset of otherwise unrelated proteins. Competition experiments have shown that SecB binds tightly to all the unfolded proteins tested, including proteins outside of its particular export subset, but does not appear to interact with the folded protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this embodiment, a test solution containing the test ligand and the target is incubated on a microtiter plate or other suitable surface coated with molecular chaperones, under conditions appropriate for binding of non-natural amino acid polypeptide with its ligand and binding of the molecular chaperones used to unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide. The unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide in the solution will have a greater tendency to bind to the molecular chaperone-covered surface relative to the ligand-stabilized folded non-natural amino acid polypeptide. Thus, the ability of the test ligand to bind non-natural amino acid polypeptide can be determined by determining the amount of non-natural amino acid polypeptide remaining unbound, or the amount bound to the chaperone-coated surface, using the methods detailed below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a competition assay for binding to molecular chaperones can be utilized. A test solution containing purified non-natural amino acid polypeptide, the test ligand, and a molecular chaperone can be incubated in a container, such as a microtiter well coated with denatured (unfolded) non-natural amino acid polypeptide, under conditions appropriate for binding non-natural amino acid polypeptide with its ligand and binding of the molecular chaperones to unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide. A control solution which is the same as the test solution except that it does not contain test ligand is processed in the same manner. Denatured non-natural amino acid polypeptide in solution will bind to the chaperonin and, thus, inhibit its binding to the denatured non-natural amino acid polypeptide bound to the container surface (microtiter well surface). Binding of a test ligand to non-natural amino acid polypeptide will result in a smaller amount of unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide, and, thus, more chaperones will be available to bind to the solid-phase denatured non-natural amino acid polypeptide than is the case in the absence of binding of test ligand. Thus, binding of test ligand can be determined by assessing chaperones bound to the surface or in solution in the test solution and i\nD\n the control solution and comparing the results. Binding of chaperone to solid-phase denatured non-natural amino acid polypeptide to a greater extent in the test solution than in the control solution is indicative of test ligand-non-natural amino acid polypeptide binding (\ni.e.,\n is indicative of identification of a ligand of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide). In this assay, the molecular shaperones are generally not provided in excess, so that competition for their binding can be measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, test solution containing the non-natural amino acid polypeptide, the test ligand and a molecular chaperone can be incubated in a container, such as a microtiter well, whose surface is coated with antisera or a monoclonal antibody specific for the folded non-natural amino acid polypeptide (NS antibody) and unable to bind the non-natural amino acid polypeptide bound to the chaperone. Unfolded non-natural amino acid polypeptide will bind chaperone in solution and thus be inhibited from binding the solid phase antibody. By detecting non-natural amino acid polypeptide in the solution or bound to the well walls and comparing the extent of either or both in an appropriate control (the same combination without the test ligand), the ability of the test ligand to bind non-natural amino acid polypeptide can be determined. If the test ligand is a ligand for the non-natural amino acid polypeptide, more non-natural amino acid polypeptide will be bound to the antisera or monoclonal antibody bound to the container surface in the test solution than in the control solution. Conversely, less non-natural amino acid polypeptide will be present unbound (in solution) in the test solution than in the control solution. Detection and comparison of bound non-natural amino acid polypeptide, unbound non-natural amino acid polypeptide or a ratio of the two in the test solution and control solution indicate whether the test ligand is a ligand of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide or not.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n5. Determining Ligand Binding Through Measurements the Protein Aggregation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe higher the fraction of protein in the folded form, the greater the amount of protein that is available to bind to a ligand that binds exclusively to the folded state. Consequently, if a protein has a known ligand, it is possible to increase the binding of the protein to the known ligand by adding a ligand that binds another site on the protein. In this approach, a ligand known to bind to the non-natural amino acid polypeptide is immobilized on a solid substrate. A solution containing the non-natural amino acid polypeptide is then added, along with test ligand or ligands. An increase in the amount of non-natural amino acid polypeptide that binds to the immobilized ligand relative to an identical assay in the absence of test ligand indicates that the test ligand binds the non-natural amino acid polypeptide. The amount of non-natural amino acid polypeptide bound to the solid substrate can be assessed by sampling the solid substrate or by sampling the solution, using the detection methods outlined below.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n6. Determining Ligand Binding Through Measurements of Protein Aggregation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor proteins that unfold irreversibly, unfolded protein often forms insoluble aggregates. The extent of protein aggregation can be measured by techniques outlined below such as light scattering, centrifugation, and filtration. In this approach, non-natural amino acid polypeptide and test ligand are incubated and the amount of protein aggregation is measured over time or after a fixed incubation time. The extent of protein aggregation in the test mixture is compared to the same measurement for a control assay in the absence of test ligand. If a test ligand binds a non-natural amino acid polypeptide, the rate of unfolding of non-natural amino acid polypeptide will be lower than in the absence of test ligand. For measurements over time, the rate of increase of unfolded protein and hence of aggregated protein will be lower if the test ligand is a ligand for the non-natural amino acid polypeptide than if it is not. For measurements at a fixed time, there will be less unfolded protein add therefore less aggregated protein if the test ligand is a ligand for the non-natural amino acid polypeptide than if it is not. Thus, the ability of a test ligand to bind a non-natural amino acid polypeptide can be determined by assessing the extent of protein aggregation in the presence and absence of test ligand.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nXIV. Protein Detection Techniques\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods known in the art to detect the presence or absence of protein, small peptides or free amino acids can be used in the present method for detecting non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof. The method used can be determined by the product (proteins, peptides, free amino acids) to be detected. For example, techniques for detecting protein size can be used to determine the extent of proteolytic degradation of the non-natural amino acid polypeptide. Radio-labeling, fluorescence labeling, and enzyme-linked labeling can detect the presence or absence either in solution or on a substrate by measurement of radioactivity, fluorescence or enzymatic activity. Immunologic methods can detect the presence or absence of a known non-natural amino acid polypeptide in solution or on a substrate such as by binding of an antibody specific for that protein. \nFIG. 1a\n presents various protein detection techniques that can be used to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA. Fluoroscence Microscopy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for protein detection disclosed herein, include fluorescence microscopy to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof. Fluorescence Microscopy is a widely used microscopy technique that enables the molecular composition of the structures being observed to be identified through the use of fluorescently-labelled probes of high chemical specificity. Such probes may be antibodies, antibody fragments, or antigen-binding polypeptides that comprise a non-natural amino acid. Fluorescence microscopy may be used in studies of fixed specimens. For proteins that can be extracted and purified in reasonable abundance, a fluorophore may be conjugated to a protein and the conjugate introduced into a cell. A fluorophore may be conjugated to a non-natural amino acid in the polypeptide. It is assumed that the fluorescent analogue behaves like the native protein and can therefore serve to reveal the distribution and behavior of this protein in the cell. Along with NMR, infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism and other techniques, protein intrinsic fluorescence decay and its associated observation of fluorescence anisotropy, collisional quenching and resonance energy transfer are key techniques for protein detection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeasuring the fluorescence decay allows the dynamics of structural changes in a protein to be observed directly. Moreover, excitation of the native fluorescence of proteins emanating from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan eliminates the possibility of perturbation of the local environment when using extrinsic fluorescent probes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA development in the use of fluorescent probes for biological studies has been the use of naturally fluorescent proteins as fluorescent probes. Naturally occurring dyes, so-called fluorescent proteins (GFP, YFP, CFP, TOPAS, GFT, RFP), were discovered in the late 1990s (Clonetech, USA). These dyes are distinguished by their reduced influence on specimens. They are therefore particularly suitable for labeling cell regions in living preparations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe jellyfish Aequorea victoria produces a naturally fluorescent protein known as green fluorescent protein (GFP). The fusion of these fluorescent probes to a target protein enables visualization by fluorescence microscopy and quantification by flow cytometry. Because they are genetically encoded and require no auxiliary cofactors, GFP tags can be used to analyze protein expression and localization in living cells and whole organisms. The gene for this protein has been cloned and can be transfected into other organisms. GFP tags may be used for localizing regions in which a particular gene is expressed in an organism, or in identifying the location of a particular protein. In many cases these chimeric proteins preserve their original function. It is therefore often possible, for example, to use this technique to visualize the intracellular distribution of a protein, including but not limited to a cytoskeletal protein. With GFP, unstained or unfixed samples can be observed. There are presently several variants of GFP which provide spectrally separable emission colors. Mutations to GFP have resulted in blue-, cyan- and yellow-fluorescent light emitting versions. Fluorescent proteins which can be used to label the present non-natural amino acid peptides, polypeptides, antibodies, and antibody fragments include but are not limited to, green fluorescent protein (GFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), red fluorescent protein (RFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFF), enhanced GFP (EGFP), enhanced YFP (EYFP), and the like. New versions of GFP have been developed via mutation, including a \"humanized\" GFP DNA, the protein product of which has increased synthesis in mammalian cells (see \nCormack, et al., (1996) Gene 173, 33-38\n; \nHaas, et al., (1996) \n; and \nYang, et al., (1996) Nucleic Acids Research 24, 4592-4593\n). One such humanized protein is \"enhanced green fluorescent protein\" (EGFP). GFP, variants of GFP, or other naturally occurring dyes may be coupled to non-natural amino acid polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGFP can be used as a biosensor, reporting the results of levels of ions or pH by fluorescing in characteristic ways. One molecule that can be used to sense the level of zinc ions is a blue fluorescent protein shown as PDB (Protein Data Bank) entry 1kys. The protein fluoresces twice as brightly creating an easily detectable visible signal once zinc binds to the modified chromophore. Construction of other peptide and protein biosensors comprising a non-natural amino acid may exhibit altered fluorescence properties in response to changes in their environment, oligomeric state, conformation upon ligand binding, structure, or direct ligand binding. Appropriately labeled fluorescent biomolecules allow spatial and temporal detection of biochemical reactions inside living cells. See for example \nGiuliano, K. A., et al., Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995, 24:405-434\n; \nDay, R. N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998, 12:1410-9\n; \nAdams, S.

Biochem. 1999, 192:87-94\n. \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,951,947\n \n, which is incorporated by reference herein, discusses biosensors and fluorophores that detect environmental changes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt present the technology is driven by new applications of existing probes and the design and synthesis of new and innovative probes. Without limiting the scope of the present invention, some of the probes are as following:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nLabels\n \n: Sensitivity and safety (compared to radioactive methods) of fluorescence has been increasingly used for specific labelling of nucleic acids, proteins and other biomolecules. Besides Fluorescein, there are other fluorescent labels that cover the whole range from 400 to 820 nm. By way of example only, some of the labels include, but are not limited to, Fluorescein and its derivatives, Carboxyfluoresceins, Rhodamines and their derivatives, Atto labels, Fluorescent red and Fluorescent orange: Cy3/Cy5™ alternatives, Lanthanide complexes with long lifetimes, Long wavelength labels - up to 800 nm, DY cyanine labels, Phycobili proteins. Fluorescent molecules that are capable of absorbing radiation at one wavelength and emitting radiation at a longer wavelength include but are not limited to Alexa-532, Hydroxycoumarin, Aminocoumarin, Methoxycoumarin, Coumarin, Cascade Blue, Lucifer Yellow, P-Phycoerythrin, R-Phycoerythrin, (PE), PE-Cy5 conjugates, PE-Cy7 conjugates, Red 613, Fluorescein, BODIPY-FL, BODIPY TR, BODIPY TMR, Cy3, TRITC, X-Rhodamine, Lissamine Rhodamine B, PerCP, Texas Red, Cy5, Cy7, Allophycocyanin (APC), TruRed, APC-Cy7 conjugates, Oregon Green, Tetramethylrhodamine, Dansyl, Dansyl aziridine, Indo-1, Fura-2, FM 1-43, DilC18(3), Carboxy-SNARF-1, NBD, Indo-1, Fluo-3, DCFH, DHR, SNARF, Monochlorobimane, Calcein, N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) amine (NBD), ananilinonapthanele, deproxyl, phthalamide, amino pH phthalamide, dimethylamino-naphthalenesulfonamide, probes comparable to Prodan, Lordan or Acrylodan and derivatives thereof. Coumarin fluorescent dyes include, for example, amino methylcoumarin, 7-diethylamine-3-(4'-(1-maleimidyl)phenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM) and N-(2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl)7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-Carboxamide (MDCC). Other useful molecules include those that display fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Many such donor-acceptor pairs are known, and include fluorescein to rhodamine, coumarin to fluorescein or rhodamine, etc. Still another class of useful label pairs includes fluorophore-quencher pairs in which the second group is a quencher, which decreases the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent group. Some known quenchers include acrylamide groups, heavy atoms such as iodide and bromate, nitroxide spin labels such as TEMPO, etc. Labels such as these may be conjugated to non-natural amino acid polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFluorophores that are be conjugated to a non-natural amino acid polypeptide may fluoresce all of the time or only when the polypeptide is bound to a target. Other types of fluorophores include\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nConjugates:\n \n By way of example only, some of the conjugates include but are not limited to, Isothiocyanate conjugates, streptavidin conjugates, and Biotin conjugates. Antibody conjugates have been widely used to track biomolecules in living cells and whole organisms. They can be generated with specificity for virtually any epitope and are therefore, in principle, applicable to imaging a wide range of biomolecules. Comjugates including but not limited to antibody conjugates may comprise a non-natural amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nEnzyme Substrates:\n \n Enzyme substrates include but are not limited to fluorogenic and chromogenic substrates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMicro- and Nanoparticles\n:\n Various techniques allow the preparation of a wide variety of fluorescent microspheres ranging in size, matrix chemistry, type of fluorochrome, fluorescence intensity, and surface functional groups. By way of example only, some of the fluorochromes used are: FITC (green fluorescence, Excitation/Emission = 506/529 nm), Rhodamine B (orange fluorescence, Excitation/Emission = 560/584 nm), Nile Blue A (red fluorescence, Excitation/Emission = 636/686 nm)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFluorescent nanoparticles are promising tools for both optical data storage and other technical applications, for example, in biochemical, bioanalytical and medical areas. Current medical and biological fluorescent imaging methods are mainly based on dye markers, which are limited in light emission per molecule, as well as photostability. Nanoparticles overcome those problems offering strong and stable fluorescence. Fluorescent nanoparticles have been successfully used for various types of immunoassays. Fluorescent nanoparticles are based on different materials, such as, polyacrylonitrile, and polystyrene, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMolecular Rotors\n \n: Fluorescent Molecular Rotors are sensors of microenvironmental restriction that become fluorescent only if their rotation is constrained. The change of fluorescence intensity is caused by the restriction of intramolecular rotational relaxation about the donor-acceptor bond of the fluorophores. Examples of molecular constraint include but are not limited to increased dye (aggregation), binding to antibodies, or being trapped in the polymerization of actin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIEF-Markers\n:\n IEF (Isoelectric Focusing) is a powerful analytical tool for the separation of ampholytes, mainly proteins. In order to ensure the high performance of analysis, standards of pI (pI markers) are needed. An advantage for IEF-Gel electrophoresis with Fluorescent IEF-Marker is the possibility to directly observe the formation of gradient. Fluorescent IEF-Marker can also be detected by UV-absorption at 280 nm (20°C).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny or all of these fluorescent probes can be used for the detection of non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof. \nFIG. 9\n presents non-limiting examples of molecules that are site specifically attached to proteins through oxime formation between carbonyl of non-natural amino acid incorporated into a polypeptide and the hydroxylamine of the molecule. The molecules shown are fluorophores, biotin, and chelators.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nBio-Orthogonal Chemical reporters\n:\n Small molecules have better access to intracellular and extravascular compartments. Their use as imaging agents requires a means to selectively target the small probe to a desired biomolecule. Nucleophilic functionality occurs in most types of biopolymers, permitting facile derivatization with biotin, fluorophores and numerous other small-molecule reporters. Established bioconjugation protocols have made these operations trivial for purified biopolymers \nin vitro.\n It is an alternative strategy for tagging biomolecules that blends the simplicity of genetically encoded tags with the specificity of antibody labeling and the versatility of small-molecule probes. This approach involves the incorporation of unique chemical functionality-a bioorthogonal chemical reporter-into a target biomolecule using the cell's own biosynthetic machinery. Bioorthogonal chemical reporters are non-native, non-perturbing chemical handles that can be modified in living systems through highly selective reactions with exogenously delivered probes. This two-step labeling process can be used to outfit a target biomolecule for detection or isolation, depending on the nature of the probe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of bio-orthogonal coupling reactions include but are not limited to, the Staudinger ligation of azides with triaryl phosphines, the ketone/ aldehyde-hydrazine reaction, and Huisgen's 1,3-dipolar azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Replacement of the bulky fluorescent tag with a sterically inconspicuous azide group may furnish probes that are more able to distribute in an unbiased manner within a living cell, tissue, or organism. Likewise, the variable and often antagonistic effect of the fluorescent tag on probe binding affinity for specific proteins is also eliminated. Finally, the use of azide-alkyne cycloaddition chemistry can streamline probe synthesis by removing the need to generate and purify large quantities of structurally diverse fluorophore-tagged reagents. Coupling reactions utilizing non-natural amino acid polypeptides may provide probes that are alternatives to fluorescently tagged polypeptides. Huisgen's 1,3-dipolar azide-alkyne cycloaddition may be used to attach other molecules or provide other methods for polypeptide purification or detection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide libraries can be synthesized on solid supports and, by using coloring receptors, dyed solid supports can be selected one by one. If receptors cannot indicate any colors, their binding antibodies can be dyed. Because it is possible to separate solid supports by tweezers under microscopes or even magnifiers, the method can be not only be used on protein receptors, but also on screening binding ligands of synthesized artificial receptors and screening new metal binding ligands as well. This method is useful to search new lead compounds, because it enables the screening of a large amount of compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, determination of activity depending on dye intensity may not be accurate, and large amount of solid supports may not be always treated one by one. Therefore, automated methods for high throughput screening (HTS) are required and a FACS (Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter) method can be used. This machine originally runs cells through a capillary tube and separates cells by detecting their fluorescent intensities. The same method may be used on solid supports instead of cells. Because it is designed for cells, small resins of cell size may be run, but normal sizes of solid supports (50∼200 pmol) need specially modified machines. Partial or entire isolation of compounds may also be done. For partial isolation of compounds, time controlled photodecomposition or several functional groups to cleave in different conditions are used. In the meanwhile, one can scatter solid supports on soft agar and isolate some of compounds by photodecomposition. The isolated compounds then spread out around solid supports so that screening and solid support separation can be done at a time.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nB. Immunoassays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for protein detection disclosed herein, include immunoassays to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof. Immunoassays combine the principles of chemistry and immunology enabling scientific tests, e.g. enzyme immunoassays and immunoblotting for a specific and sensitive detection of the analytes (non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof) of interest. The basic principle of these assays is the specificity of the antibody-antigen reaction. Similar to the Western blot, a single protein can be identified by its antibody with immunoblotting. Competitive binding immunoassays may be done in which analyte competes with a labelled antigen for a limited pool of antibody molecules (eg. radioimmunoassay, EMIT). Immunoassays can be non-competitive such that antibody is present in excess and is labelled. As analyte antigen is increased, the amount of labeled antibody-antigen complex also increases (e.g. ELISA). Antibodies can be polyclonal if produced by antigen injection into experimental animal, or monoclonal if produced by cell fusion and cell culture techniques. In immunoassays the antibody serves as a specific reagent for the analyte antigen. The antigen may be non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof). On the other hand, the antibodies or fragments thereof used in immunoassays may be non-natural amino acid polypeptides, and may be used in the detection of antigens that may or may not comprise a non-natural amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout limiting the scope and content of the present invention, some of the types of immunoassays are, by way of example only, RIAs (Radioimmunoassay) and enzyme immunoassays like ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), EMIT (Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique), Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA), LIA (luminescent immunoassay), and FIA (fluorescent immunoassay). These techniques can be used to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof. The antibodies - either used as primary or secondary antibodies - may be labeled with radioisotopes (e.g. \n125\nI), fluorescent dyes (e.g. FITC) or enzymes (e.g. HRP or AP) which catalyze fluorogenic or luminogenic reactions.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n1. EMIT (Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEMIT is a competitive binding immunoassay that avoids a separation step. A type of immunoassay in which the protein is labeled with an enzyme, and the enzyme-protein-antibody complex is enzymatically inactive, allowing quantitation of unlabeled protein.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n2. ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for protein detection disclosed herein, include ELISA to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays are based on selective antibodies attached to solid supports combined with enzyme reactions to produce systems capable of detecting low levels of proteins. It is also known as enzyme immunoassay or EIA. The antigen, including but not limited to a protein, is detected by antibodies that have been made against it; that is, for which it is the antigen. Monoclonal antibodies are often used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe test may require the antibodies to be fixed to a solid surface, such as the inner surface of a test tube; and a preparation of the same antibodies coupled to an enzyme. The enzyme is one (e.g., β-galactosidase) that produces a colored product from a colorless substrate. The test, for example, is performed by filling the tube with the antigen solution (e.g., protein) to be assayed. Any antigen molecules present may bind to the immobilized antibody molecules. The antibody-enzyme conjugate is added to the reaction mixture. The antibody part of the conjugate binds to any antigen molecules that were bound previously, creating an antibody-antigen-antibody \"sandwich\". After washing away any unbound conjugate, the substrate solution is added. After a set interval, the reaction is stopped (e.g., by adding 1 N NaOH) and the concentration of colored product formed by reaction of the substrate with molecules conjugated to the secondary antibody is measured in a spectrophotometer. The intensity of color is proportional to the concentration of bound antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nELISA can also be adapted to measure the concentration of antibodies, in which case, the wells are coated with the appropriate antigen. The solution (e.g., serum) containing antibody is added. After it has had time to bind to the immobilized antigen, an enzyme-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin is added, consisting of an antibody against the antibodies being tested for. After washing away unreacted reagent, the substrate is added. The intensity of the color produced is proportional to the amount of enzyme-labeled antibodies bound (and thus to the concentration of the antibodies being assayed).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n3. Radioimmunoassays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for protein detection disclosed herein, include radioimmunoassays to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof. Radioimmunoassays are highly sensitive. Using antibodies of high affinity (eg., K\n0\n = 10\n8\n-10\n11\n M\n-1\n), it is possible to detect a few picograms (10-12 g) of antigen in the tube.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadioactive isotopes can be used to study in vivo metabolism, distribution, and binding of small amount of compounds. Radioactive isotopes of \n1\nH, \n12\nC, \n31\nP, \n32\nS, \n127\nI are used such as \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n125\nI. Radioactive isotopes have almost same chemical properties as unradioactive ones, so that they can be converted easily. Also because their radiation energy is relatively large, only a little amount is needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReceptor Fixation Method- For a 96 well plate format, receptors are fixed in each well by using antibody or chemical methods, and radioactive labeled ligands are added to each well to induce binding. Unbound ligands are washed out and then the standard is determined by the quantitative analysis of the radioactivity of bound ligands or that of washed-out ligands. The addition of target compounds for screening induces competitive binding reactions with receptors. If target compounds show higher affinity to receptors than standard radioactive ligands, most of the radioactive ligands do not bind to receptors and are left in solution. Therefore, by analyzing the quantity of bound radioactive ligands (or washed-out ligands), the affinity of target compounds to receptors can be easily indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA filter membrane method may be used when receptors cannot be fixed to 96 well plates or ligand binding must be performed in solution phase. With this method, after the ligand-receptor binding reaction is done in solution, the reaction solution is filtered through nitrocellulose filter paper. Small molecules including ligands will go through the filter paper, and only protein receptors will be left on the paper. Only ligands that are strongly bound to receptors will stay on the filter paper, and the relative affinity of added compounds can be identified by quantitative analysis of the standard radioactive ligands. This method can also be used to screen protein kinase inhibitors as well. In this case, γ-\n32\nP-ATP can be used as a phosphoric acid group supplier, and by checking radioactive labeled protein substrate, enzymatic activity can be analyzed. Radioactive ATP that does not react will be filtered and removed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example only, radioimmunoassays can be performed by preparing a mixture of radioactive antigen and antibodies against that antigen. Iodine atoms can be introduced into tyrosine residues in a protein, the radioactive isotopes \n125\nI or \n131\nI are often used. Known amounts of unlabeled (\"cold\") antigen can be added to samples of the mixture. These compete for the binding sites of the antibodies. At increasing concentrations of unlabeled antigen, an increasing amount of radioactive antigen is displaced from the antibody molecules. The antibody-bound antigen is separated from the free antigen in the supernatant fluid, and the radioactivity of each is measured. From these data, a standard binding curve can be drawn. The samples to be assayed (\"the unknowns\") are run in parallel. After determining the ratio of bound to free antigen in each unknown, the antigen concentrations can be read directly from the standard curve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther methods of radioimmunoassays that can be used for detecting non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof are, by way of example only, precipitating the antigen-antibody complexes by adding a \"second\" antibody directed against the first. For example, if a rabbit IgG is used to bind the antigen, the complex can be precipitated by adding an anti-rabbit-IgG antiserum (e.g., raised by immunizing a goat with rabbit IgG). Alternatively, the antigen-specific antibodies can be coupled to the inner walls of a test tube. After incubation, the unbound contents are removed; the tube is washed, and the radioactive of the unbound and bound material are both measured. The antigen-specific antibodies can be coupled to particles, like Sephadex. Centrifugation of the reaction mixture separates the bound counts (in the pellet) from the free counts in the supernatant fluid.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n4. Fluorescence Immunoassays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for protein detection disclosed herein, include fluorescence immunoassays to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof. Fluorescence based immunological methods are based upon the competitive binding of labeled ligands versus unlabeled ones on highly specific receptor sites. It is a very important tool for clinical and analytical biochemistry in the analysis of proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis technique can be used for immunoassays based on changes in fluorescence lifetime with changing analyte concentration. This technique works with dyes with a short lifetime like fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (the donor) whose fluorescence is quenched by energy transfer to Eosin (the acceptor). A number of molecular species have been used for causing energy transfer from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule. In particular, sandwich type immuno-complex formation can be used with this technique.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of photoluminescent compounds may be used in the method of the invention and include the compounds listed above in fluorescence microscopy, as well as groups such as cyanines, oxazines, thiazines, porphyrins, phthalocyanines, fluorescent infrared-emitting polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, phycobiliproteins, squaraines and organo-metallic complexes, hydrocarbons and azo dyes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFluorescence based immunological methods can be, for example, heterogenous or homogenous. Heterogenous Immunoassays comprise a physical separation of bound from free labeled analyte. The analyte or antibody may be attached to a solid surface. The technique can be competitive (for a higher selectivity) or noncompetitive (for a higher sensitivity). Detection can be direct (only one type of antibody used) or indirect (a second type of antibody is used). Homogenous Immunoassays comprise no physical separation. Double-Antibody Fluorophore-labeled antigen participates in an equilibrium reaction with antibodies directed against both the antigen and the fluorophore. Labeled and unlabeled antigens compete for a limited number of anti-antigen antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSimple Fluorescence Labelling method-\n \n It can be used for receptor-ligand binding, enzymatic activity by using pertinent fluorescence, and as a fluorescent indicator of various in vivo physiological changes such as pH, ion concentration, and electric pressure. Self-fluorescence of amino acids such as tyrosine and tryptophan result in background radiation, and to overcome such weak points fluorescent compounds of absorption UV length longer than 520 nm such as cyanine are often used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFRET: Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer - FRET may be used to measure the interaction of two proteins in vivo and can measure nanometer scale distances and distance (conformation) changes. Therefore, it has been used to measure simple protein-protein interactions and changes in protein folding, conformation, and stability (see \nPhilipps, B.; Hennecke, J.; Glockshuber R. Mol Biol. 2003, 327, 239-249\n; \nRiven, I.; Kalmanzon, E.; Segev, L.; Reuveny E. Neuron. 2003, 38, 225-235\n). Two different fluorescent molecules (fluorophores) are conjugated to the two proteins of interest. Non-natural amino acid polypeptides conjugated to fluorophores may be used in FRET. When two fluorescent compounds are used instead of a single fluorescent compound, non-fluorescent energy transfer occurs. When the emission wavelength of a fluorescent donor is similar to absorption wavelength of an acceptor, the donor in its excited state will transfer its energy to the acceptor instead to emitting fluorescent light, and consequently emission occurs at emission wavelength of the acceptor. A number of different fluorophore pairs have been used for FRET analysis including GFP (green fluorescent protein) variants CFP (cyan) and YFP (yellow) fused to the proteins of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDistance R0 of 50% FRET effect depends on the overlap of the emission range of donors, absorption range of the acceptors, and the acceptor's quantum yields and solvent. If two fluorescent molecules are at a shorter distance from each other than R0, when the donor's absorption light is emitted, theoretically the acceptor's fluorescence will be stronger. If the distance becomes longer than R0, when the same light is emitted, the donor's fluorescence will be detected as stronger. Therefore, enzymatic activity can be measured easily if fluorescent molecules are linked to the ends of small peptides, which can be used as kinases such as protease. BRET (Bioluminescene resonance energy transfer) was developed by \nXu et al (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999, 96, 151-156\n). It acts on a principle similar to FRET and is based on the finding that the emission spectrum of Renilla luciferase is similar to that of CFP. These techniques allow the study of interactions within specific subcellular compartments, including membrane protein-protein interactions, when utilizing organelle targeted fluorescent protein variants. Also post-translational modification events can be studied in mammalian cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTRF: Time Resolved Fluorescence-\n \n To reduce fluorescent background, Time Resolved Fluorescence was developed. The lifetime of excited states of common fluorescent molecules is usually only a few microseconds, but Lanthanide series elements have milliseconds of life time. TRF is a method that selectively measures the fluorescence of the Lanthanide series after the emission of other fluorescent molecules has finished. TRF can be also with FRET, and Lanthanide series become donors or acceptors.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n5. Various assay formats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nVarious assay formats may be used for the detection of the non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides, and fragment thereof, disclosed herein, including \"sandwich\" immunoassays and probe assays. For example, in a first assay format, a polyclonal or monoclonal antibody or fragment thereof, or a combination of these antibodies, which has been coated on a solid phase, is contacted with a test sample, to form a first mixture. This first mixture is incubated for a time and under conditions sufficient to form antigen/antibody complexes. Then, an indicator reagent comprising a monoclonal or a polyclonal antibody or a fragment thereof, or a combination of these antibodies, to which a signal generating compound has been attached, is contacted with the antigen/antibody complexes to form a second mixture. This second mixture then is incubated for a time and under conditions sufficient to form antibody/antigen/antibody complexes. The presence of antigen in the test sample and captured on the solid phase, if any, is determined by detecting the measurable signal generated by the signal generating compound. The amount of antigen present in the test sample is proportional to the signal generated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative assay format, a mixture is formed by contacting: (1) a polyclonal antibody, monoclonal antibody, or fragment thereof, which specifically binds to antigen, or a combination of such antibodies bound to a solid support; (2) the test sample; and (3) an indicator reagent comprising a monoclonal antibody, polyclonal antibody, or fragment thereof, which specifically binds to a different epitope (or a combination of these antibodies) to which a signal generating compound is attached. This mixture is incubated for a time and under conditions sufficient to form antibody/antigen/antibody complexes. The presence, if any, of antigen present in the test sample and captured on the solid phase is determined by detecting the measurable signal generated by the signal generating compound. The amount of antigen present in the test sample is proportional to the signal generated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another assay format, one or a combination of at least two monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be employed as a competitive probe for the detection of antibodies to antigen. For example, unnatural amino acid polypeptides disclosed herein, either alone or in combination, are coated on a solid phase. A test sample suspected of containing antibody to antigen then is incubated with an indicator reagent comprising a signal generating compound and at least one monoclonal antibody for a time and under conditions sufficient to form antigen/antibody complexes of either the test sample and indicator reagent bound to the solid phase or the indicator reagent bound to the solid phase. The reduction in binding of the monoclonal antibody to the solid phase can be quantitatively measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another detection method, the monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies can be employed in the detection of antigens in tissue sections, as well as in cells, by immunohistochemical analysis. The tissue sections can be cut from either frozen or chemically fixed samples of tissue. If the antigens are to be detected in cells, the cells can be isolated from blood, urine, breast aspirates, or other bodily fluids. The cells may be obtained by biopsy, either surgical or by needle. The cells can be isolated by centrifugation or magnetic attraction after labeling with magnetic particles or ferrofluids so as to enrich a particular fraction of cells for staining with the antibodies. Cytochemical analysis wherein these antibodies are labeled directly (with, for example, fluorescein, colloidal gold, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, etc.) or are labeled by using secondary labeled anti-species antibodies (with various labels as exemplified herein) to track the histopathology of disease also are within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombinations of the monoclonal antibodies (and fragments thereof) also may be used together as components in a mixture or \"cocktail\" along with antibodies which specifically bind to other regions of unnatural amino acid polypeptides disclosed herein, each antibody having different binding specificities. The polyclonal antibodies used in the assays can be used either alone or as a cocktail of polyclonal antibodies. Since the cocktails used in the assay formats are comprised of either monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies having different binding specificity to unnatural amino acid polypeptides disclosed herein, they are useful for the detecting, diagnosing, staging, monitoring, prognosticating, in vivo imaging, preventing or treating, or determining the predisposition to, various diseases and conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is contemplated and within the scope of the present invention that unnatural amino acid amino acids disclosed herein, may be detected in assays by use of a recombinant antigen as well as by use of a synthetic polypeptide or purified polypeptide, which polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence of unnatural amino acid polypeptides disclosed herein. It also is within the scope of the present invention that different synthetic, recombinant or purified polypeptides, identifying different epitopes of unnatural amino acid polypeptides disclosed herein, can be used in combination in an assay for the detecting, diagnosing, staging, monitoring, prognosticating, in vivo imaging, etc. In this case, all of these polypeptides can be coated onto one solid phase; or each separate polypeptide may be coated onto separate solid phases, such as microparticles, and then combined to form a mixture of polypeptides which can be later used in assays. Polypeptides coated on solid phases or labeled with detectable labels are then allowed to compete with those present in a sample for a limited amount of antibody. A reduction in binding of the synthetic, recombinant, or purified peptides to the antibody (or antibodies) is an indication of the presence of unnatural amino acid polypeptides disclosed herein. Variations of assay formats are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n6. Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) for immunoassays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for protein detection disclosed herein, include SPM to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof. In scanning probe microscopy, in the capture phase, for example, at least one of the monoclonal antibodies is adhered to a solid phase and a scanning probe microscope is utilized to detect antigen/antibody complexes which may be present on the surface of the solid phase. The use of scanning tunneling microscopy eliminates the need for labels which normally must be utilized in many immunoassay systems to detect antigen/antibody complexes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of SPM to monitor specific binding reactions can occur in many ways. In one embodiment, one member of a specific binding partner (analyte specific substance which is the monoclonal antibody) is attached to a surface suitable for scanning. The attachment of the analyte specific substance may be by adsorption to a test piece which comprises a solid phase of a plastic or metal surface. Covalent attachment of a specific binding partner (analyte specific substance) to a test piece which test piece comprises a solid phase of derivatized plastic, metal, silicon, or glass may be utilized. Covalent attachment methods are known to those skilled in the art and include a variety of means to irreversibly link specific binding partners to the test piece. If the test piece is silicon or glass, the surface must be activated prior to attaching the specific binding partner. Also, polyelectrolyte interactions may be used to immobilize a specific binding partner on a surface of a test piece by using techniques and chemistries. The preferred method of attachment is by covalent means. Following attachment of a specific binding member, the surface may be further treated with materials such as serum, proteins, or other blocking agents to minimize non-specific binding. The surface also may be scanned either at the site of manufacture or point of use to verify its suitability for assay purposes. The scanning process is not anticipated to alter the specific binding properties of the test piece.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nC. Spectroscopy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n1. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for protein detection disclosed herein, include NMR to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNMR spectroscopy is capable of determing the structures of biological macromolecules like proteins and nucleic acids at atomic resolution. In addition, it is possible to study time dependent phenomena with NMR, such as intramolecular dynamics in macromolecules, reaction kinetics, molecular recognition or protein folding. Methods for protein detection disclosed herein, include NMR to detect non-natural amino acid polypeptides and modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProgress in the theoretical and practical capabilities of NMR, led to increasingly efficient utilization of the information content of NMR spectra. Parallel developments in the biochemical methods (recombinant protein expression) allow the simple and fast preparation of protein samples. Heteronuclei like \n15\nN, \n13\nC and \n2\nH, can be incorporated in proteins by uniformly or selective isotopic labeling. Spectra from these samples can be drastically simplified. Additionally, some new information about structure and dynamics of macromolecules can determined with these methods. All these developments currently allow the structure determination of proteins with a mass of up to 30 kDa or more.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n2. X-ray crystallography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for protein detection disclosed herein, include X-ray crystallography to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nX-ray crystallography is a technique in crystallography in which the pattern produced by the diffraction of X-rays through the closely spaced lattice of atoms in a crystal is recorded and then analyzed to reveal the nature of that lattice. This generally leads to an understanding of the material and molecular structure of a substance. The spacings in the crystal lattice can be determined using Bragg's law. The electrons that surround the atoms, rather than the atomic nuclei themselves, are the entities which physically interact with the incoming X-ray photons. This technique is widely used in chemistry and biochemistry to determine the structures of an immense variety of molecules, including inorganic compounds, DNA and proteins. X-ray diffraction is commonly carried out using single crystals of a material, but if these are not available, microcrystalline powdered samples may also be used, although this requires different equipment and is much less straightforward.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor X-ray crystallography, the molecule must be crystallized. One photon diffracted by one electron cannot be reliably detected, however, because of the regular crystalline structure; the photons are diffracted by corresponding electrons in many symmetrically arranged molecules. Because waves of the same frequency whose peaks match reinforce each other, the signal becomes detectable. To determine a structure, crystals of the molecule of interest are grown using some method of crystallization. The crystals are harvested and often frozen with liquid nitrogen. Freezing crystals both reduces radiation damage incurred during data collection and decreases thermal motion within the crystal. Crystals are placed on a diffractometer, a machine that emits a beam of X-rays. The X-rays diffract off the electrons in the crystal, and the pattern of diffraction is recorded on film and scanned into a computer. These diffraction images are combined and eventually used to construct a map of the electron density of the molecule that was crystallized, atoms are then fitted to the electron density map and various parameters such as position are refined to best fit the observed diffraction data.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n3. Fluorescence Spectroscopy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for protein detection disclosed herein, include fluorescence spectroscopy to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBesides the standard fluorescence measurements a variety of other methods have been developed. Conventional Fluorometry involves measurements of emission light intensities at defined wavelengths for a certain emission maxima of a fluorophore. Total Fluorometry involves a collection of data for a continuum of absorption as well as emission wavelengths. In Fluorescence Polarization, polarized light is used for excitation and binding of fluorochrome-labeled antigens to specific antibodies affects polarization extent. Line Narrowing Spectroscopy involves low-temperature solid-state spectroscopy that derives its selectivity from the narrow-line emission spectra it provides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTime-dependent Fluorescence Spectroscopy comprises time-resolved measurements containing more information than steady-state measurements, since the steady-state values represent the time average of time-resolved determinations. It is a single photon timing technique in which the time between an excitation light pulse and the first photon emitted by the sample is measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrequency-Domain Fluorescence Spectroscopy is an alternative to the time-resolved methods. The time decay of fluorescence is typically measured using a light source with an intensity modulated sinusoidally at a given frequency, by determining the phase delay and the relative modulation of the fluorescence signal with respect to the exciting light.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n4. Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF-MS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for protein detection disclosed herein, include MALDI TOF-MS to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nLinear TOF-MS\n- Mass spectrometry has emerged as an important tool for analyzing and characterizing large biomolecules of varying complexity. The matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) technique, developed in 1987, has increased the upper mass limit for mass spectrometric analyses of biomolecules to over 300,000 Da and has enabled the analyses of large biomolecules by mass spectrometry to become easier and more sensitive. TOF mass spectrometers operate on the principle that when a temporally and spacially well defined group of ions of differing mass/charge (m/z) ratios are subjected to the same applied electric field (K.E. = [mv2]/2 = zeEs where K.E. = kinetic energy; m = the mass of the ion; v = velocity of the ion; z = number of charges; e = the charge on an electron in coulombs; E = electric field gradient; and s = the distance of the ion source region) and allowed to drift in a region of constant electric field, they will traverse this region in a time which depends upon their m/z ratios.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nReflectron TOF-MS-\n Improved mass resolution in MALDI TOF-MS has been obtained by the utilization of a single-stage or a dual-stage reflectron (RETOF-MS). The reflectron, located at the end of the flight tube, is used to compensate for the difference in flight times of the same m/z ions of slightly different kinetic energies by means of an ion reflector. This results in focusing the ion packets in space and time at the detector. In the reflectron mass spectrum, the isotopic multiplet is well resolved producing a full width half maximum (FWHM) mass resolution of about 3400. Mass resolutions up to 6000 (FWHM) have been obtained for peptides up to about 3000 Da with RETOF-MS. Enhancing the mass resolution can also increase the mass accuracy when determining the ion's mass.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHistorically, both linear and reflectron MALDI-TOF-MS have been utilized primarily for molecular weight determinations of molecular ions and enzymatic digests leading to structural information of proteins. These digests are typically mass analyzed with or without purification prior to molecular weight determinations. Varieties of methodologies have been developed to obtain primary sequence information for proteins and peptides utilizing MALDI TOF-MS. Two different approaches can be taken. The first method is known as protein ladder sequencing and is employed to produce structurally informative fragments of the analyte prior to insertion into the TOF mass spectrometer and subsequent analysis. The second approach utilizes the phenomenon of metastable ion decay that occurs inside the TOF mass spectrometer to produce sequence information.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nLadder Sequencing with TOF-MS\n-Proteins or peptides can be sequenced using MALDI -TOF-MS with a ladder sequencing technique which consists of either a time-dependent or concentration-dependent chemical degradation from either the N- or C-terminus of the protein or peptide into fragments, each of which differs by one amino acid residue. The mixture is mass analyzed in a single MALDI -TOF-MS experiment with mass differences between adjacent mass spectral peaks corresponding to a specific amino acid residue. This type of analysis can be thought of as simply determining the masses of a series of peptides/proteins that are present in a single MALDI sample. The order of occurrence in the mass spectrum defines the sequence of amino acids in the original protein or peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPost-Source Decay with RETOF-MS MALDI\n - It has historically been considered a \"soft\" ionization technique that produces almost exclusively intact protonated pseudomolecular ion species. A significant degree of metastable ion decay occurs after ion acceleration and prior to detection. The ion fragments produced from the metastable ion decay of peptides and proteins typically include both neutral molecule losses (such as water, ammonia and portions of the amino acid side chains) and random cleavage at peptide bonds. The observance of these metastable ion decay products in MALDI mass spectra is dependent on the TOF instrumental configuration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMALDI TOF-MS has developed into a valuable tool in the biosciences for obtaining both accurate mass determinations and primary sequence information. Methods for protein detection disclosed herein, include MALDI TOF-MS to detect non-natural amino acid polypeptides and modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof. The sequence information obtained from the mass spectra whose sequence was known a priori by no means implies a straightforward scheme to deduce an unknown peptide or protein sequence from its metastable ion decay mass spectrum. These MALDI techniques are envisioned to be most useful in conjunction with conventional biochemical techniques such as protein digests. They may be applicable to identifying blocked amino termini, post-translational modifications and mutation sites in known proteins in this way. Also, with a total unknown, a significant amount of preliminary structure determination should be possible on very small (less than 10 pmol) amounts of analyte. For ladder sequencing and in-source fragmentation studies, it is important to minimize potential peptide impurities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIn-Source Decay with Linear TOF-MS\n -An alternative approach to RETOF-MS for studying metastable ion decay of MALDI generated ions is to utilize DE with linear TOF-MS. By employing the DE technique, primary structural information for peptides and proteins can also be obtained. Prompt ion fragmentation produced at the time of the desorption event (i.e., ion formation) is generally absent for MALDI generated peptide or protein ions. By incorporating a time delay between ion formation and ion extraction, ions in the source are allowed to fragment in a relatively short period of time (<100 ns) into smaller ions and neutrals prior to extraction. A drawout potential is then applied extracting the fragmented ions. Coherent mass spectral peaks are produced from these metastable decayed ions giving rise to significant structural information for peptides and proteins.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n5. Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization - time of flight (SELDI-TOF)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAnother proteomic technology involved in quantitative analysis of protein mixtures is known as surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization - time of flight (SELDI-TOF). Methods for protein detection disclosed herein, include SELDI-TOF to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis technique utilizes stainless steel or aluminum-based supports, or chips, engineered with chemical (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, pre-activated, normal-phase, immobilized metal affinity, and cationic or anionic) or biological (antibody, antigen binding fragments (including but not limited to, scFv), DNA, enzyme, or receptor) bait surfaces of 1-2mm in diameter. These varied chemical and biochemical surfaces allow differential capture of proteins based on the intrinsic properties of the proteins themselves. Solubilized tissue or body fluids in volumes as small as 0.1 µl are directly applied to these surfaces, where proteins with affinities to the bait surface will bind. Following a series of washes to remove non-specifically or weakly bound proteins, the bound proteins are laser desorbed and ionized for MS analysis. Masses of proteins ranging from small peptides of less than 1000 Da up to proteins of greater than 300 kDa are calculated based on time-of-flight. As mixtures of proteins will be analyzed within different samples, a unique sample fingerprint or signature will result for each sample tested. Consequently, patterns of masses rather than actual protein identifications are produced by SELDI analysis. These mass spectral patterns are used to differentiate patient samples from one another, such as diseased from normal. While protein fingerprints can be analyzed for differential biomarker expression, this technology is currently unable to specifically identify proteins within a sample using MS. However, this situation is rapidly evolving as prototypes are being tested which couple the SELDI-TOF technology with tandem mass spectrometers. Coupling of these types of instruments will enable amino acid sequencing and subsequent protein identification.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n6. UV-Vis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for protein detection disclosed herein, include UV-Vis to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptical absorption spectroscopy (UV/VIS) plays an important role for the determination of concentrations (proteins, DNA, nucleotides etc.). Organic dyes can be used to enhance the absorption and to shift it into the visible range (e.g. coomassie blue reagents). Understanding the forces that govern the interaction of proteins with one another assists in the understanding of such processes as macromolecular assembly, chaperone-assisted protein folding and protein translocation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResonance Raman Spectroscopy (RRS) is a tool which can be used to study molecular structure and dynamics. Resonance Raman scattering requires excitation within an electronic absorption band and results in a large increase of scattering. Few molecules have visible absorption bands; however everything absorbs in the deep UV. By using UV light it is possible to study a wide variety of colorless chromophores, and have the additional benefit of avoiding interference from fluorescence. Furthermore, electrons of different functional groups with different excitation wavelengths can be selectively excited. This approach helps to investigate specific parts of macromolecules by using different excitation wavelengths.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n7. Liquid Chromatography (LC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nLiquid chromatography has been a powerful tool for isolating proteins, peptides, and other molecules from complex mixtures. Methods for protein detection disclosed herein, include LC to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof. Liquid chromatography can be affinity chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, diaode array -LC and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGel filtration chromatography seprarates proteins, peptides, and oligonucleotides on the basis of size. Molecules move through a bed of porous beads, diffusing into the beads to greater or lesser degrees. Smaller molecules diffuse further into the pores of the beads and therefore move through the bed more slowly, while larger molecules enter less or not at all and thus move through the bed more quickly. Both molecular weight and three dimensional shape contribute to the degree of retention. Gel Filtration Chromatography may be used for analysis of molecular size, for separations of components in a mixture, or for salt removal or buffer exchange from a preparation of marcromolecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAffinity chromatography is the process of bioselective adsorption and subsequent recovery of a compound from an immobilized ligand. This process allows for the highly specific and efficient purification of many diverse proteins and other compounds. The process requires the utilization of an appropriately selective ligand which will bind the desired compound generally with a dissociation constant in the range of 10\n-4\n to 10\n-8\n, while permitting recovery under mild conditions. The ligand is generally immobilized on a beaded and porous matrix which may be in the form of a column packing or batchwise adsorption medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIon exchange chromatography separates molecules based on differences between the overall charge of the proteins. It is usually used for protein purification but may be used for purification of oligonucleotides, peptides, or other charged molecules, The protein of interest must have a charge opposite that of the functional group attached to the resin in order to bind. For example, immunoglobulins, which generally have an overall positive charge, will bind well to cation exchangers, which contain negatively charged functional groups. Because this interaction is ionic, binding must take place under low ionic conditions. Elution is achieved by increasing the ionic strength to break up the ionic interaction, or by changing the pH of the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHPLC can be used in the separation, purification and detection of non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof disclosed herein. Peptides: Use of reversed-phased chromatography (RPC) has become a common and important step in synthetic peptide production. RPC has also been used to purify natural sequences. Although analytical columns are used to carry out the process, the procedure can be preparative in nature due to the limited amount of \"active\" proteins in tissue. Some other advantages are that recovery of post-purification biological activity and reformation of secondary or tertiary structure after exposure to RPC are favored due to the abbreviated size of the peptides. Crude tissue extracts may be loaded directly onto the RPC system and mobilized by gradient elution. Rechromatography under the identical conditions is an option if further purification is warranted or necessary. RPC can also be utilized in the process of protein structure determination. The normal procedure of this process is 1) fragmentation by proteolysis or chemical cleavage; 2) purification; and 3) sequencing. A common mobile phase for RPC of peptides is a gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water to 0.1% TFA in an organic solvent, such as acetonitrile, since the organic solvent 1) solubilizes the peptide, 2) allows detection at approximately 230-240 nm, and 3) can evaporate away from the sample. \nBiologically Active Proteins:\n The use of size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and ion-exchange chromatography (IEC) is well-suited for use with biologically active proteins, such as enzymes, hormones, and antibodies, since each protein has its own unique structure and the techniques may be performed in physiological conditions. Full recovery of activity after exposure to the chromatography may be achieved, and currently, availability of SEC columns is diverse enough to allow fractionation from 10 to 1000 kilodaltons. Extremely basic or hydrophobic proteins may not exhibit true SEC character since the columns tend to have slight hydrophobicity and anionic character. The use of gradient elution with the IEC column is favorable because of equivalent resolution as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and increased loading capability when compared to SEC. In liquid affinity chromatography (LAC) interaction is based on binding of the protein due to mimicry of substrate, receptor, etc. The protein is eluted by introducing a competitive binding agent or altering the protein configuration which facilitates dissociation. \nMembrane Proteins:\n Membrane proteins are either peripheral (situated on the outer surface) or integral (partially span, entirely span, or lie completely within the membrane). The lipophilicity of the bilayer conveys the lipophilic character (i.e., hydrophobic amino acids) of the proteins within the membrane. RPC would be a logical choice in analysis and purification of these proteins, but IEC is also employed. Another procedure used in the separation of membrane proteins is the use of nonionic detergents, such as Triton X-100, or protein solubilization by organic solvents with IEC. HPLC may be coupled with MS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiode array detector-liquid chromatography (DAD-LC) provides complete, multiple spectra for each HPLC peak, which, by comparison, can provide indication of peak purity. These data can also assign presence of Tyr, Trp, Phe, and possibly others (His, Met, Cys) and can quantitate these amino acids by 2nd derivative or multi-component analysis. By a post-column derivatization, DAD-LC can also identify and quantitate Cys, His and Arg in individual peptides. Thus, it is possible to analyze for 6 of the 20 amino acids of each separated peptide in a single LC run, and information can be obtained about presence or absence of these amino acids in a given peptide in a single step. This is assisted by knowing the number of residues in each peptide. Also, by correction at 205 nm absorbance for side-chain chromophores, this technique can give much better estimation of relative amounts of each peptide.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nD. Electrophoresis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for protein detection disclosed herein, include electrophoresis to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof. Electrophoresis can be gel electrophoresis or capillary electrophoresis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGel Electrophoresis:\n \n Gel electrophoresis is a technique that can be used for the separation of proteins. Separation of large (macro) molecules depends upon two forces: charge and mass. When a biological sample, such as proteins, is mixed in a buffer solution and applied to a gel, these two forces act together. The electrical current from one electrode repels the molecules while the other electrode simultaneously attracts the molecules. The frictional force of the gel material acts as a \"molecular sieve,\" separating the molecules by size. During electrophoresis, macromolecules are forced to move through the pores when the electrical current is applied. Their rate of migration through the electric field depends on the strength of the field, size and shape of the molecules, relative hydrophobicity of the samples, and on the ionic strength and temperature of the buffer in which the molecules are moving. After staining, the separated macromolecules in each lane can be seen in a series of bands spread from one end of the gel to the other. Using this technology it is possible to separate and identify protein molecules that differ by as little as a single amino acid. Its advantage is that proteins can be visualized as well as separated, permitting a researcher to estimate quickly the number of proteins in a mixture or the degree of purity of a particular protein preparation. Also, gel electrophoresis allows determination of crucial properties of a protein such as its isoelectric point and approximate molecular weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElectrofocusing, or isoelectric focusing, is a technique for separating different molecules by their electric charge differences (if they have any charge). It is most commonly used on proteins. It is a type of zone electrophoresis that takes advantage of the fact that a molecule's charge changes as the pH of its surroundings changes. Molecules are distributed over a medium that has a pH gradient (usually created by aliphatic ampholytes). An electric current is passed through the medium, creating a \"positive\" and \"negative\" end. Negatively charged particles migrate through the pH gradient toward the \"positive\" end while positively charged particles move toward the \"negative\" end. As a particle moves into a pH that neutralizes its charge, it will stop following the current. Particles of the same initial charge will deposit (or focus) around the same place on the pH gradient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCapillary Electrophoresis\n:\n Capillary electrophoresis is a collection of a range of separation techniques which involve the application of high voltages across buffer filled capillaries to achieve separations. The variations include separation based on size and charge differences between analytes (termed Capillary Zone Electrophoresis, CZE, or Free Solution CE, FSCE), separation of neutral compounds using surfactant micelles (Micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography, MECC or sometimes referred to as MEKC) sieving of solutes through a gel network (Capillary Gel Electrophoresis, GCE), separation of cations (or anions) based on electrophoretic mobility (Capillary Isotachophoresis, CITP), and separation of zwitterionic solutes within a pH gradient (Capillary Isoelectric Focusing, CIEF). Capillary electrochromatography (CEC) is an associated electrokinetic separation technique which involves applying voltages across capillaries filled with silica gel stationary phases. Separation selectivity in CEC is a combination of both electrophoretic and chromatographic processes. Many of the CE separation techniques rely on the presence of an electrically induced flow of solution (electroosmotic flow, EOF) within the capillary to pump solutes towards the detector. GCE and CIEF are of importance for the separation of biomolecules such as proteins. Generally CE is performed using aqueous based electrolytes however there is a growing use of non-aqueous solvents in CE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOperation of a CE system involves application of a high voltage (typically 10-30kV) across a narrow bore (25-100mm) capillary. The capillary is filled with electrolyte solution which conducts current through the inside of the capillary. The ends of the capillary are dipped into reservoirs filled with the electrolyte. Electrodes made of an inert material such as platinum are also inserted into the electrolyte reservoirs to complete the electrical circuit. A small volume of sample is injected into one end of the capillary. The capillary passes through a detector, usually a UV absorbance detector, at the opposite end of the capillary. Application of a voltage causes movement of sample ions towards their appropriate electrode usually passing through the detector. The plot of detector response with time is generated which is termed an electropherogram. A flow of electrolyte, known as electroendosmotic flow, EOF, results in a flow of the solution along the capillary usually towards the detector. This flow can significantly reduce analysis times or force an ion to overcome its migration tendency towards the electrode it is being attracted to by the sign of its charge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nE. Array\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for protein detection disclosed herein, include arrays to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nArrays involve performing parallel analysis of multiple samples against known protein targets. The development of various microarray platforms has remarkably enabled and accelerated the determination of protein abundance, localization, and interactions in a cell or tissue. Microarrays provide a platform that allows identification of protein interaction or function against a characterized set of proteins, antibodies, or peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein-based chips array proteins on a small surface and can directly measure the levels of proteins in tissues using fluorescence-based imaging. Proteins can be arrayed on either flat solid phases or in capillary systems (microfluidic arrays), and several different proteins can be applied to these arrays. The most popular ones currently rely on antibody-antigen interactions, which can also detect antigen-protein interactions. The potential of antibody arrays is currently limited by the availability of antibodies that have both high specificity (to eliminate cross reactions with non-specific proteins within the sample) and high affinity for the target of interest (to allow detection of small quantities within a sample). Another challenge of protein array technology is the ability to preserve proteins in their biologically active shape and form. In addition to the use of antibodies as array probes, single-stranded oligonucleotides, whose specificity is optimized by in vitro elution (aptamers), offer a viable alternative. Aptamers allow their covalent attachment to cognate proteins by photo-crosslinking, thus reducing background. Nonspecific protein stains are then used to detect bound proteins. International Publication No. \n \nWO 04/58946\n \n entitled \"Protein Arrays,\" which is incorporated by reference herein, describes the attachment of non-natural amino acid polypeptides to solid supports.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nArrays include, but not limited to, bead arrays, bead based arrays, bioarrays, bioelectronic arrays, cDNA arrays, cell arrays, DNA arrays, gene arrays, gene expression arrays, frozen cell arrays, genome arrays, high density oligonucleotide arrays, hybridization arrays, microcantilever arrays, microelectronic arrays, multiplex DNA hybridization arrays, nanoarrays, oligonucleotide arrays, oligosaccharide arrays, planar arrays, protein arrays, solution arrays, spotted arrays, tissue arrays, exon arrays, filter arrays, macroarrays, small molecule microarrays, suspension arrays, theme arrays, tiling arrays, and transcript arrays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nF. Sensors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for protein detection disclosed herein, include sensors to detect non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof. Sensors can be used for both in vivo and in vitro detection. Sensors may be used to detect events such as binding of a non-natural amino acid polypeptide to its target, conformational changes in a non-natural amino acid polypeptide, and or measure other interactions, modifications, or changes to a non-natural amino acid polypeptide or its environment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSensors can be chemical sensors, optical sensors, and biosensors. Chemical sensors are miniaturized analytical devices which deliver real-time and online information on the presence of specific compounds or ions in complex samples. Optical sensors are based on measurement of either intrinsic optical properties of analytes, or of optical properties of indicator dyes or labeled biomolecules attached to solid supports. Biosensors can be affinity biosensor based on capabilities of enzymes to convert \"substrates\" into products; or catalytic biosensors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding of a non-natural amino acid polypeptide to its target, including but not limited to, an antibody, antibody fragment, or antigen-binding polypeptide or fragment thereof, may be measured. The non-natural amino acid polypeptide is conjugated to a molecule such as a nanotransmitter. While bound to its target in-vivo, the nanotransmitter emits a signal that is read ex vivo by a medical imaging instrument.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nG. Methods for Identifying Proteins from a Library Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to identify the protein(s) that interact with the non-natural amino acid polypeptide, many methods may be used. Protein separation aids to separate a complex mixture so that individual proteins are more easily processed with other techniques. Protein identification methods include but is not limited to low-throughput sequencing through Edman degradation, mass spectrometry techniques, peptide mass fingerprinting, \nde novo\n sequencing, antibody-based assays and protein quantification assays such as fluorescent dye gel staining, tagging or chemical modification methods (\ni.e\n. isotope-coded affinity tags - ICATS, combined fractional diagonal chromatography - COFRADIC). The purified protein may also be used for determination of three-dimensional crystal structure, which can be used for modeling intermolecular interactions. Common methods for determining three-dimensional crystal structure include x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. Detailed below are a few of the methods for identifying proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nProtein sequencing:\n N-terminal sequencing and C-terminal sequencing. N-terminal sequencing aids in the identification of unknown proteins; confirm recombinant protein identity and fidelity (reading frame, translation start point, \netc.\n); aid the interpretation of NMR and crystallographic data; demonstrate degrees of identity between proteins; or provide data for the design of synthetic peptides for antibody generation, \netc.\n N-terminal sequencing utilizes the well-established Edman degradative chemistry, sequentially removing amino acid residues from the N-terminus of the protein and identifying them by reverse-phase HPLC. Sensitivity is at the level of 100s femtomoles and long sequence reads (20-40 residues) can often be obtained from a few 10s picomoles of starting material. Pure proteins (>90%) generate easily interpreted data, but insufficiently purified protein mixtures may also provide useful data, subject to rigorous data interpretation. N-terminally modified (especially acetylated) proteins cannot be sequenced directly, as the absence of a free primary amino-group prevents the Edman chemistry. However, limited proteolysis of the blocked protein (\ne.g\n. using cyanogen bromide) may allow a mixture of amino acids to be generated in each cycle of the instrument, which can be subjected to database analysis in order to interpret meaningful sequence information.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC-terminal sequencing is recognized as an important post-translational modification, sometimes critically affecting the structure and activity of a protein. Various disease situations have been associated with impaired protein processing and C-terminal sequencing provides an additional tool for the investigation of protein structure and processing mechanisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nProteome analyses\n: With proteomics proteins can be identified primarily by computer search algorithms that assign sequences to a set of empirically acquired mass/intensity data which are generated from conducting electrospray ionization (ESI), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), time-of-flight (TOF) instruments, or a three-dimensional quadrupole ion traps on the protein of interest.\n\n\n \n\n\nOther methods of detection\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAdditional detection methods involve bipyridines, metal coordination, nanotechnology (gold), biotin-streptavidin/avidin, UV/Vis, 2 step systems that involve a binding event and a coupling event due to proximity of a non-natural amino acid to a target resulting in exmission from a fluorophore, small molecule based fluorescent/fluorogenic molecules bound to a non-natural amino acid present in a polypeptide, lipocalins (beta barrel), fatty acid binding proteins, and dark to light or light to dark fluorophores.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nXV. Imaging and Diagnostics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for imaging and diagnostics utilizing non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof, are disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMolecular Imaging is a multidisciplinary field involving the efforts from molecular and cell biology to identify the molecular imaging target, radiochemistry and bioconjugation chemistry to develop suitable imaging probes, pharmacology to optimize the probes for optimal targeting efficacy and favorable \nin vivo\n kinetics, and image-capture techniques to non-invasively monitor the fate of molecular imaging probes \nin vivo.\n Aside from its basic diagnostic applications, molecular imaging also plays roles in treatment efficacy assessment, drug discovery, and understanding of molecular mechanisms in living systems. Molecular imaging probes (monoclonal antibodies, minibodies, proteins, peptides and peptidomimetics) can be used for visualization and quantification of molecular targets. The combination of anatomical (microMRI and microCT) and molecular imaging techniques (microPET, microSPECT, and NIR fluorescence imaging) can allow obtaining molecular and functional information, and monitor specific molecular therapeutic efficacy. Bio-imaging methods can be used to detect spatial organization (i.e., distribution) and to quantify cellular and tissue natural constituents, structures, organelles and administered components such as tagging probes (e.g., fluorescent probes) and drugs using light transmission, reflection, scattering and fluorescence emission strategies, with high spatial and spectral resolutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIn-vivo\n competition assays of unlabeled compounds with labeled probes for agents with known pharmacological characteristics and efficacy can be used in the drug evaluation process. Noninvasive characterization of drug targeting, receptor occupancy, concentrations required for effective receptor or enzyme inhibition, etc., can speed up the evaluation of lead compounds. As new drug candidates proceed through pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies, imaging analyses can quantitatively and repetitively monitor target accessibility, duration of retention at the target site and its correlation with drug efficacy, and clearance from irrelevant tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn clinical trials, imaging assays can facilitate evaluation of non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof, for both their pharmacological properties and their therapeutic effectiveness in patients. By combining imaging probes with multimodality-imaging instruments that merge structural and functional data, physicians can perform multiple functional-imaging assays simultaneously with anatomic analyses. Information derived from structural studies and from noninvasive, repetitive monitoring of drug distribution and concentration can then be correlated with biological effects on signal transduction pathways, target enzyme activities, antigen levels, receptor activation, cell proliferation, proteasome activity, etc. These noninvasive assays can permit real-time monitoring and modification of targeted interventions and therapeutic strategies. Molecular-imaging technologies can be used to study mouse models in pre-clinical studies. For example, many drugs for cancer and other disorders exert their therapeutic effects by inducing apoptosis. The ability to repetitively image apoptotic responses in living animals can facilitate preclinical evaluation of these drugs. For studying transgenic mice, identification of founder mice that can express the transgene in the proper spatial and temporal pattern by noninvasive imaging can permit the identification of founders without breeding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMolecular imaging can provide the location, magnitude, and duration of expression of the therapeutic gene for the optimization of gene-therapy protocols. Optical imaging can be coupled with targeted gene transfer. Molecular imaging of reporter genes can also be used to monitor the biodistribution and efficacy of cell-based therapies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nImaging Probes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImaging probes can be molecules labeled with radioisotopes or light- or nearinfrared (NIR)-emitting molecules. The concentration and/or spectral properties of molecular imaging probes are altered by the specific biological process under investigation. Two types of probes that can be used in functional imaging studies are, by way of example only, direct binding probes and indirect probes. Direct binding probes and indirect probes may be non-natural amino acid polypeptides. Examples of direct binding probes include but are not limited to antibodies, antibody fragments, antigen-binding polypeptides and fragments thereof and receptor ligands. Direct probes can be used to detect concentrations of their targets, since their binding is stochiometric. Therefore, direct probes are useful in investigating targets that are overexpressed in pathological conditions, for example, before and after therapy. Indirect probes are used to monitor activities of their macromolecular targets, including catalytic activities. Examples of such probes are described by \nHerschman in Science 2003 302:605-608\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProbes can be developed to monitor endogenous targeted molecules and biological processes. Such probes may be (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides. Key mediators and/or indicators of endogenous processes may be investigated using imaging probes. Substrates for enzymes such as kinases or proteases may be labeled via radionuclides or fluorescent molecules such that events such as phosphorylation or protease cleavage are detected by molecular-imaging assays. Such fluorescent probes that emit NIR fluorescent light after protease cleavage may be referred to as \"activatable\" optical imaging probes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDirect and indirect probes may be discovered by high-throughput screening of chemical libraries. Direct probes may also be discovered by screening large recombinant antibody and phage libraries. Such libraries may be composed of (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nQuantum dots\n:\n Methods for imaging and diagnostics utilizing non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof disclosed herein include fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals (also known as quantum dots or qdots). Qdots can be used for the study of intracellular processes at the single-molecule level, high-resolution cellular imaging, long-term in vivo observation of cell trafficking, tumor targeting, and diagnostics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nColloidal semiconductor quantum dots are single crystals a few nanometers in diameter whose size and shape can be precisely controlled by the duration, temperature, and ligand molecules used in the synthesis. This process may yield qdots that have composition-and size-dependent absorption and emission. Absorption of a photon with energy above the semiconductor band gap energy may result in the creation of an electron-hole pair (or exciton). The absorption may have an increased probability at higher energies (i.e., shorter wavelengths) and result in a broadband absorption spectrum, in marked contrast to standard fluorophores. For nanocrystals smaller than the so-called Bohr exciton radius (a few nanometers), energy levels may be quantized, with values directly related to the qdot size (an effect called quantum confinement, hence the name \"quantum dots\"). The radiative recombination of an exciton (characterized by a long lifetime, >10 ns) may lead to the emission of a photon in a narrow, symmetric energy band. The long fluorescence lifetime of qdots may enable the use of time-gated detection to separate their signal from that of shorter lived species (such as background autofluorescence encountered in cells).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle qdots can be observed and tracked over an extended period of time with, for example, confocal microscopy, total internal reflection microscopy, or basic wide-field epifluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy may allow determination of the brightness per particle and also provide a measurement of the average qdot size. Qdots can also be used as probes for two-photon confocal microscopy because they are characterized by a very large absorption cross section. They can be used simultaneously with standard dyes. Qdots have a potential as customizable donors of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor applications such as qdot tagging of a target molecule such as a non-natural amino acid polypeptide, a single recognition moiety can be grafted to the qdot (e.g., DNA oligonucleotide or aptamer, antibody, antibody fragment, antigen-binding polypeptide, etc.) or, used as the qdot solubilization ligand. Qdot ligands containing either an amine or a carboxyl group, for example, may offer a possibility of cross-linking molecules containing a thiol group or an N-hydroxysuccinimyl ester moiety by means of standard bioconjugation reactions. Another approach can be to use electrostatic interactions between qdots and charged adapter molecules, or between qdots and proteins modified to incorporate charged domains. These functionalization steps can be repeated to add or change functionality. For instance, streptavidin-coated qdots can be used in combination with biotinylated proteins or antibodies. A three-layer approach such as, using (i) an antibody against a specific target, (ii) a biotinylated secondary antibody against the first, and (iii) a streptavidin-coated qdot can allow qdot labeling of non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof, as disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of potential surface attachment groups can be used to \"graft\" different functionalities to individual qdots, resulting in multipotent probes. For instance, in addition to a recognition moiety, qdots can be equipped with a membrane-crossing or cell-internalization capability, and/or an enzymatic function. Peptides can be customized, and with a choice of sequence, a single-step surfactant exchange can yield necessary functions: (i) protect the core/shell structure and maintain the original qdot photophysics, (ii) solubilize qdots, (iii) provide a biological interface, and (iv) allow the incorporation of multiple functions. The resulting particles can have colloidal properties, photophysics, and biocompatibility, and this \"peptide toolkit\" can be tailored to provide additional functionalities. Such functionalities can be improved by molecular evolution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLive-cell experiments such as, whole-cell labeling, labeling of membrane-bound proteins, and cytoplasmic or nuclear target labeling can be used for cell or pathogen detection, cell tracking, and cell lineage studies. This can be achieved without any functionalization through microinjection, electroporation, or phagocytosis of qdots. Different types of functionalization can be explored as a way to target qdots to cell surface proteins. Some examples include streptavidin, secondary, or primary antibodies, receptor ligands such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) or serotonin, recognition peptides, and affinity pairs such as biotin-avidin after engineering of the target protein. Another strategy may consist of cross-linking primary antibodies to qdots. Some proteins can be recognized by peptides, so peptides can be used for qdot functionalization. Microinjection can allow the delivery of qdots functionalized with the appropriate targeting peptide sequence to mitochondria or the cell nucleus. The long-term stability and brightness of qdots make them a candidate for live animal targeting and imaging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn synthesis, new compositions could entail qdots with properties such as (i) sensitivity to electric or magnetic fields; (ii) narrower fluorescence emission and longer lifetimes (using lanthanide-doped qdots); (iii) smaller sizes and extension to the NIR spectrum, as demonstrated by ternary alloys; (iv) end-specific functionalizations of nanorod qdots; (v) suppression of blinking and quantum yield enhancement; and (vi) built-in on-off switches or photoelectric biotransducers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiotransducer, light-excited qdots could transfer their charge to bound enzymes functioning as electron or hole acceptors, enabling their control by light activation. Reciprocally, qdots could be lit up by electron or hole donor enzymes through chemiluminescence. Peptide coating of nano-materials can be a tool for imparting novel functions to the organic-inorganic interface. The simultaneous engineering of the semiconductor's band gap (by rational design) with the peptide's redox potential (by molecular evolution) could be used to optimize qdot compositions and peptide sequences for binding and desired optical, electronic, magnetic, and chemical properties. In summary, different shapes, end specificities, and compositions can lead to more complex bioinorganic architectures that could be exploited as an optoelectronic interface to the cellular machinery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nQdots can be used as contrast reagents for functional imaging with a combination of MRI, PET, computed tomography, and IR fluorescence imaging (the latter by direct imaging through the epidermis or by a catheter-based confocal fiber microscope). In vivo optical biopsy could confirm the pathology, and therapy could then be performed selectively, locally, and temporally by depositing energy (monochromatic x-rays for k-shell absorption or laser IR radiation) into the targeted qdots. Alternatively, it may be possible to graft therapeutic enzymes to the qdot surface and activate them by light, or produce free radicals (such as singlet oxygen) by optically cycling the qdots.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nImaging Instrumentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nVarious instrumentation can be used for imaging and diagnostics of non-natural amino acids, non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified non-natural amino acid polypeptides and fragments thereof, as disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonitoring the probes may consist of (1) a measurement system, and (2) an analysis software. The measurement system may include all of the optics, electronics and the manner in which the sample is illuminated (e.g., light source selection), the mode of measurement (e.g., fluorescence or transmission), as well as the calibration best suited for extracting the desired results from the measurement. The analysis software may include all of the software and mathematical algorithms necessary to analyze and display important results in a meaningful way. The measurement can be carried out using virtually any optical system attached to the system, for example, an upright or inverted microscope, a fluorescence microscope, a macro lens, an endoscope and a fundus camera. Furthermore, any standard experimental method can be used, including light transmission (bright field and dark field), autofluorescence and fluorescence of administered probes, etc. Fluorescence measurements can be made with any standard filter cube (consisting of a barrier filter, excitation filter and a dichroic mirror), or any customized filter cube for special applications, provided the emission spectra fall within the spectral range of the system sensitivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpectral bio-imaging can also be used in conjunction with any standard spatial filtering method such as dark field and phase contrast, and even with polarized light microscopy. Radionuclide-labeled probes can be detected by PET or SPECT (single-photon emission tomography), probes emitting light (fluorescence, bioluminescence, or NIR emissions) can be detected by optical imaging, and radiowave emissions can be detected by MRI. Small-animal devices can be used for radionuclide-based imaging (e.g., microSPECT and microPET), optical imaging of visible light (using sensitive, cooled charged-coupled device (CCD) cameras), and NIR emissions. The combination of anatomical (microMRI and microCT) and molecular imaging techniques (microPET, microSPECT, and NIR fluorescence imaging) can help obtain molecular and functional information, and monitor specific molecular therapeutic efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNoninvasive reporter gene assays can be used for molecular-imaging studies of living animals. Radionuclide-labeled probes can be used to monitor, in living mice, the expression of reporter genes using the direct-binding FESP probe, or the herpes simplex virus type 1-thymidine kinase (HSV1-TK). HSV1-TK can be monitored with positron-labeled thymidine analogs. Like FDG, the indirect substrate probe for hexokinase, positron-labeled substrates for HSV1-TK can be retained in cells as a result of enzyme dependent phosphorylation. For optical-imaging assays, the light produced by the enzymes from their substrates can be monitored with sensitive CCD cameras. New reporter genes encoding fusion proteins that can be imaged with fluorescent, bioluminescent, or radionuclide probes can allow study of a single animal with a number of different imaging probes and instrumentation appropriate for distinct applications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroPET instrumentation can provide better anatomic discrimination of functional assays: for example, pinpointing the locations of tumors within organs, determining the location of cell migration more accurately, etc. Fluorescence-mediated tomography can improve the resolution and quantitation of optical imaging procedures. Spectral-imaging technologies can discriminate emissions from multiple fluorescent probes, permitting simultaneous analysis of distinct optical probes and dramatically reducing background autofluorescence.\n\n\n \n\n\nNon-Natural Amino Acid-Scanning of Polypeptides and Libraries.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe identification of amino acids to be substituted in order to modulate activities or properties of the polypeptide may be done by site-directed mutagenesis. Amino acids in the polypeptides and polypeptide libraries of the present invention that modulate function can be identified or modulated by substituting a non-naturally encoded amino acid in place of a natural amino acid at any or all positions of the polypeptide. Naturally encoded amino acids may be substituted into a selected position of a polypeptide by methods known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (See, e.g., Cunningham et al. 1989), which disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The alanine-scanning mutagenesis procedure introduces single alanine mutations at selected or every residue in the molecule. Instead of substituting the naturally encoded amino acid alanine, a non-naturally encoded amino acid is substituted for a naturally encoded amino acid in the polypeptide chain. The resulting mutant polypeptide molecules comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid are then tested for biological activity using assays appropriate for measuring the function of the particular polypeptide or protein. Of special interest may be substitutions of non-naturally encoded charged amino acids or non-naturally encoded neutral amino acids for the naturally encoded charged and/or neutral amino acids. These substitutions may produce proteins with highly desirable improved or modulated characteristics, such as modulated receptor binding, modulated enzymatic activity, modulated antigen binding, or modulated aggregation or solubility.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples are offered to illustrate, but not to limit the claimed invention.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example describes conjugates that may be formed with non-natural amino acid polypeptides. Molecules may be directly bonded to one or more non-natural amino acids in a polypeptide or may be attached via a linker, polymer, water soluble polymer, or biologically active molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 9\n presents non-limiting examples of molecules that are site specifically attached to polypeptides via a reaction that forms an oxime bond between the carbonyl of a non-natural amino acid incorporated into a polypeptide and the hydroxylamine of the molecule. Molecules including but not limited to, fluorphores, biotin, and chelators may be attached to non-natural amino acid polypeptides.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nResins or other materials known to those skilled in the art may be used to isolate polypeptides. \nFigure 10\n shows an example of a purification method for a non-natural amino acid polypeptide utilizing a resin that reacts with the non-natural amino acid. A covalent linkage is formed between a chemically specific affinity tag on the resin and a non-natural amino acid present in the protein. Such linkages are stable under a broad range of pH and purification conditions. The separation step may be performed in alternate modes, including but not limited to a bath mode, enabling the large-scale purifications. The resin and the affinity tags are physically and chemically stable, and thus, can be reused to reduce the cost of protein purification upon scale-up.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe separation can be performed in conjunction with conjugation of the polypeptide to molecules including but not limited to, PEG. This \"one-pot\" method further simplifies the conjugation process and reduces the cost of production of proteins, including but not limited to target therapeutic proteins (\nFigure 11\n). Other molecules that can be conjugated include but are not limited to fluorphores.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResins or other materials for purification can be selected and functionalized according to the non-natural amino acid present in the polypeptide. \nFigure 12\n shows an example of resin selection and functionalization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResins or other materials for purification can be functionalized differently depending on the non-natural amino acid in the polypeptide. For example, \nFIG. 13\n shows an example of affinity purification of a non-natural amino acid polypeptide using hydroxylamine resin. \nFIG. 14\n shows an example of purification of a non-natural amino acid polypeptide using an aldehyde resin. Non-limiting examples of hydroxylamine and aldehyde resins are shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more steps of the purification process modify one or more non-natural amino acids present in the polypeptide to one or more natural amino acids. \nFIG. 15\n shows an example of purification of native proteins from a non-natural amino acid precursor. The non-natural amino acid is converted to tyrosine after release from the resin used in the purification process. \nFIG. 16\n shows non-limiting examples of non-natural amino acids.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Natural Amino Acid-scanning Mutagenesis.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example details cloning and expression of a hGH polypeptide including a non-naturally encoded amino acid in E. \ncoli.\n This example also describes one method to assess the biological activity of modified hGH polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for cloning hGH and fragments thereof are detailed in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos, 4,601,980\n \n; \n \n4,604,359\n \n; \n \n4,634,677\n \n; \n \n4,658,021\n \n; \n \n4,898,830\n \n; \n \n5,424,199\n \n; and \n \n5,795,745\n \n, which are incorporated by reference herein. cDNA encoding the full length hGH or the mature form of hGH lacking the N-terminal signal sequence are shown in SEQ ID NO: 21 and SEQ ID NO: 22 respectively.

The O-RS preferentially aminoacylates the O-tRNA with a non-naturally encoded amino acid. In turn the translation system inserts the non-naturally encoded amino acid into hGH, in response to an encoded selector codon.\n\n \nTable 1: O-RS and O-tRNA sequences.\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:4\n \n \nM. jannaschii\n \n \n \n \nmtRNA\n \nCUA\n \nTyr\n \n \n \n \n \n \ntRNA\n \n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:5\n \n \nHLAD03; an optimized amber supressor tRNA\n \n \ntRNA\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:6\n \n \nHL325A; an optimized AGGA frameshift supressor tRNA\n \n \ntRNA\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:7\n \n \nAminoacyl tRNA synthetase for the incorporation of p-azido-L-phenylalanine p-Az-PheRS(6)\n \n \nRS\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:8\n \n \nAminoacyl tRNA synthetase for the incorporation of p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine p-BpaRS(1)\n \n \nRS\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:9\n \n \nAminoacyl tRNA synthetase for the incorporation of propargyl-phenylalanine Propargyl-PheRS\n \n \nRS\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:10\n \n \nAminoacyl tRNA synthetase for the incorporation of propargyl-phenylalanine Propargyl-PheRS\n \n \nRS\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:11\n \n \nAminoacyl tRNA synthetase for the incorporation of propargyl-phenylalmaine Propargyl-PheRS\n \n \nRS\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:12\n \n \nAminoacyl tRNA synthetase for the incorporation of p-azido-phenylalanine p-Az-PheRS(1)\n \n \nRS\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:13\n \n \nAminoacyl tRNA synthetase for the incorporation of p-azido-phenylalanine p-Az-PheRS(3)\n \n \nRS\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:14\n \n \nAminoacyl tRNA synthetase for the incorporation of p-azido-phenylalanine p-Az-PheRS(4)\n \n \nRS\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:15\n \n \nAminoacyl tRNA synthetase for the incorporation of p-azido-phenylalanine p-Az-PheRS(2)\n \n \nRS\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:16\n \n \nAminoacyl tRNA synthetase for the incorporation of p-acetyl phenylalanine (LW1)\n \n \nRS\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:17\n \n \nAminoacyl tRNA synthetase for the incorporation of p-acetyl-phenylalanine (LW5)\n \n \nRS\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:18\n \n \nAminoacyl tRNA synthetase for the incorporation of p-acetyl-phenylalanine (LW6)\n \n \nRS\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:19\n \n \nAminoacyl tRNA synthetase for the incorporation of p-azido-phenylalanine (AzPheRS-5)\n \n \nRS\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:20\n \n \nAminoacyl tRNA synthetase for the incorporation of p-azido-phenylalanine (AzPheRS-6)\n \n \nRS\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe transformation of E. \ncoli\n with plasmids containing the modified hGH gene and the orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair (specific for the desired non-naturally encoded amino acid) allows the site-specific incorporation of non-naturally encoded amino acid into the hGH polypeptide. The transformed \nE\n. \ncoli,\n grown at 37° C in media containing between 0.01 - 100 mM of the particular non-naturally encoded amino acid, expresses modified hGH with high fidelity and efficiency. The His-tagged hGH containing a non-naturally encoded amino acid is produced by the E. coli host cells as inclusion bodies or aggregates. The aggregates are solubilized and affinity purified under denaturing conditions in 6M guanidine HCl. Refolding is performed by dialysis at 4°C overnight in 50mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, 40µM CuSO\n4\n, and 2% (w/v) Sarkosyl. The material is then dialyzed against 20mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, 100mM NaCl, 2mM CaCl\n2\n, followed by removal of the His-tag. See Boissel et al., (1993) 268:15983-93. Methods for purification of hGH are well known in the art and are confirmed by SDS-PAGE, Western Blot analyses, or electrospray-ionization ion trap mass spectrometry and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe His-tagged mutant hGH proteins were purified using the ProBond Nickel-Chelating Resin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) via the standard His-tagged protein purification procedures provided by the manufacturer, followed by an anion exchange column prior to loading on the gel. To further assess the biological activity of modified hGH polypeptides, an assay measuring a downstream marker of hGH's interaction with its receptor was used. The interaction of hGH with its endogenously produced receptor leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of a signal transducer and activator of transcription family member, STAT5, in the human IM-9 lymphocyte cell line. Two forms of STAT5, STAT5A and STAT5B were identified from an IM-9 cDNA library. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nSilva et al., Mol. Endocrinol. (1996) 10(5):508-518\n. The human growth hormone receptor on IM-9 cells is selective for human growth hormone as neither rat growth hormone nor human prolactin resulted in detectable STAT5 phosphorylation. Importantly, rat GHR (L43R) extra cellular domain and the G120R bearing hGH compete effectively against hGH stimulated pSTAT5 phoshorylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIM-9 cells were stimulated with hGH polypeptides of the present invention. The human IM-9 lymphocytes were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with sodium pyruvate, penicillin, streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, San Diego) and 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). The IM-9 cells were starved overnight in assay media (phenol-red free RPMI, 10mM Hepes, 1% heat inactivated charcoal/dextran treated FBS, sodium pyruvate, penicillin and streptomycin) before stimulation with a 12-point dose range of hGH polypeptides for 10 min at 37°C. Stimulated cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde before permeabilization with 90% ice-cold methanol for 1 hour on ice. The level of STAT5 phosphorylation was detected by intra-cellular staining with a primary phospho-STAT5 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) at room temperature for 30 min followed by a PE-conjugated secondary antibody. Sample acquisition was performed on the FACS Array with acquired data analyzed on the Flowjo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). EC\n50\n values were derived from dose response curves plotted with mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) against protein concentration utilizing SigmaPlot.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 2 below summarizes the IM-9 data generated with mutant hGH polypeptides. Various hGH polypeptides with a non-natural amino acid substitution at different positions were tested with human IM-9 cells as described.

The full length and mature hIFN encoding cDNA is inserted into the pBAD HISc, pET20b, and pET19b expression vectors following optimization of the sequence for cloning and expression without altering amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn introduced translation system that comprises an orthogonal tRNA (O-tRNA) and an orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (O-RS) is used to express hGH containing a non-naturally encoded amino acid. The O-RS preferentially aminoacylates the O-tRNA with a non-naturally encoded amino acid. In turn the translation system inserts the non-naturally encoded amino acid into hGH, in response to an encoded selector codon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nO-RS and O-tRNA sequences suitable for use with Interferon expression include those shown in Example 3. The transformation of E. \ncoli\n with plasmids containing the modified hIFN gene and the orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair (specific for the desired non-naturally encoded amino acid) allows the site-specific incorporation of non-naturally encoded amino acid into the hIFN polypeptide. The transformed \nE. coli,\n grown at 37° C in media containing between 0.01 - 100 mM of the particular non-naturally encoded amino acid, expresses modified hIFN with high fidelity and efficiency. The His-tagged hIFN containing a non-naturally encoded amino acid is produced by the E. coli host cells and are affinity purified. Methods for purification of hIFN are well known in the art and are confirmed by SDS-PAGE, Western Blot analyses, or electrospray-ionization ion trap mass spectrometry and the like.\n\n\n \n\n\nBinding Assays.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe hIFN receptor was prepared as described in \n \nU.S. Patents No. 6,566,132\n \n; \n \n5,889,151\n \n; \n \n5,861,258\n \n; \n \n5,731,169\n \n; \n \n5,578,707\n \n, which are incorporated by reference herein. For a non-PEGylated polypeptide comprising a non-natural amino acid, the affinity of the hormone for its receptor was measured by using a BIAcore™ biosensor (Pharmacia) technique, which is known in the art. BIAcore biosensor assays were used to measure the binding characteristics of hIFN molecules that comprised a non-naturally encoded amino acid substituted at the positions shown in Table 3, along with the receptor binding data.

Site-specific conjugation enables production of specifically designed molecules and nano structures that have novel functions. Currently, the site-specific conjugations have been achieved mainly through maleimide chemistry, in which an engineered protein surface cysteine selectively reacts with maleimide to form a thioether. The development of site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into polypeptides has enabled a large array of chemistries for conjugation of molecules to proteins. Over 30 non-naturally encoded amino acids have been incorporated site-specifically into proteins. In this example using the unnatural amino acid described below as a handle, oligo nucleotides were conjugated to proteins site-specifically. Furthermore, using single strand DNA as template, the conjugated proteins were assembled in one dimension in a defined manner.\n\nProtein used in this experiment was human growth hormone Y35 mutant, in which the tyrosine 35 was replaced by the non-naturally encoded amino acid 9.2 (Scheme 1). The single strand DNAs were stored as 25 mM solutions in water at -80°C. The sequence of ssDNA FTam27 is 5'-CAG CCA GCG TGC ACG (SEQ ID NO:21). The 5' of FTam27 was modified with hydrazide. The sequence for the templates are FTam28-d1: 5'-\nCGT GCA CGC TGG CTG CGT GCA CGC TGG CTG\n (SEQ ID NO:21); FTam-d2: 5'-\nCGT GCA CGC TGG CTG\n \nT\n \nCGT GCA CGC TGG CTG\n (SEQ ID NO:22); FTam28-d3: 5'-\nCGT GCA CGC TGG CTG\n \nTT\n \nCGT GCA CGC TGG CTG; FTam28-t1\n (SEQ ID NO:23)\n;\n 5'-\nCGT GCA CGC TGG CTG CGT GCA CGC TGG CTG CGT GCA CGC TGG CTG\n (SEQ ID NO:24); FTam28-t2: 5'-\nCGT GCA CGC TGG CTG\n \nT\n \nCGT GCA CGC TGG\n \nT\n \nCTG CGT GCA CGC TGG CTG\n (SEQ ID NO:25); FTam28-t3: 5'\n-CGT GCA CGC TGG CTG\n \nTT\n \nCGT GCA CGC TGG\n \nTT\n \nCTG CGT GCA CGC TGG CTG\n (SEQ ID NO:26)\n.\n \n\nProtein-single strand DNA conjugation:\n\n \n \n \nProtein (1mg) was buffer exchanged into reaction buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaOAc, 400 mM Arg, 5 mM EDTA, pH 4.0) using \nPD\n 10 gel filtration columns. The protein solution was concentrated to 90 µl using 10 kD MWCO CENTROCON (Vivascience). Five µl of the water solution of 25 mM ssDNA FTam27, which has a 5' modification of hydrazide, was dispensed in 40 µl of reaction buffer. The ssDNA solution was added slowly into the protein solution. Precipitation appeared initially, but dissolved. 20 hours after incubation at 28 °C, 5 mM sodium cyanoboronhydride was added. The reaction mixture was incubated for another 20 hours and subjected to analysis and purification.\n \n\nPurification of conjugate:\n\n \nA 1 ml phenyl HIC column was employed for the FPLC purification of the conjugate. Buffer A: 2 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.0; Buffer B: 10 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.0. The gradient used in the purification was: 10 column volume (CV) 0% B, 5 CV to 50% B, hold at 50% B for 5 CV, then 30 CV to 100% B. Purified conjugate was concentrated, buffer-exchanged to storage buffer (200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris.HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and subjected to PAGE analysis using 4-12% SDS gel, at 200 V in MES buffer.\n \n\nHybridization:\n\n \nFive µl of protein-ssDNA conjugate was added to the complementary ssDNA in storage buffer (200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris.HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The mixtures were supplemented with storage buffer to give a final volume of 20 µl and heated at 42 °C for 30 seconds, then cooled to room temperature. The final products were analyzed by native TRIS-glycine gel electrophoresis at 125 V, 4 °C for 3 to 5 hours.\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \nScheme\n 1.\n \n Conjugation scheme of hGH mutant (Y35/ unnatural amino acid 9.2) with single strand DNA modified at 5' end with hydrazide\n\nNon-naturally encoded amino acid 9.2, which has a 1,3 diketone moiety, was incorporated into human growth hormone (hGH) at amino acid position 35, and used as a handle for the conjugation with a 15 mer single strand DNA, FTam27, modified at the 5' with hydrazide functional group (Scheme 1). This conjugation resulted in a hydrazone initially, which is further reduced with sodium cyanoborohydride to give an irreversible covalent linkage. With five fold excess of ssDNA, a 70% yield was obtained (\nFigure 17\n). The conjugate was purified to about 90% pure using HIC column and subject to hybridization.\n\nThe conjugate was designed to hybridize with ssDNAs that have two (d) or three (t) tandem complementary sequence (FTam28) repeats with zero(1), one(2) and two(3) bases T between them as spacers (\nFigure 18\n). To determine the relative concentration of hGH-DNA conjugate, 5 µl of hGH-ssDNA conjugate was mixed with a series concentration of FTam28-d3, a single strand DNA that has two repeating sequences complementary to FTam27 and two T bases as a spacer between them. The result was analyzed with 14% native glycine gel electrophoresis, 125 V, 3 hr at 4 °C (\nFigure 19\n). The most complete hybridization was with 5µl hGH-ssDNA mixed with 4 µl of 10 µM FTam28-d3 which gave a conjugate concentration of about 16 µM. According to the gel, hGH-ssDNA and hGH-ssDNA hybrid monomer with FTam28-d3, were more mobile than hGH itself, presumably due to the large number of negative charges on the DNA backbone.\n\nThese phenomena were also demontrated in a control experiment (\nFigure 20\n). When hGH was mixed with 1 µl of 100 µM FTam28-d3, no hybridization was observed (lane 4). On the other hand, when 1 µl of 100 µM FTam28-d3 mixed with hGH-ssDNA conjugate, hGH dimer is formed through hybridization. There is no non-specific interaction between hGH and the DNA. The dimerization of conjugated hGH was the result of specific DNA hybridization. When a large excess of FTam28-d3 was added, more hybrid monomer and less hybrid dimer were formed. There was a substantial amount of hybrid dimer present when 80 pico mole of hGH-ssDNA conjugate was mixed with 10 equivalents of FTam28-d3 (lane 3). This indicated that the hybrid dimer was more stable than the hybrid monomer thermodynamically.\n\nTo demonstrate assembly of protein-ssDNA in a well-defined manner (\nFigure 21\n), six one dimension structures of hGH using single strand DNA as templates were assembled. These structures varied by different valency and spacers between each hGH molecule. hGH-ssDNA conjugate was mixed with one equivalent of each of the DNA templates. The mixtures were incubated at 50 °C for 5 minutes, cooled to room termperature and analyzed on a native glycine gel. These 1-D structures were assembled highly efficiently. \nLane\n 1 to \nlane\n 3 show the results of dimer formation with spacers of zero, one and two, respectively, T bases between the DNA sequence repeats. \nLane\n 4 to \nlane\n 6 show the assembly results of trimer formation with spacers of zero, one and two T bases as spacer.\n    \n \n \n \nUsing non-naturally encoded amino acids as a chemical handle, single strand DNA was conjugated to the protein surface site-specifically. This single strand DNA-protein conjugate can be used to assemble protein 1-D structures highly efficiently using DNA as a template. Site-specific oligonucleotide conjugation can also be used to assemble well defined 3-D structures creating novel nano structures with novel functions. Moreover, the protein-oligo nucleotide conjugation technology may be applied to create protein drug \"plug and play\" libraries. In this case, the oligonucleotide may be used as both a linkage and a \"name tag\" to encode the individual small molecule and/or protein. The protein-oligo nucleotide conjugate may be used in immunoPCR for diagnostic applications. This technology can also be used to create protein RNA or PNA conjugates which can be used in targeted RNAi therapeutics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims.

The invention has application in the fields of biochemistry and medicinal chemistry and particularly provides TPO agonists for use in the treatment of human disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMegakaryocytes are bone marrow-derived cells, which are responsible for producing circulating blood platelets. Although comprising <0.25% of the bone marrow cells in most species, they have >10 times the volume of typical marrow cells. See \nKuter et. al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:11104-11108 (1994\n). Megakaryocytes undergo a process known as endomitosis whereby they replicate their nuclei but fail to undergo cell division and thereby give rise to polyploid cells. In response to a decreased platelet count, the endomitotic rate increases, higher ploidy megakaryocytes are formed, and the number of megakaryocytes may increase up to 3-fold. See \nHarker J. Clin. Invest. 47:458-465 (1968\n). In contrast, in response to an elevated platelet count, the endomitotic rate decreases, lower ploidy megakaryocytes are formed, and the number of megakaryocytes may decrease by 50%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe exact physiological feedback mechanism by which the mass of circulating platelets regulates the endomitotic rate and number of bone marrow megakaryocytes is not known. The circulating thrombopoietic factor involved in mediating this feedback loop is now thought to be thrombopoietin (TPO). More specifically, TPO has been shown to be the main humoral regulator in situations involving thrombocytopenia. See, e.g., \nMetcalf Nature 369:519-520 (1994\n). TPO has been shown in several studies to increase platelet counts, increase platelet size, and increase isotope incorporation into platelets of recipient animals. Specifically, TPO is thought to affect megakaryocytopoiesis in several ways: (1) it produces increases in megakaryocyte size and number; (2) it produces an increase in DNA content, in the form of polyploidy, in megakaryocytes; (3) it increases megakaryocyte endomitosis; (4) it produces increased maturation of megakaryocytes; and (5) it produces an increase in the percentage of precursor cells, in the form of small acetylcholinesterase-positive cells, in the bone marrow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause platelets (thrombocytes) are necessary for blood clotting and when their numbers are very low a patient is at serious risk of death from catastrophic hemorrhage, TPO has potential useful application in both the diagnosis and the treatment of various hematological disorders, for example, diseases primarily due to platelet defects. Ongoing clinical trials with TPO have indicated that TPO can be administered safely to patients. In addition, recent studies have provided a basis for the projection of efficacy of TPO therapy in the treatment of thrombocytopenia, and particularly thrombocytopenia resulting from chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or bone marrow transplantation as treatment for cancer or lymphoma. See, e.g., \nMcDonald (1992) Am. J. Ped. Hematoloav/Oncology 14:8-21 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gene encoding TPO has been cloned and characterized. See \nKuter et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:11104-11108 (1994\n); \nBarley et al. Cell 77:1117-1124 (1994\n); \nKaushansky et al. Nature 369:568-571 (1994\n); \nWendling et al. Nature 369:571-574 (1994\n); and \nSauvage et al. Nature 369:533-538 (1994\n). Thrombopoietin is a glycoprotein with at least two forms, with apparent molecular masses of 25 kDa and 31 kDa, with a common N-terminal amino acid sequence. See, \nBartley et al. Cell 77:1117-1124 (1994\n). Thrombopoietin appears to have two distinct regions separated by a potential Arg-Arg cleavage site. The amino-terminal region is highly conserved in man and mouse, and has some homology with erythropoietin and interferon-a and interferon-b. The carboxy-terminal region shows wide species divergence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA sequences and encoded peptide sequences for human TPO-R (also known as \nc-mp1\n) have been described. See \nVigon et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:5640-5644 (1992\n). TPO-R is a member of the haematopoietin growth factor receptor family, a family characterized by a common structural design of the extracellular domain, including four conserved C residues in the N-terminal portion and a WSXWS motif close to the transmembrane region. See \nBazan Proc. Nat1. Acad. Sci. USA 87:6934-6938 (1990\n). Evidence that this receptor plays a functional role in hematopoiesis includes observations that its expression is restricted to spleen, bone marrow, or fetal liver in mice (see \nSouyri et al. Cell 63:1137-1147 (1990\n)) and to megakaryocytes, platelets, and CD34\n+\n cells in humans (see \nMethia et al. Blood 82:1395-1401 (1993\n)). Furthermore, exposure of CD34\n+\n cells to synthetic oligonucleotides antisense to mpl RNA significantly inhibits the appearance of megakaryocyte colonies without affecting erythroid or myeloid colony formation. Some workers postulate that the receptor functions as a homodimer, similar to the situation with the receptors for G-CSF and erythropoietin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe availability of cloned genes for TPO-R facilitates the search for agonists of this important receptor. The availability of the recombinant receptor protein allows the study of receptor-ligand interaction in a variety of random and semi-random peptide diversity generation systems.

The library plasmid includes: the \nrrnB\n transcriptional terminator, the \nbla\n gene to permit selection on ampicillin, the M13 phage intragenic region (\nM13 IG\n) to permit rescue of single-stranded DNA, a plasmid replication origin (ori), one \nlaco\ns\n \n ssequence, and the \naraC\n gene to permit positive and negative regulation of the araB promoter driving expression of the headpiece dimer fusion gene. \nFigure 6B\n depicts the sequence of the cloning region at the 3' end of the headpiece dimer gene, including the SfiI and EagI sites used during library construction. \nFigure 6C\n shows the ligation of annealed ON-1679, ON-829, and ON-830 to SfiI sites of pCMG14 to produce a library.

In this assay mice are made thrombocytopenic with carboplatin. \nFigure 7\n depicts typical results when Balb/C mice are treated with carboplatin (125 mg/kg intraperitoneally) on \nDay\n 0.

For a description of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts as prodrugs, see Bundgaard, H., supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Pharmaceutically acceptable ester\" refers to those esters which retain, upon hydrolysis of the ester bond, the biological effectiveness and properties of the carboxylic acid or alcohol and are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. For a description of pharmaceutically acceptable esters as prodrugs, see \nBundgaard, H., ed., Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam (1985\n). These esters are typically formed from the corresponding carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Generally, ester formation can be accomplished via conventional synthetic techniques. (See, e.g., \nMarch Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York (1985) p. 1157\n and references cited therein, and \nMark et al. Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1980\n)). The alcohol component of the ester will generally comprise (i) a C\n2\n-C\n12\n aliphatic alcohol that can or can not contain one or more double bonds and can or can not contain branched carbons or (ii) a C\n7\n-C\n12\n aromatic or heteroaromatic alcohols. This invention also contemplates the use of those compositions which are both esters as described herein and at the same time are the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Pharmaceutically acceptable amide\" refers to those amides which retain, upon hydrolysis of the amide bond, the biological effectiveness and properties of the carboxylic acid or amine and are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. For a description of pharmaceutically acceptable amides as prodrugs, see \nBundgaard, H., ed., Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam (1985\n). These amides are typically formed from the corresponding carboxylic acid and an amine. Generally, amide formation can be accomplished via conventional synthetic techniques. (See, e.g., \nMarch Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York (1985) p. 1152\n and \nMark et al. Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, New York (1980\n)). This invention also contemplates the use of those compositions which are both amides as described herein and at the same time are the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Pharmaceutically or therapeutically acceptable carrier\" refers to a carrier medium which does not interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredients and which is not toxic to the host or patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Stereoisomer\" refers to a chemical compound having the same molecular weight, chemical composition, and constitution as another, but with the atoms grouped differently. That is, certain identical chemical moieties are at different orientations in space and, therefore, when pure, has the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light. However, some pure stereoisomers may have an optical rotation that is so slight that it is undetectable with present instrumentation. The compounds of the instant invention may have one or more asymmetrical carbon atoms and therefore include various stereoisomers. All stereoisomers are included within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Therapeutically- or pharmaceutically-effective amount\" as applied to the compositions of the instant invention refers to the amount of composition sufficient to induce a desired biological result. That result can be alleviation of the signs, symptoms, or causes of a disease, or any other desired alteration of a biological system. In the present invention, the result will typically involve a decrease in the immunological and/or inflammatory responses to infection or tissue injury.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid residues in peptides are abbreviated as follows: Phenylalanine is Phe or F; Leucine is Leu or L; Isoleucine is Ile or I; Methionine is Met or M; Valine is Val or V; Serine is Ser or S; Proline is Pro or P; Threonine is Thr or T; Alanine is Ala or A; Tyrosine is Tyr or Y; Histidine is His or H; Glutamine is Gln or Q; Asparagine is Asn or N; Lysine is Lys or K; Aspartic Acid is Asp or D; Glutamic Acid is Glu or E; Cysteine is Cys or C; Tryptophan is Trp or W; Arginine is Arg or R; and Glycine is Gly or G. Additionally, Bu is Butoxy, Bzl is benzyl, CHA is cyclohexylamine, Ac is acetyl, Me is methyl, Pen is penicillamine, Aib is amino isobutyric acid, Nva is norvaline, Abu is amino butyric acid, Thi is thienylalanine, OBn is O-benzyl, and hyp is hydroxyproline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to peptides consisting only of naturally-occurring amino acids, peptidomimetics or peptide analogs are also provided. Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed \"peptide mimetics\" or \"peptidomimetics\" (\nFauchere, J. Adv. Drug Res. 15:29 (1986\n); \nVeber and Freidinger TINS p.392 (1985\n); and \nEvans et al. J. Med. Chem. 30:1229 (1987\n), which are incorporated herein by reference). Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent or enhanced therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biological or pharmacological activity), such as naturally-occurring receptor-binding polypeptide, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of: -CH\n2\nNH-, -CH\n2\nS-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-, -CH=CH- (cis and trans), -COCH\n2\n-CH(OH)CH\n2\n-, and -CH\n2\nSO-, by methods known in the art and further described in the following references: \nSpatola, A.F. in Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins, B.

A particularly preferred non-peptide linkage is -CH\n2\nNH-. Such peptide mimetics may have significant advantages over polypeptide embodiments, including, for example: more economical production, greater chemical stability, enhanced pharmacological properties (half-life, absorption, potency, efficacy, etc.), altered specificity (e.g., a broad-spectrum of biological activities), reduced antigenicity, and others. Labeling of peptidomimetics usually involves covalent attachment of one or more labels, directly or through a spacer (e.g., an amide group), to non-interfering position(s) on the peptidomimetic that are predicted by quantitative structure-activity data and/or molecular modeling. Such non-interfering positions generally are positions that do not form direct contacts with the macromolecules(s) (e.g., immunoglobulin superfamily molecules) to which the peptidomimetic binds to produce the therapeutic effect. Derivitization (e.g., labeling) of peptidomimetics should not substantially interfere with the desired biological or pharmacological activity of the peptidomimetic. Generally, peptidomimetics of receptor-binding peptides bind to the receptor with high affinity and possess detectable biological activity (i.e., are agonistic or antagonistic to one or more receptor-mediated phenotypic changes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSystematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may be used to generate more stable peptides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods known in the art (\nRizo and Gierasch Ann. Rev. Biochem. 61:387 (1992\n), incorporated herein by reference); for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthetic or non-naturally occuring amino acids refer to amino acids which do not naturally occur in vivo but which, nevertheless, can be incorporated into the peptide structures described herein. Preferred synthetic amino acids are the D-a-amino acids of naturally occurring L-a-amino acid as well as non-naturally occurring D- and L-a-amino acids represented by the formula H\n2\nNCHR\n5\nCOOH where R\n5\n is 1) a lower alkyl group, 2) a cycloalkyl group of from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, 3) a heterocycle of from 3 to 7 carbon atoms and 1 to 2 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen, 4) an aromatic residue of from 6 to 10 carbon atoms optionally having from 1 to 3 substituents on the aromatic nucleus selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, lower alkoxy, amino, and carboxyl, 5) -alkylene-Y where alkylene is an alkylene group of from 1 to 7 carbon atoms and Y is selected from the group consisting of (a) hydroxy, (b) amino, (c) cycloalkyl and cycloalkenyl of from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, (d) aryl of from 6 to 10 carbon atoms optionally having from 1 to 3 substituents on the aromatic nucleus selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, lower alkoxy, amino and carboxyl, (e) heterocyclic of from 3 to 7 carbon atoms and 1 to 2 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen, (f) -C(O)R\n2\n where R\n2\n is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydroxy, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, and -NR\n3\nR\n4\n where R\n3\n and R\n4\n are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and lower alkyl, (g) -S(O)\nn\nR\n6\n where n is an integer from 1 to 2 and R\n6\n is lower alkyl and with the proviso that R\n5\n does not define a side chain of a naturally occurring amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther preferred synthetic amino acids include amino acids wherein the amino group is separated from the carboxyl group by more than one carbon atom such as b-alanine, g-aminobutyric acid, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly preferred synthetic amino acids include, by way of example, the D-amino acids of naturally occurring L-amino acids, L-1-napthyl-alanine, L-2-naphthylalanine, L-cyclohexylalanine, L-2-amino isobutyric acid, the sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives of methionine (i.e., HOOC-(H\n2\nNCH)CH\n2\nCH\n2\n-S(O)\nn\nR°) where n and R\n6\n are as defined above as well as the lower alkoxy derivative of methionine (i.e., HOOC-(H\n2\nNCH)CH\n2\ncH\n2\n-OR\n6\n where R\n6\n is as defined above).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Detectable label\" refers to materials, which when covalently attached to the peptides and peptide mimetics of this invention, permit detection of the peptide and peptide mimetics \nin vivo\n in the patient to whom the peptide or peptide mimetic has been administered. Suitable detectable labels are well known in the art and include, by way of example, radioisotopes, fluorescent labels (e.g., fluorescein), and the like. The particular detectable label employed is not critical and is selected relative to the amount of label to be employed as well as the toxicity of the label at the amount of label employed. Selection of the label relative to such factors is well within the skill of the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCovalent attachment of the detectable label to the peptide or peptide mimetic is accomplished by conventional methods well known in the art. For example, when the \n125\nI radioisotope is employed as the detectable label, covalent attachment of \n125\nT to the peptide or the peptide mimetic can be achieved by incorporating the amino acid tyrosine into the peptide or peptide mimetic and then iodating the peptide. If tyrosine is not present in.the peptide or peptide mimetic, incorporation of tyrosine to the N or C terminus of the peptide or peptide mimetic can be achieved by well known chemistry. Likewise-, - 3_2p -can be - incCirporated---onto the peptide or peptide mimetic as a phosphate moiety through, for example, a hydroxyl group on the peptide or peptide mimetic using conventional chemistry.\n\n\n \nII. \nOVERVIEW\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides compounds that bind to and activate the TPO-R or otherwise behave as a TPO agonist. These.compounds include \"lead\" peptide compounds and \"derivative\" compounds constructed so as to have the same or similar molecular structure or shape as the lead compounds but that differ from the lead compounds either with respect to susceptibility to hydrolysis or proteolysis and/or with respect to other biological properties, such as increased affinity for the receptor. The present invention also provides compositions comprising an effective amount of a TPO agonist, and more particularly a compound, that is useful for treating hematological disorders, and particularly, thrombocytopenia associated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or bone marrow transfusions.\n\n\n \n\n\nIII. \nIDENTIFICATION OF TPO-AGONISTS\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptides having a binding affinity to TPO-R can be readily identified by random peptide diversity generating systems coupled with an affinity enrichment process.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, random peptide diversity generating systems include the \"peptides on plasmids\" system described in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,270,170\n \n and \n \n5,338,665\n \n; the \"peptides on phage\" system described in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/718,577, filed June 20, 1991\n \n which is a continuation in part application of \n \nU.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/541,108, filed June 20, 1990\n \n, and in \nCwirla et al., Proc.

Reo. Med. Chem 26:271-180 (1991\n); and \n \nU.S. Patent Application Serial No. 805,727, filed December 6, 1991\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing the procedures described above, random peptides were generally designed to have a defined number of amino acid residues in length (e.g., 12). To generate the collection of oligonucleotides encoding the random peptides, the codon motif (NNK)x, where N is nucleotide A, C, G, or T (equimolar; depending on the methodology employed, other nucleotides can be employed), K is G or T (equimolar), and x is an integer corresponding to the number of amino acids in the peptide (e.g., 12) was used to specify any one of the 32 possible codons resulting from the NNK motif: 1 for each of 12 amino acids, 2 for each of 5 amino acids, 3 for each of 3 amino acids, and only one of the three stop codons- Thus, the NNK motif encodes all of the amino acids, encodes only one stop codon, and reduces codon bias.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the systems employed, the random peptides were presented either on the surface of a phage particle, as part of a fusion protein comprising either the pIII or the pVIII coat protein of a phage fd derivative (peptides on phage) or as a fusion protein with the LacI peptide fusion protein bound to a plasmid (peptides on plasmids).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phage or plasmids, including the DNA encoding the peptides, were identified and isolated by an affinity enrichment process using immobilized TPO-R. The affinity enrichment process, sometimes called \"panning,\" involves multiple rounds of incubating the phage, plasmids, or polysomes with the immobilized receptor, collecting the phage, plasmids, or polysomes that bind to the receptor (along with the accompanying DNA or mRNA), and producing more of the phage or plasmids (along with the accompanying LacI-peptide fusion protein) collected. The extracellular domain (ECD) of the TPO-R typically was used during panning.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter several rounds of affinity enrichment, the phage or plasmids and accompanying peptides were examined by ELISA to determine if the peptides bind specifically to TPO-R. This assay was carried out similarly to the procedures used in the affinity enrichment process, except that after removing unbound phage, the wells were typically treated with rabbit anti-phage antibody, then with alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. The amount of alkaline phosphatase in each well was determined by standard methods. A similar ELISA procedure for use in the pepides on plasmids system is described in detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy comparing test wells with control wells (no receptor), one can determine whether the fusion proteins bind to the receptor specifically. The phage pools found to bind to TPO-R were screened in a colony lift probing format using radiolabelled monovalent receptor. This probe can be produced using protein kinase A to phosphorylate a kemptide sequence fused to the C-terminus of the soluble receptor. The \"engineered\" form of the TPO receptor is then expressed in host cells, typically CHO cells. Following PI-PLC harvest of the receptors, the receptor was tested for binding to TPO or TPO-R specific phage clones. The receptor is then labeled to high specific activity with \n33\nP for use as a monovalent probe to identify high affinity ligands using colony lifts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides found to bind specifically to the receptor were then synthesized as the free peptide (e.g., no phage) and tested in a blocking assay. The blocking assay was carried out in similar fashion to the ELISA , except that TPO or a reference peptide was added to the wells before the fusion protein (the control wells were of two types: (1) no receptor; and (2) no TPO or reference peptide). Fusion proteins for which the binding to the receptor was blocked by TPO or the reference peptide contain peptides in the random peptide portion that are preferred compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTPO-R, as well as its extracellular domain, were produced in recombinant host cells. One useful form of TPO-R is constructed by expressing the protein as a soluble protein in baculovirus transformed host cells using standard methods; another useful form is constructed with a signal peptide for protein secretion and for glycophospholipid membrane anchor attachment. This form of anchor attachment is called \"PIG-tailing\". See \nCaras and Wendell Science 243:1196-1198 (1989\n) and \nLin et al. Science 249:677-679 (1990\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing the PIG-tailing system, one can cleave the receptor from the surface of the cells expressing the receptor (e.g., transformed CHO cells selected for high level expression of receptor with a cell sorter) with phospholipase C. The cleaved receptor still comprises a carboxy terminal sequence of amino acids, called the \"HPAP tail\", from the signal protein for membrane attachment and can be immobilized without further purification. The recombinant receptor protein can be immobilized by coating the wells of microtiter plates with an anti-HPAP tail antibody (Ab 179 or MAb 179), blocking non-specific binding with bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, and then binding cleaved recombinant receptor to the antibody. Using this procedure, one should perform the immobilization reaction in varying concentrations of receptor to determine the optimum amount for a given preparation, because different preparations of recombinant protein often contain different amounts of the desired protein. In addition, one should ensure that the immobilizing antibody is completely blocked (with TPO or some other blocking compound) during the affinity enrichment process. Otherwise, unblocked antibody can bind undesired phage during the affinity enrichment procedure. One can use peptides that bind to the immobilizing antibody to block unbound sites that remain after receptor immobilization to avoid this problem or one can simply immobilize the receptor directly to the wells of microtiter plates, without the aid of an immobilizing antibody. See \n \nU.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/947,339, filed September 18, 1992\n \n, incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen using random peptide generation systems that allow for multivalent ligand-receptor interaction, one must recognize that the density of the immobilized receptor is an important factor in determining the affinity of the ligands that can bind to the immobilized receptor. At higher receptor densities (e.g., each anti-receptor antibody-coated well treated with 0.25 to 0.5 mg of receptor), multivalent binding is more likely to occur than at lower receptor densities (e.g., each anti-receptor antibody-coated well treated with 0.5 to 1 ng of the receptor). If multivalent binding is occurring, then one will be more likely to isolate ligands with relatively lower affinity, unless one uses high densities of immobilized receptor to identify lead compounds and uses lower receptor densities to isolate higher affinity derivative compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo discriminate among higher affinity peptides, a monovalent receptor probe frequently is used. This probe can be produced using protein kinase A to phosphorylate a kemptide sequence fused to the C-terminus of the soluble receptor. The \"engineered\" form of the TPO receptor is then expressed in host cells, typically CHO cells. Following PI-PLC harvest of the receptors, the receptor was tested for binding to TPO or TPO-R specific phage clones. The receptor is then labeled to high specific activity with \n33\nP for use as a monovalent probe to identify high affinity ligands using colony lifts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred screening methods to facilitate identification of peptides which bind TPO-R involve first identifying lead peptides which bind to the extracellular domain of the receptor and then making other peptides which resemble the lead peptides. Specifically, using a pIII or pVIII-based peptides on phage system, a random library can be screened to discover a phage that presents a peptide that binds to TPO-R. The phage DNAs are sequenced to determine the sequences of the peptides displayed on the surface of the phages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClones capable of specific binding to the TPO-R were identified from a random linear 10-mer pVIII library and a random cyclic 10-mer and 12-mer pVIII libraries. The sequences of these peptides serve as the basis for the construction of other peptide libraries designed to contain a high frequency of derivatives of the initially-identified peptides. These libraries can be synthesized so as to favor the production of peptides that differ from the binding peptide in only a few residues. This approach involves the synthesis of an oligonucleotide with the binding peptide coding sequence, except that rather than using pure preparations of each of the four nucleoside triphosphates in the synthesis, one uses mixtures of the four nucleoside triphosphates (i.e., 55% of the \"correct\" nucleotide, and 15% each of the other three nucleotides is one preferred mixture for this purpose and 70% of the \"correct\" nucleotide and 10% of each of the other three nucleotides is another preferred mixture for this purpose) so as to generate derivatives of the binding peptide coding sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of strategies were used to derivatize the lead peptides by making \"mutagenesis on a theme\" libraries,. These included a pVIII phagemid mutagenesis library based on the consensus sequence mutagenized at 70:10:10:10 frequency and extended on each terminus with random residues to produce clones which enclode the sequence XXXX (C, S, P, or R) TLREWL XXXXXX (C or S). A similar extended/mutagenized library was constructed using the peptides-on-plasmids system to produce clones which enclode the sequence XXXXX (C, S, P, or R) TLREWL XXXXXX. An additional extended/mutagenized library, XXXX (C, S, P, or R) TLREWL XXXXXX (C or S), was constructed using the polysome display system. All three libraries were screened with peptide elution and probed with radiolabeled monovalent receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \"peptides on plasmids\" techniques was also used for peptide screening and mutagenesis studies and is described in greater detail in \n \nU.S. Patent no. 5,338,665\n \n, which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. According to this approach, random peptides are fused at the C-terminus of LacI through expression from a plasmid vector carrying the fusion gene. Linkage of the LacI-peptide fusion to its encoding DNA occurs via the \nlac0\n sequences on the plasmid, forming a stable peptide-LacI-plasmid complex that can be screened by affinity purification (panning) on an immobilized receptor. The plasmids thus isolated can then be reintroduced into \nE\n. \ncoli\n by electroporation to amplify the selected population for additional rounds of screening, or for the examination of individual clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, random peptide screening and mutagenesis studies were performed using a modified C-terminal Lac-I display system in which display valency was reduced (\"headpiece dimer\" display system). The libraries were screened and the resulting DNA inserts were cloned as a pool into a maltose binding protein (MBP) vector allowing their expression as a C-terminal fusion protein. Crude cell lysates from randomly picked individual MBP fusion clones were then assayed for TPO-R binding in an ELISA format, as discussed above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide mutagenesis studies were also conducted using the polysome display system, as described in co-pending \n \napplication U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/300,262, filed September 2, 1994\n \n, which is a continuation-in-part application based on \n \nU.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/144,775, filed October 29, 1993\n \n and \n \nPCT WO 95/11992\n \n, each of which is incorporated herein by references for all purposes. A mutagenesis library was constructed based on the sequence X X X X (C,P,R,or S) t1 ref1 X X X X X X (C or S), in which X represents a random NNK codon, and the lower case letters represent amino acid codons containing 70:10:10:10 mutagenesis at \n \npositions\n \n 1 and 2 and K (G or T) at \nposition\n 3 of the codon. The library was panned for 5 rounds against TPO receptor which had been immobilzed on magnetic beads. After the fifth round, the PCR amplified pool was cloned into pAFF6 and the ELISA positive clones were sequenced. The sequences were subcloned into an MBP vector and their binding affinities were determined by an MBP ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo imobilize the TPO-R for polysome screening, Ab 179 was first chemically conjugated to tosyl-activated magnetic beads (available from Dynal Corporation) as described by the manufacturer. The beads were incubated with antibody in 0.5 M borate buffer (pH 9.5) overnight at room temperature. The beads were washed and combined with TPO-R containing the \"HPAP\" tail. The antibody coated beads and receptor were incubated for 1 hour at 4°C, and the beads were washed again prior to adding the polysome library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScreening of the various libraries described above yielded the TPO receptor binding peptides shown in Tables 1 and 2 below, as well as others not listed herein.\n\n \n \n \nTABLE 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \nPeptide\n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \nE\n

below. A variety of methods can be used to evaluate IC\n50\n values. For example, an equilibrium binding ELISA assay, using either MBP-TPO or lacI-peptide tracer, was used to determine whether the peptides inhibit the binding of TPO to the extracellular domain of the TPO receptor. Typically, the IC\n50\n value were determined using the free peptide. The IC\n50\n value can be determined using the free peptide, which optionally can be C-terminally amidated, or can be prepared as an ester or other carboxy amide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo recreate the exact sequence displayed on the phage, the N-terminal and C-terminal amino acids of the synthetic peptides are often preceded by one or two glycine residues. These glycines are not believed to be necessary for binding or activity. Likewise, to mimic the exact sequence of peptides displayed on polysomes, the C-terminal amino acids of the synthetic peptides are often preceded by the sequence M A S. Again, this sequence is not believed to be necessary for binding or activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIC\n5.\n values are indicated symbolically by the symbols \"-\", \"+\", and \"++\". For examples, those peptides which showed IC\n50\n values in excess of 200 \nµ\nM are indicated with a \"-\". Those peptides which gave IC\n50\n values of less than or equal to 200 \nµ\nM are given a \"+\", while those which gave IC\n50\n values of 500 nm or less are indicated with a \"++\". Those peptides which gave IC\n50\n values at or near the cutoff point for a particular symbol are indicated with a hybrid designator, e.g., \"+/-\".

Preferably, for diagnostic purposes, the peptides and peptidomimetics have an IC\n50\n of about 2 mM or less and, for pharmaceutical purposes, the peptides and peptidomimetics have an IC\n50\n of about 100 \nµ\nM or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding peptide sequence also provides a means to determine the minimum size of a TPOR binding compound of the invention. Using the \"encoded synthetic library\" (ESL) system or the \"very large scale immobilized polymer synthesis\" system, one can not only determine the minimum size of a peptide with such activity, but one can also make all of the peptides that form the group of peptides that differ from the preferred motif (or the minimum size of that motif) in one, two, or more residues. This collection of peptides can then be screened for ability to bind to TPO-receptor. These immobilized polymers synthesis systems or other peptide synthesis methods can also be used to synthesize truncation analogs, deletion analogs, substitution analogs, and combinations thereof all of the peptide compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides and peptide mimetics of the present invention were also evaluated in a thrombopoietin dependent cell proliferation assay, as described in greater detail in Example 2 below. Cell proliferation is measured by techniques known in the art, such as an MTT assay which correlates with \n3\nH-thymidine incorporation as an indication of cell proliferation (see \nMossmann J. Immunol. Methods 65:55 (1983\n)). The peptides tested stimulated proliferation of TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cells in a dose dependent manner as shown in \nFigure 1A\n. These peptides have no effect on the parental cell line as shown in \nFigure 1B\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigures 7 to 9\n show the results of a further assay evaluating activity of the peptides and peptide mimetics of the invention. In this assay mice are made thrombocytopenic with carboplatin. \nFigure 7\n depicts typical results when Balb/C mice are treated with carboplatin (125 mg/kg intraperitoneally) on \nDay\n 0. The dashed lines represent untreated animals from three experiments. The solid line represent carboplatin-treated groups in three experiments. The heavy solid lines represent historical data. \nFigure 8\n depicts the effect of carboplatin titration on platelet counts in mice treated with the indicated amounts of carboplatin (in mg/kg, intraperitoneally (ip) on Day 0). \nFigure 9\n depicts amelioration of carboplatin-induced thrombocytopenia on \nDay\n 10 by peptide AF12513 (513). Carboplatin (CBP; 50-125 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was administered on \nDay\n 0. AF12513 (1 mg/kg, ip) was given on Days 1-9. These results show the peptides of the invention can ameliorate thrombocytopenia in a mouse model.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, certain peptides of the present invention can be dimerized or oligomerized, thereby increasing the affinity and/or activity of the compounds. To investigate the effect that peptide dimerization/oligomerization has on TPO mimetic potency in cell proliferation assays, a C-terminally biotinylated analog of the peptide \nGGCADGP TLREWISFCGG\n was synthesized (\nGGCADGPTLREW ISFCGGK\n (Biotin)). The peptide was preincubated with streptavidin in serum-free HEPES-buffered RPMI at a 4:1 molar ratio. The complex was tested for stimulation of cell proliferation of TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cells, as above, alongside free biotinylated peptide and the unbiotinylated parental peptide. \nFigure 2A\n shows the results of the assay for the complexed biotinylated peptide (AF 12885 with streptavidin (SA)) for both the transfected and parental cell lines. \nFigure 2B\n shows the results of the assay for the free biotinylated peptide (AF 12285) for both the transfected and parental cell lines. \nFigure 2C\n shows the results of the assay for streptavidin alone for both the transfected and parental cell lines. These figures illustrate that the pre-formed complex was approximately 10 times as potent as the free peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specificity of the binding and activity of the peptides of the invention was also examined by studying the cross reactivity of the peptides for the erythropoieitin receptor (EPO-R). The EPO-R is also a member of the haematopoietin growth factor receptor family, as is TPO-R. The peptides of the invention, as well as TPO, EPO, and a known EPO-binding peptide, were examined in a cell proliferation assay using an EPO-dependent cell line. This assay utilized FDCP-1, a growth factor dependent murine multi-potential primitive haematopoietic progenitor cell line (see, e.g., \nDexter et al. J. Exp. Med. 152:1036-1047 (1981\n)) as the parental cell line. This cell line can proliferate, but not differentiate when supplemented with WEHI-3-conditioned media (a medium that contains IL-3, ATCC number TlB68). The parental cell line is transfected with human or murine EPO-R to produce the FDCP-1-EPO-R cell line. These transfected cell lines can proliferate, but not differentiate in the presence of human or murine EPO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells were grown to half stationary density in the presence of the necessary growth factors. The cells are then washed in PBS and starved for 16-24 hours in whole media without the growth factors. After determining the viability of the cells, stock solutions (in whole media without the growth factors) are made to give about 10\n5\n cells per 50 microliters. Serial dilutions of the compounds (typically, the free solution phase peptide as opposed to a phage-bound on other bound or immobilized peptide) to be tested are made in 96-well tissue culture plates for a final volume of 50 microliters per well. Cells (50 microliters) are added to each well and the cells are incubated for 24-48 hours, at which point the negative controls should die or be quiescent. Cell proliferation is then measured by techniques known in the art, such as an MTT assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigures 3A-G\n show the results of a series of control experiments showing the activity of TPO, the peptides of the present invention, EPO, and EPO-R binding peptides in a cell proliferation assay using either the TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cell line and its corresponding parental line, or an EPO-dependent cell line and its corresponding parental line. \nFigure 3A\n depicts the results for TPO in the cell proliferation assay using the TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cell line and its corresponding parental line. \nFigure 3B\n depicts the results for EPO in the cell proliferation assay using the TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cell line and its corresponding parental line. \nFigure 3C\n depicts the results for complexed biotinylated peptide (\nAF\n 12285 with streptavidin (SA)) and a complexed form of a biotinylated EPO-R binding peptide (\nAF\n 11505 with SA) in the TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cell line. The results for the corresponding parental cell line are shown in \nFigure 3D. Figure 3E\n depicts the results for TPO in the cell proliferation assay using the EPO-dependent cell line. \nFigure 3F\n depicts the results for EPO in the cell proliferation assay using the EPO-dependent cell line. \nFigure 3G\n depicts the results for complexed biotinylated peptide (\nAF\n 12285 with streptavidin (SA)) and the complexed form of a biotinylated EPO-R binding peptide (\nAF\n 11505 with SA) in the EPO-dependent cell line. These results show that the peptides of the invention bind and activate the TPO-R with a high degree of specificity.\n\n\n \nIV. \nPREPARATION OF PEPTIDES AND PEPTIDE MIMETICS\n \n\n\nA. \nSOLID PHASE SYNTHESIS\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptides of the invention can be prepared by classical methods known in the art, for example, by using standard solid phase techniques. The standard methods include exclusive solid phase synthesis, partial solid phase synthesis methods, fragment condensation, classical solution synthesis, and even by recombinant DNA technology. See, e.g., \nMerrifield J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149 (1963\n), incorporated herein by reference. On solid phase, the synthesis is typically commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide using an alpha-amino protected resin. A suitable starting material can be prepared, for instance, by attaching the required alpha-amino acid to a chloromethylated resin, a hydroxymethyl resin, or a benzhydrylamine resin. One such chloromethylated resin is sold under the tradename BIO-BEADS SX-1 by Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA, and the preparation of the hydroxymethyl resin is described by \nBodonszky et al. Chem. Ind. (London) 38:1597 (1966\n). The benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin has been described by \nPietta and Marshall Chem. Commn. 650 (1970\n) and is commercially available from Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, in the hydrochloride form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the compounds of the invention can be prepared by coupling an alpha-amino protected amino acid to the chloromethylated resin with the aid of, for example, cesium bicarbonate catalyst, according to the method described by \nGisin Helv. Chim. Acta. 56:1467 (1973\n). After the initial coupling, the alpha-amino protecting group is removed by a choice of reagents including trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or hydrochloric acid (HCl) solutions in organic solvents at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alpha-amino protecting groups are those known to be useful in the art of stepwise synthesis of peptides. Included are acyl type protecting groups (e.g. formyl, trifluoroacetyl, acetyl), aromatic urethane type protecting groups (e.g. benzyloxycarboyl (Cbz) and substituted Cbz), aliphatic urethane protecting groups (e.g. t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), isopropyloxycarbonyl, cyclohexyloxycarbonyl) and alkyl type protecting groups (e.g. benzyl, triphenylmethyl). Boc and Fmoc are preferred protecting groups. The side chain protecting group remains intact during coupling and is not split off during the deprotection of the amino-terminus protecting group or during coupling. The side chain protecting group must be removable upon the completion of the synthesis of the final peptide and under reaction conditions that will not alter the target peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe side chain protecting groups for Tyr include tetrahydropyranyl, tert-butyl, trityl, benzyl, Cbz, Z-Br-Cbz, and 2,5-dichlorobenzyl. The side chain protecting groups for Asp include benzyl, 2,6-dichlorobenzyl, methyl, ethyl, and cyclohexyl. The side chain protecting groups for Thr and Ser include acetyl, benzoyl, trityl, tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, 2,6-dichlorobenzyl, and Cbz. The side chain protecting group for Thr and Ser is benzyl. The side chain protecting groups for Arg include nitro, Tosyl (Tos), Cbz, adamantyloxycarbonyl mesitoylsulfonyl (Mts), or Boc. The side chain protecting groups for Lys include Cbz, 2-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl (2-Cl-Cbz), 2-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl (2-BrCbz)-, Tos, or Boc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter removal of the alpha-amino protecting group, the remaining protected amino acids are coupled stepwise in the desired order. An excess of each protected amino acid is generally used with an appropriate carboxyl group activator such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) in solution, for example, in methylene chloride (CH\n2\nCl\n2\n), dimethyl formamide (DMF) mixtures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the desired amino acid sequence has been completed, the desired peptide is decoupled from the resin support by treatment with a reagent such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrogen fluoride (HF), which not only cleaves the peptide from the resin, but also cleaves all remaining side chain protecting groups. When the chloromethylated resin is used, hydrogen fluoride treatment results in the formation of the free peptide acids. When the benzhydrylamine resin is used, hydrogen fluoride treatment results directly in the free peptide amide. Alternatively, when the chloromethylated resin is employed, the side chain protected peptide can be decoupled by treatment of the peptide resin with ammonia to give the desired side chain protected amide or with an alkylamine to give a side chain protected alkylamide or dialkylamide. Side chain protection is then removed in the usual fashion by treatment with hydrogen fluoride to give the free amides, alkylamides, or dialkylamides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese solid phase peptide synthesis procedures are well known in the art and further described in \nStewart Solid Phase Peptide Syntheses (Freeman and Co., San Francisco, (1969\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing the \"encoded synthetic library\" or \"very large scale immobilized polymer synthesis\" system described in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 07/492,462, filed March 7, 1990\n \n; \n \n07/624,120, filed December 6, 1990\n \n; and \n \n07/805,727, filed December 6, 1991\n \n; one can not only determine the minimum size of a peptide with such activity, one can also make all of the peptides that form the group of peptides that differ from the preferred motif (or the minimum size of that motif) in one, two, or more residues. This collection of peptides can then be screened for ability to bind to TPO-R. This immobilized polymer synthesis system or other peptide synthesis methods can also be used to synthesize truncation analogs and deletion analogs and combinationc of truncation and deletion analogs of all of the peptide compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\nB. \nSYNTHETIC AMINO ACIDS\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThese procedures can also be used to synthesize peptides in which amino acids other than the 20 naturally occurring, genetically encoded amino acids are substituted at one, two, or more positions of any of the compounds of the invention. For instance, naphthylalanine can be substituted for tryptophan, facilitating synthesis. Other synthetic amino acids that can be substituted into the peptides of the present invention include L-hydroxypropyl, L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanyl, d amino acids such as L-d-hydroxylysyl and D-d-methylalanyl, L-a-methylalanyl, b amino acids, and isoquinolyl. D amino acids and non-naturally occurring synthetic amino acids can also be incorporated into the peptides of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne can replace the naturally occurring side chains of the 20 genetically encoded amino acids (or D amino acids) with other side chains, for instance with groups such as alkyl, lower alkyl, cyclic 4-, 5-, 6-, to 7-membered alkyl, amide, amide lower alkyl, amide di(lower alkyl), lower alkoxy, hydroxy, carboxy and the lower ester derivatives thereof, and with 4-, 5-, 6-, to 7-membered hetereocyclic. In particular, proline analogs in which the ring size of the proline residue is changed from 5 members to 4, 6, or 7 members can be employed. Cyclic groups can be saturated or unsaturated, and if unsaturated, can be aromatic or non-aromatic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCyclic groups can be saturated or unsaturated, and if unsaturated, can be aromatic or non-aromatic. Heterocyclic groups preferably contain one or more nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulphur heteroatoms. Examples of such groups include the furazanyl, furyl, imidazolidinyl, imidazolyl, imidazolinyl, isothiazolyl, isoxazolyl, morpholinyl (e.g. morpholino), oxazolyl, piperazinyl (e.g. 1-piperazinyl), piperidyl (e.g. 1-piperidyl, piperidino), pyranyl, pyrazinyl, pyrazolidinyl, pyrazolinyl, pyrazolyl, pyridazinyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrolidinyl (e.g. 1-pyrrolidinyl), pyrrolinyl, pyrrolyl, thiadiazolyl, thiazolyl, thienyl, thiomorpholinyl (e.g. thiomorpholino), and triazolyl. These heterocyclic groups can be substituted or unsubstituted. Where a group is substituted, the substituent can be alkyl, alkoxy, halogen, oxygen, or substituted or unsubstituted phenyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne can also readily modify the peptides of the instant invention by phosphorylation, and other methods for making peptide derivatives of the compounds of the present invention are described in Hruby et al.\n42\n Thus, the peptide compounds of the invention also serve as a basis to prepare peptide mimetics with similar biological activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide compounds of the invention, including peptidomimetics, can be covalently modified to one or more of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkenes, in the manner set forth in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,640,835\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,496,689\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,301,144\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,670,417\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,791,192\n \n; or \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,179,337\n \n, all which are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.\n\n\n \n\n\nC. \nTERMINAL MODIFICATIONS\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThose of skill in the art recognize that a variety of techniques are available for constructing peptide mimetics with the same or similar desired biological activity as the corresponding peptide compound but with more favorable activity than the peptide with respect to solubility, stability, and susceptibility to hydrolysis and proteolysis. See, for example, \nMorgan and Gainor Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 24:243-252 (1989\n). The following describes methods for preparing peptide mimetics modified at the N-terminal amino group, the C-terminal carboxyl group, and/or changing one or more of the amido linkages in the peptide to a non-amido linkage. It being understood that two or more such modifications can be coupled in one peptide mimetic structure (e.g., modification at the C-terminal carboxyl group and inclusion of a -CH\n2\n-carbamate linkage between two amino acids in the peptide).\n\n\n \n\n\n1. \nN-TERMINAL MODIFICATIONS\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptides typically are synthesized as the free acid but, as noted above, could be readily prepared as the amide or ester. One can also modify the amino and/or carboxy terminus of the peptide compounds of the invention to produce other compounds of the invention. Amino terminus modifications include methylating (i.e., -NHCH\n3\n or -NH(CH\n3\n)\n2\n), acetylating, adding a carbobenzoyl group, or blocking the amino terminus with any blocking group containing a carboxylate functionality defined by RCOO-, where R is selected from the group consisting of naphthyl, acridinyl, steroidyl, and similar groups. Carboxy terminus modifications include replacing the free acid with a carboxamide group or forming a cyclic lactam at the carboxy terminus to introduce structural constraints.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino terminus modifications are as recited above and include alkylating, acetylating, adding a carbobenzoyl group, forming a succinimide group, etc. Specifically, the N-terminal amino group can then be reacted as follows:\n\n \n \n \n(a) to form an amide group of the formula RC(O)NH-where R is as defined above by reaction with an acid halide [e.g., RC(O)Cl] or acid anhydride. Typically, the reaction can be conducted by contacting about equimolar or excess amounts (e.g., about 5 equivalents) of an acid halide to the peptide in an inert diluent (e.g., dichloromethane) preferably containing an excess (e.g., about 10 equivalents) of a tertiary amine, such as diisopropylethylamine, to scavenge the acid generated during reaction. Reaction conditions are otherwise conventional (e.g., room temperature for 30 minutes). Alkylation of the terminal amino to provide for a lower alkyl N-substitution followed by reaction with an acid halide as described above will provide for N-alkyl amide group of the formula RC (O) NR- ;\n \n(b) to form a succinimide group by reaction with succinic anhydride. As before, an approximately equimolar amount or an excess of succinic anhydride (e.g., about 5 equivalents) can be employed and the amino group is converted to the succinimide by methods well known in the art including the use of an excess (e.g., ten equivalents) of a tertiary amine such as diisopropylethylamine in a suitable inert solvent (e.g., dichloromethane). See, for example, \n \nWollenberg, et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,612,132\n \n which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. It is understood that the succinic group can be substituted with, for example, C\n2\n-C\n6\n alkyl or -SR substituents which are prepared in a conventional manner to provide for substituted succinimide at the N-terminus of the peptide. Such alkyl substituents are prepared by reaction of a lower olefin (C\n2\n-C\n6\n) with maleic anhydride in the manner described by Wollenberg, et al., supra and -SR substituents are prepared by reaction of RSH with maleic anhydride where R is as defined above;\n \n(c) to form a benzyloxycarbonyl-NH- or a substituted benzyloxycarbonyl-NH- group by reaction with approximately an equivalent amount or an excess of CBZ-Cl (i.e., benzyloxycarbonyl chloride) or a substituted CBZ-Cl in a suitable inert diluent (e.g., dichloromethane) preferably containing a tertiary amine to scavenge the acid generated during the reaction;\n \n(d) to form a sulfonamide group by reaction with an equivalent amount or an excess (e.g., 5 equivalents) of R-S(O)\n2\nC1 in a suitable inert diluent (dichloromethane) to convert the terminal amine into a sulfonamide where R is as defined above. Preferably, the inert diluent contains excess tertiary amine (e.g., ten equivalents) such as diisopropylethylamine, to scavenge the acid generated during reaction. Reaction conditions are otherwise conventional (e.g., room temperature for 30 minutes);\n \n(e) to form a carbamate group by reaction with an equivalent amount or an excess (e.g., 5 equivalents) of R-OC(O)Cl or R-OC(O)OC\n6\nH\n4\n-p-NO\n2\n in a suitable inert diluent (e.g., dichloromethane) to convert the terminal amine into a carbamate where R is as defined above. Preferably, the inert diluent contains an excess (e.g., about 10 equivalents) of a tertiary amine, such as diisopropylethylamine, to scavenge any acid generated during reaction. Reaction conditions are otherwise conventional (e.g., room temperature for 30 minutes); and\n \n(f) to form a urea group by reaction with an equivalent amount or an excess (e.g., 5 equivalents) of R-N=C=O in a suitable inert diluent (e.g., dichloromethane) tc convert the terminal amine into a urea (i.e., RNHC(O)NH-) group where R is as defined above. Preferably, the inert diluent contains an excess (e.g., about 10 equivalents) of a tertiary amine, such as diisopropylethylamine. Reaction conditions are otherwise conventional (e.g., room temperature for about 30 minutes).\n \n\n\n\n\n2. \nC-TERMINAL MODIFICATIONS\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn preparing peptide mimetics wherein the C-terminal carboxyl group is replaced by an ester (i.e., -C(O)OR where R is as defined above), the resins used to prepare the peptide acids are employed, and the side chain protected peptide is cleaved with base and the appropriate alcohol, e.g., methanol. Side chain protecting groups are then removed in the usual fashion by treatment with hydrogen fluoride to obtain the desired ester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preparing peptide mimetics wherein the C-terminal carboxyl group is replaced by the amide -C(O)NR\n3\nR\n4\n, a benzhydrylamine resin is used as the solid support for peptide synthesis. Upon completion of the synthesis, hydrogen fluoride treatment to release the peptide from the support results directly in the free peptide amide (i.e., the C-terminus is -C(O)NH\n2\n). Alternatively, use of the chloromethylated resin during peptide synthesis coupled with reaction with ammonia to cleave the side chain protected peptide from the support yields the free peptide amide and reaction with an alkylamine or a dialkylamine yields a side chain protected alkylamide or dialkylamide (i.e., the C-terminus is -C(O)NRR\n1\n where R and R\n1\n are as defined above). Side chain protection is then removed in the usual fashion by treatment with hydrogen fluoride to give the free amides, alkylamides, or dialkylamides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another alternative embodiment, the C-terminal carboxyl group or a C-terminal ester can be induced to cyclize by internal displacement of the -OH or the ester (-OR) of the carboxyl group or ester respectively with the N-terminal amino group to form a cyclic peptide. For example, after synthesis and cleavage to give the peptide acid, the free acid is converted to an activated ester by an appropriate carboxyl group activator such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) in solution, for example, in methylene chloride (CH\n2\nC1\n2\n), dimethyl formamide (DMF) mixtures: The cyclic peptide is then formed by internal displacement of the activated ester with the N-terminal amine. Internal cyclization as opposed to polymerization can be enhanced by use of very dilute solutions. Such methods are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne can also cyclize the peptides of the invention, or incorporate a desamino or descarboxy residue at the terminii of the peptide, so that there is no terminal amino on carboxyl group, to decrease susceptibility to proteases or to restrict the conformation of the peptide. C-terminal functional groups of the compounds of the present invention include amide, amide lower alkyl, amide di(lower alkyl), lower alkoxy, hydroxy, and carboxy, and the lower ester derivatives thereof, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.\n\n\n \n\n\nD. \nBACKBONE MODIFICATIONS\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOther methods for making peptide derivatives of the compounds of the present invention are described in \nHruby et al. Biochem J. 268(2):249-262 (1990\n), incorporated herein by reference. Thus, the peptide compounds of the invention also serve as structural models for non-peptidic compounds with similar biological activity. Those of skill in the art recognize that a variety of techniques are available for constructing compounds with the same or similar desired biological activity as the lead peptide compound but with more favorable activity than the lead with respect to solubility, stability, and susceptibility to hydrolysis and proteolysis. See \nMorgan and Gainor Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 24:243-252 (1989\n), incorporated herein by reference. These techniques include replacing the peptide backbone with a backbone composed of phosphonates, amidates, carbamates, sulfonamides, secondary amines, and N-methylamino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide mimetics wherein one or more of the peptidyl linkages [-C(O)NH-] have been replaced by such linkages as a -CH\n2\n-carbamate linkage, a phosphonate linkage, a -CH\n2\n-sulfonamide linkage, a urea linkage, a secondary amine (-CH\n2\nNH-) linkage, and an alkylated peptidyl linkage [-C(O)NR\n6\n- where R\n6\n is lower alkyl] are prepared during conventional peptide synthesis by merely substituting a suitably protected amino acid analogue for the amino acid reagent at the appropriate point during synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable reagents include, for example, amino acid analogues wherein the carboxyl group of the amino acid has been replaced with a moiety suitable for forming one of the above linkages. For example, if one desires to replace a -C(O)NR- linkage in the peptide with a -CH\n2\n-carbamate linkage (-CH\n2\nOC(O)NR-), then the carboxyl (-COOH) group of a suitably protected amino acid is first reduced to the -CH\n2\nOH group which is then converted by conventional methods to a -OC(O)Cl functionality or a para-nitrocarbonate -OC(O)O-C\n6\nH\n4\n-p-NO\n2\n functionality. Reaction of either of such functional groups with the free amine or an alkylated amine on the N-terminus of the partially fabricated peptide found on the solid support leads to the formation of a -CH\n2\nOC(O)NR linkage. For a more detailed description of the formation of such -CH\n2\n-carbamate linkages, see \nCho et al Science, 261:1303-1305 (1993\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, replacement of an amido linkage in the peptide with a phosphonate linkage can be achieved in the manner set forth in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 07/943,805\n \n, \n \n08/081,577\n \n, and \n \n08/119,700\n \n, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReplacement of an amido linkage in the peptide with a -CH\n2\n-sulfonamide linkage can be achieved by reducing the carboxyl (-COOH) group of a suitably protected amino acid to the -CH\n2\nOH group and the hydroxyl group is then converted to a suitable leaving group such as a tosyl group by conventional methods. Reaction of the tosylated derivative with, for example, thioacetic acid followed by hydrolysis and oxidative chlorination will provide for the -CH\n2\n-S(O)\n2\nCl functional group which replaces the carboxyl group of the otherwise suitably protected amino acid. Use of this suitably protected amino acid analogue in peptide synthesis provides for inclusion of an -CH\n2\nS(O)\n2\nNR- linkage which replaces the amido linkage in the peptide thereby providing a peptide mimetic. For a more complete description on the conversion of the carboxyl group of the amino acid to a -CH\n2\nS(O)\n2\nCl group, see, for example, \nWeinstein, Boris Chemistry & Biochemistry of Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins Vol. 7, pp. 267-357, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1983\n) which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReplacement of an amido linkage in the peptide with a urea linkage can be achieved in the manner set forth in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/147,805\n \n which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSecondary amine linkages wherein a -CH\n2\nNH- linkage replaces the amido linkage in the peptide can be prepared by employing, for example, a suitably protected dipeptide analogue wherein the carbonyl bond of the amido linkage has been reduced to a CH\n2\n group by conventional methods. For example, in the case of diglycine, reduction of the amide to the amine will yield after deprotection H\n2\nNCH\n2\nCH\n2\nNHCH\n2\nCOOH which is then used in N-protected form in the next coupling reaction. The preparation of such analogues by reduction of the carbonyl group of the amido linkage in the dipeptide is well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe suitably protected amino acid analogue is employed in the conventional peptide synthesis in the same manner as would the corresponding amino acid. For example, typically about 3 equivalents of the protected amino acid analogue are employed in this reaction. An inert organic diluent such as methylene chloride or DMF is employed and, when an acid is generated as a reaction by-product, the reaction solvent will typically contain an excess amount of a tertiary amine to scavenge the acid generated during the reaction. One particularly preferred tertiary amine is diisopropylethylamine which is typically employed in about 10 fold excess. The reaction results in incorporation into the peptide mimetic of an amino acid analogue having a non-peptidyl linkage. Such substitution can be repeated as desired such that from zero to all of the amido bonds in the peptide have been replaced by non-amido bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne can also cyclize the peptides of the invention, or incorporate a desamino or descarboxy residue at the terminii of the peptide, so that there is no terminal amino or carboxyl group, to decrease susceptibility to proteases or to restrict the conformation of the peptide. C-terminal functional groups of the compounds of the present invention include amide, amide lower alkyl, amide di(lower alkyl), lower alkoxy, hydroxy, and carboxy, and the lower ester derivatives thereof, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Examples of cyclized compounds are provided in Tables 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.\n\n\n \n\n\nE. \nDISULFIDE BOND FORMATION\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may exist in a cyclized form with an intramolecular disulfide bond between the thiol groups of the cysteines Alternatively, an intermolecular disulfide bond between the thiol groups of the cysteines can be produced to yield a dimeric (or higher oligomeric) compound. One or more of the cysteine residues may also be substituted with a homocysteine. These intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide derivatives can be represented schematically as shown below:\n\n \n \n\nwherein m and n are independently 1 or 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther embodiments of this invention provide for analogs of these disulfide derivatives in which one of the sulfurs has been replaced by a CH\n2\n group or other isostere for sulfur. These analogs can be made via an intramolecular or intermolecular displacement, using methods known in the art as shown below:\n\n \n \n\nwherein p is 1 or 2. One of skill in the art will readily appreciate that this displacement can also occur using other homologs of the a-amino-g-butyric acid derivative shown above and homocysteine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the amino-terminus of the peptide can be capped with an alpha-substituted acetic acid, wherein the alpha substituent is a leaving group, such as an a-haloacetic acid, for example, a-chloroacetic acid, a-bromoacetic acid, or a-iodoacetic acid. The compounds of the present invention can be cyclized or dimerized via displacement of the leaving group by the sulfur of the cysteine or homocysteine residue. See, e.g., \nBarker et al. J. Med. Chem. 35:2040-2048 (1992\n) and \nOr et al. J. Org. Chem. 56:3146-3149 (1991\n), each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Examples of dimerized compounds are provided in Tables 7, 9, and 10.\n\n\n \nV. \nUTILITY\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are useful in vitro as unique tools for understanding the biological role of TPO, including the evaluation of the many factors thought to influence, and be influenced by, the production of TPO and the receptor binding process. The present compounds are also useful in the development of other compounds that bind to and activate the TPO-R, because the present compounds provide important information on the relationship between structure and activity that should facilitate such development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds are also useful as competitive binders in assays to screen for new TPO receptor agonists. In such assay embodiments, the compounds of the invention can be used without modification or can be modified in a variety of ways; for example, by labeling, such as covalently or non-covalently joining a moiety which directly or indirectly provides a detectable signal. In any of these assays, the materials thereto can be labeled either directly or indirectly. Possibilities for direct labeling include label groups such as: radiolabels such as \n125\nI, enzymes (\n \nUS Patent 3,645,090\n \n) such as peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase, and fluorescent labels (\n \nU.S. Patent Np. 3,940,475\n \n) capable of monitoring the change in fluorescence intensity, wavelength shift, or fluorescence polarization. Possibilities for indirect labeling include biotinylation of one constituent followed by binding to avidin coupled to one of the above label groups. The compounds may also include spacers or linkers in cases where the compounds are to be attached to a solid support.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, based on their ability to bind to the TPO receptor, the peptides of the present invention can be used as reagents for detecting TPO receptors on living cells, fixed cells, in biological fluids, in tissue homogenates, in purified, natural biological materials, etc. For example, by labelling such peptides, one can identify cells having TPO-R on their surfaces. In addition, based on their ability to bind the TPO receptor, the peptides of the present invention can be used in in situ staining, FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting), Western blotting, ELISA, etc. In addition, based on their ability to bind to the TPO receptor, the peptides of the present invention can be used in receptor purification, or in purifying cells expressing TPO receptors on the cell surface (or inside permeabilized cells).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can also be utilized as commercial reagents for various medical research and diagnostic uses. Such uses include but are not limited to: (1) use as a calibration standard for quantitating the activities of candidate TPO agonists in a variety of functional assays; (2) use to maintain the proliferation and growth of TPO-dependent cell lines; (3) use in structural analysis of the TPO-receptor through co-crystallization; (4) use to investigate the mechanism of TPO signal transduction/receptor activation; and (5) other research and diagnostic applications wherein the TPO-receptor is preferably activated or such activation is conveniently calibrated against a known quantity of a TPO agonist, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be used for the in vitro expansion of megakaryocytes and their committed progenitors, both in conjunction with additional cytokines or on their own. See, e.g., \n \nDiGiusto et al. PCT Publication No. 95/05843\n \n, which is incorporated herein by reference. Chemotherapy and radiation therapies cause thrombocytopenia by killing the rapidly dividing, more mature population of megakaryocytes. However, these therapeutic treatments can also reduce the number and viability of the immature, less mitotically active megakaryocyte precursor cells. Thus, amelioration of the thrombocytopenia by TPO or the compounds of the present invention can be hastened by infusing patients post chemotherapy or radiation therapy with a population of his or her own cells enriched for megakaryocytes and immature precursors by in vitro culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can also be administered to warm blooded-animals, including humans, to activate the TPO-R \nin vivo\n. Thus, the present invention encompasses methods for therapeutic treatment of TPO related disorders that comprise administering a compound of the invention in amounts sufficient to mimic the effect of TPO on TPO-R \nin vivo.\n For example, the peptides and compounds of the invention can be administered to treat a variety of hematological disorders, including but not limited to platelet disorders and thrombocytopenia, particularly when associated with bone marrow transfusions, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention, TPO antagonists are preferably first administered to patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy, followed by administration of the tpo agonists of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity of the compounds of the present invention can be evaluated either \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo\n in one of the numerous models described in \nMcDonald Am. J. of Pediatric Hematolocry/Oncology 14:8-21 (1992\n), which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one embodiment, the compositions of the present invention are useful for treating thrombocytopenia associated with bone marrow transfusions, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. The compounds typically will be administered prophylactically prior to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or bone marrow transplant or after such exposure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as an active ingredient, at least one of the peptides or peptide mimetics of the invention in association with a pharmaceutical carrier or diluent. The compounds of this invention can be administered by oral, pulmonary, parental (intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous injection), inhalation (via a fine powder formulation), transdermal, nasal, vaginal, rectal, or sublingual routes of administration and can be formulated in dosage forms appropriate for each route of administration. See, e.g., \n \nBernstein et al. PCT Patent Publication No. WO 93/25221\n \n; \n \nPitt et al. PCT Patent Publication No. WO 94/17784\n \n; and Pitt et al. European Patent Application \n \n613,683\n \n, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is admixed with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions syrups, with the elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Besides such inert diluents, compositions can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations according to this invention for parental administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents or vehicles are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured using sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium, immediately before use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which may contain, in addition tc the active substance, excipients such as cocoa butter or a suppository wax. Compositions for nasal or sublingual administration are also prepared with standard excipients well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions containing the compounds can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease, as described above, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as \"therapeutically effective dose\". Amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity of the disease and the weight and general state of the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the invention can also be microencapsulated by, for example, the method of \nTice and Bib (in Treatise on Controlled Drug Delivery, ed. A. Kydonieus, Marcel Dekker, N.Y. (1992), pp. 315-339\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn prophylactic applications, compositions containing the compounds of the invention are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease. Such an amount is defined to be a \"prophylactically effective dose\". In this use, the precise amounts again depend on the patient's state of health and weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe quantities of the TPO agonist necessary for effective therapy will depend upon many different factors, including means of administration, target site, physiological state of the patient, and other medicants administered. Thus, treatment dosages should be titrated to optimize safety and efficacy. Typically, dosages used \nin vitro\n may provide useful guidance in the amounts useful for in situ administration of these reagents. Animal testing of effective doses for treatment of particular disorders will provide further predictive indication of human dosage. Various considerations are described, e.g., in \nGilman et al. (eds), Goodman and Gilman's: The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 8th ed., Pergamon Press (1990\n); and \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 7th ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Penn. (1985\n); each of which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides and peptide mimetics of this invention are effective in treating TPO mediated conditions when administered at a dosage range of from about 0.001 mg to about 10 mg/kg of body weight per day. The specific dose employed is regulated by the particular condition being treated, the route of administration as well as by the judgement of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the condition, the age and general condition of the patient, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough only preferred embodiments of the inventic are specifically described above, it will be appreciated that modifications and variations of the invention are possible without departing from the spirit and intended scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOLID PHASE PEPTIDE SYNTHESIS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nVarious peptides of the invention were synthesized using the Merrifield solid phase synthesis techniques (See \nSteward and Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2d. edition Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL (1984\n) and \nMerrifield J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149 (1963\n)) on a Milligen/Biosearch 9600 automated instrument or an Applied Biosystems Inc. Model 431A peptide synthesizer. The peptides were assembled using standard protocols of the Applied Biosystems Inc. System Software version 1.01. Each coupling was performed for one-two hours with BOP (benzotriazolyl N-oxtrisdimethylaminophosphonium hexafluorophosphate) and HOB (1-hydroxybenzotriazole).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resin used was HMP resin or PAL (Milligen/Biosearch), which is a cross-linked polystyrene resin with 5-(4'-Fmoc-aminomethyl-3,5'-dimethyoxyphenoxy) valeric acid as a linker. Use of PAL resin results in a carboxyl terminal amide functionality upon cleavage of the peptide from the resin. Upon cleavage, the HMP resin produce a carboxylic acid moiety at the C-terminus of the final product. Most reagents, resins, and protected amino acids (free or on the resin) were purchased from Millipore or Applied Biosystems Inc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fmoc group was used for amino protection during the coupling procedure. Primary amine protection on amino acids was achieved with Fmoc and side chain protection groups were t-butyl for serine, tyrosine, asparagine, glutamic acid, and threonine; trityl for glutamine; Pmc (2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroma sulfonate) for arginine; N-t-butyloxycarbonyl for tryptophan; N-trityl for histidine and glutamine; and S-trityl for cysteine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRemoval of the peptides from the resin and simultaneous deprotection of the side chain functions were achieved by treatment with reagent K or slight modifications of it. Alternatively, in the synthesis of those peptides, with an amidated carboxyl terminus, the fully assembled peptide was cleaved with a mixture of 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% ethanedithiol, and 5% water, initially at 4°C, and gradually increasing to room temperature. The deprotected peptides were precipitated with diethyl ether. In all cases, purification was by preparative, reverse-phase, high performance liquid chromatography on a C\n18\n bonded silica gel column with a gradient of acetonitrile/water in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The homogeneous peptides were characterized by Fast Atom Bombardment mass spectrometry or electrospray mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis when applicable.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIOASSAYS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBioactivity of the peptides can be measured using a thrombopoietin dependent cell proliferation assay. Murine IL-3 dependent Ba/F3 cells were transfected with full length human TPO-R. In the absence of IL-3 (WEHI-3 conditioned media), these cells are dependent on TPO for proliferation. The parental, untransfected cell line does not respond to human TPO, but remains IL-3 dependent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBioassays have been performed on both of the above cell lines using synthetic peptides derived from library screening. The cells were grown in complete RPMI-10 media, containing 10% WEHI-3 conditioned media, then washed twice in PBS, resuspended in media which lacked WEHI-3 conditioned media, and added to wells containing dilutions of peptide or TPO at 2 x 10\n4\n cells/well. The cells were incubated for 48 hours at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere and metabolic activity was assayed by the reduction of MTT to formazan, with absorbance at 570 nM measured on an ELISA plate reader. The peptides tested stimulated proliferation of TPO-R transfected Ba/F3 cells in a dose dependent manner as shown in \nFigure 1\n. These peptides have no effect on the parental cell line.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBINDING AFFINITY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBinding affinities of chemically synthesized peptides for TPO-R were measured in a competition binding assay. The wells of a microtiter plate were coated with 1 mg streptavidin, blocked with PBS/1% BSA, followed by 50 ng of biotinylated anti-receptor immobilizing antibody (Ab179). The wells were then treated with a 1:10 dilution of soluble TPO-R harvest. Various concentrations of peptide or peptide mimetic were mixed with a constant amount of a truncated form of TPO consisting of residues 1-156 fused to the C-terminus of maltose binding protein (MBP-TPO\n156\n). The peptide MBP-TPO\n156\n mixtures were added to the TPO-R coated wells, incubated for 2 hours at 4°C and then washed with PBS. The amount of MBP-TPO\n156\n that was bound at equilibrium was measured by adding a rabbit anti-sera directed against MBP, followed by alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The amount of alkaline phosphatase in each well was then determined using standard methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay is conducted over a range of peptide concentrations and the results are graphed such that the y axis represents the amount of bound MBP-TPO\n156\n and the x axis represents the concentration of peptide or peptide mimetic. One can then determine the concentration at which the peptide or peptide mimetic will reduce by 50% (IC\n50\n) the amount of MBP-TPO\n156\n bound to immobilized TPO-R. The dissociation constant (Kd) for the peptide should be similar to the measured IC\n50\n using the assay conditions described above.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"PEPTIDES ON PLASMIDS\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pJS142 vector is used for library construction and is shown in \nFigure 4\n. Three oligonucleotide sequences ar needed for library construction: ON-829 (5' ACC ACC TCC GG); ON-830 (5' TTA CTT AGT TA) and a library specific oligonucleotide of interest (5' GA GGT GGT {NNK}\nn\n TAA CTA AGT AAA GC), where {NNK}\nn\n denotes a random region of the desired length and sequence. The oligonucleotides can be 5' phosphorylated chemically during synthesis or after purification with polynucleotide kinase. They are then annealed at a 1:1:1 molar ratio and ligated to the vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe strain of \nE. coli\n which is preferably used for panning has the genotype: Δ\n(srl-recA) endal nupG lon-11 sulA: hsdR17\n Δ\n(ompT-fepC)266\n Δ\nclpA319\n : : \nkan AlacI lac ZU118\n which car be prepared from an \nE. coli\n strain from the E. \ncoli\n Genetic Stock Center at Yale University (\nE. coli\n b/r, stock center designation CGSC:6573) with genotype \nlon-11 sulAl.\n The above \nE. coli\n strain is prepared for use in electroporation as described by \nDower et al.

These cells are used for growth of the original library and for amplification of the enriched population after each round of panning.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides on plasmids are released from cells for panning by gentle enzymatic digestion of the cell wall using lysozyme. After pelleting of the cell debris, the crude lysate can be used directly on most receptors. If some additional purification of the plasmid complexes is needed, a gel filtration column can be used to remove many of the low molecular weight contaminants in the crude lysate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPanning is carried out in a buffer (HEKL) of a lower salt concentration than most physiological buffers. The panning can be conducted in microtiter wells with a receptor immobilized on a nonblocking monoclonal antibody (MAb) or by panning on beads or on columns. More specifically, in the first round of panning, 24 wells, each coated with receptor, can be used. For the second round, six wells coated with receptor (PAN sample) and 6 wells without receptor (NC sample are typically used. Comparison of the number of plasmids in these two samples can give an indication of whether receptor specific clones are being enriched by panning. \"Enrichment\" is defined as the ratio of PAN transformants to those recovered from the NC sample. Enrichment of 10 fold is usually an indication that receptor specific clones are present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn later rounds of panning, it is useful to reduce the input of lysate into the wells to lower nonspecific background binding of the plasmid complexes. In \nround\n 2, usually 100 \nµ\nl of lysate per well is used. In \n \nround\n \n 3, 100 \nµ\n of lysate per well diluted with 1/10 in HEKL/BSA is used. Fo: further rounds of panning, typically an input of plasmid transforming units of at least 1000 fold above the estimated remaining diversity is used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding properties of the peptides encoded by individual clones are typically examined after 3, 4, or 5 rounds of panning, depending on the enrichment numbers observed. Typically, an ELISA that detects receptor specific binding by LacI-peptide fusion proteins is used. LacI is normally a tetramer and the minimum functional DNA binding species is a dimer. The peptides are thus displayed multivalently on the fusion protein. Assuming that a sufficient density of receptor can be immobilized in wells, the peptides fused to LacI will bind to the surface in a cooperative, multivalent fashion. This cooperative binding permits the detection of binding events of low intrinsic affinity. The sensitivity of this assay is an advantage in that initial hits of low affinity can be easily identified, but is a disadvantage in that the signal in the ELISA is not correlated with the intrinsic affinity of the peptides. Fusion of the peptides to maltose binding protein (MBP) as described below permits testing in an ELISA format where signal strength is better correlated with affinity. See \nFigure 5A-B\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA from clones of interest can be prepared in double stranded form using any standard miniprep procedure. The coding sequences of interesting single clones or populations of clones can be transferred to vectors that fuse those sequences in frame with the gene encoding MBP, a protein that generally occurs as a monomer in solution. The cloning of a library into pJS142 creates a BspEI restriction site near the beginning of the random coding region of the library. Digestion with BspEI and ScaI allows the purification of a \n∼\n900 bp DNA fragment that can be subcloned into one of two vectors, pELM3 (cytoplasmic) or pELM15 (periplasmic), which are simple modifications of the pMALc2 and pMALp2 vectors, respectively, available commercially from New England Biolabs. See \nFigure 5A-B\n. Digestion of pELM3 and pELM15 with AgeI and ScaI allows efficient cloning of the BspEI-ScaI fragment from the pJS142 library. The BspEI and AgeI ends are compatible for ligation. In addition, correct ligation of the ScaI sites is essential to recreate a functional \nbla\n (Amp resistance) gene, thus lowering the level of background clones from undesired ligation events. Expression of the tac promoter-driven MBP-peptide fusions can then be induced with IPTG.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLysates for the LacI or MBP ELISAs are prepared from individual clones by lysing cells using lysozyme and removing insoluble cell debris by centrifugation. The lysates are then added to wells containing immobilized receptor and to control wells without receptor. Binding by the LacI or MBP peptide fusions is detected by incubation with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against either LacI or MBP followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase labeled goat anti rabbit second antibody. The bound alkaline phosphatase is detected with p-nitrophenyl phosphate chromagenic substrate.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"HEADPIECE DIMER\" SYSTEM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA variant of the LacI peptides-on-plasmids techniqu utilizes a DNA binding protein called \"headpiece dimer\". DNA binding by the \nE\n. \ncoli lac\n repressor is mediated by the approximately 60 amino acid \"headpiece\" domain. The dimer of the headpiece domains that binds to the \nlac\n operator is normally formed by association of the much larger approximately 300 amino acid C-terminal domain. The \"headpiece dimer\" system utilizes headpiece dimer molecules containing two headpieces connected via short peptide linker. These proteins bind DNA with sufficient stability to allow association of a peptide epitope displayed at the C-terminus of the headpiece dimer with the plasmid encoding that peptide\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe random peptides are fused to the C-terminus of the headpiece dimer, which binds to the plasmid that encoded it to make a peptide-headpiece dimer-plasmid complex that can be screened by panning. The headpiece dimer peptides-on-plasmids system allows greater selectivity for high affinity ligands than the LacI system. Thus, the headpiece dimer system is useful for making mutagenesis libraries based on initial low-affinity hits, and selecting higher affinity variants of those initial sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe libraries are constructed as with peptides on plasmids using headpiece dimer vector pCMG14 (see \nFigure 6A-C\n). The presence of the \nlac\n operator is not required for plasmid binding by the headpiece dimer protein. The libraries were introduced into bacterial strain comprising \nE\n. \ncoli\n (\nlon-11 sulAl hsdR17 (ompT-fepC)\n Δ\nclpA319::kan\n Δ\nlacI lac ZU118\n Δ\n(srl-recA) 306::Tn10\n and amplified under conditions of basal (A) promoter induction. Panning of headpiece dimer libraries is carried out by similar procedures to those used for LacI libraries, except that HEK buffer is used instead of HEKL buffer and elution of plasmids from the wells is performed with aqueous phenol instead of with IPTG. Sequences from headpiece dimer panning are often characterized after transfer to the MBP vector so that they can be tested in the affinity sensitive MBP ELISA and also so that populations of clones can be screened by colony lifts with labeled receptor.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn this example cyclized compounds were subjected t three assays.

At the end of the incubation period, the cultures were concentrated by Cytospin, stained for acetylcholinesterase (AChE, a diagnostic of mouse megakaryocytes) , and counted by microscopic analysis. One (1) nM rhuTPO gave rise to the outgrowth of very large (>40 um) non-adherent cells that stain for AChE. These cells appear to be mature megakaryocytes.

From an initial seeding of 10\n6\n total marrow cells/ml (in 50 ml cultures) an estimated 1 to 2 x 10\n6\n megakaryocytes developed. This responce to TPO was designated as \"maximal\". Control cultures containing no added growth factors produced very few AChE-positive cells. Several of the peptide compounds were tested at high concentration in this assay and the results are summarized in Table 12. Peptide A at 10uM produced a maximal response of the mouse marrow. This finding was the first evidence that this peptide family is active on the murine receptor. In a second experiment, marrow cells were harvested and cultured in semisolid medium (methylcellulose) containing either no factors, 1 nM rhuTPO, or 10um Peptide A. After 7 days in culture, colonies of large cell (presumed to be megakaryocytes) were counted and grouped into small colonies (3-5 cells) or large colonies (greater than 6 cells). The results are shown in Table 13. TPO and the test peptides both produced substantially more colonies of both sized than did the negative control cultures. This indicates that the peptides mimic TPO in their ability to stimulate the expansion of the Mk precursor cell population.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo obtain a more quantitative comparison of the activity of the test compounds on murine and human receptors, the muTPO receptor was cloned and transfected into BaF3 cells. A TPO dependent population of cells was isolated.\n\n \n \n \nTABLE 12\n \n \n \n \n \n \nPeptide\n \n \n \nConcentration Tested (nM) Response\n \n \n \n \n \nD\n \n100,000\n \nnone\n \n \n \nC\n \n40,000\n \nmaximal **\n \n \n \nC + S.A.*\n \n1000\n \nmaximal**\n \n \n \nS.A. alone\n \n1000\n \nnone\n \n \n \nB\n \n100,000\n \nminimul\n \n \n \nA\n \n10,000\n \nmaximal**\n \n \n \nTPO (R & D)\n \n1\n \n\"maximal\"\n \n \n \n \n \n* Strepcavidin complexed to biotinylated peptide - concentration of putative 1:4 complex.\n\n** Compared to recombinant human TPO\n\n** 25-30% ACE staining cells on cytopspin\n\nNo factor cultures - ca. 5% AChE staining cells (lower cellularity)\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nTABLE 13\n \n \n \n \nCompound\n \n3-5 large cells\n \n6-12 large cells\n \n \n \n \nNo \nfactors\n \n \n1\n \n2\n \n1\n \n \n \nNo \nfactors\n \n \n2\n \n1\n \n1\n \n \n \n1 nM TPO\n \n#1-1\n \n15\n \n6\n \n \n \n1 nM TPO\n \n#1-2\n \n12\n \n1\n \n \n \n1 nM TPO\n \n#2-1\n \n16\n \n8\n \n \n \n1 nM TPO\n \n#2-2\n \n13\n \n3\n \n \n \n10 uM Peptide\n \n#1-1\n \n25\n \n10\n \n \n \n10 uM Peptide\n \n#1-2\n \n22\n \n8\n \n \n \n10 uM Peptide\n \n#2-1\n \n22\n \n7\n \n \n \n10 uM Peptide\n \n#2-2\n \n21\n \n10\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disclosures in this application of all articles and references, including patent documents, are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nNumberal Embodiments of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n1.

The heavy and light chain variable domain sequences of antibodies are under selective pressure and can vary significantly in sequence from one antibody to another (Wu and Kabat, 1970). There are a large number of functional germline variable heavy (˜40; Tomlinson et al., 1992; Tomlinson et al., 1994; Matsuda and Honjo, 1996), variable kappa (˜40; Meindl et al., 1989; Cox et al., 1994; Barbie and Lefranc, 1998) and variable lambda (˜30; Williams et al., 1996; Kawasaki, et al., 1997) genes embedded within the human genome. The ability of the immune system to create many combinations of heavy chain and light chain variable domain germlines is one mechanism for creating antibody diversity (Edelman, 1959; Frañek, 1961). Additional diversity is derived by the insertion of a variable connecting peptide region, the J-connecting peptide (plus D-connecting peptide for heavy chains), between the variable domains and the constant domains (Leder, 1982). Subsequent to germline antibody selection against a specific antigen, B-cells expressing a single antibody with selected variable domain germlines and (D-)J-connecting peptides undergo the process of hypersomatic mutation within the variable heavy and light chain domains to increase antibody affinity towards the antigen (Leder, 1982; Tomlinson et al., 1996). Hypersomatic insertions or deletions within variable domains are also commonly observed, although at a much lower frequency than hypersomatic mutation (de Wildt et al., 1999). Thus, a mature antibody selected against a particular antigen will have highly unique variable domain sequences which are not necessarily optimized for stability.\n\n\nPoor stability can affect the ability of an antibody or antibody domain to fold properly when expressed in various cellular systems, e.g., in bacterial or mammalian expression systems. Misfolding or poor stability can also result in fractional populations of non-functional material (Martsev et al., 1998) and/or antibodies with the tendency to form large soluble aggregates which are potentially dangerous or immunogenic when used therapeutically. Other stability problems include impeded refolding, degradation, impaired avidity, aggregation, or loss of activity following storage.\n\n\nStability problems are not limited to naturally occurring antibodies, but may occur in engineered antigen binding molecules as well, such as recombinant antibody libraries (Hoogenboom, 2005), antibody fragments (Holt et al., 2003; Todorovska et al., 2001; Worn and Plückthun, 2001; Reiter and Pastan, 1996) and engineered or humanized therapeutic antibodies for manufacturing and clinical purposes (Ewert et al., 2004; Carter and Merchant, 1997). In addition, multivalent forms of antibodies, such as bispecific molecules may have stability problems. While bispecific antibodies are desirable because of their therapeutic utility in humans, their production is unpredictable. For example, bispecific antibodies may result in substantial decrease in thermal stability, product yield, or in the formation of low molecular weight aggregates.\n\n\nUnnatural changes to the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains may also arise when humanizing rodent antibodies. Humanization is generally performed by grafting rodent complementarity determining regions (CDRs) onto the most similar human germline variable domain (Hurle and Gross, 1994). The germlines chosen for humanization may not be used with great frequency by the immune system and changes within the human frameworks are often necessary to achieve adequate antigen binding.\n\n\nUnstable proteins suffer from many problems, including one or more of: unsuitability for scale-up production in bioreactors (e.g., because of low yield, significant levels of unwanted byproducts such as unassembled product, and/or aggregated material), difficulties in protein purification, and unsuitability for pharmaceutical preparation and use (e.g., owing to significant levels of breakdown product, poor product quality, and/or unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties). Instability within the variable domains of antibodies, Fabs, Fvs, or single-chain Fvs (scFvs) may result in many of these problems. scFv constructs in particular have demonstrated problems with stability, solubility, expression, aggregation, breakdown products, and overall manufacturability in both bacterial and in mammalian expression systems (see Worn and Pluckthun, 2001). Additionally, incorporation of scFv molecules into otherwise stable recombinant antibody products often imparts these generally undesirable traits to the new recombinant design.\n\n\nAccordingly, there is a need for improved methods of predicting the stability of proteins, such as antibodies, and for improved, stable antigen binding molecules that are suitable for scalable production. There is also a need for improved methods that allow for scalable production of a population of stable antigen binding molecules that are suitable for pharmaceutical applications.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention is based, at least in part, on the development of improved polypeptide compositions, e.g. improved binding molecules, comprising or consisting of scFv molecules with improved stability and methods for making the same.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention pertains to a population of stabilized scFv molecules, wherein the stabilized scFv molecules comprise\n\n \n \ni) a scFv linker interposed between a V\nH \ndomain and a V\nL \ndomain, wherein the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains are linked by a disulfide bond between an amino acid in the V\nH \ndomain and an amino acid in the V\nL \ndomain, and wherein the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of the scFv molecules have Tm values of greater than 55° C.;

In addition, the instant invention provides methods for designing stable proteins, such as antibody molecules.\n\n\nThe stabilized scFv molecules of the instant invention are especially useful in producing stable multispecific, e.g., bispecific molecules. The stabilized binding molecules of the invention, e.g., multispecific binding molecules can be stably expressed in culture, are suitable for large scale production, and are stable in vivo.\n\n\nThe invention is also based, at least in part, on the development of stabilized binding molecules that consist of or comprise a stabilized scFv molecule and methods for making such stabilized binding molecules. In addition, the instant invention provides methods for designing stable proteins and for predicting the stability of proteins, such as antibody molecules.\n\n\nBefore further description of the invention, for convenience, certain terms are described below:\n\n\nI. Definitions\n\n\nAs used herein the term “scFv molecule” includes binding molecules which consist of one light chain variable domain (VL) or portion thereof, and one heavy chain variable domain (VH) or portion thereof, wherein each variable domain (or portion thereof) is derived from the same or different antibodies. scFv molecules preferably comprise an scFv linker interposed between the VH domain and the VL domain. scFv molecules are known in the art and are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,892,019, Ho et al. 1989. Gene 77:51; Bird et al. 1988 \nScience \n242:423; Pantoliano et al. 1991\n. Biochemistry \n30:10117; Milenic et al. 1991\n. Cancer Research \n51:6363; Takkinen et al. 1991\n. Protein Engineering \n4:837.\n\n\nA “scFv linker” as used herein refers to a moiety interposed between the VL and VH domains of the scFv. scFv linkers preferably maintain the scFv molecule in a antigen binding conformation. In one embodiment, an scFv linker comprises or consists of an scFv linker peptide. In certain embodiments, an scFv linker peptide comprises or consists of a gly-ser connecting peptide. In other embodiments, an scFv linker comprises a disulfide bond.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “gly-ser connecting peptide” refers to a peptide that consists of glycine and serine residues. An exemplary gly/ser connecting peptide comprises the amino acid sequence (Gly\n4 \nSer)\nn \n(SEQ ID NO: 156). In one embodiment, n=1. In one embodiment, n=2. In another embodiment, n=3. In a preferred embodiment, n=4, i.e., (Gly\n4 \nSer)\nn\n. In another embodiment, n=5. In yet another embodiment, n=6. Another exemplary gly/ser connecting peptide comprises the amino acid sequence Ser(Gly\n4\nSer)\nn \n(SEQ ID NO: 157). In one embodiment, n=1. In one embodiment, n=2. In a preferred embodiment, n=3. In another embodiment, n=4. In another embodiment, n=5. In yet another embodiment, n=6.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “disulfide bond” refers to the covalent bond formed between two sulfur atoms. The amino acid cysteine comprises a thiol group that can form a disulfide bond or bridge with a second thiol group.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “conventional scFv molecule” refers to an scFv molecule which is not a stabilized scFv molecule. For example, a typical conventional scFv molecule lacks stabilizing mutations and comprises a VH and a VL domain linked by a (G\n4\nS)3 linker.\n\n\nA “stabilized scFv molecule” of the invention is an scFv molecule comprising at least one change or alteration as compared to a conventional scFv molecule which results in stabilization of the scFv molecule. As used herein, the term “stabilizing mutation” includes a mutation which confers enhanced protein stability (e.g. thermal stability) to the scFv molecule and/or to a larger protein comprising said scFv molecule. In one embodiment, the stabilizing mutation comprises the substitution of a destabilizing amino acid with a replacement amino acid that confers enhanced protein stability (herein a “stabilizing amino acid”). In one embodiment, the stabilizing mutation is one in which the length of an scFv linker has been optimized. In one embodiment, a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention comprises one or more amino acid substitutions. For example, in one embodiment, a stabilizing mutation comprises a substitution of at least one amino acid residue which substitution results in an increase in stability of the VH and VL interface of an scFv molecule. In one embodiment, the amino acid is within the interface. In another embodiment, the amino acid is one which scaffolds the interaction between VH and VL. In another embodiment, a stabilizing mutation comprises substituting at least one amino acid in the VH domain or VL domain that covaries with two or more amino acids at the interface between the VH and VL domains. In another embodiment, the stabilizing mutation is one in which at least one cysteine residue is introduced (i.e., is engineered into one or more of the VH or VL domain) such that the VH and VL domains are linked by at least one disulfide bond between an amino acid in the VH and an amino acid in the VL domain. In certain preferred embodiments, a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention is one in which both the length of the scFv linker is optimized and at least one amino acid residue is substituted and/or the VH and VL domains are linked by a disulfide bond between an amino acid in the VH and an amino acid in the VL domain. In one embodiment, more than one of the stabilizing mutations described herein may be made in an scFv molecule.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, one or more stabilizing mutations made to an scFv molecule simultaneously improves the thermal stability of both the VH and VL domains of the scFv molecule as compared to a conventional scFv molecule.\n\n\nPreferably, a population of one or more of the stabilized scFv molecules of the invention is expressed as a population of monomeric, soluble proteins. In one embodiment, no more than 10% is present in aggregated form. In one embodiment, the stabilized scFv molecules of the population may comprise the same stabilizing mutation or a combination of stabilizing mutations. In other embodiments, the individual stabilized scFv molecules of the population comprise different stabilizing mutations.\n\n\nThe subject stabilized scFv molecules may be used alone to bind to a target molecule or may be linked to another polypeptide to form stabilized binding molecules which comprise a stabilized scFv molecule. For example, a binding molecule of the invention may comprise an scFv molecule linked to a second scFv molecule or a non-scFv molecule, e.g., that imparts target binding specificity, such as an antibody.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “protein stability” refers to an art-recognized measure of the maintainance of one or more physical properties of a protein in response to an environmental condition (e.g. an elevated or lowered temperature). In one embodiment, the physical property is the maintenance of the covalent structure of the protein (e.g. the absence of proteolytic cleavage, unwanted oxidation or deamidation). In another embodiment, the physical property is the presence of the protein in a properly folded state (e.g. the absence of soluble or insoluble aggregates or precipitates). In one embodiment, stability of a protein is measured by assaying a biophysical property of the protein, for example thermal stability, pH unfolding profile, stable removal of glycosylation, solubility, biochemical function (e.g., ability to bind to a protein (e.g., a ligand, a receptor, an antigen, etc.) or chemical moiety, etc.), and/or combinations thereof. In another embodiment, biochemical function is demonstrated by the binding affinity of an interaction. In one embodiment, a measure of protein stability is thermal stability, i.e., resistance to thermal challenge. Stability can be measured using methods known in the art and/or described herein.\n\n\nThe VL and VH domains of an scFv molecule are derived from one or more antibody molecules. It will also be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the variable regions of the scFv molecules of the invention may be modified such that they vary in amino acid sequence from the antibody molecule from which they were derived. For example, in one embodiment, nucleotide or amino acid substitutions leading to conservative substitutions or changes at amino acid residues may be made (e.g., in CDR and/or framework residues). Alternatively or in addition, mutations may be made to CDR amino acid residues to optimize antigen binding using art recognized techniques. The binding molecules of the invention maintain the ability to bind to antigen.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “derived from” a designated protein refers to the origin of the polypeptide. In one embodiment, the polypeptide or amino acid sequence which is derived from a particular starting polypeptide is a variable region sequence (e.g. a VH or VL) or sequence related thereto (e.g. a CDR or framework region). In one embodiment, the amino acid sequence which is derived from a particular starting polypeptide is not contiguous. For example, in one embodiment, one, two, three, four, five, or six CDRs are derived from a starting antibody. In one embodiment, the polypeptide or amino acid sequence that is derived from a particular starting polypeptide or amino acid sequence has an amino acid sequence that is essentially identical to that of the starting sequence or a portion thereof, wherein the portion consists of at least 3-5 amino acids, 5-10 amino acids, at least 10-20 amino acids, at least 20-30 amino acids, or at least 30-50 amino acids, or which is otherwise identifiable to one of ordinary skill in the art as having its origin in the starting sequence.\n\n\nAn isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a stabilized scFv molecule or a portion thereof can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of a conventional scFv molecule or an immunoglobulin from which it is derived such that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations may be introduced by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. In one embodiment, conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more non-essential amino acid residues. A “conservative amino acid substitution” is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art, including basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, an amino acid residue in an immunoglobulin polypeptide may be replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. In another embodiment, a string of amino acids can be replaced with a structurally similar string that differs in order and/or composition of side chain family members. In another embodiment, a mutation is introduced in order to introduce at least one cysteine molecule into the VH and into the VL domain and, thereby, introduce a disulfide bond into the scFv molecule. In another embodiment, an amino acid of a conventional scFv molecule may be substituted with an amino acid having similar physical (e.g., spatial) or functional properties. Preferably, amino acids substituted into conventional scFv molecules are compatible with the integrity of the V\nL\n/V\nH \ninterface, CDR conformations, and V\nH \nand/or V\nL \nfolding.\n\n\nAlternatively, in another embodiment, mutations may be introduced randomly along all or part of the immunoglobulin coding sequence.\n\n\nThe stabilized scFv molecules of the invention or polypeptides comprising the stabilized scFv molecules are binding molecules, i.e., they bind to a target molecule of interest, e.g., an antigen. When a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention is fused to a second molecule, the second molecule may also impart a binding specificity to the fusion protein.\n\n\nThe binding molecules of the invention consist of scFv molecules (e.g., a VH and a VL domain joined by an scFv linker) or comprise a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention are monovalent, i.e., comprise one target binding site (e.g., as in the case of an scFv molecule). In one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention are multivalent, i.e., comprise more than one target binding site. In another embodiment, the binding molecules comprise at least two binding sites. In one embodiment, the binding molecules comprise two binding sites. In one embodiment, the binding molecules comprise three binding sites. In another embodiment, the binding molecules comprise four binding sites. In another embodiment, the binding molecules comprise greater than four binding sites.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention are monomers. In another embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention are multimers. For example, in one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention are dimers. In one embodiment, the dimers of the invention are homodimers, comprising two identical monomeric subunits. In another embodiment, the dimers of the invention are heterodimers, comprising two non-identical monomeric subunits. The subunits of the dimer may comprise one or more polypeptide chains. For example, in one embodiment, the dimers comprise at least two polypeptide chains. In one embodiment, the dimers comprise two polypeptide chains. In another embodiment, the dimers comprise four polypeptide chains (e.g., as in the case of antibody molecules).\n\n\nAs used herein the term “valency” refers to the number of potential target binding sites in a polypeptide. Each target binding site specifically binds one target molecule or specific site on a target molecule. When a polypeptide comprises more than one target binding site, each target binding site may specifically bind the same or different molecules (e.g., may bind to different molecules, e.g., different antigens, or different epitopes on the same molecule).\n\n\nThe term “specificity” refers to the ability to specifically bind (e.g., immunoreact with) a given target. A polypeptide may be monospecific and contain one or more binding sites which specifically bind a target or a polypeptide may be multispecific (e.g., bispecific or trispecific) and contain two or more binding sites which specifically bind the same or different targets. Specific binding may be imparted by a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention and/or a non-scFv moiety to which a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention is linked.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is multispecific. For example, in one embodiment, a multispecific binding molecule of the invention is a bispecific molecule (e.g., antibody, minibody, domain deleted antibody, or fusion protein, single domain antibodies (e.g., camelid, shark, human) comprising at least one stabilized scFv molecule) having binding specificity for at least two targets, e.g., more than one target molecule or more than one epitope on the same target molecule. In one embodiment, a multispecific molecule has at least one binding site specific for a molecule targeted for reduction or elimination and a target molecule on a cell. In another embodiment, a multispecific molecule has at least one target binding site specific for a molecule targeted for reduction or elimination and at least one binding site specific for a drug. In yet another embodiment, a multispecific molecule has at least one binding site specific for a molecule targeted for reduction or elimination and at least one binding site specific for a prodrug.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a multispecific molecule comprises one specificity for a soluble molecule and one specificity for a cell surface molecule. In another embodiment, a multispecific molecule has two binding specificities for two targets present on one or more soluble molecules. In another embodiment, a multispecific molecule has two binding specificities for two targets present on one or more cell surface molecules (which may be present on one or more cells).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the binding molecules have at least one target binding site specific for a molecule which mediates a biological effect (e.g., which modulates cellular activation (e.g., by binding to a cell surface receptor and resulting in transmission or inhibition of an activating or inhibitory signal), which results in death of the cell (e.g., by a cell signal induced pathway, by complement fixation or exposure to a payload present on the binding molecule), or which modulates a disease or disorder in a subject (e.g., by mediating or promoting cell killing, by promoting lysis of a fibrin clot or promoting clot formation, or by modulating the amount of a substance which is bioavailable (e.g., by enhancing or reducing the amount of a ligand such as TNFα in the subject)).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention bind at least one target that transduces a signal to a cell, e.g., by binding to a cell surface receptor, such as a TNF family receptor. By “transduces a signal” it is meant that by binding to the cell, the binding molecule converts the extracellular influence on the cell surface receptor into a cellular response, e.g., by modulating a signal transduction pathway.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the binding molecules bind at least one target binding site specific for a molecule targeted for reduction or elimination, e.g., a cell surface antigen or a soluble antigen. In one embodiment, the binding of the binding molecule to the target results in reduction or elimination of the target, e.g., from a tissue or from the circulation. In another embodiment, the binding molecules have at least one binding site specific for a molecule that can be used to detect the presence of a target molecule (e.g., to detect a contaminant or diagnose a condition or disorder). In yet another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one binding site that targets the binding molecule to a specific site in a subject (e.g., to a tumor cell or blood clot).\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, a multispecific molecule is a tetravalent antibody that has four binding sites. A tetravalent molecule may be bispecific and bivalent for each specificity. Further description of exemplary bispecific molecules is provided below.\n\n\nPreferred binding molecules of the invention comprise framework and constant region amino acid sequences derived from a human amino acid sequence. However, binding polypeptides may comprise framework and/or constant region sequences derived from another mammalian species. For example, binding molecules comprising murine sequences may be appropriate for certain applications. In one embodiment, a primate framework region (e.g., non-human primate), heavy chain portion, and/or hinge portion may be included in the subject binding molecules. In one embodiment, one or more murine amino acids may be present in the framework region of a binding polypeptide, e.g., a human or non-human primate framework amino acid sequence may comprise one or more amino acid back mutations in which the corresponding murine amino acid residue is present and/or may comprise one or mutations to a different amino acid residue not found in the starting murine antibody. Preferred binding molecules of the invention are less immunogenic than murine antibodies.\n\n\nA “fusion” or chimeric protein comprises a first amino acid sequence linked to a second amino acid sequence with which it is not naturally linked in nature. The amino acid sequences may normally exist in separate proteins that are brought together in the fusion polypeptide or they may normally exist in the same protein but are placed in a new arrangement in the fusion polypeptide. A fusion protein may be created, for example, by chemical synthesis, or by creating and translating a polynucleotide in which the peptide regions are encoded in the desired relationship.\n\n\nThe term “heterologous” as applied to a polynucleotide or a polypeptide, means that the polynucleotide or polypeptide is derived from a genotypically distinct entity from that of the entity to which it is being compared. For instance, a heterologous polynucleotide or antigen may be derived from a different species, different cell type of an individual, or the same or different type of cell of distinct individuals.\n\n\nThe term “ligand binding domain” or “ligand binding portion” as used herein refers to any native receptor (e.g., cell surface receptor) or any region or derivative thereof retaining at least a qualitative ligand binding ability, and preferably the biological activity of a corresponding native receptor.\n\n\nThe term “receptor binding domain” or “receptor binding portion” as used herein refers to any native ligand or any region or derivative thereof retaining at least a qualitative receptor binding ability, and preferably the biological activity of a corresponding native ligand.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention are stabilized “antibody” or “immunoglobulin” molecules, e.g., naturally occurring antibody or immunoglobulin molecules (or an antigen binding fragment thereof) or genetically engineered antibody molecules that bind antigen in a manner similar to antibody molecules and that comprise an scFv molecule of the invention. As used herein, the term “immunoglobulin” includes a polypeptide having a combination of two heavy and two light chains whether or not it possesses any relevant specific immunoreactivity. “Antibodies” refers to such assemblies which have significant known specific immunoreactive activity to an antigen of interest (e.g. a tumor associated antigen). Antibodies and immunoglobulins comprise light and heavy chains, with or without an interchain covalent linkage between them. Basic immunoglobulin structures in vertebrate systems are relatively well understood.\n\n\nAs will be discussed in more detail below, the generic term “immunoglobulin” comprises five distinct classes of that can be distinguished biochemically. All five classes of antibodies are within the scope of the present invention, the following discussion will generally be directed to the IgG class of immunoglobulin molecules. With regard to IgG, immunoglobulins comprise two identical light polypeptide chains of molecular weight approximately 23,000 Daltons, and two identical heavy chains of molecular weight 53,000-70,000. The four chains are joined by disulfide bonds in a “Y” configuration wherein the light chains bracket the heavy chains starting at the mouth of the “Y” and continuing through the variable region.\n\n\nBoth the light and heavy chains are divided into regions of structural and functional homology. The terms “constant” and “variable” are used functionally. In this regard, it will be appreciated that the variable domains of both the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chain portions determine antigen recognition and specificity. Conversely, the constant domains of the light chain (CL) and the heavy chain (CH\n1\n, CH\n2 \nor CH\n3\n) confer important biological properties such as secretion, transplacental mobility, Fc receptor binding, complement binding, and the like. By convention the numbering of the constant region domains increases as they become more distal from the antigen binding site or amino-terminus of the antibody. The N-terminus is a variable region and at the C-terminus is a constant region; the CH\n3 \nand CL domains actually comprise the carboxy-terminus of the heavy and light chain, respectively.\n\n\nStabilizing mutations to scFv molecules may be made to amino acids in the CDR and/or in the framework regions of an scFv variable heavy and/or variable light change. As used herein the term “variable region CDR amino acid residues” includes amino acids in a CDR or complementarity determining region as identified using sequence or structure based methods. As used herein, the term “CDR” or “complementarity determining region” means the noncontiguous antigen combining sites found within the variable region of both heavy and light chain polypeptides. These particular regions have been described by Kabat et al., J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6609-6616 (1977) and Kabat et al., Sequences of protein of immunological interest. (1991), and by Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987) and by MacCallum et al., J. Mol. Biol. 262:732-745 (1996) where the definitions include overlapping or subsets of amino acid residues when compared against each other. The amino acid residues which encompass the CDRs as defined by each of the above cited references are set forth for comparison. Preferably, the term “CDR” is a CDR as defined by Kabat based on sequence comparisons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDR Definitions\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKabat\n1\n \n\n\nChothia\n2\n \n\n\nMacCallum\n3\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nH \nCDR1\n\n\n31-35\n\n\n26-32\n\n\n30-35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nH \nCDR2\n\n\n50-65\n\n\n53-55\n\n\n47-58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nH \nCDR3\n\n\n 95-102\n\n\n 96-101\n\n\n 93-101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nL \nCDR1\n\n\n24-34\n\n\n26-32\n\n\n30-36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nL \nCDR2\n\n\n50-56\n\n\n50-52\n\n\n46-55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nL \nCDR3\n\n\n89-97\n\n\n91-96\n\n\n89-96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n1\nResidue numbering follows the nomenclature of Kabat et al., supra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n2\nResidue numbering follows the nomenclature of Chothia et al., supra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n3\nResidue numbering follows the nomenclature of MacCallum et al., supra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs used herein the term “variable region framework (FR) amino acid residues” refers to those amino acids in the framework region of an Ig chain. The term “framework region” or “FR region” as used herein, includes the amino acid residues that are part of the variable region, but are not part of the CDRs (e.g., using the Kabat definition of CDRs). Therefore, a variable region framework is between about 100-120 amino acids in length but includes only those amino acids outside of the CDRs. For the specific example of a heavy chain variable region and for the CDRs as defined by Kabat et al., \nframework region\n 1 corresponds to the domain of the variable region encompassing amino acids 1-30; \nframework region\n 2 corresponds to the domain of the variable region encompassing amino acids 36-49; \nframework region\n 3 corresponds to the domain of the variable region encompassing amino acids 66-94, and \nframework region\n 4 corresponds to the domain of the variable region from \namino acids\n 103 to the end of the variable region. The framework regions for the light chain are similarly separated by each of the light chain variable region CDRs. Similarly, using the definition of CDRs by Chothia et al. or McCallum et al. the framework region boundaries are separated by the respective CDR termini as described above. In preferred embodiments, the CDRs are as defined by Kabat.\n\n\nIn naturally occurring antibodies, the six CDRs present on each monomeric antibody are short, non-contiguous sequences of amino acids that are specifically positioned to form the antigen binding site as the antibody assumes its three dimensional configuration in an aqueous environment. The remainder of the heavy and light variable domains show less inter-molecular variability in amino acid sequence and are termed the framework regions. The framework regions largely adopt a β-sheet conformation and the CDRs form loops which connect, and in some cases form part of, the β-sheet structure. Thus, these framework regions act to form a scaffold that provides for positioning the six CDRs in correct orientation by inter-chain, non-covalent interactions. The antigen binding site formed by the positioned CDRs defines a surface complementary to the epitope on the immunoreactive antigen. This complementary surface promotes the non-covalent binding of the antibody to the immunoreactive antigen epitope. The position of CDRs can be readily identified by one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nAs previously indicated, the subunit structures and three dimensional configuration of the constant regions of the various immunoglobulin classes are well known. As used herein, the term “VH domain” includes the amino terminal variable domain of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. As used herein, the term “VL domain” includes the amino terminal variable domain of an immunoglobulin light chain.\n\n\nThe term “fragment” refers to a part or portion of a polypeptide (e.g., an antibody or an antibody chain) comprising fewer amino acid residues than an intact or complete polypeptide. The term “antigen-binding fragment” refers to a polypeptide fragment of an immunoglobulin or antibody that binds antigen or competes with intact antibody (i.e., with the intact antibody from which they were derived) for antigen binding (i.e., specific binding). As used herein, the term “fragment” of an antibody molecule includes antigen-binding fragments of antibodies, for example, an antibody light chain (VL), an antibody heavy chain (VH), a single chain antibody (scFv), a F(ab′)2 fragment, a Fab fragment, an Fd fragment, an Fv fragment, and a single domain antibody fragment (DAb). Fragments can be obtained, e.g., via chemical or enzymatic treatment of an intact or complete antibody or antibody chain or by recombinant means.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “binding site” comprises a region of a polypeptide which is responsible for selectively binding to a target molecule of interest (e.g. an antigen, ligand, receptor, substrate or inhibitor). Binding domains comprise at least one target binding site. Exemplary binding domains include an antibody variable domain, a receptor binding domain of a ligand, a ligand binding domain of a receptor or an enzymatic domain.\n\n\nBinding molecules of the invention can be made using techniques that are known in the art. In one embodiment, the polypeptides of the invention are “recombinantly produced,” i.e., are produced using recombinant DNA technology. Exemplary techniques for making such molecules are discussed in more detail below.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is a naturally occurring antibody to which a stabilized scFv molecule has been fused. In one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is a modified antibody to which a stabilized scFv molecule has been fused. As used herein, the term “modified antibody” includes synthetic forms of antibodies which are altered such that they are not naturally occurring. In another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is a fusion protein comprising at least one scFv molecule.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, a polypeptide of the invention will not elicit a deleterious immune response in a human.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises a constant region, e.g., a heavy chain constant region. In one embodiment, such a constant region is modified compared to a wild-type constant region. That is, the polypeptides of the invention disclosed herein may comprise alterations or modifications to one or more of the three heavy chain constant domains (CH1, CH2 or CH3) and/or to the light chain constant region domain (CL). Exemplary modifications include additions, deletions or substitutions of one or more amino acids in one or more domains. Such changes may be included to optimize effector function, half-life, etc.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “malignancy” refers to a non-benign tumor or a cancer. As used herein, the term “cancer” includes a malignancy characterized by deregulated or uncontrolled cell growth. Exemplary cancers include: carcinomas, sarcomas, leukemias, and lymphomas. The term “cancer” includes primary malignant tumors (e.g., those whose cells have not migrated to sites in the subject's body other than the site of the original tumor) and secondary malignant tumors (e.g., those arising from metastasis, the migration of tumor cells to secondary sites that are different from the site of the original tumor).\n\n\nAs used herein the term “engineered” includes manipulation of nucleic acid or polypeptide molecules by synthetic means (e.g. by recombinant techniques, in vitro peptide synthesis, by enzymatic or chemical coupling of peptides or some combination of these techniques). Preferably, the binding molecules of the invention are made using such methods.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “linked,” “fused” or “fusion” are used interchangeably. These terms refer to the joining together of two more elements or components, by whatever means including chemical conjugation or recombinant means. Preferably the polypeptides which are fused are genetically fused, i.e., are fused using recombinant DNA technology. An “in-frame fusion” refers to the joining of two or more open reading frames (ORFs) to form a continuous longer ORF, in a manner that maintains the correct reading frame of the original ORFs. Thus, the resulting fusion protein is a single protein containing two ore more segments that correspond to polypeptides encoded by the original ORFs (which segments are not normally so joined in nature.) Although the reading frame is thus made continuous throughout the fused segments, the segments may be physically or spatially separated by, for example, in-frame scFv linker sequence.\n\n\nIn the context of polypeptides, a “linear sequence” or a “sequence” is an order of amino acids in a polypeptide in an amino to carboxyl terminal direction in which residues that neighbor each other in the sequence are contiguous in the primary structure of the polypeptide.\n\n\nAs used herein, the phrase “subject that would benefit from administration of a binding molecule” includes subjects, such as mammalian subjects, that would benefit from administration of a binding molecule used, e.g., for detection of an antigen recognized by a binding molecule (e.g., for a diagnostic procedure) and/or from treatment with a binding molecule to reduce or eliminate the target recognized by the binding molecule. For example, in one embodiment, the subject may benefit from reduction or elimination of a soluble or particulate molecule from the circulation or serum (e.g., a toxin or pathogen) or from reduction or elimination of a population of cells expressing the target (e.g., tumor cells). As described in more detail herein, the binding molecule can be used in unconjugated form or can be conjugated, e.g., to a detectable moiety, a drug, prodrug, or an isotope.\n\n\nThe term “TNF receptor” or “TNF receptor family member” refers to any receptor belonging to the Tumor Necrosis Factor (“TNF”) superfamily of receptors. Members of the TNF Receptor Superfamily (“TNFRSF”) are characterized by an extracellular region with two or more cysteine-rich domains (˜40 amino acids each) arranged as cysteine knots (see Dempsey et al., \nCytokine Growth Factor Rev\n. (2003). 14(3-4):193-209). Upon binding their cognate TNF ligands, TNF receptors transduce signals by interacting directly or indirectly with cytoplasmic adapter proteins known as TRAFs (TNF receptor associate factors). TRAFs can induce the activation of several kinase cascades that ultimately lead to the activation of signal transduction pathways such as NF-KappaB, JNK, ERK, p38 and PI3K, which in turn regulate cellular processes ranging from immune function and tissue differentiation to apoptosis.\n\n\nThe nucleotide and amino acid sequences of several TNF receptors family members are known in the art and include at least 29 human genes: TNFRSF1A (TNFR1, also known as DR1, CD120a, TNF-R-I p55, TNF-R, TNFR1, TNFAR, TNF-R55, p55TNFR, p55R, or TNFR60, GenBank GI No. 4507575; see also U.S. Pat.

TNF ligands bind to distinct receptors of the TNF receptor superfamily and exhibit 15-25% amino acid sequence homology with each other (Gaur et al., \nBiochem. Pharmacol\n. (2003), 66(8):1403-8). The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of several TNF Receptor (Ligand) Superfamily (“TNFSF”) members are known in the art and include at least 16 human genes: TNFSF1 (also known as Lymphotoxin-α (LTA), TNFβ or LT, GI No.: 34444 and 6806893), TNFSF2 (also known as TNF, TNFα, or DIF; GI No. 25952111), TNFSF3 (also known as Lymphotoxin-β (LTB), TNFC, or p33), TNFSF4 (also known as OX-40L, gp34, CD134L, or tax-transcriptionally activated glycoprotein 1, 34 kD (TXGP1); GI No. 4507603), TNFSF5 (also known as CD40LG, IMD3, HIGM1, CD40L, hCD40L, TRAP, CD154, or gp39; GI No. 4557433), TNFSF6 (also known as FasL or APT1LG1; GenBank GI No. 4557329), TNFSF7 (also known as CD70, CD27L, or CD27LG; GI No. 4507605), TNFSF8 (also known as CD30LG, CD30L, or CD153; GI No. 4507607), TNFSF9 (also known as 4-1BB-L or ILA ligand; GI No. 4507609), TNFSF10 (also known as TRAIL, Apo-2L, or TL2; GI No. 4507593), TNFSF11 (also known as TRANCE, RANKL, OPGL, or ODF; GI Nos. 4507595 and 14790152), TNFSF12 (also known as Fn14L, TWEAK, DR3LG, or APO3L; GI Nos. 4507597 and 23510441), TNFSF13 (also known as APRIL), TNFSF14 (also known as LIGHT, LTg, or HVEM-L; GI Nos. 25952144 and 25952147), TNFSF15 (also known as TL1 or VEGI), or TNFSF16 (also known as AITRL, TL6, hGITRL, or GITRL; GI No. 4827034). Other TNF ligand family members include EDAR1 & XEDAR ligand (ED1; GI No. 4503449; Monreal et al. (1998) \nAm J Hum Genet. \n63:380), Troy/Trade ligand, BAFF (also known as TALL1; GI No. 5730097), and NGF ligands (e.g. NGF-β (GI No. 4505391), NGF-2/NTF3; GI No. 4505469), NTF5 (GI No. 5453808)), BDNF (GI Nos. 25306267, 25306235, 25306253, 25306257, 25306261, 25306264; IFRD1 (GI No. 4504607)).\n\n\nThe term “Tm”, also referred to as the “transition temperature”, is the temperature at which 50% of a macromolecule, e.g., binding molecule, becomes denatured, and is considered to be the standard parameter for describing the thermal stability of a protein.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “scaffolding residue” refers to amino acid residues or residue positions that are not in an interface (e.g., the VH/VL interface) but that are important in maintaining the interface. These amino acid residues do not physically interact with the interface residues on the opposing domain or contribute surface area to the interface, but are nonetheless important for providing proper structural context for interface residues. Such amino acid residues scaffold the interaction between VH and VL.\n\n\nTwo or more amino acid residue positions within a candidate polypeptide sequence that normally occur together are said to “covary” (“covarying residue positions” or “covariant residue positions”). Covariance between two or more amino acid positions is observed when the type of amino acid found at a first amino acid position is dependent on the type of amino acid found at another amino acid position. That is, when one particular amino acid is found at a first position within a sequence, a second particular amino acid is usually found at a second position within the sequence.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “Ig fold” includes a protein domain found in proteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins. As is well known in the art, the Ig fold is a distinguishing feature of the immunoglobulin superfamily (see, e.g. Bork, P., Holm, L. & Sander, C. 1994. The Immunoglobulin Fold. \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n242, 309-320). Representative structures for each class of Ig fold are depicted in \nFIG. 73\n.\n\n\nII. Stabilized scFv Molecules\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is a stabilized scFv molecule. The stabilized scFv molecules of the invention may comprise an scFv linker interposed between a V\nH \ndomain and a V\nL \ndomain, wherein the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains are linked by a disulfide bond between an amino acid in the V\nH \nand an amino acid in the V\nL \ndomain. In other embodiments, the stabilized scFv molecules of the invention comprise an scFv linker having an optimized length or composition. In yet other embodiments, the stabilized scFv molecules of the invention comprise a V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomain having at least one stabilizing amino acid substitution(s). In yet another embodiment, a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention comprises at least two of the above listed stabilizing features.\n\n\nThe stabilized scFv molecules of the invention have improved stability.

In another embodiment, populations of the stabilized scFv molecules of the invention have VH and VL domains with Tm-values greater than 55° C. In another embodiment, populations of the stabilized scFv molecules of the invention have a T50 of greater than 49° C. In another embodiment, populations of the stabilized scFv molecules of the invention have a T50 of greater than 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, or 48° C. In yet another embodiment, populations of the stabilized scFv molecules of the invention have a T50 of greater than 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, or 49° C.\n\n\nThe scFv molecules of the invention bind to a target molecule of interest. The VH and VL domains used to make an scFv may be derived from the same or from different antibodies. In another embodiment, a VH or VL for use in a stabilized scFv of the invention may comprise one or more CDRs which bind to a target of interest, while the remainder of the VH or VL domain is derived from a different antibody or is synthetic. In a preferred embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one CDR of an antibody, e.g., an antibody known in the art to bind to a target of interest. In another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises at least two CDRs of a given antibody. In another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises at least three CDRs of a given antibody. In another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises at least four CDRs of a given antibody. In another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises at least five CDRs of a given antibody. In another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises at least six CDRs of a given antibody. In a preferred embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one VH domain of an antibody, e.g., an antibody known in the art to bind to a target of interest. In a preferred embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one VL domain of a given antibody. In another preferred embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one VH domain and one VL domain of an antibody known in the art to bind a target of interest. scFv molecules can be constructed in a VH-linker-VL orientation or VL-linker-VH orientation.\n\n\nThe stability of scFv molecules of the invention or fusion proteins comprising them can be evaluated in reference to the biophysical properties (e.g., thermal stability) of a conventional (non-stabilized) scFv molecule or a binding molecule comprising a conventional scFv molecule. In one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention have a thermal stability that is greater than about 0.1, about 0.25, about 0.5, about 0.75, about 1, about 1.25, about 1.5, about 1.75, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, about 6, about 7, about 8, about 9, or about 10 degrees Celsius than a control binding molecule (eg. a conventional scFv molecule). Stabilized scFv molecules of the invention include those identified using methods of the invention as described in Section VIII infra.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the stabilized scFv molecules of the invention comprise an scFv linker with an optimized length and/or amino acid composition. Preferred scFv linkers of the invention improve the thermal stability of a binding molecule of the invention by at least about 2° C. or 3° C. as compared to a conventional binding molecule.

Methods for Predicting/Determining Protein Stability\n\n\nIn certain aspects, the invention provides methods for predicting, a priori, potentional biophysical problems with proteins selected for large-scale expression, e.g. therapeutic proteins or industrial enzymes. In certain exemplary aspects, the methods of the invention allow one skilled in the art to avoid expressing protein sequences that are predicted to have inherently poor stability when recombinantly expressed, for example, in mammalian cells. In alternative aspects, the methods of the invention may be employed to identify a variant of a protein sequence that is predicted to have improved biophysical properties, including, but not limited to improved stability, improved stability to changes in pH, and enhanced biochemical function.\n\n\nIn certain aspects, the invention provides computational methods for predicting a biophysical property of (e.g., thermal stability) a candidate proteins, or a sequence variant or homolog thereof, based on the polypeptide sequence (e.g. amino acid sequence) of the candidate protein. In other aspects, the methods of the invention employ structural modeling to predict the stability of the candidate protein or to identify homologs or variants of the candidate protein with known exemplary stability that can be used to improve the stability of a candidate protein, e.g., an scFv molecule.\n\n\na. Covariation Analysis\n\n\nIn certain exemplary aspects, the invention provides an improved computational method termed “covariation analysis” for predicting a biophysical property (e.g. protein stability). As used herein, “covariation analysis” refers to a computational method for identifying two or more amino acid residue positions within a candidate polypeptide sequence that normally occur together, or covary, in homologs of the candidate sequence (herein “covarying residue positions” or “covariant residue positions”). Covariance between two or more amino acid positions is observed when the type of amino acid found at a first amino acid position is dependent on the type of amino acid found at another amino acid position. That is, when one particular amino acid is found at a first position within a sequence, a second particular amino acid is usually found at a second position within the sequence.\n\n\nSince covariant residues are likely to have coevolved, an observation of covariation indicates that the compatibility of amino acid residues residing at normally covarying positions is likely to be important for functional or structural reasons. Accordingly, the covariation method of the invention can be used to identify one or more covarying residues or groups of residues (e.g. covarying residue pairs) within a polypeptide sequence (e.g. a candidate polypeptide sequence). As used herein, a “covarying residue” (also termed a “linked residue”) is an amino acid which is statistically prevalent at a covarying residue position within a polypeptide sequence.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the covariation methods of the invention can be used to identify important functional residues in a candidate sequence. Moreover, since the number of covarying residues within a candidate polypeptide is predictive of its stability, the covariation method of the invention can be used to predict the stability candidate protein.\n\n\nIn other certain embodiments, the covariation methods of the invention can be employed to guide successful protein designs. In one exemplary embodiment, the covariation method of the invention can be used to identify covarying amino acids within a candidate sequence. If present, the covarying residues are preferably retained during subsequent engineering of the protein sequence. In another exemplary embodiment, the covariation methods of the invention can be used to identify the amino acid positions of non-covarying residues within a candidate polypeptide sequence wherein corresponding amino acids in other proteins (e.g., proteins corresponding to the sequences of a reference set) are normally covarying amino acids. Once identified, non-covarying residues can be substituted (e.g. using recombinant DNA methodology) with corresponding covarying residues to enhance function or improve the biophysical properties (e.g., stability) of the candidate polypeptide sequence.\n\n\nCovariant residue positions may be identified by a statistical analysis (e.g., a correlation analysis) of residue positions within a database of related polypeptide sequences (e.g., an aligned reference set or multiple sequence alignment). In preferred embodiments, the covariation analysis involves a statistical comparison of candidate polypeptide sequences against a curated database of diverse polypeptide sequences having the same structural fold (e.g. an Ig fold).\n\n\nIn the novel covariation analysis described herein, the following basic steps are taken to predict the stability of a candidate polypeptide:\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Providing a set of homologous sequences (herein, a “reference set”) corresponding to a sequence of a candidate polypeptide or a domain or portion thereof (herein a “test domain sequence”).\n \n2. Aligning the sequences of the reference set to generate an aligned set of homologous sequence (herein, an “aligned set).\n \n3. Determining covariation between two or more residue positions (e.g. at least one pair of amino acids) within the reference set to generate covariation data or a set of covariation data (“covariation dataset”).\n \n4. Using the covariation data to predict the stability of the candidate polypeptide.\n \n \n \n\n\nStep 1: Providing a Reference Set\n\n\nThe covariation methods of the invention employ a set of sequences (a “reference set”) which are homologous to (i.e., related to) a sequence of interest or “test sequence”. The reference set may comprise a set of homologous sequences having moderate to high degrees of similarity with the test sequence. In certain embodiments, the homologous sequences of the reference set have a moderate to high degree of amino acid sequence similarity. In more preferred embodiments, the homologous sequences of the reference set have a moderate to high degree of structural similarity. In still more preferred embodiments, the homologous sequences of the reference set have a high degree of structural similarity (e.g. they share at least one protein domain or fold). The set of homologous sequences need not be large, as long as a reasonably unbiased selection is obtained.\n\n\nIn exemplary embodiments, the covariation method of the invention employs a curated reference set. As used herein, the term “curated reference set” refers to a reference set in which component sequences have been deleted or additional sequences added according to certain selection criteria. Accordingly, whereas a non-curated reference is generated by unbiased selection of component sequences, a curated database is generated by biased selection. For example, the reference set of homologous sequences may be culled to eliminate certain sequences, e.g. redundant sequence. Alternatively, a curated database may be expanded, e.g. to include a suitable number of non-redundant or non-identical sequences.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the curated database comprises at least one hundred sequences (e.g. 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 750, or more sequences). In one embodiment, the curated database comprises at least one thousand sequences (e.g. 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, or more sequences). In another embodiment, the curated database comprises at least ten thousand sequences (e.g., 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, 100,000, 250,000, 500,000, 750,000 or more sequence. In one embodiment the curated database comprises at least 1 million individual sequences (e.g., 1 million, 2 million, 5 million, 10 million, or more sequences).\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, the covariation method of the invention employs a curated reference set having at least 50% diversity (e.g. at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95% diversity, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or more diversity) in order to minimize artificial or non-informative covariations. As used herein, the term “% diversity” refers to the percentage of sequences in the reference set that are non-redundant or non-identical. As used herein, the term “non-redundant” refers to a sequence which has less than 100% sequence identity with every other sequence in the reference set, i.e., a sequence which differs at least in one amino acid position from every other sequence in the reference set. In certain embodiments, a sequence of the reference set has less than 99%, less than 95%, less than 90%, or less than 85% sequence identity with every other sequence in the reference set. In preferred embodiments, a sequence of the reference set has less than 80% sequence identity with every other sequence in the reference set (e.g. less than 75%, less than 70%, less than 65%, less than 60%, or less than 50% sequence identity). In particularly preferred embodiments, every sequence of the reference set has less than than 80% sequence identity with every other sequence in the reference set. In exemplary embodiments, the sequences of the reference set are curated for the preferred diversity using a filtering tool which culls sequences containing more common sequence types (e.g., a Henikoff sorting tool). When two sequences are equal in length, sorting by Henikoff weight ensures that sequences with rare residue types are retained while sequences with more common residue types are discarded (Henikoff et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n243: 574-578 (1994)).\n\n\nIn other preferred embodiments, the reference set comprises sequences encoded by genes which are not evolutionarly close to genes encoding other sequences in the database. For example, to increase diversity, the reference set may comprise one or more ortholog sequences, that is a sequence which is from a different species (e.g., different mammalian species)) but which has the same or similar biochemical function. In one exemplary embodiment, the reference set may comprise one human sequence and at least one non-human sequence (e.g., a non-human mammalian sequence). In another exemplary embodiment, the reference set may comprise at least one sequence for a mammalian species (e.g., a human, chimpanzee, dog, cow, pig, cat, rat, or mouse) and at least one non-mammalian sequence (e.g. a non-mammalian vertebrate sequence (e.g., a teleost or avian sequence), an invertebrate sequence (e.g., an insect (e.g., \nDrosophila\n) or nematode (e.g., \nC. elegans\n) sequence), or a fungal, plant, bacterial, or virus sequence). In other embodiments, the reference set may comprise one or more paralog sequences, that is sequences from the same species as a first sequence, but which has the same or similar biochemical function.\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the sequences of the reference set are above a certain threshold length. Preferably, the sequences of the reference set are at least 20 residues in length (e.g., 25, 30, or 40 residues in length). More preferably, the sequences of the reference set are at least 50 residues in length (e.g., 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, or 95 residues in length). Still more preferred are sequences of at least 100 residues in length (e.g., 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, or more residues in length). In exemplary embodiments, the sequences of the reference set are curated for the preferred length by filtering using a filtering tool (e.g., a non-gap residue count). Ranking by decreasing non-gap residue count ensures that shorter sequences (e.g., gapped sequences) are filtered out over longer ones.\n\n\nThe sequences can be obtained through sequence-based homology searches for any of the sequence databases known in the art (e.g. NCBI, TIGR databases). In an exemplary embodiment, a standard BLAST search with default parameters may be performed with the test sequence to retrieve homologous sequences of interest. Sequences with a minimum percentage of sequence identity (e.g. greater than 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% sequence identity, preferably greater than 30% sequence identity) to the test sequence may be selected for inclusion in the reference set.\n\n\nIn certain preferred embodiments, the reference set is curated to comprise sequences from proteins having the same class of protein fold (e.g., proteins having SH3, TPR, GPCR, serine protease, aspartyl protease, globin, immunoglobulin, or other folds). Such proteins or structures may be identified and collected by bioinformatics techniques known in the art (e.g., be structure-based searching using the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) of the National Institutes of Health), or by searching the ASTRAL database or the RCSB protein database (PDB) using a desired SCOP classification). Preferably, the sequences are derived from proteins whose 3-dimensional structures have been solved at high resolution, for example, by X-ray crystallography.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, sequences corresponding to collected structures are filtered using art-recognized techniques to remove erroneously categorized, incomplete, redundant, or domain-swapped structures. In one embodiment, the structures are visually inspected (e.g., using the SwissPDB Viewer) for breaks in the corresponding sequence due to unresolved densities or domain swapping. The PDB files of faulty structures are manually removed from the corresponding set of structures. In another embodiment, sequences (e.g. FASTA sequences) corresponding to the collected structures are filtered to remove any sequences that are 100% identical, or perfect match substrings of remaining sequences. In yet other embodiments, PDB structures with aberrantly long or short amino acid sequences (a hallmark of erroneous structural categorization) are culled from the structure datasets. The length cutoff criteria may be determined, for example, by examining a histogram of all sequence lengths of sequences of the reference set. In still other embodiments, the structures are visually inspected (e.g., using the Swiss PDB viewer) for misfolding. Any structures that do not conform with the standard topology of the protein fold are preferably discarded.\n\n\nIn exemplary embodiments, the curated reference set comprises sequences corresponding to an immunoglobulin-type fold (“Ig fold”) of a protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins. As is well known in the art, the Ig fold is a distinguishing feature of the immunoglobulin superfamily (see, e.g. Bork, P., Holm, L. & Sander, C. 1994. The Immunoglobulin Fold. \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n242, 309-320). The Ig fold appears often in mammalian proteins and serves as a platform for various functions—particularly protein-protein interactions. For example, all immunoglobulins and most immunoglobulin receptors are composed of multiple Ig-fold domains. Ig folds may be subdivided into several subfamilies including C1, C2, I, and V. Although members of all the subfamilies comprise a two-β sheet, greek-key topology, these subfamilies differ by the number of β-strands on each sheet and by the connections across β-sheets (see, e.g., A F Williams, \nImmunology Today, \n8, (1987)). Representative structures for each class of Ig fold are depicted in \nFIG. 73\n.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the reference set comprises an Ig-fold sequence of an immunoglobulin superfamily protein selected from the group consisting of a cell adhesion protein, a integrin, an allergen, a T-cell receptor, a major histocompatibility complex protein (e.g., a MHC Class I or MHC Class II protein), an immunoglobulin receptor (e.g., an Fc gamma receptor (e.g. FcγRI, FcγRIIa)), and an immunoglobulin (e.g., an IgG, IgM, IgA, or IgE immunoglobulin).\n\n\nIn certain preferred embodiments, all of the sequences of the reference set correspond to an Ig-fold or portion thereof. In one embodiment, the Ig-fold is a C1 fold. In another embodiment, the Ig-fold is a C2-fold. In another embodiment, the Ig-fold is a V-fold. In yet another embodiment, the Ig-fold is an I-fold. In another embodiment, all of the sequences of the reference set correspond to a C1 fold. In another embodiment, all of the sequences of the reference set correspond to a C2-fold. In another embodiment, all of the sequences of the reference set correspond to an I-fold. In certain preferred embodiments, the sequences of Ig-fold reference set are within about 75 to about 150 residues in length.\n\n\nStep 2: Aligning the Reference Set\n\n\nIn the second step, the sequences of the reference set are precisely aligned to generate an aligned set of sequences (or alignment). In one embodiment, the sequences of the reference set are aligned using sequence alignment algorithms (e.g. LALIGN or BLAST and other art-recognized alignments described supra) to create an aligned set of sequences (herein a “sequence-based sequence alignment”). In another embodiment, structures corresponding to the sequences of the reference set are aligned using a structural alignment algorithm (e.g. Secondary Structure Matching (SSM) using the Schrödinger structalign package) to create an aligned set of structures (herein, a “structure alignment”). Preferably, the structure alignment algorithm ensures that core regions (e.g., β strands) of each structure are aligned, instead of intervening loops. In yet another embodiment, the sequences of the reference set are aligned by structure-based methods (e.g., by matching amino acids from one superimposed structure to that of another superimposed structure based on the shortest distance between the α-carbons of the polypeptide backbones, e.g., using the Schrödinger package).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the sequences of the reference set are aligned using both sequence-based and structure-based alignment algorithms. Preferably, the structures corresponding to the sequences of the reference set are first aligned using a structure-based alignment algorithm or other structure-guided alignment tools, followed by alignment of the corresponding sequences with a sequence-based algorithm. More preferably, the structures corresponding to the sequences of the reference set are first aligned, followed by alignment of the sequences using a structure-based sequence alignment.\n\n\nIn certain optional embodiments, the aligned set of sequences is further curated. For example, the aligned set of sequences can be expanded (e.g., by non-gap sorting or by Henikoff sorting) to increase its diversity (e.g., to obtain very large sets of homolgous sequences having the same fold). In other embodiments, the aligned set of sequences can be further subjected to several rounds of curation and, optionally, further alignment (e.g. structure-based alignment).\n\n\nIn certain preferred embodiments, the invention provides methods for curating an aligned set containing a relatively small number of sequences in order to enhance its diversity. By increasing the number of sequence in the alignment, the robustness of the covariation analysis is increased. In one embodiment, the methods may employ a heuristically-derived model or profile to search for additional homologous sequences from a large, publically-available, sequence database (e.g., the NR database maintained by the NCBI). The heuristically-derived models may be produced using one or more regression-based algorithms selected from, e.g., a partial least squares regression, a multiple linear regression, an inverse least squares regression, a principal component regression, a variable importance for projection, or the like. In other embodiments, the heuristically-derived model is produced using one or more pattern-based algorithm selected from, e.g., a Hidden Markov model, a Smith Waterman algorithm, neural network, a classification and regression tree, a multivariate adaptive regression spline, or the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the pattern recognition algorithm is a Hidden Markov Model. An HMM is a statistical model where the system being modeled contains hidden parameters which can be extracted using observable parameters and employed for analysis of pattern recognition. For example, art-recognized HMMs may employ predicted secondary structures to search for antibodies of the same fold as a given antibody, rather than antibodies having purely sequence-based relatedness (see e.g., \nProteins \n36(1), 68-76). MetaFam (Silverstein et al. \nNucleic Acids Res \n29(1), 49-51 (2001)), Interpro (Apweiler, et al., \nNucleic Acids Res, \n29(1), 37-40, (2001)), and HMMER (Bateman et al, \nNucleic Acids Res \n27(1), 260-2 (1999)) are exemplary HMM-based pattern recognition tools.\n\n\nIn certain additional embodiments, sequences extracted with a HMM algorithm may be validated for their proper structural class assignment using art-recognized bioinformatics software. An exemplary validation tool is the PFAM classification tool maintained by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and is publicly available on the internet. For example, the PFAM tool ‘pfamverify’ may be applied to each extracted sequence to confirm that it was correctly classified by the class-specific HMM created from the structure-based structure alignment (Finn et al., \nNucleic Acids Res, \n24 (Database issue), D247-51, (2006). HMM profiles corresponding to a PFAM clan (or related family of proteins, e.g. an Ig-fold clan) may be downloaded from the PFAM website to facilitate scoring of the extracted sequences. Extracted sequences whose scores lay below a recommended cutoff are preferably removed from the reference set.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, sequences extracted with the HMM algorithm may also be aligned using the HMMC algorithm. Since these HMM algorithms are based upon careful structural alignments, this process insures the structure guided alignment of the additional extracted sequences. For example, the HMMER package may be utilized to generate ‘mapali’ alignments in FASTA output format.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, the method of the invention provides a novel HMM which not only finds sequences similar to those of the aligned set, but aligns the new sequences to insure the correct core region alignment. For example, the novel HMM algorithm of the invention can search for separate domains (e.g., Ig-fold domains) within a single protein (e.g., an immunoglobulin superfamily member), extract each domain separately, and add it to the aligned set of sequences. HMM algorithms or profiles may be built from structure-based sequence alignments (e.g., using the HMMER software package which is publically available on the internet, e.g., at www.psc.edu). For each structure-specific HMM search, hit sequences above a criterion score threshold are preferably retained as candidate members of the structural class whose HMM was used. For those hit regions that are subsequences of hit sequence, the exact subsequence hit may be extracted from the full sequence.\n\n\nIn other exemplary embodiments, the invention provides methods for curating the aligned set of sequences in order to reduce its redundancy. For example, while the large number of sequences in a structurally aligned set (e.g., an Ig-fold aligned set) represents a rich source of sequences, some subfamilies (e.g., certain Ig-fold subclasses) may be highly over-represented, while other are highly under-represented. Over- or under-representation results in significant bias due to close common ancestry and limits the overall usefulness of covariation analyses. Accordingly, in preferred embodiments, the alignment is subjected to further filtering steps to reduce alignment redundancy. In preferred embodiments, at least one sequence with greater than 90% identity to another sequence (e.g., 91%, 92%, 93%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity) is removed from the alignment. In particularly preferred embodiments, at least one sequence sharing greater than 80% sequence identity with another sequence (e.g., 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 87%, 88%, 89%, or 90% sequence identity) is removed from the alignment.\n\n\nIn exemplary embodiments, the invention provides a novel method to reduce redundancy within the alignment. Such methods comprise use of a heuristic algorithm to find and rank sequences of desired sequence identity cutoff. Such methods comprise one of more of the following sequential steps: (1) calculating percent identities for all pairs of sequences in the alignment; (2) grouping identity values into one or more bins of percent identity; (3) ranking the sequences of each bin by descreasing non-gap residue count and/or by Henikoff sequence weight; and (4) removing redundant sequences according to a cutoff criterion (e.g., a % identity cutoff level).\n\n\nRemoval of the redundant sequences can be performed in a number of ways. In one embodiment, ranked sequences are grouped into multiple bins of sequence identity (e.g., a 99% bin, a 98% bin, a 97% bin, etc.). Sequences are then systematically removed by rank (e.g., highest ranked sequences first) from the highest % identity bin (ie., the 99% bin, followed by the 98% bin, followed by the 97% bin, etc.). Identity calculation, grouping and/or ranking steps (Steps (1)-(3)) are optionally repeated after each removal step until the final bin that meets the cutoff criterion is eliminated. In another embodiment, a single bin of ranked sequences is created at the cutoff criterion and sequences are systematically removed by rank from the bin. Identity calculation and/or ranking steps (Step (1) and (3)) are optionally repeated after each removal step.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, the cutoff criterion is 90% or higher (e.g., 91%, 92%, 93%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity). In particularly preferred embodiments, the cutoff criterion is 80% or higher (e.g., 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 87%, 88%, 89%, or 90% sequence identity).\n\n\nIn another optional step, the lengths of sequences in the aligned reference set may be truncated. In one embodiment, gapped regions within the alignment may be removed to avoid calculation on these less informative regions. For example, columns that are not match states in an HMM profile used to find the sequences may be removed. In another embodiment, sequences within the alignment which overlap the consensus length of the alignment are cropped to remove the overhanging portion of the sequence. In other embodiment, overlapping sequences are removed from the alignment.\n\n\nStep 3: Covariation Analysis of the Aligned Set\n\n\nOnce the sequences of the aligned set are compiled, covariation analysis is performed on one or more pairs of amino acid residues in the alignment set. The covariation analysis results in the generation of a novel dataset (herein, a “covariation dataset”) describing the statistical significance of correlated residues within the alignments. In certain embodiments, the covariation dataset lists correlations between every possible pair of residues within the alignment.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, computation of covariation is a computer-implemented process (e.g., a Java-executable process). Computation of covariation may result in several art-recognized statistical parameters. In one embodiment, the statistical significance (e.g. a χ\n2\n-value) of covariation is calculated using a Chi-square analysis. In another embodiment, the statistical strength (e.g. φ value) of covariation is calculated. For example, a negative φ value may be predictive of a negative correlation. That is, the presence of one amino acid at a first position in the alignment favors the absence of another specific amino acid at a second position. Conversely, a positive φ value may be predictive of a positive correlation, thereby indicating that the amino acid at the first position favors the presence of the amino acid at the second position.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a φ value is calculated using formula I:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nϕ\n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n=\n \n \n \n \n(\n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n*\n \n \n \na\n \n_\n \n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nb\n \n_\n \n \nj\n \n \n \n)\n \n \n-\n \n \n(\n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nb\n \n_\n \n \nj\n \n \n*\n \n \n \na\n \n_\n \n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(\n \n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n \n+\n \n \n \n \na\n \n_\n \n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n*\n \n \n(\n \n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nb\n \n_\n \n \nj\n \n \n \n+\n \n \n \n \na\n \n_\n \n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nb\n \n_\n \n \nj\n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n*\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(\n \n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n \n+\n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nb\n \n_\n \n \nj\n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n*\n \n \n(\n \n \n \n \n \na\n \n_\n \n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n \n+\n \n \n \n \na\n \n_\n \n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nb\n \n_\n \n \nj\n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(\n \nI\n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n\n\na\ni\nb\nj \nis the number of times residues of type “a” or “b” are found in the same sequence at positions i and j, respectively;\n\n \n \n \n \nā\ni\n \nb\n \nj \nis the number of times both residue types are absent from the same sequence; a\n1\n \nb\n \nj \nis the number of times a is found present while b is absent; and\n \nā\ni\nb\nj \nis the number of times a is absent while b is present.\n \n \n \n\n\nIn one embodiment, a φ value is calculated using the following formula II:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nϕ\n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n=\n \n \n \n \n(\n \n \nc\n \n*\n \nf\n \n \n)\n \n \n-\n \n \n(\n \n \nd\n \n*\n \ne\n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \nghij\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(\n \nII\n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere c through j are defined by the matrix:\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na\ni\n \n \nā\ni\n \n \nTotal\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nb\nj\n \n \nc\n \nd\n \ng\n \n \n \n \n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \ne\n \nf\n \nh\n \n \n \n \n \nTotal\n \ni\n \nj\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nand\n\n\n\nc=a\ni\nb\nj\n, d=ā\ni\nb\nj\n, e=a\ni\n \nb\n \nj\n, f=ā\ni\n \nb\n \nj\n, g=c+d, h=e+f, i=c+e, and j=d+f.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a χ\n2\n-value may be calculated using a “frequency-of -occurrence” based formula. In other embodiments, a χ\n2\n-value is calculated using an “event-based” formula (ie. number of occurrences).

In preferred embodiments, however, a residue type may also include a gap as a distinct residue type, since gaps (especially in loop portion) often help to discriminate one motif from another.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the covariation calculation may include a diversity weighting function (e.g., a Henikoff weighing scheme).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, Sequence Average Identities (SAIs) may be used to filter out covarying pairs. For example, SAIs may be used to filter out covariation from pairs with greater than average sequence identity in order to remove potential artifactual covariations arising from closely related sequences. In embodiments where the alignment has been subjected to curation by a high identity threshold (e.g., 80% identity as cutoff criterion), SAI calculations are preferably dispensed with.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, covarying pairs are not reported by the calculation unless they are observed a minimum number of times (herein, an “event cutoff”). In one embodiment, the event cutoff is 10 or more events. In a more preferred embodiment, the event cutoff about 2 or more, and less than 10, events (e.g., 9, 8, 7, 6, or 5 events).\n\n\nStep 4: Using Covariation Data to Predict Protein Stability\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the statistically significant covariations within the covariation dataset are used to search for corresponding covariations within the candidate or test sequence. In particular, the conservation of one or more covariant amino acids of the reference set at corresponding amino acid positions within the candidate or test sequence indicates that these residues are functionally important and are predictive of favorable protein stability. Accordingly, the number of covariant amino acids that are conserved within a candidate or test sequence may be used to predict the stability of the sequence.\n\n\nIn certain exemplary aspects, the relevant covariations may be visualized using a graphical user interface (GUI) of the invention (e.g., the NAPMAP tool described in Section V infra) for analysis of the covariation dataset. Because interpretation of data in the covariation dataset may be cumbersome, the graphical user interface may ease data analysis and facilitate rapid protein designs and functional analyses.\n\n\nIn exemplary embodiments, the presence or absence of covariant residues within the reference set or alignment that are present or absent within the candidate sequence can be used to establish a score which is correlative with protein stability. For example, where a covariant (e.g., positively covariant) pair of residues is found to be retained within the candidate sequence, a first score (e.g. a positive score) can be assigned to the candidate sequence. Conversely, where a covariant (e.g., positively covariant) pair of residues is missing from the candidate sequence, a second score of oppositive sign to the first score (e.g., a negative score) can be assigned to the candidate sequence. In one preferred embodiment, the absence of a negatively covariant pair of residues within a test sequence is assigned a positive score, while the presence of the negatively covariant pair of residues is assigned a negative score. In another preferred embodiment, the presence of a positively covariant pair of residues of a test sequence is assigned a positive score, while the absence of a positively covariant pair test sequence residues is assigned a negative score.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, covariation scores are generated only for covariations that satisfy a threshold level of statistical significance. In one embodiment, covariation scores are generated only for covariations above (or below) a certain χ\n2\n-value or φ value. For example, the cutoff for designation of negative covariation score may be a covariation with a phi association coefficient (Φ) of less than +0.2 (about +0.2 to about −1.0), and more preferable less than −0.2. In another exemplary embodiment, a covariation is assigned a positive covariation score if it has a phi association coefficient of greater than −0.2, preferably greater than +0.2. In preferred embodiments, a negative covariation score is assigned to a covariation with a phi association coefficient (Φ) of less than −0.5 (e.g., −0.5, −0.6, −0.7, −0.8, −0.9, or −1.0), and a positive covariation score is assigned to a covariation with a phi association coefficient (Φ) of greater than +0.5 (e.g., +0.5, +0.6, +0.7, +0.8, +0.9, or +1.0), while all other covariations are masked by assigning a neutral score (e.g., zero).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the negative or positive covariation score can be weighted to reflect the statistical significance or strength of the corresponding covariation. In one exemplary embodiment, a positive covariation can be assigned a high positive covariation score if its phi association coefficient is also high or a lower positive covariation score its φ value is low. For example, a candidate sequence having first and second covariations with respecitive φ values of +0.5 and +1.0 may be assigned a low positive covariation score (e.g., +1) for the first covariation and a higher positive covariation score for the second covariation (e.g., +2).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the covariation score is assigned only to those covariations which are validated by a means other than calculated statistical significance. Several non-statistical criteria may be used to validate that the calculated covariations are significant and biologically meaningful. In one embodiment, the covariation is validated by examining whether there is correlation or trend between residues that covary with each other and their proximity to each other within a structural model of the corresponding protein. If said residues are close in proximity (e.g. 30 Å or less, preferably 10 Å or less) to each other in the structure, the predicted covariation is validated as a true covariation. In another embodiment, the covariation is validated by determining whether the covarying amino acids form a connection which is already known to exist within a subset of proteins corresponding to sequences of the reference set (e.g., a known disulfide bond). For example, residues 6-10 at the N-terminus of human or murine IgG variable heavy chain folds are known to adopt very specific conformations based on the conservation of covarying pairs of amino acids (Ewert et al., \nMethods, \n34: 184-199 (2004)).\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, a covariation score of an amino acid in a candidate sequence can be weighted to reflect the number of covariations within the reference set or alignment that is satisfies (or violates). In one embodiment, the candidate sequence is assigned a positive covariation score for each covariation within the reference set or alignment that it satisfies, and a negative covariation score for each covariation within the reference set that it violates. In preferred embodiments, the covariation score for a particular amino acid of a test sequence is the sum total of the positive covariation scores offset by the sum total of the negative covariation scores. For example, where 2 negative covariations and 9 positive covariations are observed within the reference set at amino acid positions corresponding to the amino acid of the candidate sequence, the candidate sequence amino acid may be assigned a total covariation score of 7.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a total covariation scores are summed for all the amino acids in a candidate sequence (or portion thereof) to obtain a “sequence covariation score”. This sequence covariation score may be employed to predict the stability of the sequence. Generally, a negative sequence covariation score is predictive of low protein stability, whereas a positive sequence covariation score is predictive of high protein stability.\n\n\nb. Consensus Scoring\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the computational methods of the invention employ a novel scoring technique termed “consensus-based scoring” which compares candidate polypeptide sequences against a database of related polypeptide sequences to identify proteins with potentially low stability. As used herein “consensus-based scoring” refers to calculation of the number of non-consensus amino acids within a protein (e.g., a test protein) based on the information available from sequence compilations of related proteins. The calculation results in a “consensus score” for the protein. As shown in the Examples infra, the consensus score of a protein is highly correlative with its empirically-determined protein stability. Accordingly, an object of the invention is to employ consensus-based scoring to predict protein stability. The greater the deviation of a test protein sequence from a consensus sequence, the higher the consensus score, and the more likely the test protein is to contain amino acids detrimental to its stability.\n\n\nIn the novel consensus scoring approach described herein, the following basic steps are taken to predict the stability of a candidate or test protein:\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Providing a set of homologous sequences (herein, a “reference set”) corresponding to a sequence of a domain (or portion thereof) of the candidate protein (herein a “test domain sequence”).\n \n2. Determining the residue frequency at every residue position within the test domain sequence (or portion thereof) to obtain a consensus score.\n \n3. Using the consensus score to predict the stability of the candidate or test protein.\n \n \n \n\n\nIn certain exemplary embodiments, the following optional steps are employed to increase the predictive value of the consensus score:\n\n \n \n \n \n4. Determining the residue frequency at every corresponding residue position within every sequence of the reference set (or a subset thereof) obtain an average score.\n \n5. Comparing the consensus score to the average consensus score to determine a sequence score.\n \n6. Using the sequence score to predict the stability of the candidate or test protein.\n \n \n \n\n\nStep 1: Providing a Reference Set\n\n\nThe consensus scoring based methods of the invention employ a set of sequences (a “reference set”) which are homologous to (i.e., related to) a sequence of interest or “test sequence”. The reference set may comprise a set of homologous sequences having moderate to high degrees of similarity with the test sequence.\n\n\nThe set of homologous sequences may be determined by one skilled in the art to include a suitable number of non-redundant sequences. The set of homologous sequences need not be large, as long as a reasonably unbiased selection is obtained. It is not the number of sequences, but the ratio of frequencies that is important.\n\n\nSuch sequences can be obtained through homology-based searches of any of the sequence databases known in the art (e.g. NCBI, TIGR databases). In an exemplary embodiment, a standard BLAST search with default parameters may be performed with the test sequence to retrieve homologous sequences of interest. Sequences with a minimum percentage of sequence identity (e.g. greater than 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% sequence identity, preferably greater than 30% sequence identity) may be selected for inclusion in the reference set. In certain embodiments, those sequences with a high degree of sequence identity (e.g., greater than 85%, 90%, 95%, or 98% sequence identity, preferably greater than 95% sequence identity) are excluded from the reference set to avoid bias.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the reference set may be curated to include only those sequences which satisfy one or more criteria for inclusion in the set. For example, in certain embodiments, the reference set may comprise ortholog sequences (e.g. sequences which are from different species (e.g., different mammalian species) but which have the same biochemical function). In other embodiments, the reference set comprises human sequences. In an exemplary embodiment, the set of homologous sequences includes only mammalian germline sequences. In preferred embodiments, the reference set includes sequences from proteins having the same class of protein fold (e.g. a similar protein domain) to the test protein (e.g. proteins having an immunoglobulin-type fold). Such proteins may be identified by bioinformatics techniques known in the art (e.g., be searching the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) of the National Institutes of Health).\n\n\nStep 2: Determining the Consensus Score of the Test Sequence\n\n\nOnce the sequences of the reference set are compiled, the consensus sequence of the reference set is determined in order to facilitate the consensus scoring method of the invention. As used herein, the term “consensus sequence” refers to a sequence wherein the residue (e.g. amino acid residue) at each position within the sequence corresponds to the most common residue at that position in an aligned set of related sequences (i.e., the reference set).\n\n\nTo determine the consensus sequence, the sequences within the reference set may first be aligned using sequence alignment algorithms known in the art. A preferred, non-limiting example of a local alignment algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (1990) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n87:2264-68, modified as in Karlin and Altschul (1993) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n90:5858-77. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the BLAST programs (version 2.0) of Altschul, et al. (1990) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n215:403-10. In another embodiment, the alignment is optimized by introducing appropriate gaps and percent identity is determined over the length of the aligned sequences (i.e., a gapped alignment). To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al., (1997) \nNucleic Acids Res. \n25(17):3389-3402. In another embodiment, the alignment is optimized by introducing appropriate gaps and percent identity is determined over the entire length of the sequences aligned (i.e., a global alignment). A preferred, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the global comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller, \nCABIOS \n(1989). Such an algorithm is incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used.\n\n\nTo determine the consensus sequence of the aligned set of references, the most frequently occurring residue at each position within the aligned set of references is determined. The consensus sequence may be determined visually or it may be determined by computational analysis using a publically available bioinformatics program (e.g., the EMBOSS CONS tool available from the \nHelix \nSystems of the National Institute of Health).\n\n\nThe consensus sequence is employed in the methods of the invention to determine a consensus score. In certain embodiments, a consensus score is a numerical value which equates the residue frequency or occurrence within the reference set of the consensus residue at each amino acid position in the consensus sequence (ie. the “consensus residue frequency”) with the residue frequency or occurrence within the reference set of the amino acid at the corresponding position in the test sequence (ie. the “test residue frequency”). Residue frequencies at a position within the test or consensus sequence are calculated by summing the number of times the amino acid at that position is present at the corresponding position in the aligned reference set, and dividing the summed value by the total number of sequences within the reference set. In an exemplary embodiment, the consensus score at each amino acid position is calculated by dividing the test residue frequency by the consensus residue frequency to give a non-zero score of between 1 and 0. For example, a residue which is identical to the consensus amino acid at that position is assigned a perfect score of 1, while a consensus score approaches zero, the less common the amino acid is at that position.\n\n\nIn certain preferred embodiments, the consensus score may be summed for each position of the test sequence (or a portion thereof) to obtain a total consensus score. For example, a perfect total consensus score is the number of amino acids in the test sequence, indicating that the test sequence is identical to its corresponding consensus sequence.\n\n\nAn exemplary formula for calculating the total consensus score of a protein is set forth below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscore\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n∑\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n⁡\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nr\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n⁡\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nr\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein\n\n\nc\ni\n(r) equals the consensus residue frequency at an amino acid position of the consensus sequence,\n\n\nh\ni\n(r) equals the test residue frequency of an amino acid position of the test sequence, and\n\n\ni equals the number of amino acid positions within the test sequence.\n\n\nStep 3: Using the Consensus Score to Predict Protein Stability\n\n\nThe consensus score may then be employed to predict the stability of the test protein. In general, the higher the value of the consensus score, the greater the probability that the test protein will have adequate stability for its intended use. In certain embodiments, the consensus score of the test protein may be compared with the consensus score of a control sequence. In one exemplary embodiment, the control sequence is from a protein which is known to have poor or undesired stability properties (herein, a “negative control”). Accordingly, the test protein is predicted to have improved stability if its consensus score is higher than that of the negative control. In another exemplary embodiment, the control sequence is from a protein which is known to have desirable stability properties (herein, a “positive control”). Accordingly, the test protein is predicted to have improved stability if its consensus score is substantially similar or higher than that of the positive control. In other embodiments, the consensus score of the test sequence may be compared with its hypothetical perfect consensus score, a value which corresponds to the total number of amino acids in the test sequence.\n\n\nStep 4: Determining the Average Consensus Score of the Reference Set\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, average consensus scores at some or all of the amino acid positions of the sequences within the reference set are determined for comparison with the consensus scores at corresponding positions within the test sequence. In preferred embodiments, the average total consensus score for the reference set is determined for comparison with the total consensus score of the of the test sequence. The average total consensus score for the reference set is the sum of the residue frequencies for all amino acid positions of a sequence within the reference set, divided by the total number of sequences in there reference set.\n\n\nStep 5: Determining the Sequence Score\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the sequence score is determined by comparing the average consensus score of the reference set with the consensus score of the test sequence. The differential of these values is the “sequence score” of the test sequence (also referred to herein as the “Δ score”). The sequence score may be determined by subtracting the consensus score from the average consensus score.\n\n\nStep 6: Using the Sequence Score to Predict Protein Stability\n\n\nThe sequence score provides a measure of the deviation of the consensus score of the test sequence from the average consensus score of the reference set. The Examples infra demonstrate that the sequence score of a protein is highly correlated with the stability (e.g. thermal stability) of the protein. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the sequence score may also be used to predict the stability of the protein. If the A score of the protein is a negative value (ie. the consensus score is lower than the average consensus score), the prediction would be that the stability of the protein of interest will have a lower-stability than the majority of proteins within the reference set.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the test sequences employed in the methods of the invention are single-domain proteins. As used herein, a “single domain protein” is a protein comprising one or more domains, wherein each of the domains are of the same type (e.g. a variable heavy (VH) domain).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the test sequences employed in the methods of the invention are multi-domain proteins. As used herein, a “multi-domain protein” is a protein comprising two or more domains, where at least two of the domains are of a different type. For example, antibodies are proteins typically comprising six domains (i.e., VH, VL, CL, CH1, CH2, and CH3). In preferred embodiments, the stability of the least stable domain of a multi-domain protein is predicted using the methods of the invention. The Examples infra demonstrate that the methods of the invention are particularly effective in predicting thermal stability when the least stable domain (or portion thereof) of a multi-domain protein (e.g. the VH domain of an antibody) is employed as a test sequence.\n\n\nIf the least stable domain is not known a priori, it can be determined using experimental methods that are known in the art (e.g. using any of the methods described supra, such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), temperature dependent circular dichroism (CD), or fluorescence measurements). Such methods allow for the determination of multiple thermal unfolding transitions where the least stable domain either unfolds first (see \nFIG. 69A\n) or limits the overall stability threshold of a multidomain unit that unfolds cooperatively (i.e. a multidomain protein which exhibits a single unfolding transition). The least stable domain can be identified in a number of additional ways. Mutagenesis can be performed to probe which domain limits the overall stability. Additionally, protease resistance of a multidomain protein can be performed under conditions where the least stable domain is known to be intrinsically unfolded via DSC or other spectroscopic methods (Fontana, et al., \nFold. Des., \n2: R17-26, 1997). Once the least stable domain is identified, the sequence encoding this domain (or a portion thereof) may be employed as a test sequence in the methods of the invention.\n\n\nIn certain exemplary embodiments, the multi-domain proteins evaluated using the methods of the invention are antibodies. The methods of the invention allow one skilled in the art to exclude the selection of inappropriate variable region domains from among the vast pool of variable region sequences created by the diversity mechanisms of the immune system. In exemplary embodiments, e.g., scFv molecules or antibody molecules comprising variable region (Fv) domains with a relatively high stability (e.g. thermal stability) may be identified using the methods of the invention, and selected. In other exemplary embodiments, human immunoglobulin variable region (Fv) domains having acceptable stability may be identified using the methods of the invention and selected for use as acceptor immunoglobulin chains in the humanization of an antibody. In other exemplary embodiments, the methods of the invention may be employed to screen candidate engineered antibody variable sequences (e.g., humanized VL or VH sequences) for appropriate stability before proceeding with the synthesis of a binding molecule comprising the candidate sequence.\n\n\nAs is known in the art, protein stability varies from one antibody to another based on the many possible variations in natural or engineered antibodies. For example, the selective pressure of the immune system to create diversity within the variable domains of natural antibody can negatively affect their stability or foldability in recombinant expression systems (Knappik and Pluckthun, \nProtein Engng., \n8: 81-89, (1995); Wall and Pluckthun, \nProtein Engng, \n12: 605-11 (1999); Knappik et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n296: 57-86, (2000); Ewert et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n3325: 531-33, (2003)). Antibodies consisting of the same isotype and subclass, human IgG1 being the most commonly used for antibody therapeutics, vary in stability from one another primarily based on differences in their variable domains since the remainder of their sequences are identical. Thermal unfolding of antibody Fab fragments predominantly occurs in a single apparent transition. In most cases, the antibody Fv region limits the overall thermostability of the Fab except in the rare cases where Fv (or single V\nH \nor V\nL\n) stability is extremely low or extremely high and the Fv unfolding transition is decoupled from that of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1/C\nL \nregion (Shimba, et al., 1995; Röthlisberger et al., 2005).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the methods of the invention employ a variable region sequence of an antibody as a test sequence. In certain preferred embodiments, the methods of the invention employ the heavy chain variable domain (VH) (or a portion thereof) as a test sequence. The Examples infra demonstrate that the VH domain is highly predictive of the stability of an antibody comprising said domain.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the variable domain test sequence is compared with a reference set comprising, or consisting solely of, variable domain sequences. Said variable domain sequences may be compiled from the Kabat database of immunoglobulin sequences (Kabat et al., “Distribution Files of the Fifth Edition of Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest”, 1992). In certain preferred embodiments, the reference set may comprise or consist of human immunoglobulin sequences.\n\n\nIn other preferred embodiments, the reference set may comprise, or consist solely of, human germline sequences. In one embodiment, the reference comprises variable domain sequences from the same Kabat subclass of antibody sequences.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, a portion of variable domain (e.g. VH domain) is used as a test sequence in the methods of the invention. An exemplary variable domain portion is a sequence comprising less than all of the framework regions or CDRs of the variable region sequence (e.g. a VH sequence that is truncated to remove CDR3 and FR4). In one embodiment, the VH domain sequences are of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n1 Kabat germline subclass. In another embodiment, the variable domain sequences are of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n2 Kabat germline subclass. In another embodiment, the variable domain sequences are of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 Kabat germline subclass. In another embodiment, the variable domain sequences are of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n4 Kabat germline subclass. In another embodiment, the variable domain sequences are of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n5 Kabat germline subclass. In another embodiment, the variable domain sequences are of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n7 Kabat germline subclass.\n\n\nThe methods of invention may be employed with proteins known in the art. In one embodiment, the protein is an antibody or portion thereof. In certain embodiments, the antibody is a humanized antibody. In other embodiments, the antibody is a human antibody. In other embodiments, the antibody is a non-human antibody (e.g., mouse monoclonal antibody). In other embodiments, the antibody is a single-domain antibody (e.g., camelid, shark, human). In yet other embodiments, the antibody is a chimeric antibody. Other exemplary modified antibodies for use in the methods of the invention include domain-deleted antibodies and bispecific binding molecules. Other exemplary antibodies include the scFv-containing antibodies or modified antibodies described supra. In preferred embodiments, the stability of the aforementioned binding proteins is evaluated using a heavy chain variable sequence thereof (or portion thereof) as the test sequence in the methods of the invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, of the invention, the data obtained for a given polypeptide are stored or outputted as a measure of the stability of the polypeptide. In one embodiment, the methods described herein can be repeated for a plurality of polypeptides. In one embodiment, a selection of a polypeptide may be made based on the data obtained. In another embodiment, a selected polypeptide may be formulated for therapeutic use.\n\n\nIV. Methods for Designing/Producing Proteins with Enhanced Biophysical Properties (E.G., Protein Stability)\n\n\n(a) Covariation Design\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods for designing protein variants with an enhanced biophysical property relative to the parent molecule from which it is derived using the results of a covariation analysis. There are many types of protein engineering efforts where covariation data may be used to facilitate design, including but not limited to enhanced protein stability designs, modification of pH unfolding profiles, stable removal of glycosylation, and alteration of biochemical function.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the invention provides methods for designing proteins with enhanced stability designs based on the identification of covariation scores (or covariations themselves) that are predictive of enhanced or reduced protein stability according the method of Section III supra. For example, if a sequence belonging to the protein of interest is missing or violates several key covariations, protein designs can be made to correct for this. Modifications can also be included which improve the calculated number of strong covariations observed within a single sequence.\n\n\nA number of designs have been developed for stabilizing the BHA10 scFv V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains. In particular, initial library screening results for two scFv BHA10 domains validate the ability of the Covariation Analysis Tool for protein stability design. The first example involves the successful prediction of a stabilizing mutation (S46L) within the BHA10 V\nL \ndomain that imparts a significant improvement in thermal stability (ΔT\n50 \nof +10° C.) as measured by a thermal challenge assay. Mutation from Ser to Leu at position 46 (Kabat numbering system) leads to a positive connection to an existing Tyr at \nresidue\n 36 which the Tool shows covaries strongly with Leu 46 (\nFIG. 78\n). A second example of the utility of the Covariation Analysis Tool is the analytical agreement of the negative effects of a BHA10 V\nH \nQ6E mutation. Single residue frequency analysis suggested that mutation to the much more commonly observed Glu at this position would lead to an increase in stability. However, the Covariation Analysis Tool indicated that single mutation to Glu violates several existing covariations present within the BHA10 V\nH \nsequence. To obtain an improvement in stability one must replace several amino acids that preferentially stabilize Glu at this position.\n\n\nAnother example of the predictive value of the Covariation Analysis Tool is shown in \nFIG. 79\n. \nMet\n 80 was mutated to Leu as part of a single residue library design. It was thought that this single mutation would be highly stabilizing, as Leu is the most frequent amino acid observed at this position within the sequence database. However, covariation analyses indicate that two other amino acids must be mutated (V67F and T70S) in order to achieve covariation harmony.\n\n\n(b) Interface Design\n\n\nIn yet other aspects, the invention provides methods for enhancing a biophysical property (e.g., protein stability) of a second or candidate protein (e.g., an antibody) using a first protein as a template protein for rational design.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “template protein”, refers to a protein with a desirable biophysical property (e.g., high protein thermal stability) which is used to model the same property in a second protein for an improvement of the biophysical property is also desirable. In preferred embodiments, the template protein is of the same structural class as the second protein (e.g., if the second protein is an antibody, an antibody is employed as a template protein).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the template protein is identified as having desirable biophysical property (e.g., protein stability) according to a method of the invention. In one exemplary embodiment, the template protein with desirable stability properties may have been identified from a group of proteins (Such as BIIB1-4, described in Table 20, supra) using experimental methods such as those described in Example 15. This template protein would then serve as a sequence platform for design. In one exemplary embodiment, the template protein is predicted to have an improved biophysical property (e.g, protein stability) by a covariation analysis method of the invention outlined supra. In other exemplary embodiments, the template protein is predicted to be a desirable protein (e.g., a stabilized protein) according to a consensus scoring method as outlined supra. In yet another exemplary embodiment, the template protein is identified according to a screening method of the invention.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the template protein is a protein designed according to a method of the invention. In one exemplary embodiment, the template protein is designed to have an improved biophysical property (e.g., enhanced protein stability) according to a covariation method of the invention. In another exemplary embodiment, the template protein is designed to have an improved biophysical property according a consensus scoring method.\n\n\nThe methods of this aspect of the invention involve the following steps:\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) providing structural models of the template protein and the candidate protein;\n \n(2) identifying residues in the template protein that are important for stability; and\n \n(3) substituting residues in the candidate protein that correspond to the important residues template protein.\n \n \n \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the template protein structural model is a crystal structure (e.g., an X-ray crystal structure) and the candidate protein is modeled by homology modeling using the structural model of the template protein.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, an important residue is a VH/VL interface residue. As used herein, an “interface residue” is a residue that participates in domain-domain interactions within or among proteins. Preferably, an interface residue resides at the boundary, i.e., the “interface” between two protein domains and contributes its surface area to at least one of the domains (preferably both). The residues that bury significantly more surface area than others at the interface, i.e., the residues which do not expose significantly more of their surface area to the surface of the folded protein, are considered to be more crucial to interface stability. The surface area that each residue contributes to the interface can be determined using art-recognized techniques (e.g., analysis using MOLMOL software). In certain embodiments, the interface residue buries at least 10 Å\n2 \nof surface area (e.g. 10 Å\n2\n, 15 Å\n2\n, 20 Å\n2\n, 25 Å\n2 \nor more of buried surface area).\n\n\nResidues of the candidate protein located at amino acid positions corresponding to those of the important residues (e.g., buried interface residues) of the template protein are preferably substituted if they are of a non-identical type. In certain embodiments, only non-conservative substitutions are made. In other embodiments, only conservative substitutions are made.\n\n\nIn exemplary embodiments, the template and candidate proteins are binding molecules (e.g., antibodies or variants thereof (e.g. scFv molecules)). In one embodiment, the interface that is examined is that between one Fc domain (e.g., hinge, CH2, and CH3) and another Fc domain. In another embodiment, the interface is that formed between the V\nH \ndomain and the V\nL \ndomain.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, the designs are focused on the interface between the VH and VL domains of an antibody. Biophysical data (see DSC data—Example 15) suggest that the affinity of VH and VL for one another is marginal in the scFv format (i.e. in the absence of the CH1 and CL domains of the Fab). In particular, VH and VL interactions are not always strong enough (i.e. do not have sufficient affinity to lead to a cooperatively folded single entity. Therefore, improving the stability of the VH/VL interface (ie. increasing the affinity between the VH and VL domains) may be a preferred route to enhancing antibody/scFv stability. By stabilizing the interface, the folding transition of antibody can be turned into a single event, raise the affinity of the domains for one another, and allowing for less dynamic fluctuations that may lead to exposed hydrophobic surface area (as observed by ANS-binding experiments).\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the designs may be validated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments which allow one skilled in the art to non-quantitatively observe real affinity increases between the VH and VL.\n\n\n(c) Combined Covariation and Interface Design\n\n\nIn yet other aspects of the invention, two or more of the sequence based design tools described herein may be employed for the design of optimized protein variants. In one exemplary embodiment, interface design is employed together with covariation analysis to determine residues or residue positions which are important for protein structure and function, including, for example, protein stability. In one exemplary embodiment, covariation analysis is used to determine residues or residue positions outside an interface (herein, termed “scaffolding residues”) that do not physically interact with the interface residues on the opposing domain or contribute surface area to the interface, but are nonetheless important for providing proper structural context for interface residues. For example, covariation analysis may be conducted on residues located within the interface to identify scaffolding residues which covary with the interface residues. Preferably, interface residues which bury a high degree of surface area (e.g., residues that bury at least 40 Å\n2 \nof surface area) are selected for covariation analysis. Scaffolding residues which covary with the selected interface residues are then identified using the covariation methods of the invention. Preferably, scaffolding residues which strongly covary (e.g., phi-value of at least 0.25) are selected. In another preferred embodiment, scaffolding residues are selected if they covary with at least two interface residues (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more interface residues). The greater the number of covariations, the higher the covariation score may be attributed to the scaffolding residue, since the number of covariations is predictive of the contribution made by the scaffolding residue to stabilization of the VH/VL interface.\n\n\nThe methods of this aspect of the invention involve the following steps:\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) providing structural models of a template protein and a candidate protein;\n \n(2) identifying interface residues (e.g., VH/VL) in the template protein that are important for stability;\n \n(3) identifying scaffolding residues which covary with the interface residues of step (2), e.g., using the Covariation Analysis Tool described herein;\n \n(4) substituting one or more interface residues or scaffolding residues in the candidate protein with the corresponding residues or scaffolding residues identified in steps (2) and (3).\n \n \n \n\n\nResidues of the candidate protein located at amino acid positions corresponding to those of the important residues (e.g., interface or scaffolding residues) of the template protein are preferably substituted if they are of a non-identical type. In certain embodiments, only non-conservative substitutions are made. In other embodiments, only conservative substitutions are made.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, of the invention, the improved sequence of a given polypeptide is stored or outputted. In another embodiment, a selected polypeptide may be formulated for therapeutic use.\n\n\nV. Systems, Interfaces, and Computer-Implemented Methods\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention pertains to methods (e.g., computer-implemented methods), apparatus, and software for implementing the selection or design methods of the invention. In exemplary embodiments, the invention provides a computer-implemented method and apparatus for identifying amino acid residues (e.g., covariant amino acid residues) in a candidate sequence. In another embodiment, the invention provides computer-implemented methods and apparatus for ranking one or more test or candidate sequences by a score (e.g., a consensus score or covariation score) which is predictive of a biophysical property (e.g., protein stability, catalytic activity, therapeutic activity, resistance to a pathogen or toxin, toxicity, etc).\n\n\nThe computer implemented methods aspect may be described by the following sequence of operations: (a) receiving data (e.g., sequence or structural data) characterizing a reference set and a test sequence; (b) from the data, calculating a score (e.g., a covariation score or consensus score); (c) ranking the scores to identify one or more sequences or amino acid residues of interest.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the scores are ranked to identify one or more amino acid residues that are to remain fixed in the test or candidate sequence. In other embodiments, the scores are ranked to identify one or more amino acid residues which are candidates for substitution. In one exemplary embodiment, the computer-implemented method ranks residue positions (or specific residues at certain positions) in order of covariation score. In another exemplary embodiment, the computer implemented method ranks candidate sequences in order of consensus score.\n\n\nYet another aspect of the invention pertains to apparatus and machine-readable media on which are provided program instructions and/or arrangements of data for implementing the methods described above. Frequently, the program instructions are provided as code for performing certain method operations. Data, if employed to implement features of this invention, may be provided as data structures, database tables, data objects, or other appropriate arrangements of specified information. Any of the methods or systems of this invention may be represented, in whole or in part, as such program instructions and/or data provided on machine-readable media.\n\n\nThe computer-implemented methods of the invention may include an output device that displays information to a user (e.g., a CRT display, an LCD, a printer, a communication device such as a modem, audio output, and the like). In addition, instructions (e.g. an algorithm) for carrying out the calculation, in part or in whole, can be conferred to a medium suitable for use in an electronic device for carrying out the instructions. Thus, the methods of the invention are amenable to a high throughput approach comprising software (e.g., computer-readable instructions) and hardware (e.g., computers, robotics, and chips). The computer-implemented process is not limited to a particular computer platform, particular processor, or particular high-level programming language.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the calculations used in the methods of the invention are carried out by a computer algorithm suitable for use with a computer programming language (e.g. PERL). In exemplary embodiments, the computer algorithm is designed to recognize (i) a sequence alignment of a reference set and/or (ii) one or more test sequences as input for the algorithm.\n\n\n(i) Computer-implemented Consensus Scoring\n\n\nIn one aspect of the invention pertains to computer-implemented methods, apparatus, and software for conducting the consensus scoring method of the invention described supra using a computer-implemented algorithm. In exemplary embodiments, the algorithm is designed to perform one or more of the following steps: (1) cutting out each residue position of the alignment as a column and calculating the consensus residue frequency at that position; (2) cutting off each residue position of the test sequence(s) and calculating the test residue frequency at that position, and (3) dividing the test residue frequency by the consensus residue frequency to give a consensus score; and/or (4) summing the consensus score at each position to give a total consensus score. In other embodiments, the algorithm may be designed to perform one or more of the following additional steps: (5) calculating the average consensus score of the reference set, and/or (6) the sequence score of the test sequence.\n\n\nThese aspects of the invention are also embodied in a system for conducting the consensus scoring method of the invention. The system includes (a) a computer that includes a database capable of storing at least one population of reference sets, and (b) system software. The system software includes one or more logic instructions for conducting any of steps (1)-(6) of the computer-implemented consensus scoring method.\n\n\nThe invention also provides a computer program product for conducting the consensus scoring method of the invention. The computer program product includes a computer-readable medium having one or more logic instructions for conducting any of steps (1)-(6).\n\n\n(ii) Computer-implemented Covariation Analysis\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention pertains to computer-implemented methods for conducting the covariation analysis method of the invention as described supra using a computer-implemented algorithm. In exemplary embodiments, the methods perform one or more of the following steps: (1) cutting out each residue position of the aligned set as a column; (2) arranging columns in a matrix; (3) calculating correlation among various columns in the matrix to derive a correlative term; (4) adding correlative terms to linear terms, which correspond to amino acid residues, to generate an expanded predictor matrix; (5) generating a heuristically-derived model (e.g. a hidden Markov model) from the expanded predictor matrix to identify important correlations.\n\n\nThese aspects of the invention are also embodied in a system for conducting the covariation analysis method of the invention. The system includes (a) a computer that includes a database capable of storing at least one population of character string libraries, and (b) system software. The system software includes one or more logic instructions for conducting any of steps (1)-(5) of the computer-implemented method covariation scoring method.\n\n\nThe invention also provides a computer program product for conducting the covariation scoring method of the invention. The computer program product includes a computer-readable medium having one or more logic instructions for conducting any of steps (1)-(5).\n\n\n(iii) Graphical User Interfaces for Covariation Analysis\n\n\nIn certain exemplary aspects, the invention provides a novel graphical user interface (GUI) for use with the covariation methods of the invention. This covariation analysis tool, termed NAPMAP, assists the user in visualizing covariations in the context of aligned set of sequences. The novel graphical user interface is computer implemented using art-recognized programming languages (e.g. in Java 1.4.2 utilizing the Processing library from processing.org).\n\n\n(a) Grid Layouts\n\n\nIn one aspect, the graphical user interface of the invention comprises a graphical depiction of an alignment (e.g., a sequence alignment created according to the methods of the invention supra) or data corresponding thereto. A simple form of this display is the grid layout. As used herein, the term “grid layout” (also known as an alignment platform) refers to a matrix in which the properties of an alignment are represented. In one embodiment, the grid layout graphically represents residue positions of the sequences of an alignment. In another embodiment, the grid layout graphically represents residue types of sequences within the alignment. In another embodiment, the grid layout graphically represents the frequency of residue types (or “residue usage frequency”) within the alignment. In yet other embodiments, the grid layout represents one or more properties of residues within the alignment (e.g., hydrophobicity, charge, size, pKa, etc.).\n\n\nIn certain exemplary embodiments, the grid layout comprises a representative display of (i) contiguous residue positions corresponding to a sequence of the alignment; and (ii) residue usage frequencies for residue types at each residue position of the alignment sequence. In one embodiment, the residue usage frequency is symbolically depicted (e.g., by a circle or square). In other embodiments, all 20 natural amino acids, gaps, and ambiguous residues are represented. In certain embodiments, the residue positions are displayed in rows and the residue usage frequencies are displayed in columns. In certain embodiments, the residue positions are displayed in columns and the residue usage frequencies are displayed in rows.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the residue use frequency is correlated (e.g., positively or negatively correlated) with symbol size (e.g., size of circle), so that more conserved residues can be discriminated from less frequently observed residues. For example, residue frequency may be represented as circles of various sizes with circle area proportional to the frequency of its usage. The radius of each circle (R) may be used for drawing the node using an ellipse function calculated according to the following formula (IV)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \n=\n \n \n \n \nA\n \n·\n \n \nN\n \nM\n \n \n \nπ\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(\n \nIV\n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein:\n\n\n\nA=desired average area of all nodes\n\n\nN=number of sequences using this residue\n\n\nM=the average number of sequences using each residue\n\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, the grid layout comprises a matrix of contiguous columns and rows wherein (i) contiguous columns graphically represent corresponding contiguous residue positions of the alignment; (ii) each of the contiguous rows graphically represent a specific amino acid type; and (iii) the residue usage frequency at each residue position is graphically represented in each cell of the matrix. Preferably all residue types (e.g., all 20 amino acids and/or possible gaps) are represented by a separate row in the grid layout. More preferably, residue usage frequency at each residue position of the alignment is graphically represented in each cell of the matrix with a symbol (e.g., a circle) whose size is correlated (e.g., positively correlated) with residue usage frequency. An exemplary grid layout is depicted in \nFIG. 76\n.\n\n\n(b) Covariation Overlays\n\n\nIn other aspects, the graphical user interface of the invention comprises a graphical depiction of one or more covariations (e.g., covariations identified according to the methods of the invention supra) or data corresponding thereto.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the graphical user interface of the invention comprises graphical depicts of both (i) a grid layout; and (ii) one or more covariations. In these embodiments, the grid layout may serve as alignment platform for the display of covariation data. Covariation data may be displayed, for example, by overlaying the grid layout with covariation data. Covariation data arranged in this fashion are termed a “covariation overlay”. For example, covariations may be depicted in the covariation overlay as lines or network of lines connecting two or more covarying amino acids that are graphically depicted within the grid layout.\n\n\nThe lines of the covariation overlay may be of various thicknesses (e.g., thin lines or bars) or continuities (e.g., dashed or solid, straight or jagged), so long as the connection between two or more covarying amino acids is apparent to the user (see, e.g., \nFIG. 77\n, wherein covariations are depicted as semi-transparent bars that connect two covarying amino acids). In certain exemplary embodiments, the graphical representation of the covariation may further represent the statistical significance of the covariation (e.g., its φ or χ\n2\n-value). In one exemplary embodiment, the thickness of a line within the covariation overlay may be proportional to the statistical significance of the covariation. For example, the line thickness of the covariation overlay may be drawn in proportion to φ value according to formula V:\n\n\n\nW=\n1+(\nM·Φ\n \nN\n)  (V)\n\n\n\nwherein:\n\n\nW=line thickness\n\n\nΦ=phi (correlation coefficient)\n\n\nN=exaggeration multiplier\n\n\nM=max line thickness\n\n\nIn another exemplary embodiment, positive and negative covariations may be graphically discriminated from each other (e.g., by different colored lines or thicknesses). In yet other exemplary embodiments, only covariations above a certain threshold level of statistical significance are displayed to the user. For example, in certain embodiments, φ value cutoffs may be applied to view only covariations with desired correlation strengths.\n\n\n(c) Sequence Traces\n\n\nIn other optional aspects, the graphical user interface comprises a graphical depiction of a sequence of interest to aid with possible protein design efforts. The sequence of interest may be the test or candidate sequence (ie., an input sequence) or it may be a sequence in which desirable covariations are integrated (ie., an output sequence). The sequence of interest may be graphically represented as a line.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the graphical interface comprises both (i) a depiction of a sequence of interest; and (ii) a grid layout (e.g., the sequence of interest is superimposed on the grid layout). In another embodiment, the graphical interface comprises both (i) a depiction of a sequence of interest; and (ii) a covariation overlay (e.g., the sequence of interest is superimposed on the covariation overlay). In yet other embodiments, the graphical interface comprises (i) a depiction of a sequence of the interest; (ii) a covariation overlay; and (iii) a grid layout (e.g., the sequence of interest is superimposed (e.g., traced) on the covariation overlay which is in turn superimposed on the grid layout).\n\n\nA sequence of interest may be displayed on a grid layout, for example, as a curve connecting adjacent amino acids that are graphically depicted within the grid layout. A sequence of interest displayed in this fashion is termed a “sequence trace”. In preferred embodiments, the sequence trace should pass or thread through only one cell (or graphical representation of an amino acid type) for a particular row or column of the grid layout that represents a particular residue position. More preferably, the sequence trace passes through the cell which graphically represents the residue type occurring at a particular residue position within the sequence of interest. The sequence trace may pass though every cell of the grid layout that represent a residue within the sequence of interest, or it may pass through only the cells that represent a portion of the sequence of interest. An exemplary sequence trace of a sequence of interest is depicted in \nFIG. 77\n. Sequence traces depicted therein (catmull-rom splines) were drawn using a bezier function. Given two nodes to draw a sequence transition bezier curve, the node pair's previous and next nodes are used as anchor points and the two nodes themselves are used as the first and second control points. For nodes in the first column (representing the first residues of amino acid sequences), the first control point doubles as its anchor point; for nodes in the last column, its second control point double as its anchor point.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, the sequence trace plot is rendered interactive for manipulation by the user. For example, the cells within the grid layout (representing can be rendered interactive for selection by the user. In one embodiment, the selected cell can be assigned a particular selection state (e.g., a positive, neutral, or negative selection state). In one exemplary embodiment, a cell representing a particular residue can be positively selected by the user so that the sequence trace can be retraced to pass though the selected cell. For example, if a cell is positively selected by the user, multiple sequence traces can be generated for all sequences of interest (e.g., all sequences within the reference set or alignment) that employ the residue represented by the positively selected cell. In an alternative embodiment, a cell representing a particular residue can be negatively selected by the user so that the sequence trace does not pass through the selected cell. Accordingly, sequence traces can be generated for every sequence of interest (e.g., all sequences within the reference set or alignment) that excludes the residue represented by the negatively selected cell.\n\n\nMultiple sequences of interest can be graphically displayed, so long as they can be distinguished by the user (e.g., using different line thicknesses or continuities). For example, to compare different sequence alignments, sequences traces representing multiple sequences of interest from two or more alignments can be overlaid on the grid layout (e.g., with different colors, preferably opposing colors) to enable visualization of differential residue usage on a global scale.\n\n\n(d) Display Modes\n\n\nThe graphical user interface may facilitate any art-recognized functionality. For example, in certain embodiments, the graphical user interface may be capable of panning or zooming on different portions of the grid layout. For example, the viewport size of the grid layout can be changed depending on the user's computer screen resolution and visualization can be zoomed out or panned for viewing an alignment that does not fit in the view port initially.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, data masking is employed, for example, to emphasize the most important covariation pairs and/or networks across several pairs. The graphical user interface of the invention may employ one or more display modes for the viewing of covariations (e.g., statistically-significant covariations). Preferably, said display modes are available in an interactive plot when viewing a sequence trace of a sequence of interest. Exemplary Viewermodes are as follows:\n\n\nViewermode #1: Only covariations between residues that are also present in the sequence of interest are displayed. These covariations can be thought of as hypothesized residue-residue interactions (e.g., those found by statistical residue pair frequency analysis) that hold the corresponding protein molecule together and may be important for function.\n\n\nViewermode #2: The only covariations displayed are those between residue pairs having only one residue of the residue pair present in the sequence of interest. These covariations are residue-residue interactions that tend to be conserved but are not present in the sequence of interest, and whose absence may be detrimental to protein stability. This viewermode is particularly preferred when the Covariation Analysis Tool is employed for protein design (see Section IV supra).\n\n\nViewermode #3: The only covariations displayed are those between residue pairs having neither amino acid member of the covarying pair present in the sequence of interest.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, all viewermodes are displayed to the user but each in a unique display format. In another embodiment, all viewermodes are separately displayed (e.g., in separate display windows).\n\n\n \nFIG. 89\n depicts an exemplary environment suitable for practicing an embodiment of the invention. A \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n supports an initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n and \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n. The \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n may be a workstation, server, laptop, mainframe, PDA or other computing device equipped with one or more processors and able to support the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n and \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n. The \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n may have a single processor or multiple processors and each of the processors may have one core or multiple cores. The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n is implemented in software and programmatically analyzes covariation between pairs of residues within alignment to obtain covariation data. The \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n is in communication with, and outputs data to, an \noutput display device\n \n8910\n. The \nOutput display device\n \n8910\n displays a graphical user interface (GUI) \n8912\n generated by the \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n. The \nGUI\n \n8912\n may include a grid layout \n8914\n and a \ncovariation overlay\n \n8916\n. The \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n may also be in communication over a \nnetwork\n \n8920\n with one or \n \nmore storage locations\n \n \n8930\n and \n8940\n that respectively hold \n \nsequence data\n \n \n8932\n and \n8942\n. The initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n programmatically retrieves candidate sequences from the \n \nsequence data\n \n \n8932\n and \n8942\n based on user-supplied and/or pre-determined parameters. The retrieved sequence data is analyzed by the \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that although the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n and \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n are depicted separately in \nFIG. 89\n, they may be implemented as part of an integrated application, process or plug-in. Similarly, it should be appreciated that the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n and analysis facility may each separately be a task, thread, process, application or plug-in. The \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n may communicate over the \nnetwork\n \n8920\n with the \n \nstorage locations\n \n \n8930\n and \n8940\n using a number of different mediums and configurations. For example, the \nnetwork\n \n8920\n may be arranged as a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), an intranet, the Internet, and/or may be a wireless network and/or a telephone line, or some other type of network allowing the \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n to communicate with the \n \nstorage locations\n \n \n8930\n and \n8940\n. The \n \nstorage locations\n \n \n8930\n and \n8940\n may be databases or some other type of storage datastructure hosted by computing devices that are accessible over the \nnetwork\n \n8920\n. It should be noted that although components of the present invention are depicted in a particular configuration in \nFIG. 89\n, other component configurations are also possible within the scope of the present invention. For example, the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n and \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n may be located on separate computing devices and/or the \n \nsequence data\n \n \n8932\n and \n8942\n may be located on one or more databases hosted by the \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n.\n\n\n \nFIG. 90\n is a flowchart of an exemplary sequence of steps that may be followed by an embodiment of the invention in order to determine a sequence covariation score that may be used as a measure of the stability of a polypeptide. The sequence begins with the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n providing alignment of a curated reference set of sequences corresponding to an Ig fold of a polypeptide (step \n9000\n). The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n then calculates covariation between residues of the sequence of the alignment as described herein to generate covariation data (step \n9002\n). The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n uses the covariation data to determine a sequence covariation score for a candidate sequence from covariations within the covariation data (step \n9004\n). The determined sequence covariation score provides an indicator of the measure of stability of the polypeptide and may be stored and/or output to a user via the \nGUI\n \n8912\n or in some other manner (step \n9006\n).\n\n\nAs noted above, the \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n may also be used to determine a consensus score. \nFIG. 91\n is a flowchart of an exemplary sequence of steps that may be followed by an embodiment of the invention in order to determine and use a consensus score to predict the stability of a candidate protein. The sequence begins by using the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n to provide a reference set of sequences corresponding to a test domain sequence of a candidate protein (step \n9100\n). The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n then determines residue frequencies at amino acid positions within the test domain sequence to obtain a consensus score (step \n9102\n). The determined consensus score may then be stored and/or output to a user to provide a prediction of the stability of the candidate protein (step \n9104\n).\n\n\nThe \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n may also be used to determine an average consensus score. \nFIG. 92\n is a flowchart of an exemplary sequence of steps that may be followed by an embodiment of the invention in order to determine and use an average consensus score as a measure of the stability of a candidate protein. The sequence begins by using the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n to provide a reference set of sequences corresponding to a test domain sequence of a candidate protein (step \n9200\n). The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n then determines residue frequencies at amino acid positions within the test domain sequence to obtain a consensus score (step \n9202\n). The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n also determines residue frequencies within the sequences of the reference set to determine an average consensus score (step \n9204\n). The consensus score is compared with the average consensus score in order to determine a sequence score (step \n9206\n) and the determined sequence score may then be stored and/or output to a user to provide a prediction of the stability of the candidate protein (step \n9206\n).\n\n\n \nFIG. 93\n is a flowchart of an exemplary series of steps that may be followed by an embodiment of the invention in order to identify and substitute an amino acid residue that fails to satisfy a covariation with the covarying residue found at a corresponding position in the alignment to determine an improved amino acid sequence of the polypeptide. The sequence begins by the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n providing alignment of a curated reference set of sequences corresponding to an Ig fold of a polypeptide (step \n9300\n). The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n then calculates covariation between residues of the sequence of the alignment to identify covarying residues (step \n9302\n). The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n may identify a particular residue of the polypeptide that fails to satisfy a covariation and may substitute a covarying residue found at a corresponding position in the alignment (step \n9304\n) in order to improve the sequence of the polypeptide. The improved sequence may then be stored or output to a user (step \n9306\n).\n\n\nThe present invention may be provided as one or more computer-readable programs embodied on or in one or more mediums. The mediums may be a floppy disk, a hard disk, a compact disc, a digital versatile disc, a flash memory card, a PROM, an MRAM, a RAM, a ROM, or a magnetic tape. In general, the computer-readable programs may be implemented in any programming language. Some examples of languages that can be used include FORTRAN, C, C++, C#, Python or Java. The software programs may be stored on or in one or more mediums as object code. Hardware acceleration may be used and all or a portion of the code may run on a FPGA, an ASIP, or an ASIC. The code may run in a virtualized environment such as in a virtual machine. Multiple virtual machines running the code may be resident on a single processor.\n\n\nVI. Methods of Evaluating Protein Stability\n\n\nThe stability properties of the compositions of the invention can be analyzed using methods known in the art. Stability parameters acceptable to those in the art may be employed. Exemplary parameters are described in more detail below. In exemplary embodiments, thermal stability is evaluated. In preferred embodiments, the expression levels (e.g., as measured by % yield) of the compositions of the invention are evaluated. In other preferred embodiments, the aggregation levels of the compositions of the invention are evaluated.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the stability properties of a composition of an invention are compared with that of a suitable control. Exemplary controls include conventional scFv molecule. A particularly preferred control is a (Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nscFv molecule.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, one or more parameters described below are measured. In one embodiment, one or more of these parameters is measured following expression in a mammalian cell. In one embodiment, one or more parameters described below are measured under large scale manufacturing conditions (e.g., expression of scFvs or molecules comprising scFvs in a bioreactor).\n\n\na) Thermal Stability\n\n\nThe thermal stability of the compositions of the invention may be analyzed using a number of non-limiting biophysical or biochemical techniques known in the art. In certain embodiments, thermal stability is evaluated by analytical spectroscopy.\n\n\nAn exemplary analytical spectroscopy method is Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). DSC employs a calorimeter which is sensitive to the heat absorbances that accompany the unfolding of most proteins or protein domains (see, e.g. Sanchez-Ruiz, et al., \nBiochemistry, \n27: 1648-52, 1988). To determine the thermal stability of a protein, a sample of the protein is inserted into the calorimeter and the temperature is raised until the Fab or scFv unfolds. The temperature at which the protein unfolds is indicative of overall protein stability.\n\n\nAnother exemplary analytical spectroscopy method is Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. CD spectrometry measures the optical activity of a composition as a function of increasing temperature. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy measures differences in the absorption of left-handed polarized light versus right-handed polarized light which arise due to structural asymmetry. A disordered or unfolded structure results in a CD spectrum very different from that of an ordered or folded structure. The CD spectrum reflects the sensitivity of the proteins to the denaturing effects of increasing temperature and is therefore indicative of a protein's thermal stability (see van Mierlo and Steemsma, \nJ. Biotechnol., \n79(3):281-98, 2000).\n\n\nAnother exemplary analytical spectroscopy method for measuring thermal stability is Fluorescence Emission Spectroscopy (see van Mierlo and Steemsma, supra). Yet another exemplary analytical spectroscopy method for measuring thermal stability is Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (see, e.g. van Mierlo and Steemsma, supra).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the thermal stability of a composition of the invention is measured biochemically. An exemplary biochemical method for assessing thermal stability is a thermal challenge assay. In a “thermal challenge assay”, a composition of the invention is subjected to a range of elevated temperatures for a set period of time. For example, in one embodiment, test scFv molecules or molecules comprising scFv molecules are subject to an range of increasing temperatures, e.g., for 1-1.5 hours. The activity of the protein is then assayed by a relevant biochemical assay. For example, if the protein is a binding protein (e.g. an scFv or scFv-containing polypeptide of the invention) the binding activity of the binding protein may be determined by a functional or quantitative ELISA.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, such an assay may be done in a high-throughput format. In another embodiment, a library of scFv variants may be created using methods known in the art. scFv expression may be induced an scFvs may be subjected to thermal challenge. The challenged test samples may be assayed for binding and those scFvs which are stable may be scaled up and further characterized.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, thermal stability is evaluated by measuring the melting temperature (Tm) of a composition of the invention using any of the above techniques (e.g. analytical spectroscopy techniques). The melting temperature is the temperature at at the midpoint of a thermal transition curve wherein 50% of molecules of a composition are in a folded state.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, thermal stability is evaluated by measuring the specific heat or heat capacity (Cp) of a composition of the invention using an analytical calorimetric technique (e.g. DSC). The specific heat of a composition is the energy (e.g. in kcal/mol) required to raise by 1° C., the temperature of 1 mol of water. As large Cp is a hallmark of a denatured or inactive protein composition. In certain embodiments, the change in heat capacity (ΔCp) of a composition is measured by determining the specific heat of a composition before and after its thermal transition. In other embodiments, thermal stability may be evaluated by measuring or determining other parameters of thermodynamic stability including Gibbs free energy of unfolding (ΔG), enthalpy of unfolding (ΔH), or entropy of unfolding (ΔS).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, one or more of the above biochemical assays (e.g. a thermal challenge assay) is used to determine the temperature (ie. the T\nC \nvalue) at which 50% of the composition retains its activity (e.g. binding activity).\n\n\nb) % Aggregation\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the stability of a composition of the invention is determined by measuring its propensity to aggregate. Aggregation can be measured by a number of non-limiting biochemical or biophysical techniques. For example, the aggregation of a composition of the invention may be evaluated using chromatography, e.g. Size-Exclusion Chromatograpy (SEC). SEC separates molecules on the basis of size. A column is filled with semi-solid beads of a polymeric gel that will admit ions and small molecules into their interior but not large ones. When a protein composition is applied to the top of the column, the compact folded proteins (ie. non-aggregated proteins) are distributed through a larger volume of solvent than is available to the large protein aggregates. Consequently, the large aggregates move more rapidly through the column, and in this way the mixture can be separated or fractionated into its components. Each fraction can be separately quantified (e.g. by light scattering) as it elutes from the gel. Accordingly, the % aggregation of a composition of the invention can be determined by comparing the concentration of a fraction with the total concentration of protein applied to the gel. Stable compositions elute from the column as essentially a single fraction and appear as essentially a single peak in the elution profile or chromatogram.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, SEC is used in conjunction with in-line light scattering (e.g. classical or dynamic light scattering) to determine the % aggregation of a composition. In certain preferred embodiments, static light scattering is employed to measure the mass of each fraction or peak, independent of the molecular shape or elution position. In other preferred embodiments, dynamic light scattering is employed to measure the hydrodynamic size of a composition. Other exemplary methods for evaluating protein stability include High-Speed SEC (see e.g. Corbett et al., \nBiochemistry. \n23(8):1888-94, 1984).\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the % aggregation is determined by measuring the fraction of protein aggregates within the protein sample. In a preferred embodiment, the % aggregation of a composition is measured by determining the fraction of folded protein within the protein sample.\n\n\nc) % Yield\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the stability of a composition of the invention is evaluated by measuring the amount of protein that is recovered (herein the “% yield”) following expression (e.g. recombinant expression) of the protein. For example, the % yield can be measured by determining milligrams of protein recovered for every ml of host culture media (ie. mg/ml of protein). In a preferred embodiment the % yield is evaluated following expression in a mammalian host cell (e.g. a CHO cell).\n\n\nd) % Loss\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the stability of a composition of the invention is evaluated by monitoring the loss of protein at a range of temperatures (e.g. from −80 to 25° C.) following storage for a defined time period. The amount or concentration of recovered protein can be determined using any protein quantification method known in the art, and compared with the initial concentration of protein. Exemplary protein quantification methods include SDS-PAGE analysis or the Bradford assay for (Bradford, et al., \nAnal. Biochem. \n72, 248, (1976)). A preferred method for evaluating % loss employs any of the analytical SEC methods described supra. It will be appreciated that % Loss measurements can be determined under any desired storage condition or storage formulation, including, for example, lyophilized protein preparations.\n\n\ne) % Proteolysis\n\n\nIn still other embodiments, the stability of a composition of the invention is evaluated by determining the amount of protein that is proteolyzed following storage under standard conditions. In an exemplary embodiment, proteolysis is determined by SDS-PAGE a sample of the protein wherein the amount of intact protein is compared with the amount of low-molecular weight fragments which appear on the SDS-PAGE gel. In another exemplary embodiment, proteolysis is determined by Mass Spectrometry (MS), wherein the amount of protein of the expected molecular weight is compared with the amount of low-molecular weight protein fragments within the sample.\n\n\nf) Binding Affinity\n\n\nIn still other embodiments, the stability of a composition of the invention may be assessed by determining its target binding affinity. A wide variety of methods for determining binding affinity are known in the art. An exemplary method for determining binding affinity employs surface plasmon resonance. Surface plasmon resonance is an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BIAcore system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, N.J.). For further descriptions, see Jönsson, U., et al. (1993) \nAnn. Biol. Clin. \n51:19-26; Jönsson, U., et al. (1991) \nBiotechniques \n11:620-627; Johnsson, B., et al. (1995) \nJ. Mol. Recognit. \n8:125-131; and Johnnson, B., et al. (1991) \nAnal. Biochem. \n198:268-277.\n\n\ng) Other Binding Studies\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the stability of a composition of the invention may be assessed by quantifying the binding of a labeled compound to denatured or unfolded portions of a binding molecule. Such molecules are preferably hydrophobic, as they preferably bind or interact with large hydrophobic patches of amino acids that are normally buried in the interior of the native protein, but which are exposed in a denatured or unfolded binding molecule. An exemplary labeled compound is the hydrophobic fluorescent dye, 1-anilino-8-naphthaline sulfonate (ANS).\n\n\nVII. Methods For Selecting Stable Proteins\n\n\nThe methods described supra for the prediction of protein stability can be employed to select a candidate protein (e.g. antibodies) for further use. In certain embodiments, the methods of the invention are employed to select a protein for expression. In other embodiments, the methods of the invention are used to select a candidate protein for modification. In exemplary embodiments, the prediction methods of the invention can be employed in the humanization of a non-human donor antibody (e.g. to select an acceptor immunoglobulin).\n\n\nA candidate protein may be selected based on its total consensus score or sequence score as determined using the methods of the invention. In certain embodiments, the candidate protein is selected if its consensus score is greater than a suitable negative control (e.g. greater than 5%, preferably greater than 10%, more preferably greater than 20%). In other embodiments, the candidate protein is selected if its consensus score is substantially similar to (e.g. within 20%, 10%, or 5%) or greater than (e.g. greater than 5%, preferably greater than 10%, more preferably greater than 20%) a suitable positive control.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, a candidate protein is selected if its consensus score is substantially similar to its ideal or perfect consensus score (e.g. within 30%, preferably within 20%, more preferably within 10%).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, a candidate protein is selected if its sequence score is greater than zero. In one embodiment, the candidate protein is selected if its sequence score is greater than 0.5. In another embodiment, the candidate protein is selected if its sequence score is greater than 1. In other embodiment, the candidate protein is selected if its sequence score is greater than 2. In a preferred embodiment, the candidate protein is selected if its sequence score is greater than 3.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, a candidate protein is selected if its Δ score is at least −3, at least −2, or at least −1, preferably at least 0, more preferably at least 1.\n\n\na. Selecting an Acceptor Immunoglobulin for Antibody Humanization\n\n\nHumanized antibodies can be produced using recombinant DNA technology, see for example, e.g., Queen et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA\n, (1989), 86:10029-10033; Jones et al., \nNature\n, (1986), 321:522-25; Riechmann et al., \nNature\n, (1988), 332:323-27; Verhoeyen et al., \nScience\n, (1988), 239:1534-36; Orlandi et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA\n, (1989), 86:3833-37; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101; 5,585,089; 5,693,761; 5,693,762; 6,180,370. When a preferred nonhuman donor antibody has been selected for humanization, an appropriate human acceptor antibody may be obtained, e.g., from sequence databases of expressed human antibody genes, from germline Ig sequences or a consensus sequence of several human antibodies. The substitution of nonhuman CDRs into a human variable domain framework is most likely to result in retention of their correct spatial orientation if the human variable domain framework adopts the same or similar conformation to the nonhuman variable framework from which the CDRs originated. This is achieved by obtaining the human variable domains from human acceptor antibodies whose framework sequences exhibit a high degree of sequence identity with the nonhuman variable framework domains from which the CDRs were derived. The heavy and light chain variable framework regions can be derived from the same or different human antibody sequences. Preferably the human acceptor antibody retains the canonical and interface residues of the donor antibody. Additionally, the human acceptor antibody preferably has substantial similarity in the length of CDR loops. See Kettleborough et al., \nProtein Engineering \n4:758 (1991); Kolbinger et al., \nProtein Engineering \n6:971 (1993) and Carter et al., WO 92/22653.\n\n\nHaving identified the CDRs of the donor antibody and appropriate human acceptor antibody, the next step is to determine which, if any, residues from these components should be substituted to optimize the properties of the resulting humanized antibody. Typically, some or all of the amino acids of the nonhuman, donor immunoglobulin light or heavy chain that are required for antigen binding (e.g., one or more CDRs) are used to substitute for the corresponding amino acids from the light or heavy chain of the human acceptor antibody. The human acceptor antibody retains some or all of the amino acids that are not required for antigen binding. When necessary, one or more residues in the human framework regions can be changed to residues at the corresponding positions in the murine antibody so as to preserve the binding affinity of the humanized antibody to the antigen. This change is sometimes called “back mutation.” Certain amino acids from the human variable region framework residues are selected for back mutation based on their possible influence on CDR conformation and/or binding to antigen.\n\n\nIn some cases, however, the humanization process results in unnatural changes to the variable domain which confers undesirable instability to the humanized antibody. For example, the acceptor immunoglobulin may have rare sequence variations that confer low stability. This is particularly true of certain germline sequences which may not be used with great frequency by the immune system.\n\n\nThe methods of the invention provide improved methods for humanization. In particular, the methods of the invention allow the skilled artisan to predict which test sequence (e.g. test germline sequence) with a reference set of candidate acceptor sequences (e.g. germline sequences) are suitably stable for use in the humanization of the acceptor sequence. Test acceptor sequences (e.g. germline sequences) which have a score that is predictive of acceptable stability (e.g. have a high consensus score as compared to the average consensus score of the reference set) may be selected as an acceptor immunoglobulin.\n\n\nVIII. Library Based Methods for Identifying Stabilized scfv Molecules\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides methods of identifying scFv molecules with improved protein stability, e.g. improved thermal stability. The methods of the invention comprise (i) providing a library comprising candidate scFv molecules; and (ii) screening the library to identify candidate scFv molecules with improved protein stability relative to a suitable control (e.g. a control scFv molecule). As used herein, a “candidate scFv molecule” is an scFv molecule formed by introducing one or more candidate stabilizing mutations into the scFv molecule, wherein the effect of the candidate stabilizing mutation on the stability of the scFv molecule is not known a priori, i.e., an scFv molecule into which a mutation has been introduced and which has to be evaluated to determine whether the mutation results in an scFv molecule with increased stability. In one embodiment, a candidate scFv molecule is one formed by introducing one or more candidate stabilizing mutations into a conventional (ie. non-stabilized) scFv molecule. In another embodiment, a candidate scFv molecule is one formed by introducing one or more candidate stabilizing mutations into one of the stabilized scFv molecules described in Section II, supra.\n\n\nBy a “library of candidate scFv molecules” herein is meant at least two non-redundant candidate scFv molecules, with at least about 10 being preferred, at least about 100 being particularly preferred, and at least about 1000 being especially preferred (e.g. at least about 10\n4\n, 10\n5\n, 10\n6\n, 10\n7\n, or 10\n8 \nscFv molecules). In one embodiment, the library is randomized, with unspecified mutations generated randomly at any position. In another embodiment, the scFv library is a partially randomized or designed. That is, a specified amino acid residue or class of amino acid residues is introduced randomly at any position of the scFv, or a specified amino acid position is selected for mutagenesis with an unspecified amino acid, a particular class of amino acids, or a specified amino amino acid. In a preferred embodiment, an scFv library is designed by substituting a selected residue of an scFv molecule with an amino acid of a defined class, for example, a hydrophobic amino acid, a basic amino acid, a hydrophilic amino acid, a charged amino acid, a sterically biased (either small or large) amino acid, or a cysteine capable of disulfide bond formation.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the scFv library comprises candidate scFv molecules with candidate stabilizing mutation(s) that are introduced within a variable region (VL and/or VH) of the scFv molecule. In other embodiments, the scFv library comprises candidate scFv molecules with candidate stabilizing mutation(s) that are introduced within an scFv linker of the scFv molecule. In other embodiments, the scFv library comprises candidate scFv molecules with candidate stabilizing mutation(s) that are introduced within an scFv linker of the scFv molecule and candidate stabilizing mutation(s) that are introduced within a variable region (VL and/or VH).\n\n\na. Design of scFv Libraries\n\n\nMethods for designing the scFv library may be aided by molecular or computational modeling. In certain embodiments, library design may be carried out in silico. In certain embodiments, the scFv library may be designed by the following two-step method:\n\n \n \n \n \n1) identifying target amino acid residues in the scFv that when altered by a mutation (e.g, by amino acid substitution), are predicted to result in improved scFv stability (herein “candidate destabilizing residues”); and\n \n2) substituting the target amino acid residues with candidate stabilizing amino acid residues.\n\n\nStep #1: Identifying Candidate Destabilizing Residues\n\n \n \n \n\n\nIn certain embodiments, candidate destabilizing amino acid residues may be identified by sequence-based analysis. For example, candidate destabilizing amino acid residues may be identified by comparing a variable region sequence of an scFv with a reference set of variable region sequences, e.g. variable region sequences from naturally-occurring human antibodies, and selecting those variable region amino acid residues of the scFv which are unusual or rare at their corresponding amino acid positions within the reference set. In preferred embodiments, only the framework regions of a variable region sequence of the scFv are analysed, while the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the variable region are conserved in order to avoid disrupting the binding activity of the scFv molecule.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one which is absent or found at a low frequency at a corresponding position within a reference set of homologous variable region sequences. Methods for compiling reference sets are described in Sections III-V, supra. In preferred embodiments, the candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one which is present within less than 10% of the sequences at corresponding positions within the reference set. In more preferred embodiments, the candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one which is present within less than 5% of the sequences at corresponding positions within the reference set. In particularly preferred embodiments, the candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one which is present within less than 2% (e.g. 0.5%, 0.75%, or 1%) of the sequences at corresponding positions within the reference set.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one which differs from the amino acid present at the corresponding position in a consensus sequence of the reference set of variable region sequences (ie. the consensus amino acid residue). Methods for determining the consensus sequence of the reference set are described in Section III and V, supra.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one which has a low consensus score. Methods for determining a consensus score of an amino acid are described in Section III and V, supra. In one embodiment, the candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one with a consensus score of less than 0.5 (e.g. less than 0.4, less than 0.3, less than 0.2, or less than 0.1). In a preferred embodiment, the candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one with a consensus score of less than 0.3.\n\n\nStep #2: Selection of Candidate Stabilizing Mutations\n\n\nHaving identified one or more candidate destabilizing amino acids, the next step is to select one or more candidate stabilizing mutations for each destabilizing amino acid. The scFv library may then be designed to include a representative candidate scFv molecule for each candidate stabilizing mutation that is selected.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, every natural amino acid variant of a particular destabilizing amino acid is selected as a candidate stabilizing mutation (ie. 19 candidate stabilizing mutations for every destabilizing amino acid).\n\n\nIn more preferred embodiments, a subset of the natural amino acid variants of a particular destabilizing amino acid are selected as candidate stabilizing mutations (ie. 1-18 candidate stabilizing amino acids for every destabilizing amino acid). In one embodiment, the subset of candidate stabilizing mutations comprise substitutions with an amino acid of a defined class, for example, hydrophobic amino acids, basic amino acids, hydrophilic amino acids, charged amino acids, or sterically biased amino acids (either small or large) amino acids.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a subset of candidate stabilizing mutations include substitutions with amino acids which are present at high frequencies at a position corresponding to that of the destabilizing amino acid within a reference set of homologous variable region sequences. In preferred embodiments, a candidate stabilizing mutation comprises substitution with an amino acid that is present within the database at a frequency of greater than 10%. In more preferred embodiments, the amino acid is present at a frequency greater than 15%. In still more preferred embodiments, the amino acid is present at a frequency of greater than 20%. In yet more preferred embodiments, the amino acid is present at a frequency of greater than 25%.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a candidate stabilizing mutation is a substitution with the consensus amino acid (ie. most frequent residue) found at the position of the destabilizing amino acid within the reference set.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a subset of candidate stabilizing mutations comprise substitutions with every amino acid that is found within a reference set of homologous variable region sequences at the position of the destabilizing amino acid. Accordingly, an scFv library may then be designed to include a representative candidate scFv molecule for each candidate stabilizing mutation that is represented in the reference set.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the subset of candidate stabilizing mutations may be identified or prioritized for screening by an analysis (e.g. visual inspection or computational analysis) of a three-dimensional structure or model of a variable region of the scFv molecule. The three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide influences its biological activity and stability, and that structure can be determined or predicted in a number of ways. Tertiary structure can be predicted using model building of three-dimensional structures of one or more homologous proteins (or protein complexes) that have a known three-dimensional structure. X-ray crystallography is perhaps the best-known way of determining protein structure (accordingly, the term “crystal structure” may be used in place of the term “structure”), but estimates can also be made using circular dichroism, light scattering, or by measuring the absorption and emission of radiant energy. Other useful techniques include neutron diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and homology modeling. All of these methods are known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and they have been well described in standard textbooks (see, e.g., \nPhysical Chemistry, \n4th Ed., W. J. Moore, Prentiss-Hall, N.J., 1972, or \nPhysical Biochemistry\n, K. E. Van Holde, Prentiss-Hall, N.J., 1971)) and numerous publications. Any of these techniques can be carried out to determine the structure of a molecule comprising a variable region of an scFv molecule (e.g. an antibody, a Fab, or an scFv molecule itself).\n\n\nThe structure of the variable region may be modeled in silico. For example, the compatibility of a candidate stabilizing mutation with the three-dimensional structure may be analyzed by computationally modeling the substitution of a destabilizing mutation with a candidate stabilizing mutation. The candidate stabilizing mutation may be selected for inclusion in the scFv library if it is compatable with the overall structure of the scFv molecule. In one embodiment, the candidate stabilizing mutation may be selected if it does not perturb the native folding or conformation of the variable region of the scFv molecule or one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) thereof. In another embodiment, the candidate stabilizing mutation may be selected if it does not perturb the ability of the variable region to form a native VL/VH interface.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a candidate stabilizing mutation may be selected by applying a sidechain repacking technique to a structure (e.g. the crystal structure or model) of the variable region. In a sidechain repacking calculation, the candidate stabilizing residues can be modified computationally, and the stability of the resulting mutants is evaluated computationally. The sidechain repacking calculation generates a ranked list of the mutants that have altered stability (i.e., altered intramolecular energy). The number of protein mutants that is evaluated computationally can be very large, since every variable amino acid position can be mutated into all 20 standard amino acids. Exemplary computational algorithms used to rank the results of the computational analysis include dead-end elimination and tree search algorithms (see for example, Lasters et al. (\nProtein Eng. \n8:815-822, 1995), Looger and Helling a (\nJ. Mol. Biol. \n307:429-445, 2001), and Dahiyat and Mayo (\nProtein Sci. \n5:895-903, 1996)). Accordingly, an scFv library may then be designed to include a representative candidate scFv molecule for each of the top-ranked candidate stabilizing mutations in the ranked list of mutations generated by the sidechain repacking calculation. In certain embodiments, at least the top ranked mutation is selected (e.g., the top ranked, the top two ranked, the top three ranked, the top four ranked, or the top five ranked mutations are selected).\n\n\nb. Construction of scFv Libraries\n\n\nHaving determined the candidate stabilizing mutations to include in the scFv library, one can use any of a variety of available methods to produce candidate scFv molecules comprising the mutations. Such polypeptides can, for example, be produced by recombinant methods. Moreover, because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a variety of nucleic acid sequences can be used to encode each desired scFv.\n\n\nExemplary art recognized methods for making a nucleic acid molecule encoding a candidate scFv molecule include, but are not limited to, preparation by site-directed (or oligonucleotide-mediated) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared DNA encoding the candidate scFv.\n\n\nSite-directed mutagenesis is a preferred method for preparing substitution variants. This technique is well known in the art (see, e.g., Carter et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 13:4431-4443 (1985) and Kunkel et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:488 (1987)). Briefly, in carrying out site-directed mutagenesis of DNA, the parent DNA is altered by first hybridizing an oligonucleotide encoding the desired mutation to a single strand of such parent DNA. After hybridization, a DNA polymerase is used to synthesize an entire second strand, using the hybridized oligonucleotide as a primer, and using the single strand of the parent DNA as a template. Thus, the oligonucleotide encoding the desired mutation is incorporated in the resulting double-stranded DNA, which may then be ligated into a plasmid or other suitable vector.\n\n\nPCR mutagenesis is also suitable for making candidate scFv molecules. See Higuchi, in PCR Protocols, pp. 177-183 (Academic Press, 1990); and Vallette et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 17:723-583 (1989). Briefly, when small amounts of template DNA are used as starting material in a PCR, primers that differ slightly in sequence from the corresponding region in a template DNA can be used to generate relatively large quantities of a specific DNA fragment that differs from the template sequence only at the positions where the primers differ from the template. The PCR primers may also be designed to incorporate restriction sites, such that the DNA product of the PCR reaction can be can then be directly ligated into a plasmid or other suitable vector.\n\n\nAnother method for preparing variants, cassette mutagenesis, is based on the technique described by Wells et al., Gene 34:315-323 (1985). The starting material is the plasmid (or other vector) comprising the starting polypeptide DNA to be mutated. The codon(s) in the parent DNA to be mutated are identified. There must be a unique restriction endonuclease site on each side of the identified mutation site(s). If no such restriction sites exist, they may be generated using the above-described oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis method to introduce them at appropriate locations in the starting polypeptide DNA. The plasmid DNA is cut at these sites to linearize it. A double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the sequence of the DNA between the restriction sites but containing the desired mutation(s) is synthesized using standard procedures, wherein the two strands of the oligonucleotide are synthesized separately and then hybridized together using standard techniques. This double-stranded oligonucleotide is referred to as the cassette. This cassette is designed to have 5′ and 3′ ends that are compatible with the ends of the linearized plasmid, such that it can be directly ligated to the plasmid.\n\n\nRepresentative nucleic acids for each of the candidate scFv molecules may be generated by the above methods. The nucleic acids may then be cloned into expression vectors to form an expression vector library. Host cells may then be transformed with the resulting library of vectors, and the host cells cultured under the appropriate conditions in order to express each candidate scFv molecule.\n\n\nC. Screening Methods\n\n\nA scFv library the invention may be screened in an assay (e.g. a high-throughput assay) to identify candidate scFv molecules with desired protein stability. Such an assay may employ any of the methods for evaluating protein stability described in Section VI, supra. A particularly preferred method is a thermal challenge assay.\n\n\nSuch assay methods generally involve comparing the thermal stability of a candidate scFv molecule with that of a suitable control and selecting the candidate scFv molecule if the thermal stability is greater than that of the control. Exemplary suitable controls include conventional scFv molecules, e.g. a (Gly4Ser)3 scFv molecule. Candidate scFv molecules are may be selected if they have a thermal stability that is greater than about 0.1, about 0.25, about 0.5, about 0.75, about 1, about 1.25, about 1.5, about 1.75, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, about 6, about 7, about 8, about 9, or about 10 degrees Celsius than that of the control. In an exemplary embodiment, a candidate scFv molecule is selected if it has a thermal stability than is greater than about 3 degrees Celsius than that of the control.\n\n\nscFv Libraries may be presented in different assay formats. For example, scFv molecules may be presented in solution (e.g., Houghten (1992) \nBiotechniques \n13:412-421), on beads (Lam (1991) \nNature \n354:82-84), chips (Fodor (1993) \nNature \n364:555-556), bacteria (Ladner U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), spores (Ladner U.S. Pat. No. '409), or on phage (Scott and Smith (1990) \nScience \n249:386-390); (Devlin (1990) \nScience \n249:404-406); (Cwirla et al. (1990) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n87:6378-6382); (Felici (1991) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222:301-310); (Ladner supra.).\n\n\nIn certain exemplary embodiments, the candidate scFv molecules are assayed in a solution format. In one embodiment, each sample comprises an aliquout of a solution having candidate scFv molecules with the same candidate stabilizing mutation or mutations. Such a solution can generated by isolating individual host cell colonies from a library of host cells transformed with expression plasmid library and culturing the host cell colony in an appropriate vessel under conditions which facilitate expression of the scFv molecule. In one embodiment, the candidate scFv molecule may be purified from the host cell and resolubilized in an appropriate assay solution. In a more preferred embodiment, the candidate scFv molecule is fused to a cleavable signal peptide sequence such that the scFv molecule is secreted by the host cell into the host cell culture medium. In yet other preferred embodiments, the host cell may be cultured under conditions such that candidate scFv molecule is released into the media, along with host cell proteins.\n\n\nIt may be desirable to automate any of the above assay formats. For example, robotics may be employed to isolate each member of the scFv library (e.g. as individual host cell colonies) in rapid succession so they can be assayed in separate vessels. Examples of assay vessels include microtiter plates (e.g. 96-well microtiter plates), test tubes, and micro-centrifuge tubes.\n\n\nd. Further Optimization of Stabilized scFv Molecules\n\n\nA stable scFv molecule identified by the above screening methods can be re-modeled and further optimized to further improve its protein stability. Thus, the steps described above can be repeated with a stable scFv molecule identified in an initial round of optimization. Alternatively, the stabilizing mutations from two or more stabilized scFv molecules may be combined in a single scFv molecule to further improve protein stability.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the stable scFv molecule identified by the methods of the invention can be further optimized. For example, on or more of the following additional alterations may be made. In one embodiment, a stabilized scFv molecule may be further stabilized by introducing a disulfide bond which links an amino acid in the VL domain with an amino acid in the VH domain. Exemplary disulfide bonds include any the disulfide bonds described in Section II supra. A particularly preferred disulfide bond is VH44-VL100.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the stable scFv molecule identified by the methods of the invention is further optimized by introducing an scFv linker with an optimized length or composition. Exemplary scFv linkers are described in Section II supra. A particularly preferred scFv linker is (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4\n.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the stable scFv molecule identified by the methods of the invention is further optimized by introducing a stabilizing mutation into at least one of the VH or VL domain.\n\n\nIX. Methods for Stabilizing Binding Molecules\n\n\nIn other aspects, the invention provides methods for improving the stability properties of binding molecules. These methods generally involve incorporating or appending a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention to the binding molecule. Surprisingly, as shown in the working examples herein, scFv molecules of the invention are not only stable on their own, they also confer improved stability to binding molecules into which they are incorporated. Accordingly, the methods of the invention provide a convenient and reliable means for improving the stability of commercially valuable binding molecules for which large scale manufacturing is often limited by poor protein stability (e.g. multispecific antibodies (e.g. bispecific antibodies) and other modified antibodies).\n\n\nStabilized scFv molecules may be incorporated into binding molecules using protein conjugation methodology that is known in the art. In one embodiment, the stabilized scFv is fused directly to an N- or C-terminus of a polypeptide, e.g., an antibody molecule. In another embodiment, a non-peptide linker is employed to link the stabilized scFv to an N- or C-terminus of a polypeptide. In yet other embodiments, a connecting peptide is used to link the stabilized scFv to a polypeptide. In an exemplary embodiment, the connecting peptide is a short gly/ser rich peptide. Exemplary Gly/Ser rich peptides are listed in Table 1 below. Other exemplary connecting peptides are known in the art (see, e.g., International PCT Application Nos. WO 2005/000898 and WO 2005/000899). In one embodiment, a stabilized scFv of the invention is linked to the C-terminal end of a binding molecule, e.g., an antibody molecule, using a S(G\n4\nS)\n3 \nlinker. In another embodiment, a stabilized scFv of the invention is linked to the N-terminal end of a binding molecule, e.g., an antibody molecule, using a (G\n4\nS)\n5 \nlinker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting Peptides\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinker\n\n\nNO\n\n\nDNA or Amino Acid Sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Gly\n4\nSer)\n5\n \n\n\n132\n\n\n5′-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGGCGGTGGAGGGTCCGGTGGAGGGGGCTCTGGA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGGGGGCGGTTCAGGGGGCGGTGGATCGGGGGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAGGTGGCTCC-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n133\n\n\nGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSer(Gly\n4\nSer)\n3\n \n\n\n 42\n\n\n5′-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTCCGGCGGGGGTGGATCCGGTGGAGGGGGCTCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGGCGGTGGCGGGTCC-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 43\n\n\nSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one embodiment, at least one stabilized scFv molecule is appended to an antibody molecule to make a bispecific molecule. In another embodiment, two stabilized scFv molecules are appended to an antibody molecule to make a bispecific molecule.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, stabilized binding molecules of the invention result in increased yield as compared to conventional scFv molecules or binding molecules comprising conventional scFv molecules. Methods for evaluating yield are described in Section VI, supra. In one embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule produced by the methods of the invention has an increase in yield of at least 1% relative to the unstabilized binding molecule. In other embodiments, the stabilized binding molecule has an increase in yield of at least 2%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 50%, at least 75%, or at least 100%, relative to the unstabilized binding molecule.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, binding molecules of the invention result in reduced aggregation as compared to conventional scFv molecules or binding molecules comprising conventional scFv molecules. Methods for evaluating aggregation are described in Section VI, supra. In one embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule produced by the methods of the invention has a decrease in aggregation of at least 1% relative to the unstabilized binding molecule. In other embodiments, the stabilized binding molecule has a decrease in aggregation of at least 2%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 50%, at least 75%, or at least 100%, relative to the unstabilized binding molecule.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, binding molecules of the invention result in increased long-term stability or shelf-life as compared to conventional scFv molecules or binding molecules comprising conventional scFv molecules. Methods for evaluating shelf-life include % loss or % proteolysis as described in Section VI, supra. In one embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule produced by the methods of the invention has an increase in shelf life of at least 1 day relative to the unstabilized binding molecule. This means that a preparation of binding molecules has substantially the same amount of stable binding molecules as present on the previous day. In other embodiments, the stabilized binding molecule has an increase in shelf life of at least 2 days, at least 5 days, at least 1 week, at least 2 weeks, at least 1 month, at least 2 months, at least 6 months, or at least 1 year, relative to the unstabilized binding molecule.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, binding molecules of the invention result improved stability e.g., when expressed in a particular host cell type, as compared to conventional scFv molecules or binding molecules comprising conventional scFv molecules. In exemplary embodiments, the methods of the invention result in the production of binding molecules which have increased stability (e.g. increased yield) when the binding molecule is expressed in a host cell, e.g., a bacterial or eukaryotic (e.g., yeast or mammalian) host cell. Exemplary mammalian host cells include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, HELA (human cervical carcinoma) cells, CVI (monkey kidney line) cells, COS (a derivative of CVI with SV40 T antigen) cells, R1610 (Chinese hamster fibroblast) cells, BALBC/3T3 (mouse fibroblast) cells, HAK (hamster kidney line) cells, SP2/O (mouse myeloma) cells, BFA-1c1BPT cells (bovine endothelial cells), RAJI (human lymphocyte) cells and 293 cells (human kidney). In a preferred embodiment, two stabilized scFv molecules are appended to an antibody molecule to create a stabilized bispecific molecule for secretion in CHO cells.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, host cells capable of expressing stabilized binding molecules can be screened to select for single cell isolates that are capable of expressing high levels of solubilized and properly-folded stabilized binding molecules (e.g. binding molecules exhibiting less than 10% aggregation). Such methods may employ fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) techniques (see, for example, Brezinky et al., J Immunol Meth (2003). 277:141-155). In one embodiment, the single cell isolate is adapted to serum-free conditions to establish a stable producer cell line. The stable producer cell line may then be cultured to facilitate large-scale manufacture of a stabilized binding molecule of the invention.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the methods of the invention are employed to improve the stability of a binding molecule that is expressed from a host cell in a large volume of culture media. In exemplary embodiments, the methods of the invention result in an increased stability (e.g. increased yield) when the binding molecule is expressed in at least 1 liter of culture media. In other embodiments, the methods of the invention are used to produce a stabilized binding molecule which has an increased stability (e.g. yield) when expressed from a host cell in at least 2 liters, at least 10 liters, at least 20 liters, at least 50 liters, at least 75 liters, at least 100 liters, at least 200 liters, or at least 500 liters of culture media. In an exemplary embodiment, the methods of the invention are used to produce at least 10 mg of a stabilized binding molecule for every liter of culture media.\n\n\nX. Stabilized Binding Molecules Comprising Stabilized scfv Molecules\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention is a fusion protein. For example, a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention may be linked to a second scFv molecule or a non-scFv molecule. In one embodiment, a non-scFv molecule to which a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention may be linked provides at least one additional binding site. For example, exemplary binding sites that can be included in a binding molecule of the invention include: the receptor binding portion of a ligand, the ligand binding portion of a receptor, the substrate binding portion of an enzyme, the enzyme binding portion of a substrate, or one or more antigen binding portions of an antibody. scFv molecules may be linked, e.g., to antibody molecules to form modified antibody molecules or to other polypeptides to form fusion proteins. Some examples are described below.\n\n\nA. Modified Antibody Molecules\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention is linked to an antibody or fragment thereof to form a stabilized binding protein which is a modified antibody. In another embodiment, a stabilized scFv of the invention is linked to a modified antibody, i.e., non-naturally occurring antibody molecule, to form a stabilized binding protein. Preferred modified antibody constructs are described in more detail below. As used herein, the term “modified antibody” includes synthetic forms of antibodies which are altered such that they are not naturally occurring, e.g., antibodies that comprise at least two heavy chain portions but not two complete heavy chains (such as, domain deleted antibodies or minibodies); multispecific forms of antibodies (e.g., bispecific, trispecific, etc.) altered to bind to two or more different antigens or to different epitopes on a single antigen). In addition, the term “modified antibody” includes multivalent forms of antibodies (e.g., trivalent, tetravalent, etc., antibodies that bind to three or more copies of the same antigen).\n\n\nIt will be understood that when discussing the binding molecules of the invention, the exemplary binding specificities described herein may be imparted by a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention, a binding molecule comprising an scFv molecule of the invention or both.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the stabilized binding proteins of the present invention may be immunoreactive with one or more tumor antigens or antigens associated with immune disorders. For example, for neoplastic disorders, the binding site (i.e. the variable region or immunoreactive fragment or recombinant thereof) of the disclosed binding molecules binds to a selected tumor associated antigen at the site of the malignancy. Similarly, in one embodiment, a binding molecule may bind to at least one selected marker present on immune cells. Given the number of reported antigens associated with neoplasias and immune disorders, and the number of related antibodies, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the presently disclosed binding molecules may therefore be derived from any one of a number of whole antibodies. More generally, polypeptides useful in the present invention may be obtained or derived from any antibody (including those previously reported in the literature) that reacts with a molecule or marker associated with the selected condition. Further, the parent or precursor antibody, or fragment thereof, used to generate the stabilized binding molecules of the invention may be murine, human, chimeric, humanized, non-human primate or primatized.\n\n\nAs used herein, “tumor associated antigens” includes antigens which are generally associated with tumor cells, e.g., expressed on tumor cells. More generally, tumor associated antigens comprise antigens that provide for the localization of immunoreactive antibodies at a neoplastic cell irrespective of its expression on non-malignant cells. Such antigens may be relatively tumor specific, e.g., limited in expression to the surface of malignant cells. Alternatively, such antigens may be found on both malignant and non-malignant cells. For example, CD20 is a pan B antigen that is found on the surface of both malignant and non-malignant B cells that has proved to be an extremely effective target for immunotherapeutic antibodies for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this respect, pan T cell antigens such as CD2, CD3, CD5, CD6 and CD7 also comprise tumor associated antigens within the meaning of the present invention. Still other exemplary tumor associated antigens comprise but not limited to MAGE-1, MAGE-3, MUC-1, \nHPV\n 16, HPV E6 & E7, TAG-72, CEA, L6-Antigen, CD19, CD22, CD37, CD52, HLA-DR, EGF Receptor and HER2 Receptor. In many cases immunoreactive antibodies for each of these antigens have been reported in the literature. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that each of these antibodies may serve as a precursor for antibodies of the invention in accordance with the present invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the stabilized binding molecules of the present invention preferably associate with, and bind to, tumor or immune associated antigens as described above. Accordingly, as will be discussed in some detail below the stabilized binding molecules of the present invention may be derived, generated or fabricated from any one of a number of antibodies that react with tumor associated antigens. In certain embodiments the stabilized binding molecules of the invention are domain deleted antibodies that are derived using common genetic engineering techniques whereby at least a portion of one or more constant region domains are deleted or altered so as to provide the desired biochemical characteristics such as reduced serum half-life. More particularly, one skilled in the art may readily isolate the genetic sequence corresponding to the variable and/or constant regions of the subject stabilized binding molecule and delete or alter the appropriate nucleotides to provide polypeptides of the invention for use as monomeric subunits in accordance with the instant invention.\n\n\nPreviously reported antibodies that react with tumor associated antigens may be stabilized as described herein to provide the stabilized binding molecules of the present invention. Exemplary antibodies that may be used to provide antigen binding regions to generate or derive the disclosed stabilized binding molecules include, but are not limited to 2B8 and C2B8 (Zevalin® and Rituxan®, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corp., San Diego), Lym 1 and Lym 2 (Techniclone), LL2 (Immunomedics Corp., New Jersey), HER2 (Herceptin®, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco), B1 (Bexxar®, Coulter Pharm., San Francisco), Campath® (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge), abagovomab (Menarini, Italy), CEA-Scan™ (Immunomedics, Morris Plains, N.J.), capromab (Prostascint®, Cytogen Corp.), edrecolomab (Panorex®, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J.), igovomab (C1S Bio Intl., France), mitumomab (BEC2, Imclone Systems, Somerville, N.J.), nofetumomab (Verluma®, Boehringer Ingleheim, Ridgefield, Conn.), OvaRex (Altarex Corp., Waltham, Mass.), satumomab (Onoscint®, Cytogen Corp.), cetuximab (Erbitux®, Imclone Systems, New York, N.Y.), bevacizumab (AVASTIN®, Genentech Inc., S.

Other binding sites that can be incorporated into the subject binding molecules include those found in: Orthoclone OKT3 (CD3), ReoPro (GpIIb/gIIa), Zenapax (C25), Remicade (TNF-a), Simulect (CD25), Synagis (RSV), Mylotarg (CD33), and Campath (CD52). In preferred embodiments, the stabilized binding molecules of the present invention will bind to the same tumor associated antigens as the antibodies enumerated immediately above. In particularly preferred embodiments, the stabilized binding molecules will be derived from or bind the same antigens as 2B8, C2B8, CC49 and C5E10 and, even more preferably, will lack all or part of a CH2 domain.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention may have one or more binding sites derived from one or more of the following antibodies. tositumomab (BEXXAR®), muromonab (ORTHOCLONE®) and ibritumomab (ZEVALIN®), cetuximab (ERBITUX™), rituximab (MABTHERA®/RITUXAN®), infliximab (REMICADE®), abciximab (REOPRO®) and basiliximab (SIMULECT®), efalizumab (RAPTIVA®, bevacizumab (AVASTIN®), alemtuzumab (CAMPATH®), trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN®), gemtuzumab (MYLOTARG®), palivizumab (SYNAGIS®), omalizumab (XOLAIR®), daclizumab (ZENAPAX®), natalizumab (TYSABRI®) and ranibizumab (LUVENTIS®), adalimumab (HUMIRA®) and panitumumab (VECTIBIX®).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention binds to CD23 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,011,138). In a preferred embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention binds to the same epitope as the 5E8 antibody. In another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one CDR (e.g., at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 CDRs) from an anti-CD23 antibody, e.g., the 5E8 antibody.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention binds to a TNF receptor. In one exemplary embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention binds to a LTβR. In another exemplary embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention binds to a TRAIL receptor. In another embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one CDR(e.g., at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 CDRs) from an anti-TRAIL-R2 antibody (e.g. murine or chimeric 14A2). In another embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one CDR from an anti-LTβR antibody. Examples of anti-LTβR antibodies include. BKA11, CDH10, BCG6, AGH1, BDA8, CBE11 and BHA10.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention binds to the CRIPTO-I antigen (WO02/088170A2 or WO03/083041A2). In a preferred embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention binds to the same epitope as the B3F6 antibody. In another embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one CDR from an anti-CRIPTO-I antibody, e.g., the B3F6 antibody.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the stabilized binding molecule will bind to the same tumor associated antigen as Rituxan®. Rituxan® (also known as, rituximab, IDEC-C2B8 and C2B8) was the first FDA-approved monoclonal antibody for treatment of human B-cell lymphoma (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,843,439; 5,776,456 and 5,736,137 each of which is incorporated herein by reference). Y2B8 (90Y labeled 2B8; Zevalin®; ibritumomab tiuxetan) is the murine parent of C2B8. Rituxan® is a chimeric, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody which is growth inhibitory and reportedly sensitizes certain lymphoma cell lines for apoptosis by chemotherapeutic agents in vitro. The antibody efficiently binds human complement, has strong FcR binding, and can effectively kill human lymphocytes in vitro via both complement dependent (CDC) and antibody-dependent (ADCC) mechanisms (Reff et al., Blood 83: 435-445 (1994)). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that dimeric variants (homodimers or heterodimers) of C2B8 or 2B8, modified according to the instant disclosure, may be used in conjugated or unconjugated forms to effectively treat patients presenting with CD20 +malignancies. More generally, it must be reiterated that the stabilized binding molecule disclosed herein may be used in either a “naked” or unconjugated state or conjugated to a cytotoxic agent to effectively treat any one of a number of disorders.\n\n\nIn other preferred embodiments of the present invention, the stabilized binding molecule of the invention will be derived from, or bind to, the same tumor associated antigen as CC49. CC49 binds human tumor associated antigen TAG-72 which is associated with the surface of certain tumor cells of human origin, specifically the LS174T tumor cell line. LS174T [American Type Culture Collection (herein ATCC) No. CL 188] is a variant of the LS180 (ATCC No. CL 187) colon adenocarcinoma line. It will further be appreciated that numerous murine monoclonal antibodies have been developed which have binding specificity for TAG-72. One of these monoclonal antibodies, designated B72.3, is a murine IgG1 produced by hybridoma B72.3 (ATCC No. HB-8108). B72.3 is a first generation monoclonal antibody developed using a human breast carcinoma extract as the immunogen (see Colcher et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 78:3199-3203 (1981); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,918 and 4,612,282 each of which is incorporated herein by reference). Other monoclonal antibodies directed against TAG-72 are designated “CC” (for colon cancer). As described by Schlom et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,443 which is incorporated herein by reference) CC monoclonal antibodies are a family of second generation murine monoclonal antibodies that were prepared using TAG-72 purified with B72.3. Because of their relatively good binding affinities to TAG-72, the following CC antibodies have been deposited at the ATCC, with restricted access having been requested: CC49 (ATCC No. HB 9459); CC 83 (ATCC No. BB 9453); CC46 (ATCC No. HB 9458); CC92 (ATTCC No. HB 9454); CC30 (ATCC No. HB 9457); CC11 (ATCC No. 9455); and CC15 (ATCC No. HB 9460). U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,443 further teaches that the disclosed antibodies may be altered into their chimeric form by substituting, e.g., human constant regions (Fc) domains for mouse constant regions by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art. Besides disclosing murine and chimeric anti-TAG-72 antibodies, Schlom et al. have also produced variants of a humanized CC49 antibody as disclosed in PCT/US99/25552 and single chain constructs as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,892,019 each of which is also incorporated herein by reference. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that each of the foregoing antibodies, constructs or recombinants, and variations thereof, may be modified and used to provide polypeptides in accordance with the present invention.\n\n\nIn addition to the anti-TAG-72 antibodies discussed above, various groups have also reported the construction and partial characterization of domain-deleted CC49 and B72.3 antibodies (e.g., Calvo et al. Cancer Biotherapy, 8(1):95-109 (1993), Slavin-Chiorini et al. Int. J. Cancer 53:97-103 (1993) and Slavin-Chiorini et al. Cancer. Res. 55:5957-5967 (1995\n\n\nStill other preferred embodiments of the present invention comprise binding sites that are derived from or bind to the same tumor associated antigen as C5E10. As set forth in co-pending application Ser. No. 09/104,717, C5E10 is an antibody that recognizes a glycoprotein determinant of approximately 115 kDa that appears to be specific to prostate tumor cell lines (e.g. DU145, PC3, or ND1). Thus, in conjunction with the present invention, stabilized binding molecules (e.g. CH2 domain-deleted antibodies) that specifically bind to the same tumor associated antigen recognized by C5E10 antibodies could be produced and used in a conjugated or unconjugated form for the treatment of neoplastic disorders. In particularly preferred embodiments, the stabilized binding molecule will be derived or comprise all or part of the antigen binding region of the C5E10 antibody as secreted from the hybridoma cell line having ATCC accession No. PTA-865. The resulting stabilized binding molecule could then be conjugated to a radionuclide as described below and administered to a patient suffering from prostate cancer in accordance with the methods herein.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the stabilized binding molecules of the invention have at least one of the binding specificities described herein, e.g., in Section C infra. In another embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention may bind to a target molecule of interest, e.g., described herein, e.g., in section B or C, infra.\n\n\nPreviously reported antibodies that react with antigens associated with immune-cell disorders (e.g., B-cell disorders) may be stabilized as described herein to provide the stabilized binding molecules of the present invention. Exemplary antibodies that may be used to provide antigen binding regions to generate or derive the disclosed stabilized binding molecules include, but are not limited to an anti-TNFα antibody (e.g., infliximab (Remicade®, Centocor, Horsham, Pa.); MAK 195-F (Abbott Labs., Abbott Park, Ill.); adalimumab (Humira®, Abbott Labs, Abbott Park, Ill.); an anti-CD3 antibody (e.g., Orthoclone (OKT3®, OrthoBiotech, Bridgewater, N.J.); MEDI-500 (Medimmune, Gaithersburg, Md.); visilizumab (NUVION®, Protein Design Labs (Fremont, Calif., USA)), an anti-IgE antibody (e.g., omalizumab, XOLAIR®, Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif.), an anti-VLA-4 antibody (e.g., TYSABRI®), BiogenIdec, Cambridge, Mass.), an anti-CD147 antibody (e.g., ABX-CBL (Abgenix, Fremont, Calif.)), an anti-CD25 antibody (e.g., basiliximab, Simulect® (East Hanover, N.J.); Inolimomab (OPI, France), an anti-CD18 antibody (e.g., odulimomab, Antilfa®, Pateur Meriuex, France), anti-NCA90 (e.g., sulesomab, Leukoscan®, Immunomedics, Morris Plains, N.J.), an anti-GpIIb/gIIa antibody (e.g., abciximab, ReoPro®, Centocor, Horsham, Pa.), an anti-C25 antibody (e.g., Zenapax), an anti-CD33 antibody (e.g., Mylotarg), and an anti-CD25 antibody (e.g., alemtuzumab, Campath® (Milleneum Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Mass.). In preferred embodiments, the stabilized binding molecules of the present invention will bind to the same immune-cell associated antigens as the antibodies enumerated immediately above.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the term, “modified antibody” according to the present invention includes immunoglobulins, antibodies, or immunoreactive fragments or recombinants thereof, in which at least a fraction of one or more of the constant region domains has been deleted or otherwise altered so as to provide desired biochemical characteristics such as the ability to non-covalently dimerize, increased ability to localize at the site of a tumor, or reduced serum half-life when compared with a whole, unaltered antibody of approximately the same immunogenicity. In a preferred embodiment, the polypeptides of the present invention are domain deleted antibodies which comprise a polypeptide chain similar to an immunoglobulin heavy chain, but which lack at least a portion of one or more heavy chain domains. In one embodiment, one entire domain of the constant region of the stabilized binding protein will be deleted. In another embodiment, all or part of the CH2 domain will be deleted.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the stabilized binding proteins of the invention are minibodies. Minibodies are dimeric molecules made up of two polypeptide chains each comprising a stabilized scFv molecule (a single polypeptide comprising one or more antigen binding sites, e.g., a VL domain linked by a flexible linker to a VH domain fused to a CH3 domain via a connecting peptide.\n\n\nMinibodies can be made by constructing an scFv component and connecting peptide-CH3 component using methods described in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,821 or WO 94/09817A1). These components can be isolated from separate plasmids as restriction fragments and then ligated and recloned into an appropriate vector. Appropriate assembly can be verified by restriction digestion and DNA sequence analysis.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a tetravalent minibody can be constructed. Tetravalent minibodies can be constructed in the same manner as minibodies, except that two scFv molecules are linked using a flexible linker, e.g., having an amino acid sequence (G\n4\nS)\n4\nG\n3\nAS(SEQ ID NO: 23).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, tetravalent antibodies can be produced by combining a DNA sequence encoding an antibody with a scFv molecule. For example, in one embodiment, these sequences are combined such that the scFv molecule is linked at its N-terminus to the CH3 domain of the antibody via a flexible linker (e.g., a gly/ser linker such as (Gly\n4\nSer)\n3\n.\n\n\nIn another embodiment a tetravalent antibody can be made by fusing n stabilized scFv molecule to a connecting peptide, which is fused to a CH1 domain to construct a stabilized scFv—Fab tetravalent molecule (Coloma and Morrison. 1997. Nature Biotechnology. 15:159; WO 95/09917).\n\n\nIn one embodiment a stabilized binding molecule of the invention comprises a tetravalent or bispecific tetravalent antibody with an scFv appended to the N-terminus of the light chain. In another embodiment of the invention, a binding molecule comprises a tetravalent or bispecific tetravalent CH2 domain-deleted antibody with an scFv appended to the N-terminus of the heavy chain. In one embodiment, the attachment of the scFv to the N-terminus results in reduced aggregation of the molecules as compared to molecules in which the scFv is attached at the carboxy-terminus.\n\n\nAntibodies or fragments thereof for use in a stabilized binding molecule of the invention may be obtained using art recognized protocols, for example, antibodies are preferably raised in mammals by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections of the relevant antigen (e.g., purified tumor associated antigens or cells or cellular extracts comprising such antigens) and an adjuvant. This immunization typically elicits an immune response that comprises production of antigen-reactive antibodies from activated splenocytes or lymphocytes. While the resulting antibodies may be harvested from the serum of the animal to provide polyclonal preparations, it is often desirable to isolate individual lymphocytes from the spleen, lymph nodes or peripheral blood to provide homogenous preparations of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Preferably, the lymphocytes are obtained from the spleen.\n\n\nIn this well known process (Kohler et al., \nNature, \n256:495 (1975)) the relatively short-lived, or mortal, lymphocytes from a mammal which has been injected with antigen are fused with an immortal tumor cell line (e.g. a myeloma cell line), thus, producing hybrid cells or “hybridomas” which are both immortal and capable of producing the genetically coded antibody of the B cell. The resulting hybrids are segregated into single genetic strains by selection, dilution, and regrowth with each individual strain comprising specific genes for the formation of a single antibody. They produce antibodies which are homogeneous against a desired antigen and, in reference to their pure genetic parentage, are termed “monoclonal.”\n\n\nHybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that reagents, cell lines and media for the formation, selection and growth of hybridomas are commercially available from a number of sources and standardized protocols are well established. Generally, culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies against the desired antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of the monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro assay, such as a radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, \nMonoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice\n, pp 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). It will further be appreciated that the monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be separated from culture medium, ascites fluid or serum by conventional purification procedures such as, for example, protein-A, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis or affinity chromatography.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, DNA encoding desired monoclonal antibodies may be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The isolated and subcloned hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells such as \nE. coli \ncells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulins. More particularly, the isolated DNA (which may be synthetic as described herein) may be used to clone constant and variable region sequences for the manufacture antibodies as described in Newman et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,570, filed Jan. 25, 1995, which is incorporated by reference herein. Essentially, this entails extraction of RNA from the selected cells, conversion to cDNA, and amplification by PCR using Ig specific primers. Suitable primers for this purpose are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,570. As will be discussed in more detail below, transformed cells expressing the desired antibody may be grown up in relatively large quantities to provide clinical and commercial supplies of the immunoglobulin.\n\n\nThose skilled in the art will also appreciate that DNA encoding antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g., antigen binding sites) may also be derived from antibody phage libraries, e.g., using pd phage or Fd phagemid technology. Exemplary methods are set forth, for example, in EP 368 684 B1; U.S. Pat. No. 5,969,108, Hoogenboom, H. R. and Chames. 2000\n. Immunol. Today \n21:371; Nagy et al. 2002\n. Nat. Med. \n8:801; Huie et al. 2001\n. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n98:2682; Lui et al. 2002\n. J. Mol. Biol. \n315:1063, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Several publications (e.g., Marks et al. \nBio/Technology \n10:779-783 (1992)) have described the production of high affinity human antibodies by chain shuffling, as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing large phage libraries. In another embodiment, Ribosomal display can be used to replace bacteriophage as the display platform (see, e.g., Hanes et al. 2000\n. Nat. Biotechnol. \n18:1287; Wilson et al. 2001\n. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n98:3750; or Irving et al. 2001 \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n248:31. In yet another embodiment, cell surface libraries can be screened for antibodies (Boder et al. 2000. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:10701; Daugherty et al. 2000 \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n243:211. Such procedures provide alternatives to traditional hybridoma techniques for the isolation and subsequent cloning of monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the present invention a binding site of a binding molecule of the invention may be provided by a human or substantially human antibody. Human or substantially human antibodies may be made in transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are incapable of endogenous immunoglobulin production (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,075,181, 5,939,598, 5,591,669 and 5,589,369 each of which is incorporated herein by reference). For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of a human immunoglobulin gene array to such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. Another preferred means of generating human antibodies using SCID mice is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,524 which is incorporated herein by reference. It will be appreciated that the genetic material associated with these human antibodies may also be isolated and manipulated as described herein.\n\n\nYet another highly efficient means for generating recombinant antibodies is disclosed by Newman, \nBiotechnology, \n10: 1455-1460 (1992). Specifically, this technique results in the generation of primatized antibodies that contain monkey variable domains and human constant sequences. This reference is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. Moreover, this technique is also described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,658,570, 5,693,780 and 5,756,096 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, lymphocytes can be selected by micromanipulation and the variable genes isolated. For example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells can be isolated from an immunized mammal and cultured for about 7 days in vitro. The cultures can be screened for specific IgGs that meet the screening criteria. Cells from positive wells can be isolated. Individual Ig-producing B cells can be isolated by FACS or by identifying them in a complement-mediated hemolytic plaque assay. Ig-producing B cells can be micromanipulated into a tube and the VH and VL genes can be amplified using, e.g., RT-PCR. The VH and VL genes can be cloned into an antibody expression vector and transfected into cells (e.g., eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells) for expression.\n\n\nMoreover, genetic sequences useful for producing the binding molecules of the present invention may be obtained from a number of different sources. For example, as discussed extensively above, a variety of human antibody genes are available in the form of publicly accessible deposits. Many sequences of antibodies and antibody-encoding genes have been published and suitable antibody genes can be chemically synthesized from these sequences using art recognized techniques. Oligonucleotide synthesis techniques compatible with this aspect of the invention are well known to the skilled artisan and may be carried out using any of several commercially available automated synthesizers. In addition, DNA sequences encoding several types of heavy and light chains set forth herein can be obtained through the services of commercial DNA synthesis vendors. The genetic material obtained using any of the foregoing methods may then be altered or synthetic to provide obtain polypeptides of the present invention.\n\n\nAlternatively, antibody-producing cell lines may be selected and cultured using techniques well known to the skilled artisan. Such techniques are described in a variety of laboratory manuals and primary publications. In this respect, techniques suitable for use in the invention as described below are described in \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology\n, Coligan et al., Eds., Green Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, John Wiley and Sons, New York (1991) which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, including supplements.\n\n\nIt will further be appreciated that the scope of this invention encompasses stabilized binding molecules comprising alleles, variants and mutations of art recognized antigen binding DNA sequences and a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention.\n\n\nAs is well known, RNA may be isolated from the original hybridoma cells or from other transformed cells by standard techniques, such as guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and precipitation followed by centrifugation or chromatography. Where desirable, mRNA may be isolated from total RNA by standard techniques such as chromatography on oligo dT cellulose. Suitable techniques are familiar in the art.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, cDNAs that encode the light and the heavy chains of the antibody may be made, either simultaneously or separately, using reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase in accordance with well known methods. PCR may be initiated by consensus constant region primers or by more specific primers based on the published heavy and light chain DNA and amino acid sequences. As discussed above, PCR also may be used to isolate DNA clones encoding the antibody light and heavy chains. In this case the libraries may be screened by consensus primers or larger homologous probes, such as mouse constant region probes.\n\n\nDNA, typically plasmid DNA, may be isolated from the cells using techniques known in the art, restriction mapped and sequenced in accordance with standard, well known techniques set forth in detail, e.g., in the foregoing references relating to recombinant DNA techniques. Of course, the DNA may be synthetic according to the present invention at any point during the isolation process or subsequent analysis. Exemplary antibodies or fragments thereof for use in the binding molecules of the invention include antibodies that recognize the targets set forth herein.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, antigen binding fragments of antibodies can be produced using techniques well known in the art.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention may comprise a complete antibody molecule and a stabilized scFv molecule. In another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention may comprise a portion of an antibody molecule and a a stabilized scFv molecule.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises a fragment or portion of an antibody and a stabilized scFv molecule. For example, in one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention may comprise a domain deleted antibody and a stabilized scFv molecule. Domain deleted antibodies are antibody molecules in which one or more domains are partially or entirely deleted. In especially preferred embodiments compatible stabilized binding molecules will comprise domain deleted constructs or variants wherein the entire CH2 domain has been removed (ΔCH2 constructs). For other preferred embodiments a short connecting peptide may be substituted for the deleted domain to provide flexibility and freedom of movement for the variable region. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that such constructs are particularly preferred due to the regulatory properties of the CH2 domain on the catabolic rate of the antibody.\n\n\nDomain deleted constructs can be derived using a vector (e.g., from IDEC Pharmaceuticals, San Diego) encoding an IgG\n1 \nhuman constant domain (see, e.g., WO 02/060955A2 and WO02/096948A2). It will be noted that these exemplary constructs were engineered to fuse the CH3 domain directly to a hinge region of the respective polypeptides of the invention. In other constructs it may be desirable to provide a peptide spacer between the hinge region and the synthetic CH2 and/or CH3 domains. For example, compatible constructs could be expressed wherein the CH2 domain has been deleted and the remaining CH3 domain (synthetic or unsynthetic) is joined to the hinge region with a 5-20 amino acid spacer. Such a spacer may be added, for instance, to ensure that the regulatory elements of the constant domain remain free and accessible or that the hinge region remains flexible. For example, a domain deleted B3F6 construct having a short amino acid spacer substituted for the CH2 domain and the lower hinge region (B3F6.ΔCH2 [gly/ser]) can be used. Other exemplary connecting peptides are known in the art (see, e.g., International PCT Application Nos. WO 2005/000898 and WO 2005/000899). These connecting peptides can be used in connection with the binding molecules of the invention. Preferably, the connecting peptides are used with a polypeptide lacking a CH2 heavy chain domain. Preferably, any connecting peptide compatible with the instant invention will be relatively non-immunogenic and not inhibit the non-covalent association of the polypeptides of the invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain having deletion or substitution of a few or even a single amino acid as long as it permits the desired covalent or non-covalent association between the monomeric subunits. For example, the mutation of a single amino acid in selected areas of the CH2 domain may be enough to substantially reduce Fc binding and thereby increase tumor localization. Similarly, it may be desirable to simply delete that part of one or more constant region domains that control the effector function (e.g. complement binding) to be modulated. Such partial deletions of the constant regions may improve selected characteristics of the antibody (serum half-life) while leaving other desirable functions associated with the subject constant region domain intact. Moreover, as alluded to above, the constant regions of the disclosed antibodies may be synthetic through the mutation or substitution of one or more amino acids that enhances the profile of the resulting construct. In this respect it may be possible to disrupt the activity provided by a conserved binding site (e.g. Fc binding) while substantially maintaining the configuration and immunogenic profile of the stabilized binding molecule. Yet other preferred embodiments may comprise the addition of one or more amino acids to the constant region to enhance desirable characteristics such as effector function or provide for more cytotoxin or carbohydrate attachment. In such embodiments it may be desirable to insert or replicate specific sequences derived from selected constant region domains.\n\n\nIt is known in the art that the constant region mediates several effector functions. For example, binding of the C1 component of complement to antibodies activates the complement system. Activation of complement is important in the opsonisation and lysis of cell pathogens. The activation of complement also stimulates the inflammatory response and may also be involved in autoimmune hypersensitivity. Further, antibodies bind to cells via the Fc region, with a Fc receptor site on the antibody Fc region binding to a Fc receptor (FcR) on a cell. There are a number of Fc receptors which are specific for different classes of antibody, including IgG (gamma receptors), IgE (epsilon receptors), IgA (alpha receptors) and IgM (mu receptors). Binding of antibody to Fc receptors on cell surfaces triggers a number of important and diverse biological responses including engulfment and destruction of antibody-coated particles, clearance of immune complexes, lysis of antibody-coated target cells by killer cells (called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or ADCC), release of inflammatory mediators, placental transfer and control of immunoglobulin production.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, effector functions may be eliminated or reduced by using a constant region of an IgG4 antibody, which is thought to be unable to deplete target cells, or making Fc variants, wherein residues in the Fc region critical for effector function(s) are mutated using techniques known in the art, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,097. For example, the deletion or inactivation (through point mutations or other means) of a constant region domain may reduce Fc receptor binding of the circulating stabilized binding molecule thereby increasing tumor localization. In other cases it may be that constant region modifications consistent with the instant invention moderate compliment binding and thus reduce the serum half life and nonspecific association of a conjugated cytotoxin. Yet other modifications of the constant region may be used to modify disulfide linkages or oligosaccharide molecules that allow for enhanced localization due to increased antigen specificity or antibody flexibility. More generally, those skilled in the art will realize that antibodies modified as described herein may exert a number of subtle effects that may or may not be readily appreciated. However the resulting physiological profile, bioavailability and other biochemical effects of the modifications, such as tumor localization, biodistribution and serum half-life, may easily be measured and quantified using well know immunological techniques without undue experimentation.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, modified forms of antibodies can be made from a whole precursor or parent antibody using techniques known in the art. Exemplary techniques are discussed in more detail herein.\n\n\nB. Modified Fusion Proteins\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention is a modified fusion protein. In one exemplary embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is a fusion protein comprising a stabilized scFv molecule linked to the ligand-binding region of a receptor, an adhesion molecule, a ligand, or an enzyme. In another exemplary embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is fusion protein comprising a stabilized scFv molecule linked to a receptor binding portion of ligand. For example a binding molecule of the invention is fusion protein comprising a stabilized scFv molecule to one or more of the following molecules:\n\n\nCytokines and Cytokine Receptors\n\n\nCytokines have pleiotropic effects on the proliferation, differentiation, and functional activation of lymphocytes. Various cytokines, or receptor binding portions thereof, can be utilized in the fusion proteins of the invention.

Binding Specificity\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention binds to a target molecule that is present on the surface of a cell or that is soluble.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, at least one binding specificity of a binding molecule of the invention is catalytic. Catalytic binding specificities can be made using art recognized techniques (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,590,080, 5,658,753). Catalytic binding specificities can work by a number of basic mechanisms similar to those identified for enzymes to stabilize the transition state, thereby reducing the free energy of activation. For example, general acid and base residues can be optimally positioned for participation in catalysis within catalytic active sites; covalent enzyme-substrate intermediates can be formed; catalytic antibodies can also be in proper orientation for reaction and increase the effective concentration of reactants by at least seven orders of magnitude (Fersht, A. R., et al., Am. Chem. Soc. 90 (1968):5833) and thereby greatly reduce the entropy of a chemical reaction. Finally, catalytic antibodies can convert the energy obtained upon substrate binding to distort the reaction towards a structure resembling the transition state.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, acid or base residues can be brought into the binding site by using a complementary charged molecule as an immunogen. This technique proved successful for elicitation of antibodies with a hapten containing a positively-charged ammonium ion (Shokat, et al., Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 27 (1988):269-271).\n\n\nIn another approach, antibodies can be elicited to stable compounds that resemble the size, shape, and charge of the transition state of a desired reaction (i.e., transition state analogs). See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,792,446 and 4,963,355 which describe the use of transition state analogues to immunize animals and the production of catalytic antibodies. Both of these patents are hereby incorporated by reference. In one embodiment, such molecules can be administered as part of an immunoconjugate, e.g., with an immunogenic carrier molecule, such as KLH.\n\n\nExemplary catalytic binding specificities can have, e.g., esterase activity (involving a charged transition state whose electrostatic and shape characteristics can be mimicked by a phosphonate structure; Jacobs, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 109 (1987):2174-2176; Durfor, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110 (1988):8713-8714; Tramontano, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110 (1988):2282; Pollack, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111 (1989):5961-5962); peptidase or amidase activity (Janda, et al., Science 241 (1988):1188-1191; Iverson, et al., Science 243 (1989):1184-1188; Paul, et al., Science 244 (1989):1158-1162); Claisen rearrangement (Jackson, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110 (1988):4841-4842; Hilvert, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 (1988):4953-4955; Hilvert, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110 (1988):5593-5594); redox reactions (Shokat, et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 27 (1989):269-271); photochemical cleavage of a thymine dimer (Cochran, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110 (1988):7888-7890); stereospecific transesterification rearrangements (Napper, et al., Science 237 (1987):1041-1043); or a bimolecular amide synthesis (Benkovic, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 (1988):5355-5358; Janda, et al., Science 241 (1988):1188-1191).\n\n\nIn another approach, conventional binding specificities can be mutated to render them catalytic.\n\n\nMethods of screening for catalytic antibody activity are well known in the art (e.g., Reymond, J. L. 2002. Journal of Immunological Methods 269:125; Mouratou et al. 2002. J. of Immunological Methods. 269:147. In yet another embodiment, catalytic B cells can be selected, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,590,080 using a molecule can be constructed which facilitates selection of catalytic B cells.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, catalytic binding specificities can be developed as part of a two step process. Catalytic antibodies can be selected only if displaying the following binding features: binding both the substrate and a reactive group in such a way that the two groups are in a reactive position towards each other. Second, the selected antibodies can be chemically engineered by covalently binding a reactive group into the binding pocket of the antibody. J Immunol Methods. 2002. 269:81-98.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a catalytic binding specificity is specific for a prodrug. Such a binding specificity can be used to catalyze the conversion of a prodrug into a drug which is effective in vivo. Preferably, the reaction catalyzed is one that cannot be accomplished by natural enzymes in vivo. Examples of prodrug activation by antibodies are known in the art (see, e.g., Miyashita et al. 1993. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5337).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one binding specificity for a target cell and at least one binding specificity for a prodrug. For example, in a preferred embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one binding specificity for a tumor cell and at least one binding specificity for a prodrug which can be converted to cytotoxic drug. In one example, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention comprises a binding specificity for a carbamate prodrug 4-[N,N,-bis(2-chloroethyl)]aminophenyl-N-[(1S-(1,3-dicarboxy)propyl]carbamate and generates the corresponding cytotoxic nitrogen mustard (Wentworth et al. 1996. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 93:799).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, binding molecule is administered prior to administration of the prodrug to allow accumulation at the site of the target cell. Exemplary prodrugs are known in the art. Prodrugs can also be synthesized by incorporating a portion designed to be released by catalytic action, e.g., by sequential retro-aldol/retro-Michael reactions catalyzed by an antibody with aldolase activity. (Shabat et al. 2001. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98:7428). Such drug masking portions can be made, e.g., by modification of hydroxyl or thiol groups of drugs.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is multispecific, i.e., has at least one binding site that binds to a first target molecule or epitope of the target molecule and at least one second binding site that binds to a second, different target molecule or to a second, different epitope of the first target molecule. In certain embodiments, multispecific binding molecules of the invention (e.g. bispecific binding molecules) comprise at least one binding site from any of the antibodies described in herein, e.g., Section A, supra.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is bispecific. Bispecific molecules can bind to two different target sites, e.g., on the same target molecule or on different target molecules. For example, in the case of antibodies, bispecific molecules can bind to two different epitopes, e.g., on the same antigen or on two different antigens. Bispecific molecules can be used, e.g., in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. For example, they can be used to immobilize enzymes for use in immunoassays. They can also be used in diagnosis and treatment of cancer, e.g., by binding both to a tumor associated molecule and a detectable marker (e.g., a chelator which tightly binds a radionuclide. Bispecific molecules can also be used for human therapy, e.g., by directing cytotoxicity to a specific target (for example by binding to a pathogen or tumor cell and to a cytotoxic trigger molecule, such as the T cell receptor or the Fcγ receptor. Bispecific antibodies can also be used, e.g., as fibrinolytic agents or vaccine adjuvants.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention include those with at least one arm (ie. binding site) directed against a cell-surface molecule, and at least one arm directed against a soluble molecule. In another embodiment, a multispecific antibody of the invention has two binding sites that bind to soluble molecules. In another embodiment, a multispecific antibody of the invention has two binding sites that bind to cell surface molecules.\n\n\nThe multispecific binding molecules of the invention may be monovalent for each specificity or multivalent for each specificity. In one embodiment, a bispecific binding molecule of the invention may comprise one binding site that reacts with a first target molecule and one binding site that reacts with a second target molecule (e.g. a bispecific antibody molecule, fusion protein, or minibody). In another embodiment, a bispecific binding molecule of the invention may comprise two binding sites that react with a first target molecule and two binding sites that react with a second target molecule (e.g. a bispecific scFv2 tetravalent antibody, tetravalent minibody, or diabody).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, at least one binding site of a multispecific binding molecule of the invention is an antigen binding region of an antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention are bivalent antibodies or antibody variants with one arm containing at least one stabilized scFv directed to a first target molecule and a second arm containing at least one stabilized scFv directed to a second target molecule.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention comprise at least one stabilized scFv (e.g. 2, 3, or 4 scFvs) linked to the C-terminus of a heavy chain, wherein the scFvs have the same or different binding specificity.

An exemplary binding molecule of this type (a “N\nH\n-Hercules” antibody) is shown in \nFIG. 13\n. In another embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention comprise at least one stabilized scFv (e.g. 2, 3, or 4 scFvs) linked to the N-terminus of a light chain, wherein the scFvs have the same or different binding specificity. An exemplary binding molecule of this type (a “N\nL\n-Hercules” antibody) is shown in \nFIG. 13\n. In another embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention comprise at least one stabilized scFv (e.g., 2, 3, or 4 scFvs linked to the N-terminus of the heavy chain or light chain and at least one stabilized scFv (e.g., 2, 3, or 4 scFvs) linked to the C-terminus of the heavy chain, wherein the scFvs have the same or different binding specificity.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention are bivalent minibodies with one arm containing at least one scFv fragment directed to a first target molecule and a second arm containing at least one scFv directed to a second target molecule wherein at least one of the scFv molecules is stabilized. An exemplary bispecific bivalent minibody construct is shown in \nFIG. 42\n. In \nFIG. 42\n a CH3 domain is fused at its N-terminus to a connecting peptide which is fused at its N-terminus to a VH domain which is fused via its N-terminus to a (Gly4Ser)n flexible linker which is fused at its N-terminus to a VL domain.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention are scFv tetravalent minibodies, with each heavy chain portion of the scFv tetravalent minibody containing first and second scFv fragments wherein at least one of the scFv molecules is stabilized. Said second scFv fragment may be linked to the N-terminus of the first scFv fragment (e.g. bispecific N\nH \nscFv tetravalent minibodies or bispecific N\nL \nscFv tetravalent minibodies). An example of a bispecific N-scFv tetravalent minibody is shown in \nFIG. 43\n. Alternatively, the second scFv fragment may be linked to the C-terminus of said heavy chain portion containing said first scFv fragment (e.g. bispecific C-scFv tetravalent minibodies). An example of a bispecific C-scFv tetravalent minibody is shown in \nFIG. 44\n. In one embodiment, the first and second scFv fragments of may bind the same or different target molecule. Where the first and second scFv fragments of a first heavy chain portion of a bispecific tetravalent minibody bind the same target molecule, at least one of the first and second scFv fragments of the second heavy chain portion of the bispecific tetravalent minibody binds a different target molecule.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention are bispecific diabodies, with each arm of the diabody comprising tandem scFv fragments at least one of which is stabilized. In one embodiment, a bispecific diabody may comprise a first arm with a first binding specificity and a second arm with a second binding specificity (see, for example, \nFIG. 45\n). In another embodiment, each arm of the diabody may comprise a first scFv fragment with a first binding specificity and a second scFv fragment with a second binding specificity.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention are scFv2 tetravalent antibodies with each heavy chain portion of the scFv2 tetravalent antibody containing an scFv molecule, wherein at least one of the scFv molecules are stabilized. The scFv fragments may be linked to the N-termini of a variable region of the heavy chain portions (e.g. bispecific N\nH \nscFv2 tetravalent antibodies or bispecific N\nL \nscFv2 tetravalent antibodies). Alternatively, the scFv fragments may be linked to the C-termini of the heavy chain portions of the scFv2 tetravalent antibody (e.g. bispecific C-scFv2 tetravalent antibodies, see for example \nFIG. 46\n). Each heavy chain portion of the scFv2 tetravalent antibody may have variable regions and scFv fragments that bind the same or different target molecules. Where the scFv fragment and variable region of a first heavy chain portion of a bispecific scFc2 tetravalent antibody bind the same target molecule, at least one of the first and second scFv fragments of the second heavy chain portion of the bispecific tetravalent minibody binds a different target molecule.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention are scFv2 tetravalent domain-deleted antibodies with each heavy chain portion of the scFv2 tetravalent antibody containing an scFv fragment at least one of which is stabilized.

Alternatively, the scFv fragments may be linked to the C-termini of the heavy chain portions of the scFv2 tetravalent domain-deleted antibody (e.g. bispecific C-scFv2 tetravalent domain deleted antibodies, see for example \nFIG. 47\n).\n\n\nExemplary cell-surface molecules to which a binding molecule of the invention may bind include receptors or tumor cell antigens that are overexpressed on the surface of a tumor or neoplastic cell, as well as any of the cytokine receptors, adhesion molecules, or growth factor receptors described in herein, e.g. section B supra.

Chem. 279:2856).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the bispecific binding molecules of the invention include those with at least one arm (ie. binding site) directed against a first soluble molecule (e.g. soluble ligand), and at least one arm directed against a second soluble molecule (e.g. soluble ligand). Such bispecific binding molecules can be employed as diagnostic tools (e.g. anti-rabbit IgG/anti-ferritin, anti-horse radish peroxidase (HRP)/anti-hormone, anti-somatostatin/anti-substance P, anti-HRP/anti-FITC (see Nolan et al., supra)) or fibrinolytic agents (e.g. anti-fibrin/anti-tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), anti-fibrin/anti-urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)).\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the soluble molecule to which a bispecific binding molecule of the invention binds is a soluble ligand of the TNF family. Examples of TNF family ligands include, but are not limited to, LTA (which binds TNFR1/TNFRSF1A), TNF (which binds CD120b/TNFRSF1B), LTB (which binds LTBR/TNFRSF3), OX40L (which binds OX40/TNFRSF4), CD40L (which binds CD40/TNFRSF5), (which binds Fas/TNFRSF6 and DcR3/TNFRSF6B), CD27L (which binds CD27/TNFRSF7), CD30L (which binds CD30/TNFRSF8), 4-1-BB-L (which binds 4-1-BB/TNFRSF9), TRAIL (which binds TRAIL-R1/TNFRSF10A, TRAIL-R2/TNFRSF10B, TRAIL-R3/TNFRSF10C, and TRAIL-R4/TNFRSF10D), RANKL (which binds RANK/TNFRSF11A and Osteoprotegrin/TNFRSF11B), APO-3L (which binds APO-3/TNFRSF12 and DR3L/TNFRSF12L), APRIL (which binds TACI/TNFRSF13B), BAFF (which binds BAFFR/TNFRSF13A), LIGHT (which binds HVEM/TNFRSF14), NGF ligands (which bind LNGFR, e.g. NGF-β, NGF-2/NTF3, NTF5, BDNF, IFRD1), GITRL (which binds GITR/TNFRSF18), EDAR1 & XEDAR ligand, Fn14 ligand, and Troy/Trade ligand.\n\n\nIn other exemplary embodiments, the bispecific binding molecules of the invention have at least one binding site for a first cell-surface molecule and at least one binding site for a second cell-surface molecule. In one embodiment, the first and second cell-surface molecules are located on different cells (e.g. different cell types). For example, bispecific molecules may have at least one arm directed against a tumor cell antigen and at least one arm directed against cell-surface receptor on a non-tumor cell (e.g. an immune cell). Exemplary bispecific binding molecules of this type include those having at least one binding site for a tumor cell antigen and at least one binding site directed against a cytotoxic trigger molecule of an immune effector cell (such as anti-Fc.gamma.RI/anti-CD15, anti-p185.sup.HER2/Fc.gamma.RIII (CD16), anti-p185.sup.HER2/anti-VEGF, anti-CD3/anti-malignant B-cell (1D10), anti-CD3/anti-p185.sup.HER2, \nanti-CD\n 3/anti-p97, anti-CD3/anti-renal cell carcinoma, anti-CD3/anti-OVCAR-3, anti-CD3/L-D1 (anti-colon carcinoma), anti-CD3/anti-melanocyte stimulating hormone analog, anti-EGF receptor/anti-CD3, anti-CD3/anti-CAMA1, anti-CD3/anti-CD19, anti-CD3/MoV18, anti-neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)/anti-CD3, anti-folate binding protein (FBP)/anti-CD3, and anti-pan carcinoma associated antigen (AMOC-31)/anti-CD3)). Bispecific molecules which bind to both tumor cell antigens and cytotoxic trigger molecule are capable of effectively juxtaposing a tumor cell with an immune effector cell, thereby activating the effector cell to destroy the tumor cell by cell-mediated immune mechanisms.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the first and second cell-surface molecules to which a bispecific binding molecule is capable of binding are located on the same cell or cell type. By crosslinking the first and second receptors on the same cell, the bispecific binding molecules of the invention may inhibit or enhance an activity (e.g. signal transduction activity) associated with one or both of the first and second receptors. In one embodiment the first and second cell surface molecules are of the same type (e.g., are in the same family of molecules). In another embodiment said first and second cell surface molecules are distinct types (e.g., are in different families of molecules). Exemplary cell surface receptors to which the bispecific binding molecules bind include tumor cell antigens or immune cell receptors. Exemplary cell surface receptors include any of the cytokine receptors, adhesion molecules, or growth factor receptors described in section B supra.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, exemplary target molecules to which a binding molecule of the invention binds include one or more epitopes of e.g., heparin sulfate, growth factors or their receptors (.e.g, epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor receptor, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF/SF) receptor (See, e.g., Cao et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001. 98:7443; Lu et al. 2004. J. Biol. Chem. 279:2856).\n\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, at least one of the molecules to which a bispecific binding molecule of the invention binds is a member of the TNF receptor (TNFR) family. In another exemplary embodiment, the first and second target molecules to which a bispecific binding molecule of the invention binds are both TNFR family members. In another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention binds to a TNFR family ligand. In yet another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention binds to one TNFR family member and an antigen expressed on the surface of a tumor cell, e.g., preferentially expressed on a tumor cell. The limiting factor in the treatment of tumors with monospecific TNFR binding molecules is that often only a subset of tumors appears to be sensitive to such therapies. Multispecific TNFR binding molecules can specifically activate TNFRs, and enhance receptor signaling by, for example, bringing the TNFRs into close proximity. The invention provides improved bispecific TNFR binding molecules which can target more than one TNFR or TNFR type and enhance signaling, thus providing an improved method of treating cancer. In one embodiment, the bispecific TNFR binding molecule increases the signal strength by binding to two or more TNFRs of the same type increasing the number of TNFRs being brought together. In another more preferred embodiment, the bispecific TNFR binding molecule is capable of binding to two different receptors of the TNF family.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, at least one of the TNFRs to which a bispecific TNFR binding molecule binds contains a death domain. The term “death domain” refers to a cytoplasmic region of a TNF family receptor which is involved TNF-mediated cell death or apoptotic signaling and cell-cytotoxicity induction mediated by these receptors. This region couples the receptor to caspase activation via adaptor proteins resulting in activation of the extrinsic death pathway.\n\n\nExamples of TNF receptors which contain death domains include, but are not limited to, TNFR1 (TNFRSF1A), Fas (TNFRSF6), DR-3 (TNFRSF6B), LNGFR (TNFRSF16) TRAIL-R1 (TNFRSF10A), TRAIL-R2 (TNFRSF10B) and DR6 (TNFRSF21). The apoptotic signaling of these receptors is modulated upon binding of a cognate ligand and formation of any of the following receptor-ligand pairs: TNFR1/TNFα, Fas/FasL, DR-3/DR-3LG, TRAIL-R1/TRAIL, or TRAIL-R2/TRAIL.\n\n\nBispecific TNFR binding molecules that target TNF family receptors containing death domains are useful for the treatment of cancer since the TNFRs of this type are often overexpressed on tumor cells and stimulating of the receptor can activate tumor cell apoptosis. In preferred embodiments, the death-domain containing TNFR to which the bispecific TNFR binding molecule of the invention binds is TRAIL-R2. TRAIL-R2 is preferred for human tumor therapy since its activation does not trigger hepatocyte apoptosis and hence should have reduced toxicity.\n\n\nWhile the activation of some of death domain containing receptors, e.g. TNFR1 or Fas, has been toxic in in vivo applications, it is likely that tethering these receptors to other TNF receptors may diminish toxicity and thus render a toxic antibody less toxic.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a bispecific TNFR binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one binding site directed to a TNFR containing a death domain and at least one binding site directed to a TNFR lacking a death domain.\n\n\nIn certain exemplary embodiments, TNFRs lacking a death domain include TNFRs involved in tissue differentiation. Examples of TNFR receptors involved in tissue differentiation include LTβR, RANK, EDAR1, XEDAR, Fn14, Troy/Trade, and NGFR. TNFRs involved in tissue differentiation may influence tissue differentiation following binding of a cognate ligand. TNFR binding molecules that target TNFRs involved in tissue differentiation can affect tumors in several ways. First, they have the potential to directly slow tumor growth by altering cell cycle progression. Second, tissue differentiation in the context of tumor cell transformation may lead to cell cycle conflict and default apoptosis. Third, such conflicting input may render a cell more sensitive to chemotherapy.\n\n\nIn certain preferred embodiments, TNFR involved in tissue differentiation is lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR). LTβR is involved in the control of the maturation status of various specialized stromal cells in the immune system and plays a critical role during the development of the stromal elements of the lymph node anlagen. It has been proposed that activation of a developmental program in epithelial or fibroblastoid cells in the context of a transformed cell is detrimental to their survival and this action may account for some of the anti-tumor activity of LTβR activation. These receptors can also initiate inflammatory programs that involve chemokine release or promote immunological anti-tumor responses. Such release could affect the inflammatory status of the tumor and/or invoke infiltration of lymphoid elements promoting an immunological reaction to the tumor. Thus, bispecific TNFR binding molecules which bind LTβR, alone or in combination with TNF receptors containing death domains (e.g. TRAIL-R2), are encompassed by the invention.\n\n\nIn certain exemplary embodiments, the TNFRs lacking a death domain include TNFRs involved in immune regulation. Such receptors include TNFR2, HVEM, CD27, CD30, CD40, 4-1BB, OX40, GITR, TACI, BAFF-R, BCMA, and RELT. Additional TNF family receptors involved in immune regulation include TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4.\n\n\nOther target TNF family receptors with a role in tumor formation can be identified using existing RNA databases of receptor expression in various cell types which allow one to define TNF family receptors that are present or ideally overexpressed on various tumors. Moreover, existing RNA databases provide an additional advantage in that the pair of TNF family receptors to which a bispecific TNFR binding molecule of the invention binds could be optimized by identifying those receptor pairs that are more uniquely expressed on a tumor type or subset of tumors but are not abundant on normal tissues, especially liver and vasculature. In such a manner receptor pairs (or more) are identified that could deliver a potent signal to the tumor and spare normal tissues.\n\n\nMethods of producing multispecific molecules are well known in the art. For example, recombinant technology can be used to produce multispecific molecules, e.g., diabodies, single-chain diabodies, tandem scFvs, etc. Exemplary techniques for producing multispecific molecules are known in the art (e.g., Kontermann et al. Methods in Molecular Biology Vol. 248: Antibody Engineering: Methods and Protocols. Pp 227-242 US 2003/0207346 A1 and the references cited therein). In one embodiment, a multimeric multispecific molecules are prepared using methods such as those described e.g., in US 2003/0207346 A1 or U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,333, or US2004/0058400.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a multispecific binding molecule of the invention is a multispecifc fusion protein. As used herein the phrase “multispecific fusion protein” designates fusion proteins (as hereinabove defined) having at least two binding specificities (i.e. combining a binding domains of a ligand or receptor). Multispecific fusion proteins can be assembled, e.g., as heterodimers, heterotrimers or heterotetramers, essentially as disclosed in WO 89/02922 (published Apr. 6, 1989), in EP 314,317 (published May 3, 1989), and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,116,964 issued May 2, 1992. Preferred multispecific fusion proteins are bispecific. Examples of bispecific fusion proteins include CD4-scFv/TNF receptor-IgG and CD4-scFv/L-selectin-IgG. The last mentioned molecule combines the lymph node binding function of the lymphocyte homing receptor (LHR, L-selectin), and the HIV binding function of CD4, and finds potential application in the prevention or treatment of HIV infection, related conditions, or as a diagnostic.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention pertains to multispecific stabilized binding molecules, e.g., bispecific binding molecules, e.g., antibodies, which incorporate at least one binding site that binds to a known target and at least one binding site which recognizes an unknown target (for example, in one embodiment, the bispecific molecule incorporates binding sites selected from a semi-synthetic antibody phage display library) and a stabilized scFv of the invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, one of ordinary skill in the art could start with a single chain antibody of known specificity and build a Fab library using techniques known in the art or, alternatively, the skilled artisan could start with an Fab fragment of known specificity and build a stabilized single chain library using techniques known in the art. It is known in the art that libraries from nonimmunized sources and prepared by synthetic recombination of V-gene sequences (preferably recombination of VH with, DH and JH, and VL with JL sequences) can be used to isolate antibodies to any antigen. For example, patent application WO92/01047 teaches that antibody fragments can be displayed on the surface of bacteriophage and that they will bind antigen. Antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, Fv, scFv and VH) can be directly selected using this characteristic. Other methods known in the art include those taught, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,698,426; 6,291,159; 5,658,727; 5,667,988; and 5,969,108.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, scFv which recognize a known target can be dimerized with scFv isolated from a semi-synthetic human phage antibody display library. (see, e.g., Kruif and Logtenberg 1996. J. Biol. Chem. 271:7630).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the subject multispecific molecule is expressed in an expression system used to express antibody molecules, for example mammalian cells, yeast such as Picchia, \nE. coli, Bacculovirus\n, etc. In one embodiment, the subject bispecific molecule is expressed in the NEOSPLA vector system (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,159,730). This vector contains the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer, the mouse beta globin major promoter, the SV40 origin of replication, the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence, \nneomycin phosphotransferase exon\n 1 and \nexon\n 2, the dihydrofolate reductase gene and leader sequence.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the subject multispecific molecules comprise a synthetic connecting peptide.\n\n\nThese multispecific molecules have one or more binding sites for a known target and express a library at one or more binding sites. Such multispecific molecules can be used, e.g., to identify molecules in close proximity to or associated with the known target. For example, the skilled artisan could use the subject multispecific molecules in an assay to select for those that induce a particular response, e.g., apoptosis or cellular activation, using screening methods well known in the art. The bispecific molecule identified as producing the response screened for can then be identified and its specificity determined. Using such methods it is possible to identify molecules in close association with particular targets of interest, e.g., T cell markers or other signaling molecules (such as CRIPTO-I, death domain molecules, or molecules involved in apoptosis). The proximity of the known target and the molecule newly identified as a “nearest neighbor” can be confirmed using immunoprecipitation or other techniques known to those of skill in the art. Using these methods it is possible to identify molecules as targets for modulating a particular cellular response.\n\n\nBinding specificities comprising antigen recognition sites or entire variable regions of multispecific binding molecule, in particular multispecific antibodies or antibody variants of the invention may be derived from one or more parental antibodies. The parental antibodies can include naturally occurring antibodies or antibody fragments, antibodies or antibody fragments adapted from naturally occurring antibodies, antibodies constructed de novo using sequences of antibodies or antibody fragments known to be specific a target molecule. Sequences that may be derived from parental antibodies include heavy and/or light chain variable regions and/or CDRs, framework regions or other portions thereof.\n\n\nIn one exemplary embodiment of the invention, the parental antibodies used to construct a multispecific TNFR binding molecule are an anti-TRAIL-R2 antibody, for example 14A2, and an anti-LTβR antibody, for example CBE11 or BHA10. Multivalent, multispecific antibodies may contain a heavy chain comprising two or more variable regions and/or a light chain comprising one or more variable regions wherein at least two of the variable regions recognize different epitopes of LTβR.\n\n\nMultispecific, e.g., bispecific TNFR binding molecules may be constructed in a variety different ways using a variety of different sequences derived from parental anti-LTβR antibodies, including murine or humanized BHA10 (Browning et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n154: 33 (1995); Browning et al. \nJ. Exp. Med. \n183:867 (1996)), murine or humanized CBE11 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,312,691 and WO 02/30986, respectively), and/or parental anti-TRAIL-R2 murine or chimeric 14A2. Examples of anti-LTβR antibodies which can be used for the bispecific TNFR binding molecules of the invention include consisting: BKA11, CDH10, BCG6, AGH1, BDA8, CBE11 and BHA10 or BHA10. The following hybridoma cell lines producing monoclonal anti-LT-β-R antibodies may be used to produce anti-LTβR antibodies from which to derive antibody construct sequences, which have been previously deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) according to the provisions of the Budapest Treaty and have been assigned the indicated ATCC accession numbers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCell Line\n\n\nmAb Name\n\n\nAccession No.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\na) AG.H1.5.1\n\n\nAGH1\n\n\nHB 11796\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nb) BD.A8.AB9\n\n\nBDA8\n\n\nHB 11798\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc) BC.G6.AF5\n\n\nBCG6\n\n\nB 11794\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nd) BH.A10\n\n\nBHA10\n\n\nB 11795\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ne) BK.A11.AC10\n\n\nBKA11\n\n\nB 11799\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nf) CB.E11.1\n\n\nCBE11\n\n\nB 11793\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ng) CD.H10.1\n\n\nCDH10\n\n\nB 11797\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther examples of anti-TNF receptor antibodies which can be used in the multispecific TNFR binding molecules of the invention include antibodies directed to TNF receptors containing a death domain. A number of antibodies have been generated to death domain containing TNF receptors and are well known in the art. Such antibodies include anti-TNF-R1 monoclonal antibodies (R&D systems anti-TNF-R1; Tularik mAb #985, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,110,690; 6,437,113), anti-Fas receptor mAb CH-11 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,312,691; WO 95/10540), anti-DR3 antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,547; Johnson, et al. (1984) ImmunoBiology of HLA, ed. Dupont, B. O., Springer, New York; U.S. Pat.

Examples of anti-TNF receptor antibodies specific to TNF receptors involved in tissue differentiation include: anti-RANK monoclonal antibodies (Immunex—U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,562,948; 6,537,763; 6,528,482; 6,479,635; 6,271,349; 6,017,729; Komed—WO 03/080671), anti-EDAR polyclonal (anti-human) and monoclonal (anti-mouse) antibodies (R&D Systems—MAB745, BAF157; Elomaa et al.

Immunology 170:341; ITEM-1, ITEM-2, and ITEM-4 clones available from eBioscience), anti-TROY antibody (T3323 from Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-NGFR (anti-rodent) antibodies (Chemicon USA).\n\n\nA number of antibodies have been also raised to TNF receptors involved in immune regulation and are known in the art.

Preferably non-human antibodies are “humanized” by linking the non-human antigen binding domain with a human constant domain (e.g. Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., Proc.

Expression of Binding Molecules\n\n\nFollowing manipulation of the isolated genetic material to provide polypeptides of the invention as set forth above, the genes are typically inserted in an expression vector for introduction into host cells that may be used to produce the desired quantity of polypeptide that, in turn, provides the claimed binding molecules.\n\n\nThe term “vector” or “expression vector” is used herein for the purposes of the specification and claims, to mean vectors used in accordance with the present invention as a vehicle for introducing into and expressing a desired gene in a cell. As known to those skilled in the art, such vectors may easily be selected from the group consisting of plasmids, phages, viruses and retroviruses. In general, vectors compatible with the instant invention will comprise a selection marker, appropriate restriction sites to facilitate cloning of the desired gene and the ability to enter and/or replicate in eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells.\n\n\nFor the purposes of this invention, numerous expression vector systems may be employed. For example, one class of vector utilizes DNA elements which are derived from animal viruses such as bovine papilloma virus, polyoma virus, adenovirus, vaccinia virus, baculovirus, retroviruses (RSV, MMTV or MOMLV) or SV40 virus. Others involve the use of polycistronic systems with internal ribosome binding sites. Additionally, cells which have integrated the DNA into their chromosomes may be selected by introducing one or more markers which allow selection of transfected host cells. The marker may provide for prototrophy to an auxotrophic host, biocide resistance (e.g., antibiotics) or resistance to heavy metals such as copper. The selectable marker gene can either be directly linked to the DNA sequences to be expressed, or introduced into the same cell by cotransformation. Additional elements may also be needed for optimal synthesis of mRNA. These elements may include signal sequences, splice signals, as well as transcriptional promoters, enhancers, and termination signals. In particularly preferred embodiments the cloned variable region genes are inserted into an expression vector along with the heavy and light chain constant region genes (preferably human) synthetic as discussed above. Preferably, this is effected using a proprietary expression vector of IDEC, Inc., referred to as NEOSPLA (U.S. Pat. No. 6,159,730). This vector contains the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer, the mouse beta globin major promoter, the SV40 origin of replication, the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence, \nneomycin phosphotransferase exon\n 1 and \nexon\n 2, the dihydrofolate reductase gene and leader sequence. As seen in the examples below, this vector has been found to result in very high level expression of antibodies upon incorporation of variable and constant region genes, transfection in CHO cells, followed by selection in G418 containing medium and methotrexate amplification. Vector systems are also taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,736,137 and 5,658,570, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. This system provides for high expression levels, e.g., >30 pg/cell/day. Other exemplary vector systems are disclosed e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,413,777.\n\n\nIn other preferred embodiments the polypeptides of the invention of the instant invention may be expressed using polycistronic constructs such as those disclosed in copending U.S. provisional application No. 60/331,481 filed Nov. 16, 2001 and incorporated herein in its entirety. In these novel expression systems, multiple gene products of interest such as heavy and light chains of antibodies may be produced from a single polycistronic construct. These systems advantageously use an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to provide relatively high levels of polypeptides of the invention in eukaryotic host cells. Compatible IRES sequences are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,193,980 which is also incorporated herein. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that such expression systems may be used to effectively produce the full range of polypeptides disclosed in the instant application.\n\n\nMore generally, once the vector or DNA sequence encoding a monomeric subunit of the binding molecule (e.g. a modified antibody) has been prepared, the expression vector may be introduced into an appropriate host cell. That is, the host cells may be transformed. Introduction of the plasmid into the host cell can be accomplished by various techniques well known to those of skill in the art. These include, but are not limited to, transfection (including electrophoresis and electroporation), protoplast fusion, calcium phosphate precipitation, cell fusion with enveloped DNA, microinjection, and infection with intact virus. See, Ridgway, A. A. G. “\nMammalian Expression Vectors\n” Chapter 24.2, pp. 470-472 Vectors, Rodriguez and Denhardt, Eds. (Butterworths, Boston, Mass. 1988). Most preferably, plasmid introduction into the host is via electroporation. The transformed cells are grown under conditions appropriate to the production of the light chains and heavy chains, and assayed for heavy and/or light chain protein synthesis. Exemplary assay techniques include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), or fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (FACS), immunohistochemistry and the like.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “transformation” shall be used in a broad sense to refer to the introduction of DNA into a recipient host cell that changes the genotype and consequently results in a change in the recipient cell.\n\n\nAlong those same lines, “host cells” refers to cells that have been transformed with vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques and encoding at least one heterologous gene. In descriptions of processes for isolation of polypepties from recombinant hosts, the terms “cell” and “cell culture” are used interchangeably to denote the source of antibody unless it is clearly specified otherwise. In other words, recovery of polypeptide from the “cells” may mean either from spun down whole cells, or from the cell culture containing both the medium and the suspended cells.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the host cell line used for protein expression (e.g., of multivalent binding molecules) is of mammalian origin; those skilled in the art are credited with ability to preferentially determine particular host cell lines which are best suited for the desired gene product to be expressed therein. Exemplary host cell lines include, but are not limited to, DG44 and DUXB11 (Chinese Hamster Ovary lines, DHFR minus), HELA (human cervical carcinoma), CVI (monkey kidney line), COS (a derivative of CVI with SV40 T antigen), R1610 (Chinese hamster fibroblast) BALBC/3T3 (mouse fibroblast), HAK (hamster kidney line), SP2/O (mouse myeloma), P3.times.63-Ag3.653 (mouse myeloma), BFA-1c1BPT (bovine endothelial cells), RAJI (human lymphocyte) and 293 (human kidney). In one embodiment NS0 cells may be used. CHO cells are particularly preferred. Host cell lines are typically available from commercial services, the American Tissue Culture Collection or from published literature.\n\n\nIn vitro production allows scale-up to give large amounts of the desired polypeptides. Techniques for mammalian cell cultivation under tissue culture conditions are known in the art and include homogeneous suspension culture, e.g. in an airlift reactor or in a continuous stirrer reactor, or immobilized or entrapped cell culture, e.g. in hollow fibers, microcapsules, on agarose microbeads or ceramic cartridges. If necessary and/or desired, the solutions of polypeptides can be purified by the customary chromatography methods, for example gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, chromatography over DEAE-cellulose or (immuno-)affinity chromatography, e.g., after preferential biosynthesis of a synthetic hinge region polypeptide or prior to or subsequent to the HIC chromatography step described herein.\n\n\nGenes encoding the polypeptide of the invention can also be expressed non-mammalian cells such as bacteria or yeast or plant cells. In this regard it will be appreciated that various unicellular non-mammalian microorganisms such as bacteria can also be transformed; i.e. those capable of being grown in cultures or fermentation. Bacteria, which are susceptible to transformation, include members of the enterobacteriaceae, such as strains of \nEscherichia coli \nor \nSalmonella\n; Bacillaceae, such as \nBacillus subtilis; Pneumococcus; Streptococcus\n, and \nHaemophilus influenzae\n. It will further be appreciated that, when expressed in bacteria, the polypeptides typically become part of inclusion bodies. The polypeptides must be isolated, purified and then assembled into functional molecules. Where tetravalent forms of antibodies are desired, the subunits will then self-assemble into tetravalent antibodies (WO02/096948A2).\n\n\nIn addition to prokaryates, eukaryotic microbes may also be used. \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n, or common baker's yeast, is the most commonly used among eukaryotic microorganisms although a number of other strains are commonly available. For expression in \nSaccharomyces\n, the plasmid YRp7, for example, (Stinchcomb et al., Nature, 282:39 (1979); Kingsman et al., Gene, 7:141 (1979); Tschemper et al., Gene, 10:157 (1980)) is commonly used. This plasmid already contains the TRP1 gene which provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1 (Jones, Genetics, 85:12 (1977)). The presence of the trpl lesion as a characteristic of the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan.\n\n\nXII. Labeling or Conjugation of Binding Molecules\n\n\nThe binding molecules of the present invention may be used in non-conjugated form or may be conjugated to at least one of a variety of effector, i.e., functional, molecules, e.g., to facilitate target detection or for imaging or therapy of the patient. The polypeptides of the invention can be labeled or conjugated either before or after purification, when purification is performed. In particular, the polypeptides of the present invention may be conjugated to cytotoxins (such as radioisotopes, cytotoxic drugs, or toxins) therapeutic agents, cytostatic agents, biological toxins, prodrugs, peptides, proteins, enzymes, viruses, lipids, biological response modifiers, pharmaceutical agents, immunologically active ligands (e.g., lymphokines or other antibodies wherein the resulting molecule binds to both the neoplastic cell and an effector cell such as a T cell), PEG, or detectable molecules useful in imaging. In another embodiment, a polypeptide of the invention can be conjugated to a molecule that decreases vascularization of tumors. In other embodiments, the disclosed compositions may comprise polypeptides of the invention coupled to drugs or prodrugs. Still other embodiments of the present invention comprise the use of polypeptides of the invention conjugated to specific biotoxins or their cytotoxic fragments such as ricin, gelonin, pseudomonas exotoxin or diphtheria toxin. The selection of which conjugated or unconjugated polypeptide to use will depend on the type and stage of cancer, use of adjunct treatment (e.g., chemotherapy or external radiation) and patient condition. It will be appreciated that one skilled in the art could readily make such a selection in view of the teachings herein.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that, in previous studies, anti-tumor antibodies labeled with isotopes have been used successfully to destroy cells in solid tumors as well as lymphomas/leukemias in animal models, and in some cases in humans. Exemplary radioisotopes include: \n90\nY, \n125\nI, \n131\nI, \n123\nI, \n111\nIn, \n105\nRh, \n153\nSm, \n67\nCu, \n67\nGa, \n166\nHo, \n177\nLu, \n186\nRe and \n188\nRe. The radionuclides act by producing ionizing radiation which causes multiple strand breaks in nuclear DNA, leading to cell death. The isotopes used to produce therapeutic conjugates typically produce high energy α- or α-particles which have a short path length. Such radionuclides kill cells to which they are in close proximity, for example neoplastic cells to which the conjugate has attached or has entered. They have little or no effect on non-localized cells. Radionuclides are essentially non-immunogenic.\n\n\nWith respect to the use of radiolabeled conjugates in conjunction with the present invention, polypeptides of the invention may be directly labeled (such as through iodination) or may be labeled indirectly through the use of a chelating agent. As used herein, the phrases “indirect labeling” and “indirect labeling approach” both mean that a chelating agent is covalently attached to a binding molecule and at least one radionuclide is associated with the chelating agent. Such chelating agents are typically referred to as bifunctional chelating agents as they bind both the polypeptide and the radioisotope. Particularly preferred chelating agents comprise 1-isothiocycmatobenzyl-3-methyldiothelene triaminepentaacetic acid (“MX-DTPA”) and cyclohexyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (“CHX-DTPA”) derivatives. Other chelating agents comprise P-DOTA and EDTA derivatives. Particularly preferred radionuclides for indirect labeling include \n111\nIn and \n90\nY.\n\n\nAs used herein, the phrases “direct labeling” and “direct labeling approach” both mean that a radionuclide is covalently attached directly to a polypeptide (typically via an amino acid residue). More specifically, these linking technologies include random labeling and site-directed labeling. In the latter case, the labeling is directed at specific sites on the polypeptide, such as the N-linked sugar residues present only on the Fc portion of the conjugates. Further, various direct labeling techniques and protocols are compatible with the instant invention. For example, Technetium-99m labeled polypeptides may be prepared by ligand exchange processes, by reducing pertechnate (TcO\n4\n \n−\n) with stannous ion solution, chelating the reduced technetium onto a Sephadex column and applying the polypeptides to this column, or by batch labeling techniques, e.g. by incubating pertechnate, a reducing agent such as SnCl\n2\n, a buffer solution such as a sodium-potassium phthalate-solution, and the antibodies. In any event, preferred radionuclides for directly labeling antibodies are well known in the art and a particularly preferred radionuclide for direct labeling is \n131\nI, covalently attached via tyrosine residues. Polypeptides according to the invention may be derived, for example, with radioactive sodium or potassium iodide and a chemical oxidizing agent, such as sodium hypochlorite, chloramine T or the like, or an enzymatic oxidizing agent, such as lactoperoxidase, glucose oxidase and glucose. However, for the purposes of the present invention, the indirect labeling approach is particularly preferred.\n\n\nPatents relating to chelators and chelator conjugates are known in the art. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 4,831,175 of Gansow is directed to polysubstituted diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid chelates and protein conjugates containing the same, and methods for their preparation. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,099,069, 5,246,692, 5,286,850, 5,434,287 and 5,124,471 of Gansow also relate to polysubstituted DTPA chelates. These patents are incorporated herein in their entirety. Other examples of compatible metal chelators are ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DPTA), 1,4,8,11-tetraazatetradecane, 1,4,8,11-tetraazatetradecane-1,4,8,11-tetraacetic acid, 1-oxa-4,7,12,15-tetraazaheptadecane-4,7,12,15-tetraacetic acid, or the like. Cyclohexyl-DTPA or CHX-DTPA is particularly preferred and is exemplified extensively below. Still other compatible chelators, including those yet to be discovered, may easily be discerned by a skilled artisan and are clearly within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nCompatible chelators, including the specific bifunctional chelator used to facilitate chelation in co-pending application Ser. Nos. 08/475,813, 08/475,815 and 08/478,967, are preferably selected to provide high affinity for trivalent metals, exhibit increased tumor-to-non-tumor ratios and decreased bone uptake as well as greater in vivo retention of radionuclide at target sites, i.e., B-cell lymphoma tumor sites. However, other bifunctional chelators that may or may not possess all of these characteristics are known in the art and may also be beneficial in tumor therapy.\n\n\nIt will also be appreciated that, in accordance with the teachings herein, polypeptides may be conjugated to different radiolabels for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. To this end the aforementioned co-pending applications, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety, disclose radiolabeled therapeutic conjugates for diagnostic “imaging” of tumors before administration of therapeutic antibody. “In2B8” conjugate comprises a murine monoclonal antibody, 2B8, specific to human CD20 antigen, that is attached to \n111\nIn via a bifunctional chelator, i.e., MX-DTPA (diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid), which comprises a 1:1 mixture of 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyl-DTPA and 1-methyl-3-isothiocyanatobenzyl-DTPA. \n111\nIn is particularly preferred as a diagnostic radionuclide because between about 1 to about 10 mCi can be safely administered without detectable toxicity; and the imaging data is generally predictive of subsequent \n90\nY-labeled antibody distribution. Most imaging studies utilize 5 mCi \n111\nIn-labeled antibody, because this dose is both safe and has increased imaging efficiency compared with lower doses, with optimal imaging occurring at three to six days after antibody administration. See, for example, Murray, \nJ. Nuc. Med. \n26: 3328 (1985) and Carraguillo et al., \nJ. Nuc. Med. \n26: 67 (1985).\n\n\nAs indicated above, a variety of radionuclides are applicable to the present invention and those skilled in the art can readily determine which radionuclide is most appropriate under various circumstances. For example, \n131\nI is a well known radionuclide used for targeted immunotherapy. However, the clinical usefulness of \n131\nI, can be limited by several factors including: eight-day physical half-life; dehalogenation of iodinated antibody both in the blood and at tumor sites; and emission characteristics (e.g., large gamma component) which can be suboptimal for localized dose deposition in tumor. With the advent of superior chelating agents, the opportunity for attaching metal chelating groups to proteins has increased the opportunities to utilize other radionuclides such as \n111\nIn and \n90\nY. \n90\nY provides several benefits for utilization in radioimmunotherapeutic applications: the 64 hour half-life of \n90\nY is long enough to allow antibody accumulation by tumor and, unlike e.g., \n131\nI, \n90\nY is a pure beta emitter of high energy with no accompanying gamma irradiation in its decay, with a range in tissue of 100 to 1,000 cell diameters. Furthermore, the minimal amount of penetrating radiation allows for outpatient administration of \n90\nY-labeled antibodies. Additionally, internalization of labeled antibody is not required for cell killing, and the local emission of ionizing radiation should be lethal for adjacent tumor cells lacking the target molecule.\n\n\nThose skilled in the art will appreciate that these non-radioactive conjugates may also be assembled using a variety of techniques depending on the selected agent to be conjugated. For example, conjugates with biotin are prepared e.g. by reacting the polypeptides with an activated ester of biotin such as the biotin N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. Similarly, conjugates with a fluorescent marker may be prepared in the presence of a coupling agent, e.g. those listed above, or by reaction with an isothiocyanate, preferably fluorescein-isothiocyanate. Conjugates of the polypeptides of the invention with cytostatic/cytotoxic substances and metal chelates are prepared in an analogous manner.\n\n\nMany effector molecules lack suitable functional groups to which antibodies can be linked. In one embodiment, an effector molecule, e.g., a drug or prodrug is attached to the antibody through a linking molecule. In one embodiment, the linking molecule contains a chemical bond that allows for the activation of cytotoxicity at a particular site. Suitable chemical bonds are well known in the art and include disulfide bonds, acid labile bonds, photolabile bonds, peptidase labile bonds, thioether bonds formed between sulfhydryl and maleimide groups, and esterase labile bonds. Most preferably, the linking molecule comprises a disulfide bond or a thioether bond. In accordance with the invention, the linking molecule preferably comprises a reactive chemical group. Particularly preferred reactive chemical groups are N-succinimidyl esters and N-sulfosuccinimidyl esters. In a preferred embodiment, the reactive chemical group can be covalently bound to the effector via disulfide bonding between thiol groups. In one embodiment an effector molecule is modified to comprise a thiol group. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a thiol group contains a sulfur atom bonded to a hydrogen atom and is typically also referred to in the art as a sulfhydryl group, which can be denoted as “—SH” or “RSH.”\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a linking molecule may be used to join the effector molecule with the binding molecule. The linking molecule of the invention may be cleavable or non-cleavable. In one embodiment, the cleavable linking molecule is a redox-cleavablelinking molecule, such that the linking molecule is cleavable in environments with a lower redox potential, such as the cytoplasm and other regions with higher concentrations of molecules with free sulfhydryl groups. Examples of linking molecules that may be cleaved due to a change in redox potential include those containing disulfides. The cleaving stimulus can be provided upon intracellular uptake of the binding protein of the invention where the lower redox potential of the cytoplasm facilitates cleavage of the linking molecule. In another embodiment, a decrease in pH triggers the release of the maytansinoid cargo into the target cell. The decrease in pH is implicated in many physiological and pathological processes, such as endosome trafficking, tumor growth, inflammation, and myocardial ischemia. The pH drops from a physiological 7.4 to 5-6 in endosomes or 4-5 in lysosomes. Examples of acid sensitive linking molecules which may be used to target lysosomes or endosomes of cancer cells, include those with acid-cleavable bonds such as those found in acetals, ketals, orthoesters, hydrazones, trityls, cis-aconityls, or thiocarbamoyls (see for example, Willner et al., (1993), \nBioconj. Chem., \n4: 521-7; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,569,789, 4,631,190, 5,306,809, and 5,665,358). Other exemplary acid-sensitive linking molecules comprise dipeptide sequences Phe-Lys and Val-Lys (King et al., (2002), \nJ. Med. Chem., \n45: 4336-43). The cleaving stimulus can be provided upon intracellular uptake trafficking to low pH endosomal compartments (e.g. lysosomes). Other exemplary acid-cleavable linking molecules are the molecules that contain two or more acid cleavable bonds for attachment of two or more maytansinoids (King et al., (1999), \nBioconj. Chem., \n10: 279-88; WO 98/19705).\n\n\nCleavable linking molecules may be sensitive to biologically supplied cleaving agents that are associated with a particular target cell, for example, lysosomal or tumor-associated enzymes. Examples of linking molecules that can be cleaved enzymatically include, but are not limited to, peptides and esters. Exemplary enzyme cleavable linking molecules include those that are sensitive to tumor-associated proteases such as Cathepsin B or plasmin (Dubowchik et al., (1999), \nPharm. Ther., \n83: 67-123; Dubowchik et al., (1998), \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., \n8: 3341-52; de Groot et al., (2000), \nJ. Med. Chem., \n43: 3093-102; de Groot et al., (1999)m 42: 5277-83). Cathepsin B-cleavable sites include the dipeptide sequences valine-citrulline and phenylalanine-lysine (Doronina et al., (2003), \nNat. Biotech., \n21(7): 778-84); Dubowchik et al., (2002), \nBioconjug. Chem., \n13: 855-69). Other exemplary enzyme-cleavable sites include those formed by oligopeptide sequences of 4 to 16 amino acids (e.g., Suc-β-Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu SEQ ID NO: 158)) which recognized by trouse proteases such as Thimet Oliogopeptidase (TOP), an enzyme that is preferentially released by neutrophils, macrophages, and other granulocytes.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the linking molecule is formed by reacting a binding molecule of the invention with a linking molecule of the formula:\n\n\nX—Y—Z\n\n\n\nwherein:\n\n \n \n \n \nX is an attachment molecule;\n \nY is a spacer molecule; and\n \nZ is a effector attachment moeity.\n \n \n \n\n\nThe term “binding molecule attachment molecule” includes molecules which allow for the covalent attachment of the connecting peptide to a binding molecule of the invention.\n\n\nThe attachment molecule may comprise, for example, a covalent chain of 1-60 carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur atoms, optionally substituted with hydrogen atoms and other substituents which allow the binding molecule to perform its intended function. The attachment molecule may comprise peptide, ester, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, ether, thioether, etc. functional groups. Preferably, the attachment molecule is selected such that it is capable of reacting with a reactive functional group on a polypeptide comprising at least one antigen binding site, to form a binding molecule of the invention. Examples of attachment molecules include, for example, amino, carboxylate, and thiol attachment molecules.\n\n\nAmino attachment molecules include molecules which react with amino groups on a polypeptide, such that a binding molecule of the invention is formed. Amino attachment molecules are known in the art. Examples of amino attachment molecules include, activated carbamides (e.g., which may react with an amino group on a binding molecule to form a linking molecule which comprises urea group), aldehydes (e.g., which may react with amino groups on a binding molecule), and activated isocyanates (which may react with an amino group on a binding molecule to from a linking molecule which comprises a urea group). Examples of amino attachment molecules include, but are not limited to, N-succinimidyl, N-sulfosuccinimidyl, N-phthalimidyl, N-sulfophthalimidyl, 2-nitrophenyl, 4-nitrophenyl, 2,4-dinitrophenyl, 3-sulfonyl-4-nitrophenyl, or 3-carboxy-4-nitrophenyl molecule.\n\n\nCarboxylate attachment molecules include molecules which react with carboxylate groups on a polypeptide, such that a binding molecule of the invention is formed. Carboxylate attachment molecules are known in the art. Examples of carboxylate attachment molecules include, but are not limited to activated ester intermediates and activated carbonyl intermediates, which may react with a COOH group on a binding molecule to form a linking molecule which comprises a ester, thioester, or amide group.\n\n\nThiol attachment molecules include molecules which react with thiol groups present on a polypeptide, such that a binding molecule of the invention is formed. Thiol attachment molecules are known in the art. Examples of thiol attachment molecules include activated acyl groups (which may react with a sulfhydryl on a binding molecule to form a linking molecule which comprises a thioester), activated alkyl groups (which may react with a sulfhydryl on a binding molecule to form a linking molecule which comprises a thioester molecule), Michael acceptors such as maleimide or acrylic groups (which may react with a sulfhydryl on a binding molecule to form a Michael-type addition product), groups which react with sulfhydryl groups via redox reactions, activated di-sulfide groups (which may react with a sulfhydryl group on a binding molecule to form, for example, a linking molecule which comprises a disulfide molecule). Other thiol attachment molecules include acrylamides, alpha-iodoacetamides, and cyclopropan-1,1-dicarbonyl compounds. In addition, the thiol attachment molecule may comprise a molecule which modifies a thiol on the binding molecule to form another reactive species to which the linking molecule can be attached to form a binding molecule of the invention.\n\n\nThe spacer molecule, Y, is a covalent bond or a covalent chain of atoms which may contain one or more aminoacid residues. It may also comprise 0-60 carbon, oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen atoms optionally substituted with hydrogen or other substituents which allow the resulting binding molecule to perform its intended function. In one embodiment, Y comprises an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, ester, ether, carbonyl, or amide molecule.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a thiol group on the binding molecule is converted into a reactive group, such as a reactive carbonyl group, such as a ketone or aldehyde. The attachment molecule is then reacted with the ketone or aldehyde to form the desired compound of the invention. Examples of carbonyl reactive attachment molecules include, but are not limited to, hydrazines, hydrazides, O-substituted hydroxylamines, alpha-beta-unsaturated ketones, and H\n2\nC═CH—CO—NH—NH\n2\n. Other examples of attachment molecules and methods for modifying thiol molecules which can be used to form binding molecules of the invention are described Pratt, M. L. et al. J Am Chem. Soc. 2003 May 21; 125(20):6149-59; and Saxon, E. Science. 2000 Mar. 17; 287(5460):2007-10.\n\n\nThe linking molecule may be a molecule which is capable of reacting with an effector molecule or a derivative thereof to form a binding molecule of the invention. For example, the effector molecule may be linked to the remaining portions of the molecule through a disulfide bond. In such cases, the linking molecule is selected such that it is capable of reacting with an appropriate effector moeity derivative such that the effector molecule is attached to the binding molecule of the invention. As described above, the linking molecule and/or the connecting peptide as a whole may be selected that the connecting peptide is cleaved in an appropriate environment.\n\n\nParticularly preferred connecting peptide molecules include, for example, N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP) (see, e.g., Carlsson et al., Biochem. J., 173, 723-737 (1978)), N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)butanoate (SPDB) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,563,304), N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)pentanoate (SPP) (see, e.g., CAS Registry number 341498-08-6), N-succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) (see, e.g., Yoshitake et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 101, 395-399 (1979)), and N-succinimidyl 4-methyl-4-[2-(5-nitro-pyridyl)-dithio]pentanoate (SMNP) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,563,304) The most preferred connecting peptide molecules for use in the inventive composition are SPP, SMCC, and SPDB. In a preferred embodiment, SPDB is used to link an effector molecule to a binding molecule of the invention.\n\n\nPreferred cytotoxic effector molecules for use in the present invention are cytotoxic drugs, particularly those which are used for cancer therapy. As used herein, “a cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent” means any agent that is detrimental to the growth and proliferation of cells and may act to reduce, inhibit or destroy a cell or malignancy. Exemplary cytotoxins include, but are not limited to, radionuclides, biotoxins, enzymatically active toxins, cytostatic or cytotoxic therapeutic agents, prodrugs, immunologically active ligands and biological response modifiers such as cytokines. Any cytotoxin that acts to retard or slow the growth of immunoreactive cells or malignant cells is within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nExemplary cytotoxins include, in general, cytostatic agents, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, anti-proliferative agents, tubulin binding agents, hormones and hormone antagonists, and the like. Exemplary cytostatics that are compatible with the present invention include alkylating substances, such as mechlorethamine, triethylenephosphoramide, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, chlorambucil, busulfan, melphalan or triaziquone, also nitrosourea compounds, such as carmustine, lomustine, or semustine.\n\n\nParticularly preferred molecules for conjugation are maytansinoids. Maytansinoids were originally isolated from the east African shrub belonging to the genus \nMaytenus\n, but were subsequently also discovered to be metabolites of soil bacteria, such as \nActinosynnema pretiosum \n(see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,896,111). Maytansinoids are known in the art to include maytansine, maytansinol, C-3 esters of maytansinol, and other maytansinol analogues and derivatives (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020 and 6,441,163). C-3 esters of maytansinol can be naturally occurring or synthetically derived. Moreover, both naturally occurring and synthetic C-3 maytansinol esters can be classified as a C-3 ester with simple carboxylic acids, or a C-3 ester with derivatives of N-methyl-L-alanine, the latter being more cytotoxic than the former. Synthetic maytansinoid analogues also are known in the art and described in, for example, Kupchan et al., J. Med. Chem., 21, 31-37 (1978). Methods for generating maytansinol and analogues and derivatives thereof are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,151,042.\n\n\nSuitable maytansinoids for use as antibody conjugates can be isolated from natural sources, synthetically produced, or semi-synthetically produced using methods known in the art. Moreover, the maytansinoid can be modified in any suitable manner, so long as sufficient cytotoxicity is preserved in the ultimate conjugate molecule.\n\n\nParticularly preferred maytansinoids comprising a linking molecule that contains a reactive chemical group are C-3 esters of maytansinol and its analogs where the linking molecule contains a disulfide bond and the attachment molecule comprises a N-succinimidyl or N-sulfosuccinimidyl ester. Many positions on maytansinoids can serve as the position to chemically link the linking molecule, e.g., through an effector attachment molecule. For example, the C-3 position having a hydroxyl group, the C-14 position modified with hydroxymethyl, the C-15 position modified with hydroxy and the C-20 position having a hydroxy group are all useful. The linking molecule most preferably is linked to the C-3 position of maytansinol. Most preferably, the maytansinoid used in connection with the inventive composition is N.sup.2′-deacetyl-N.sup.2′-(−3-mercapto-1-oxopropyl)-maytansine (DM1) or N.sup.2′-deacetyl-N.sup.2′-(4-mercapto-4-methyl-1-oxopentyl)-maytansine (DM4).\n\n\nLinking molecules with other chemical bonds also can be used in the context of the invention, as can other maytansinoids. Specific examples of other chemical bonds which may be incorportated in the linking molecules include those described above, such as, for example acid labile bonds, thioether bonds, photolabile bonds, peptidase labile bonds and esterase labile bonds. Methods for producing maytansinoids with linking molecules and/or effector attachment molecules are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020, 5,416,064, and 6,333,410.\n\n\nThe linking molecule (and/or the effector attachment molecule) of a maytansinoid typically and preferably is part of a larger connecting peptide molecule that is used to join the antibody to the maytansinoid. Any suitable connecting peptide molecule can be used in connection with the invention, so long as the linking molecule provides for retention of the cytotoxicity and targeting characteristics of the maytansinoid and the antibody, respectively. The linking molecule joins the maytansinoid to the antibody through chemical bonds (as described above), such that the maytansinoid and the antibody are chemically coupled (e.g., covalently bonded) to each other. Desirably, the linking molecule chemically couples the maytansinoid to the antibody through disulfide bonds or thioether bonds. Most preferably, the antibody is chemically coupled to the maytansinoid via disulfide bonds.\n\n\nOther preferred classes of cytotoxic agents include, for example, the anthracycline family of drugs, the vinca drugs, the mitomycins, the bleomycins, the cytotoxic nucleosides, the pteridine family of drugs, diynenes, and the podophyllotoxins. Particularly useful members of those classes include, for example, adriamycin, caminomycin, daunorubicin (daunomycin), doxorubicin, aminopterin, methotrexate, methopterin, mithramycin, streptonigrin, dichloromethotrexate, mitomycin C, actinomycin-D, porfiromycin, 5-fluorouracil, floxuridine, ftorafur, 6-mercaptopurine, cytarabine, cytosine arabinoside, podophyllotoxin, or podophyllotoxin derivatives such as etoposide or etoposide phosphate, melphalan, vinblastine, vincristine, leurosidine, vindesine, leurosine and the like. Still other cytotoxins that are compatible with the teachings herein include taxol, taxane, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, tenoposide, colchicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Hormones and hormone antagonists, such as corticosteroids, e.g. prednisone, progestins, e.g. hydroxyprogesterone or medroprogesterone, estrogens, e.g. diethylstilbestrol, antiestrogens, e.g. tamoxifen, androgens, e.g. testosterone, and aromatase inhibitors, e.g. aminogluthetimide are also compatible with the teachings herein. As noted previously, one skilled in the art may make chemical modifications to the desired compound in order to make reactions of that compound more convenient for purposes of preparing conjugates of the invention.\n\n\nOne example of particularly preferred cytotoxins comprise members or derivatives of the enediyne family of anti-tumor antibiotics, including calicheamicin, esperamicins or dynemicins. These toxins are extremely potent and act by cleaving nuclear DNA, leading to cell death. Unlike protein toxins which can be cleaved in vivo to give many inactive but immunogenic polypeptide fragments, toxins such as calicheamicin, esperamicins and other enediynes are small molecules which are essentially non-immunogenic. These non-peptide toxins are chemically-linked to the dimers or tetramers by techniques which have been previously used to label monoclonal antibodies and other molecules. These linking technologies include site-specific linkage via the N-linked sugar residues present only on the Fc portion of the constructs. Such site-directed linking methods have the advantage of reducing the possible effects of linkage on the binding properties of the constructs.\n\n\nAmong other cytotoxins, it will be appreciated that polypeptides can also be associated with a biotoxin such as ricin subunit A, abrin, diptheria toxin, botulinum, cyanginosins, saxitoxin, shigatoxin, tetanus, tetrodotoxin, trichothecene, verrucologen or a toxic enzyme. Preferably, such constructs will be made using genetic engineering techniques that allow for direct expression of the binding molecule-toxin construct. Other biological response modifiers that may be associated with the polypeptides of the invention of the present invention comprise cytokines such as lymphokines and interferons. In view of the instant disclosure it is submitted that one skilled in the art could readily form such constructs using conventional techniques.\n\n\nAnother class of compatible cytotoxins that may be used in conjunction with the disclosed polypeptides are radiosensitizing drugs that may be effectively directed to tumor or immunoreactive cells. Such drugs enhance the sensitivity to ionizing radiation, thereby increasing the efficacy of radiotherapy. A conjugate internalized by the tumor cell would deliver the radiosensitizer nearer the nucleus where radiosensitization would be maximal. The unbound radiosensitizer linked polypeptides of the invention would be cleared quickly from the blood, localizing the remaining radiosensitization agent in the target tumor and providing minimal uptake in normal tissues. After rapid clearance from the blood, adjunct radiotherapy would be administered in one of three ways: 1.) external beam radiation directed specifically to the tumor, 2.) radioactivity directly implanted in the tumor or 3.) systemic radioimmunotherapy with the same binding molecule. A potentially attractive variation of this approach would be the attachment of a therapeutic radioisotope to the radiosensitized immunoconjugate, thereby providing the convenience of administering to the patient a single drug.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a molecule that enhances the stability or efficacy of the polypeptide can be conjugated. For example, in one embodiment, PEG can be conjugated to the polypeptides of the invention to increase their half-life in vivo. Leong, S. R., et al. 2001\n. Cytokine \n16:106; 2002\n; Adv. in Drug Deliv. Rev. \n54:531; or Weir et al. 2002. Biochem. Soc. Transactions 30:512.\n\n\nAs previously alluded to, compatible cytotoxins may comprise a prodrug. As used herein, the term “prodrug” refers to a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance that is less cytotoxic to tumor cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically activated or converted into the more active parent form. Prodrugs compatible with the invention include, but are not limited to, phosphate-containing prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing prodrugs, sulfate containing prodrugs, peptide containing prodrugs, β-lactam-containing prodrugs, optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide-containing prodrugs, 5-fluorocytosine and other 5-fluorouridine prodrugs that can be converted to the more active cytotoxic free drug. In one embodiment, a cytotoxic agent, such as a maytansinoid, is administered as a prodrug which is released by the hydrolysis of disulfide bonds. Further examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in the present invention comprise those chemotherapeutic agents described above.\n\n\nXIII. Administration of Binding Molecules\n\n\nMethods of preparing and administering binding molecules of the invention to a subject are well known to or are readily determined by those skilled in the art. The route of administration of the binding molecules of the invention may be oral, parenteral, by inhalation or topical. The term parenteral as used herein includes intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, rectal or vaginal administration. The intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous and intramuscular forms of parenteral administration are generally preferred. While all these forms of administration are clearly contemplated as being within the scope of the invention, a form for administration would be a solution for injection, in particular for intravenous or intraarterial injection or drip. Usually, a suitable pharmaceutical composition for injection may comprise a buffer (e.g. acetate, phosphate or citrate buffer), a surfactant (e.g. polysorbate), optionally a stabilizer agent (e.g. human albumin), etc. However, in other methods compatible with the teachings herein, the polypeptides can be delivered directly to the site of the adverse cellular population thereby increasing the exposure of the diseased tissue to the therapeutic agent.\n\n\nPreparations for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. In the subject invention, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, 0.01-0.1M and preferably 0.05M phosphate buffer or 0.8% saline. Other common parenteral vehicles include sodium phosphate solutions, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's, or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers, such as those based on Ringer's dextrose, and the like. Preservatives and other additives may also be present such as for example, antimicrobials, antioxidants, chelating agents, and inert gases and the like. More particularly, pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In such cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and will preferably be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fingi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols, such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\nIn any case, sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating an active compound (e.g., a polypeptide by itself or in combination with other active agents) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated herein, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle, which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying, which yields a powder of an active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The preparations for injections are processed, filled into containers such as ampoules, bags, bottles, syringes or vials, and sealed under aseptic conditions according to methods known in the art. Further, the preparations may be packaged and sold in the form of a kit such as those described in co-pending U.S. Ser. No. 09/259,337 and U.S. Ser. No. 09/259,338 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such articles of manufacture will preferably have labels or package inserts indicating that the associated compositions are useful for treating a subject suffering from, or predisposed to autoimmune or neoplastic disorders.\n\n\nEffective doses of the stabilized binding molecules of the present invention, for the treatment of the above described conditions vary depending upon many different factors, including means of administration, target site, physiological state of the patient, whether the patient is human or an animal, other medications administered, and whether treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. Usually, the patient is a human, but non-human mammals including transgenic mammals can also be treated. Treatment dosages may be titrated using routine methods known to those of skill in the art to optimize safety and efficacy.\n\n\nFor passive immunization with a binding molecule of the invention, the dosage may range, e.g., from about 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg, and more usually 0.01 to 5 mg/kg (e.g., 0.02 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 0.75 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, etc.), of the host body weight. For example dosages can be 1 mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight or within the range of 1-10 mg/kg, preferably at least 1 mg/kg. Doses intermediate in the above ranges are also intended to be within the scope of the invention.\n\n\nSubjects can be administered such doses daily, on alternative days, weekly or according to any other schedule determined by empirical analysis. An exemplary treatment entails administration in multiple dosages over a prolonged period, for example, of at least six months. Additional exemplary treatment regimes entail administration once per every two weeks or once a month or once every 3 to 6 months. Exemplary dosage schedules include 1-10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg on consecutive days, 30 mg/kg on alternate days or 60 mg/kg weekly. In some methods, two or more monoclonal antibodies with different binding specificities are administered simultaneously, in which case the dosage of each antibody administered may fall within the ranges indicated.\n\n\nBinding molecules of the invention can be administered on multiple occasions. Intervals between single dosages can be, e.g., daily, weekly, monthly or yearly. Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring blood levels of polypeptide or target molecule in the patient. In some methods, dosage is adjusted to achieve a certain plasma binding molecule or toxin concentration, e.g., 1-1000 μg/ml or 25-300 μg/ml. Alternatively, binding molecules can be administered as a sustained release formulation, in which case less frequent administration is required. Dosage and frequency vary depending on the half-life of the antibody in the patient. In general, humanized antibodies show the longest half-life, followed by chimeric antibodies and nonhuman antibodies. In one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention can be administered in unconjugated form, In another embodiment, the polypeptides of the invention can be administered multiple times in conjugated form. In still another embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention can be administered in unconjugated form, then in conjugated form, or vise versa.\n\n\nThe dosage and frequency of administration can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the present antibodies or a cocktail thereof are administered to a patient not already in the disease state to enhance the patient's resistance. Such an amount is defined to be a “prophylactic effective dose.” In this use, the precise amounts again depend upon the patient's state of health and general immunity, but generally range from 0.1 to 25 mg per dose, especially 0.5 to 2.5 mg per dose. A relatively low dosage is administered at relatively infrequent intervals over a long period of time. Some patients continue to receive treatment for the rest of their lives.\n\n\nIn therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage (e.g., from about 1 to 400 mg/kg of binding molecule, e.g., antibody per dose, with dosages of from 5 to 25 mg being more commonly used for radioimmunoconjugates and higher doses for cytotoxin-drug conjugated molecules) at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated, and preferably until the patient shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patent can be administered a prophylactic regime.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a subject can be treated with a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide of the invention (e.g., in a vector). Doses for nucleic acids encoding polypeptides range from about 10 ng to 1 g, 100 ng to 100 mg, 1 μg to 10 mg, or 30-300 μg DNA per patient. Doses for infectious viral vectors vary from 10-100, or more, virions per dose.\n\n\nTherapeutic agents can be administered by parenteral, topical, intravenous, oral, subcutaneous, intraarterial, intracranial, intraperitoneal, intranasal or intramuscular means for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment. Intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion are preferred for administration of a binding molecule of the invention. In some methods, particular therapeutic binding molecules are injected directly into the cranium. In some methods, binding molecules are administered as a sustained release composition or device, such as a Medipad™ device.\n\n\nAgents of the invention can optionally be administered in combination with other agents that are effective in treating the disorder or condition in need of treatment (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic). Preferred additional agents are those which are art recognized and are standardly administered for a particular disorder.\n\n\nEffective single treatment dosages (i.e., therapeutically effective amounts) of \n90\nY-labeled polypeptides of the invention range from between about 5 and about 75 mCi, more preferably between about 10 and about 40 mCi. Effective single treatment non-marrow ablative dosages of \n131\nI-labeled antibodies range from between about 5 and about 70 mCi, more preferably between about 5 and about 40 mCi. Effective single treatment ablative dosages (i.e., may require autologous bone marrow transplantation) of \n131\nI-labeled antibodies range from between about 30 and about 600 mCi, more preferably between about 50 and less than about 500 mCi. In conjunction with a chimeric modified antibody, owing to the longer circulating half life vis-á-vis murine antibodies, an effective single treatment non-marrow ablative dosages of iodine-131 labeled chimeric antibodies range from between about 5 and about 40 mCi, more preferably less than about 30 mCi. Imaging criteria for, e.g., the \n111\nIn label, are typically less than about 5 mCi.\n\n\nWhile a great deal of clinical experience has been gained with \n131\nI and \n90\nY, other radiolabels are known in the art and have been used for similar purposes. Still other radioisotopes are used for imaging. For example, additional radioisotopes which are compatible with the scope of the instant invention include, but are not limited to, \n123\nI, \n125\nI, \n32\nP, \n57\nCo, \n64\nCU, \n67\nCu, \n77\nBr, \n81\nRb, \n81\nKr, \n87\nSr, \n113\nIn, \n127\nCs, \n129\nCs, \n132\nI, \n197\nHg, \n203\nPb, \n206\nBi, \n177\nLu, \n186\nRe, \n212\nPb, \n212\nBi, \n47\nSc, \n105\nRh, \n109\nPd, \n153\nSm, \n188\nRe, \n199\nAu, \n225\nAc, \n211\nAt, and \n213\nBi. In this respect alpha, gamma and beta emitters are all compatible with in the instant invention. Further, in view of the instant disclosure it is submitted that one skilled in the art could readily determine which radionuclides are compatible with a selected course of treatment without undue experimentation. To this end, additional radionuclides which have already been used in clinical diagnosis include \n125\nI, \n123\nI, \n99\nTc, \n43\nK, \n52\nFe, \n67\nGa, \n68\nGa, as well as \n111\nIn. Antibodies have also been labeled with a variety of radionuclides for potential use in targeted immunotherapy (Peirersz et al. \nImmunol. Cell Biol. \n65: 111-125 (1987)). These radionuclides include \n188\nRe and \n186\nRe as well as \n199\nAu and \n67\nCu to a lesser extent. U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,785 provides additional data regarding such radioisotopes and is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nWhether or not the binding molecules of the invention are used in a conjugated or unconjugated form, it will be appreciated that a major advantage of the present invention is the ability to use these polypeptides in myelosuppressed patients, especially those who are undergoing, or have undergone, adjunct therapies such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy. In other preferred embodiments, the polypeptides (again in a conjugated or unconjugated form) may be used in a combined therapeutic regimen with chemotherapeutic agents. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that such therapeutic regimens may comprise the sequential, simultaneous, concurrent or coextensive administration of the disclosed antibodies and one or more chemotherapeutic agents. Particularly preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention will comprise the administration of a toxin conjugated binding molecule, e.g., conjugated to a maytansinoid such as a D4 maytansinoid.\n\n\nWhile the binding molecules may be administered as described immediately above, it must be emphasized that in other embodiments conjugated and unconjugated polypeptides may be administered to otherwise healthy patients as a first line therapeutic agent. In such embodiments the polypeptides may be administered to patients having normal or average red marrow reserves and/or to patients that have not, and are not, undergoing adjunct therapies such as external beam radiation or chemotherapy.\n\n\nHowever, as discussed above, selected embodiments of the invention comprise the administration of binding molecules to myelosuppressed patients or in combination or conjunction with one or more adjunct therapies such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy (i.e. a combined therapeutic regimen). As used herein, the administration of polypeptides in conjunction or combination with an adjunct therapy means the sequential, simultaneous, coextensive, concurrent, concomitant or contemporaneous administration or application of the therapy and the disclosed binding molecules. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the administration or application of the various components of the combined therapeutic regimen may be timed to enhance the overall effectiveness of the treatment. For example, chemotherapeutic agents could be administered in standard, well known courses of treatment followed within a few weeks by radioimmunoconjugates of the present invention. Conversely, cytotoxin associated polypeptides could be administered intravenously followed by tumor localized external beam radiation. In yet other embodiments, the polypeptide may be administered concurrently with one or more selected chemotherapeutic agents in a single office visit. A skilled artisan (e.g. an experienced oncologist) would readily be able to discern effective combined therapeutic regimens without undue experimentation based on the selected adjunct therapy and the teachings of the instant specification.\n\n\nIn this regard it will be appreciated that the combination of the binding molecules (either conjugated or unconjugated) and the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered in any order and within any time frame that provides a therapeutic benefit to the patient. That is, the chemotherapeutic agent and polypeptide may be administered in any order or concurrently. Binding molecules and chemotherapeutic agents may be administered separately or may be administered in the form of one composition. In selected embodiments the polypeptides of the present invention will be administered to patients that have previously undergone chemotherapy. In yet other embodiments, the polypeptides and the chemotherapeutic treatment will be administered substantially simultaneously or concurrently. For example, the patient may be given the binding molecule while undergoing a course of chemotherapy. In preferred embodiments the binding molecule will be administered within 1 year of any chemotherapeutic agent or treatment. In other preferred embodiments the polypeptide will be administered within 10, 8, 6, 4, or 2 months of any chemotherapeutic agent or treatment. In still other preferred embodiments the polypeptide will be administered within 4, 3, 2 or 1 week of any chemotherapeutic agent or treatment. In yet other embodiments the polypeptide will be administered within 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 days of the selected chemotherapeutic agent or treatment. It will further be appreciated that the two agents or treatments may be administered to the patient within a matter of hours or minutes (i.e. substantially simultaneously).\n\n\nMoreover, in accordance with the present invention a myelosuppressed patient shall be held to mean any patient exhibiting lowered blood counts. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are several blood count parameters conventionally used as clinical indicators of myelosuppresion and one can easily measure the extent to which myelosuppresion is occurring in a patient. Examples of art accepted myelosuppression measurements are the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) or platelet count. Such myelosuppression or partial myeloablation may be a result of various biochemical disorders or diseases or, more likely, as the result of prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In this respect, those skilled in the art will appreciate that patients who have undergone traditional chemotherapy typically exhibit reduced red marrow reserves. As discussed above, such subjects often cannot be treated using optimal levels of cytotoxin (i.e. radionuclides) due to unacceptable side effects such as anemia or immunosuppression that result in increased mortality or morbidity.\n\n\nMore specifically conjugated or unconjugated polypeptides of the present invention may be used to effectively treat patients having ANCs lower than about 2000/mm\n3 \nor platelet counts lower than about 150,000/mm\n3\n. More preferably the polypeptides of the present invention may be used to treat patients having ANCs of less than about 1500/mm\n3\n, less than about 1000/mm\n3 \nor even more preferably less than about 500/mm\n3\n. Similarly, the polypeptides of the present invention may be used to treat patients having a platelet count of less than about 75,000/mm\n3\n, less than about 50,000/mm\n3 \nor even less than about 10,000/mm\n3\n. In a more general sense, those skilled in the art will easily be able to determine when a patient is myelosuppressed using government implemented guidelines and procedures.\n\n\nAs indicated above, many myelosuppressed patients have undergone courses of treatment including chemotherapy, implant radiotherapy or external beam radiotherapy. In the case of the latter, an external radiation source is for local irradiation of a malignancy. For radiotherapy implantation methods, radioactive reagents are surgically located within the malignancy, thereby selectively irradiating the site of the disease. In any event, the disclosed polypeptides may be used to treat disorders in patients exhibiting myelosuppression regardless of the cause.\n\n\nIn this regard it will further be appreciated that the polypeptides of the instant invention may be used in conjunction or combination with any chemotherapeutic agent or agents (e.g. to provide a combined therapeutic regimen) that eliminates, reduces, inhibits or controls the growth of neoplastic cells in vivo. As discussed, such agents often result in the reduction of red marrow reserves. This reduction may be offset, in whole or in part, by the diminished myelotoxicity of the compounds of the present invention that advantageously allow for the aggressive treatment of neoplasias in such patients. In other preferred embodiments the radiolabeled immunoconjugates disclosed herein may be effectively used with radiosensitizers that increase the susceptibility of the neoplastic cells to radionuclides. For example, radiosensitizing compounds may be administered after the radiolabeled binding molecule has been largely cleared from the bloodstream but still remains at therapeutically effective levels at the site of the tumor or tumors.\n\n\nWith respect to these aspects of the invention, exemplary chemotherapeutic agents that are compatible with the instant invention include alkylating agents, vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine), procarbazine, methotrexate and prednisone. The four-drug combination MOPP (mechlethamine (nitrogen mustard), vincristine (Oncovin), procarbazine and prednisone) is very effective in treating various types of lymphoma and comprises a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In MOPP-resistant patients, ABVD (e.g., adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine), ChlVPP (chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine and prednisone), CABS (lomustine, doxorubicin, bleomycin and streptozotocin), MOPP plus ABVD, MOPP plus ABV (doxorubicin, bleomycin and vinblastine) or BCVPP (carmustine, cyclophosphamide, vinblastine, procarbazine and prednisone) combinations can be used. Arnold S. Freedman and Lee M. Nadler, \nMalignant Lymphomas\n, in H\nARRISON'S \nP\nRINCIPLES OF \nI\nNTERNAL \nM\nEDICINE \n1774-1788 (Kurt J. Isselbacher et al., eds., 13\nth \ned. 1994) and V. T. DeVita et al., (1997) and the references cited therein for standard dosing and scheduling. These therapies can be used unchanged, or altered as needed for a particular patient, in combination with one or more polypeptides of the invention as described herein.\n\n\nAdditional regimens that are useful in the context of the present invention include use of single alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil, or combinations such as CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone), CHOP (CVP and doxorubicin), C-MOPP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine), CAP-BOP(CHOP plus procarbazine and bleomycin), m-BACOD (CHOP plus methotrexate, bleomycin and leucovorin), ProMACE-MOPP (prednisone, methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and leucovorin plus standard MOPP), ProMACE-CytaBOM (prednisone, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine, methotrexate and leucovorin) and MACOP-B (methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, fixed dose prednisone, bleomycin and leucovorin). Those skilled in the art will readily be able to determine standard dosages and scheduling for each of these regimens. CHOP has also been combined with bleomycin, methotrexate, procarbazine, nitrogen mustard, cytosine arabinoside and etoposide. Other compatible chemotherapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA), 2′-deoxycoformycin and fludarabine.\n\n\nFor patients with intermediate- and high-grade NHL, who fail to achieve remission or relapse, salvage therapy is used. Salvage therapies employ drugs such as cytosine arabinoside, cisplatin, etoposide and ifosfamide given alone or in combination. In relapsed or aggressive forms of certain neoplastic disorders the following protocols are often used: IMVP-16 (ifosfamide, methotrexate and etoposide), MIME (methyl-gag, ifosfamide, methotrexate and etoposide), DHAP (dexamethasone, high dose cytarabine and cisplatin), ESHAP (etoposide, methylpredisolone, HD cytarabine, cisplatin), CEPP(B) (cyclophosphamide, etoposide, procarbazine, prednisone and bleomycin) and CAMP (lomustine, mitoxantrone, cytarabine and prednisone) each with well known dosing rates and schedules.\n\n\nThe amount of chemotherapeutic agent to be used in combination with the polypeptides of the instant invention may vary by subject or may be administered according to what is known in the art. See for example, Bruce A Chabner et al., \nAntineoplastic Agents\n, in G\nOODMAN \n& G\nILMAN'S \nT\nHE \nP\nHARMACOLOGICAL \nB\nASIS OF \nT\nHERAPEUTICS \n1233-1287 ((Joel G.

Biologics useful in the treatment of cancers are known in the art and a binding molecule of the invention may be administered, for example, in conjunction with such known biologics.\n\n\nFor example, the FDA has approved the following biologics for the treatment of breast cancer: Herceptin® (trastuzumab, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, Calif.; a humanized monoclonal antibody that has antitumor activity in HER2-positive breast cancer); Faslodex® (fulvestrant, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP, Wilmington, Del.; an estrogen-receptor antagonist used to treat breast cancer); Arimidex® (anastrozole, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP; a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor which blocks aromatase, an enzyme needed to make estrogen); Aromasin® (exemestane, Pfizer Inc., New York, N.Y.; an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator used in the treatment of breast cancer); Femara® (letrozole, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, N.J.; a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor approved by the FDA to treat breast cancer); and Nolvadex® (tamoxifen, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP; a nonsteroidal antiestrogen approved by the FDA to treat breast cancer).

In this regard, it will be appreciated that the disclosed binding molecules will be formulated so as to facilitate administration and promote stability of the active agent. Preferably, pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the present invention comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable, non-toxic, sterile carrier such as physiological saline, non-toxic buffers, preservatives and the like. For the purposes of the instant application, a pharmaceutically effective amount of a binding molecule of the invention, conjugated or unconjugated to a therapeutic agent, shall be held to mean an amount sufficient to achieve effective binding to a target and to achieve a benefit, e.g., to ameliorate symptoms of a disease or disorder or to detect a substance or a cell. In the case of tumor cells, the polypeptide will be preferably be capable of interacting with selected immunoreactive antigens on neoplastic or immunoreactive cells and provide for an increase in the death of those cells. Of course, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in single or multiple doses to provide for a pharmaceutically effective amount of the polypeptide.\n\n\nIn keeping with the scope of the present disclosure, the polypeptides of the invention may be administered to a human or other animal in accordance with the aforementioned methods of treatment in an amount sufficient to produce a therapeutic or prophylactic effect. The polypeptides of the invention can be administered to such human or other animal in a conventional dosage form prepared by combining the binding molecule of the invention with a conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent according to known techniques. It will be recognized by one of skill in the art that the form and character of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent is dictated by the amount of active ingredient with which it is to be combined, the route of administration and other well-known variables. Those skilled in the art will further appreciate that a cocktail comprising one or more species of polypeptides according to the present invention may prove to be particularly effective.\n\n\nXIV. Methods of Use\n\n\nThe molecules of the invention can be used in circumstances where it is desirable to use stabilized scFv molecules or compositions comprising such scFv molecules, e.g., for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide compounds, compositions, kits and methods for the diagnosis and/or treatment of disorders that would benefit from administration of a binding molecule of the invention, e.g., neoplastic disorders in a mammalian subject in need of such treatment. Preferably, the subject is a human.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the subject binding molecules may be used in an assay to detect a tumor antigen in vitro, e.g., using an ELISA assay. Exemplary assays are known in the art, see, e.g., United States Application Number 20040077025.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the subject binding molecules are useful for detecting the presence of tumor antigen bearing cells using imaging technology. For such applications, it may be desirable to conjugate the binding molecule to a detectable molecule, e.g., a radiolabel, as described further below.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the subject binding molecules are useful for reducing or eliminating cells (e.g. by apoptosis) bearing an epitope (e.g., an epitope of Cripto or an epitope of a TNF receptor family member, eg. TRAIL-R2 or LTβR) recognized by a binding molecule of the invention. In another embodiment, the subject binding molecules are effective in reducing the concentration of or eliminating soluble target molecules in the circulation.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention reduces tumor size, inhibits tumor growth and/or prolongs the survival time of a tumor-bearing subject. Accordingly, this invention also relates to a method of treating tumors in a human or other animal by administering to such human or animal an effective, non-toxic amount of polypeptide. One skilled in the art would be able, by routine experimentation, to determine what an effective, non-toxic amount of polypeptide would be for the purpose of treating malignancies. For example, a therapeutically active amount of a polypeptide may vary according to factors such as the disease stage (e.g., stage I versus stage IV), age, sex, medical complications (e.g., immunosuppressed conditions or diseases) and weight of the subject, and the ability of the binding molecule to elicit a desired response in the subject. The dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily, or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. Generally, however, an effective dosage is expected to be in the range of about 0.05 to 100 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day and more preferably from about 0.5 to 10, milligrams per kilogram body weight per day.\n\n\nFor purposes of clarification “mammal” refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, cats, cows, etc. Preferably, the mammal is human. “Treatment” refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disease or disorder as well as those in which the disease or disorder is to be prevented. Hence, the mammal may have been diagnosed as having the disease or disorder or may be predisposed or susceptible to the disease.\n\n\nIn general, the disclosed compositions may be used to prophylactically or therapeutically. For example, a neoplasm comprising a marker that allows for the targeting of the cancerous cells by the binding molecule may be detected or inhibited (e.g., killed) using a binding molecule of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention are used to treat solid tumors. Exemplary cancers that may be treated include, but are not limited to, prostate, gastric carcinomas such as colon, skin, breast, ovarian, lung and pancreatic cancer. In another embodiment, the antibodies of the instant invention may be used to treat Kaposi's sarcoma, CNS neoplasias (capillary hemangioblastomas, meningiomas and cerebral metastases), melanoma, gastrointestinal and renal sarcomas, rhabdomyosarcoma, glioblastoma (preferably glioblastoma multiforme), leiomyosarcoma, retinoblastoma, papillary cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary, Wilm's tumor or small cell lung carcinoma. It will be appreciated that appropriate polypeptides may be derived for tumor associated molecules related to each of the forgoing neoplasias without undue experimentation in view of the instant disclosure.\n\n\nExemplary hematologic malignancies that are amenable to treatment with the disclosed invention include Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphoma as well as leukemias, including ALL-L3 (Burkitt's type leukemia), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and monocytic cell leukemias. It will be appreciated that the compounds and methods of the present invention are particularly effective in treating a variety of B-cell lymphomas, including low grade/follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), cell lymphoma (FCC), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL), small lymphocytic (SL) NHL, intermediate grade/follicular NHL, intermediate grade diffuse NHL, high grade immunoblastic NHL, high grade lymphoblastic NHL, high grade small non-cleaved cell NHL, bulky disease NHL and Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. It should be clear to those of skill in the art that these lymphomas will often have different names due to changing systems of classification, and that patients having lymphomas classified under different names may also benefit from the combined therapeutic regimens of the present invention. In addition to the aforementioned neoplastic disorders, it will be appreciated that the disclosed invention may advantageously be used to treat additional malignancies bearing compatible tumor associated molecules.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is capable of binding specifically to a tumor cell antigen and inhibiting growth of tumor cells in a patient. In certain embodiments, the tumor cells are brain, head, neck, prostate, breast, testicular, colon, lung, ovary, bladder, uterine, cervical, pancreatic and stomach tumor cells. In other embodiments, a binding molecule of the invention binds specifically to the tumor cell antigen and inhibits growth of tumor cells which overexpress the antigen. In one embodiment, the tumor cells are cell lines which overexpress the antigen, such as cell lines derived from brain, breast, testicular, colon, lung, ovary, bladder, uterine, cervical, pancreatic and stomach cancers.\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments the binding molecules of the present invention may be used to treat immune disorders that include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis; Allergic rhinitis Autoimmune hemolytic anemia; Acanthosis nigricans; Allergic contact dermatitis; Addison's disease; Atopic dermatitis; Alopecia greata; Alopecia universalis; Amyloidosis; Anaphylactoid purpura; Anaphylactoid reaction; Aplastic anemia; Angioedema, hereditary; Angioedema, idiopathic; Ankylosing spondylitis; Arteritis, cranial; Arteritis, giant cell; Arteritis, Takayasu's; Arteritis, temporal; Asthma; Ataxia-telangiectasia; Autoimmune oophoritis; Autoimmune orchitis; Autoimmune polyendocrine failure; Behcet's disease; Berger's disease; Buerger's disease; bronchitis; Bullous pemphigus; Candidiasis, chronic mucocutaneous; Caplan's syndrome; Post-myocardial infarction syndrome; Post-pericardiotomy syndrome; Carditis; Celiac sprue; Chagas's disease; Chediak-Higashi syndrome; Churg-Strauss disease; Cogan's syndrome; Cold agglutinin disease; CREST syndrome; Crohn's disease; Cryoglobulinemia; Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis; Dermatitis herpetifomis; Dermatomyositis; Diabetes mellitus; Diamond-Blackfan syndrome; DiGeorge syndrome; Discoid lupus erythematosus; Eosinophilic fasciitis; Episcleritis; Drythema elevatum diutinum; Erythema marginatum; Erythema multiforme; Erythema nodosum; Familial Mediterranean fever; Felty's syndrome; Fibrosis pulmonary; Glomerulonephritis, anaphylactoid; Glomerulonephritis, autoimmune; Glomerulonephritis, post-streptococcal; Glomerulonephritis, post-transplantation; Glomerulopathy, membranous; Goodpasture's syndrome; Granulocytopenia, immune-mediated; Granuloma annulare; Granulomatosis, allergic; Granulomatous myositis; Grave's disease; Hashimoto's thyroiditis; Hemolytic disease of the newborn; Hemochromatosis, idiopathic; Henoch-Schoenlein purpura; Hepatitis, chronic active and chronic progressive; Histiocytosis X; Hypereosinophilic syndrome; Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; Job's syndrome; Juvenile dermatomyositis; Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (Juvenile chronic arthritis); Kawasaki's disease; Keratitis; Keratoconjunctivitis sicca; Landry-Guillain-Barre-Strohl syndrome; Leprosy, lepromatous; Loeffler's syndrome; lupus; Lyell's syndrome; Lyme disease; Lymphomatoid granulomatosis; Mastocytosis, systemic; Mixed connective tissue disease; Mononeuritis multiplex; Muckle-Wells syndrome; Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis; Multiple sclerosis; Myasthenia gravis; Mycosis fungoides; Necrotizing vasculitis, systemic; Nephrotic syndrome; Overlap syndrome; Panniculitis; Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria; Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; Pemphigoid; Pemphigus; Pemphigus erythematosus; Pemphigus foliaceus; Pemphigus vulgaris, Pigeon breeder's disease; Pneumonitis, hypersensitivity; Polyarteritis nodosa; Polymyalgia rheumatic; Polymyositis; Polyneuritis, idiopathic; Portuguese familial polyneuropathies; Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia; Primary biliary cirrhosis; Progressive systemic sclerosis (Scleroderma); Psoriasis; Psoriatic arthritis; Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis; Pulmonary fibrosis, Raynaud's phenomenon/syndrome; Reidel's thyroiditis; Reiter's syndrome, Relapsing polychrondritis; Rheumatic fever; Rheumatoid arthritis; Sarcoidosis; Scleritis; Sclerosing cholangitis; Serum sickness; Sezary syndrome; Sjogren's syndrome; Stevens-Johnson syndrome; Still's disease; Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis; Sympathetic ophthalmia; Systemic lupus erythematosus; Transplant rejection; Ulcerative colitis; Undifferentiated connective tissue disease; Urticaria, chronic; Urticaria, cold; Uveitis; Vitiligo; Weber-Christian disease; Wegener's granulomatosis and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention can be used for pretargeting applications. For example, the same advantages will be apparent in pretargeting applications for chemotherapeutic drug delivery.\n\n\nFor example, in pretargeting a tumor is pretargeted with a binding construct that has affinity for the tumor-associated antigen on the one hand and for, e.g., a radiolabeled hapten on the other. The radiolabeled hapten is administered later, preferably after the binding construct that has affinity for the tumor-associated antigen has cleared (see, e.g., Boerman et al. 2003. J. Nuclear Med. 44:400). In another example, an antibody which is non-toxic, but has been derivitized to react with a drug or prodrug that is toxic only when bound by the binding molecule. Given the biodistribution data in the instant examples, the binding molecules of the invention are well suited to use in pretargeting applications. In one embodiment, a clearing agent could be eliminated from the pretargeting methodology by using the instant binding molecules.\n\n\nThis invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references, patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThroughout the examples, the following materials and methods were used unless otherwise stated.\n\n\nGeneral Materials and Methods\n\n\nIn general, the practice of the present invention employs, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of chemistry, biophysics, molecular biology, recombinant DNA technology, immunology (especially, e.g., antibody technology), and standard techniques in electrophoresis.

Seventeen of the 18 antibodies were expressed from either stable bulk or clonal CHO cell lines and 1 of the antibodies (BIIB13) was expressed using transient transfection in HEK293E cells. All 18 antibodies contain kappa light chains. The majority of the antibodies were human IgG1; however, BIIB2, BIIB5 and BIIB11 were human IgG4. Seventeen of the 18 antibodies were human or humanized. BIIB15 was PRIMATIZED® (Nakamura et al., 2000). The identity of the human germline for each antibody was assessed by ClustalW alignment (ClustalW WWW Service at the European Bioinformatics Institute, Thompson et al., 1994) of the BIIB V\nH \nor V\nκ\n sequences against the publicly available human germlines (Lefranc et al., 1999).\n\n\nFifteen of the 18 total antibodies were IgG1 subclass and the remaining 3 were IgG4 (BIIB2, BIIB5 and BIIB11). IgG1 and \nIgG4 C\n \n \n \nH\n1 sequences have 10 amino acid differences (6 are conservative) and an alternate disulfide-bonding pattern with the light chain.\n\n\nAn IgG1 and an IgG4 construct with a duplicate Fv region was available to investigate the effect of IgG subclass on Fab stability. Two constructs were created which contained the V\nH \nregion of BIIB7 grafted to either an IgG1 or an IgG4 heavy chain constant region.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nPreparation of Conventional BHA10 scFv and Fab Proteins\n\n\nBHA10 scFv was subcloned from plasmid pXWU034, using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotide primers shown in Table 2 below. The forward primer BHA10-01F contains a unique Sph I restriction endonuclease site (underlined sequence) followed by 18 bases of sequence complementary to the BHA10 N-terminal heavy variable domain gene. The reverse primer, BHA10-01R, contains 24 bases of sequence complementary to the BHA10 C-terminal light variable domain gene, 15 bases of sequence complementary to an Enterokinase Site, and adjacent Hind III and Xba I restriction endonuclease sites (endonuclease sites are underlined). Following PCR amplification, a PCR product corresponding to the expected size was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, excised, and purified using the Millipore Ultrafree-DA extraction kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Millipore; Bedford, Mass.). The purified PCR product was digested with Sph I, made blunt-end by digesting with DNA Polymerase I in the presence of dNTPs, and then digested with Hind III. The blunt-ended/Hind III digested PCR product was ligated to Sca I/Hind III digested pKJS216. pKJS216 is an \nE. coli \nvector that drives recombinant protein expression under the control of an inducible ara C promoter. A portion of the ligation mixture was used to transformed \nE. coli \nstrain XL1-Blue. Ampicillin drug resistant colonies were screened and DNA sequence analysis confirmed the correct sequence of the final pIEH003 construct. DNA and amino acid sequences of BHA10 scFv are shown in \nFIGS. 1A and 1B\n, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOligonucleotides for PCR amplification of a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconventional BHA10 scFv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimers\n\n\nSequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBHA10-\n01F\n \n\n\n5′- CAGTA\nGCATGC\nAGGTCCAACTGGTGCAG -3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 1)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBHA10-\n02R\n \n\n\n5′-GT\nTCTAGAAAGCTT\nTTGTCGTCGTCGTCTTTGAT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 2)\n\n\nCTCCACCTTGGTACCCTG -3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor expression of BHA10 scFv, freshly isolated colonies of \nE. coli \nstrain W3110 (ATCC, Manassas, Va. Cat. #27325) transformed with plasmid pIEH003 were grown in 4×250 ml SB media (Teknova, Half Moon Bay, Ca. Cat. # S0140) containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin in 1 L baffled flasks to OD\n600\n≅0.8, induced by adding to 0.02% arabinose, and cultured overnight. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation. The pellets were solubilized and lysed using 40 mL B-PER protein extraction reagent (Cat#78243, Pierce). Solubilized scFv was applied to a 5 mL Ni-NTA-Superflow column (Cat#30410, Qiagen). Bound scFv was washed with 60 mM imidazole, pH 8.0 and eluted with 300 mM imidazole, pH 8.0. Eluted scFv was loaded onto a 6 mL Protein L agarose column (Cat#20510, Pierce). Bound protein was washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and eluted with 0.1 M glycine, pH 3.0. Purified scFvs were dialyzed against PBS and stored at −20° C. Protein concentrations were determined using an ε\n280 nm\n=2.1 ml mg\n−1 \ncm\n−1\n.\n\n\nFor enzymatic preparation of BHA10 Fab, BHA10 IgG was mixed with 4 μl of a concentrated papain stock (0.3 mg/mL, 30 Units/mg—Cat#108014, Roche) in 8.3 ml solution containing 2.4 mg/mL BHA10 IgG1, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM EDTA at pH 7.0. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 90 minutes at 25° C. The digest solution was diluted 1:5 with 20 mM acetate, pH 5.0 and loaded onto a 6 ml SP-Sepharose FF column equilibrated with dilution buffer. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of dilution buffer. Crude Fab fragments were eluted with 30 column volumes of a 0-200 mM NaCl linear gradient. A broad peak centering at 140 mM NaCl (˜24 mL total) was collected and contained the majority of the digested IgG material. The eluted volume was reduced to 2 mL by concentration and loaded onto a preparative G300 SW Tosohaas SEC column (109 mL) equilibrated with PBS. Fab was eluted at 0.8 column volumes over 15 mL. Purified Fab was concentrated to between 2-11 mg/mL. Fab concentrations were determined using an ε\n280 nm\n=1.5 mL mg\n−1 \ncm\n−1\n.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nThermal Stability of Conventional BHA10 scFv Molecules\n\n\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to test whether an isolated BHA10 scFv is intrinsically less stable than its Fab counterpart. Scans were performed using an automated capillary differential scanning calorimeter (capDSC, MicroCal, LLC). Protein and reference solutions were sampled automatically from 96-well plates using the robotic attachment. Prior to each protein scan, 2 scans were performed with buffer in the sample cell and used for background subtraction. A single cleaning scan was performed using 5% Liquinox after every protein scan. After every scan, the instrument automatically rinsed both the reference and sample cells three times with 2 ml distilled deionized H\n2\nO containing 0.01% sodium azide. Scans were performed at 1° C./min using the medium feedback mode for enhanced peak resolution. The scan range was 20-95° C. All 96-well plates containing protein were stored within the instrument at 6° C.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n shows DSC measurements with purified BHA10 Fab and scFv antibody fragments. Within the calorimeter, the temperature is raised until the Fab or scFv unfolds. The temperature at which each protein unfolds (i.e., the T\nM \nvalue) can be indicative of the overall stability. All four domains of the BHA10 Fab (V\nH\n, V\nL\n, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and C\nL\n) unfold cooperatively at 78° C. (\nFIG. 2A\n). The scFv domain lacks the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and C\nL \ndomains. Without this scaffolding, the domains of the scFv unfold at much lower temperatures than the Fab and there is a significant decrease in the calorimetric enthalpy of the domains indicating the loss of stabilizing interactions. The V\nL \ndomain unfolds with a T\nM \nof 68° C., while the V\nH \ndomain unfolds at 58° C., 20° C. lower than what was observed for the unfolding transition of the BHA10 Fab (\nFIG. 2B\n). Additionally, there is a scan rate dependence of the T\nM\n, suggesting that protein aggregation is occurring during the heating phase which artificially lowers the T\nM \nof the scFv as the scan rate is slowed (Sánchez-Ruiz et al., \nBiochemistry, \n27: 1648-1652, 1988). The low apparent stability and the propensity to aggregate may be determining factors for the inability of CHO cells to produce significant quantities of stable, non-aggregated material which contain scFvs such as the conventional Hercules bispecific antibody molecules.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nConstruction of BHA10 scFv Molecules with Improved Thermal Stability\n\n\nKnowing that the BHA10 scFv domain, as evidenced in Example 2, is intrinsically unstable, it was hypothesized that engineering the scFv through the use of recombinant DNA technology to produce a modified scFv that is thermodynamically or functionally equivalent to a Fab under thermal challenge conditions should result in an scFv domain that is useful for constructing a bispecific antibody. Moreover, it was also hypothesized that engineering of the isolated scFv domain by itself should impart whatever beneficial biophysical properties are gained when re-introduced as a component of a full bispecific molecule. Towards that end, an effort to improve the biophysical stability of the BHA10 scFv domain using an \nE. coli \nexpression system and monitored improvements in stability by measuring binding of thermally resistant scFv domains to ligand in a thermal challenge assay was begun.\n\n\nTo stabilize the scFv domains two methods were applied: 1) introducing a disulfide bond between the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomain of the BHA10 scFv; and 2) optimizing the length of the (Gly\n4\nSer)\nn \nlinker that connects the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of the BHA10 scFv.\n\n\nA. Construction of Disulfide-stabilized BHA10 scFvs\n\n\nThe BHA10 scFv producing bacterial expression vector, pIEH003, was utilized as the parental vector. The QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene; La Jolla, Calif.) was used, according to the manufacturer's instructions, to introduce two cysteine residues, one in V\nH \nand a second in V\nL \nthat could participate in forming a stabilizing disulfide bond. Primer pairs VH44-F and VH44-R (Table 3) were used to mutagenize the Gly residue (GGA) at position 44 (Kabat numbering system) of BHA10 variable heavy chain to a Cys residue (TGC). The mutagenesis product was digested with methylation sensitive enzyme Dpn I according to the kit protocol and transformed into the \nE. coli \nstrain XL10-GOLD® (Stratagene; La Jolla, Calif.). \nE. coli \ncolonies transformed to ampicillin drug resistance were screened for the correct sequence mutation by DNA sequence analysis. The resulting plasmid, pIEH004, was utilized for a subsequent reaction to mutate the Gln residue (CAG) at position 100 (Kabat numbering system) of BHA10 variable light chain to a Cys residue (TGC) using primer pairs VL100-F and VL100-R (Table 3). Forward (VH44-F) and reverse (VH44-R) primers mutate Gly (GGA) to a Cys (TGC) at V\nH \nposition 44 (TGC indicated by underlined sequence). Forward (VL100-F) and reverse (VL100-R) primers mutate Gln (CAG) to a Cys (TGC) at V\nL \nposition 100 (TGC indicated by underlined sequence).\n\n\nXL10-GOLD® \nE. coli \ncolonies transformed to ampicillin drug resistance were screened for the correct sequence mutation by DNA sequence analysis and plasmid pIEH006 was identified as containing the double cysteine mutations at \npositions V\n \n \n \nH\n44 and \nV\n \n \n \nL\n100. DNA and amino acid sequences of VH44/VL100 disulfide-stabilized BHA10 scFv are shown in \nFIGS. 3A and 3B\n, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOligonucleotides for construction of VH44/VL100\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisulfide-stabilized BHA10scFv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimers\n\n\nSequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH44-\nF\n \n\n\n5′- GCAGGCCCCTGGACAG\nTGC\nCTTGAGTGGATGGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 5)\n\n\nATG -3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH44-\nR\n \n\n\n5′- CATCCCATCCACTCAAG\nGCA\nCTGTCCAGGGGCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 6)\n\n\nTGC -3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVL100-\nF\n \n\n\n5′- CCTATCCATTCACGTTCGGC\nTGC\nGGTACCAAGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 7)\n\n\nTGGAGATC -3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVL100-\nR\n \n\n\n5′- GATCTCCACCTTGGTACC\nGCA\nGCCGAACGTGAA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 8)\n\n\nTGGATAGG -3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Construction of BHA10 scFv with Alternative (Gly\n4\nSer)\nn \nLinkers\n\n\nPlasmid pIEH003 encoding huBHA10 scFv with the conventional (Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinker was modified to contain a (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nor (Gly\n4\nSer)\n5 \nlinker by PCR amplification using the oligonucleotide primers described in Table 4.\n\n\nBHA10 scFv (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nwas assembled using a \nforward\n 5′ PCR primer designated pXWU002-F1 and a \nreverse\n 3′ PCR primer designated XWU002-R. The 5′ VH PCR primer XW002-F1 included a Btg I restriction endonuclease site (underlined sequence) located at the carboxyl terminus of BHA10 VH followed by sequence encoding a (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker. The 3′ VL PCR primer XW002-R included an Xba I site and a partial Enterokinase site. The partial BHA10 VH+(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker+the BHA10 VL regions were amplified in a PCR reaction using the XW002-F1/XW002-R PCR primer set from plasmid DNA pIEH003 (described in Example 1). The partial BHA10 scFv-(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker gene fragment corresponding to the expected size was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, excised, and purified using the Millipore Ultrafree-DA extraction kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Millipore; Bedford, Mass.). The purified PCR product was digested and cloned into the Btg I/Xba I digested pIEH003 vector resulting in plasmid pXWU002 encoding BHA10 scFv containing a (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker. BHA10 scFv containing the (Gly\n4\nSer)\n5 \nlinker was constructed in similar fashion using PCR primers XW003-F and XW002-R to produce plasmid pXWU003. Forward 5′PCR primer (XWU003-F) contained a Btg I site (underlined sequence) followed by sequence encoding a few amino acid of the carboxyl terminus of BHA10 VH and sequence encoding a partial (Gly\n4\nSer)\n5 \nlinker. Correct sequences were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. DNA and amino acid sequences of BHA10 scFv containing the (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker are shown in \nFIGS. 4A and 4B\n, respectively.

Expression and Western Blot Analysis of Engineered BHA10 scFvs\n\n\nFor expression of engineered BHA10 scFvs, \nE. coli \nstrain W3110 (ATCC, Manassas, Va. Cat. # 27325) was transformed with plasmids pIEH003, pXWU002, pXWU003 and pIEH006 and ampicillin resistant colonies selected and grown in 10 ml SB media (Teknova, Half Moon Bay, Ca. Cat. # S0140) containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin in a 50 ml conical centrifuge tube to OD\n600\n≅0.8, induced by adding to 0.02% arabinose, and cultured overnight. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and the pellets resuspended in 1/20 volume of an ice-cold iso-osmotic solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 20% sucrose (w/v) and chilled on ice. Equal volume of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 20% sucrose (w/v) containing 2 mg/ml Lysozyme (Sigma) was added to the bacterial suspension and incubated on ice with occasional mixing for 10 minutes. The bacterial suspension was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 8000×g, 4° C. and the periplasmic fraction retained.\n\n\nSamples were mixed with native sample buffer or sample buffer containing the reducing agent dithiothreitol and heated at 90° C. for 3 minutes. Reduced and non-reduced samples were electrophoresed on an SDS-PAGE Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.). The membrane was blocked with PBS containing 5% (w/v) non-fat milk and 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with an anti-human kappa antibody (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Ind.). The membrane was washed and then incubated with an anti-rabbit HRP antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Immune complexes were detected using the ECL Western Blotting Analysis System according to the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.).\n\n\nIt was found that one of three disulfide pairs tested, namely VH44:VL100, produced suitable amounts of protein when expressed in \nE. coli \n(\nFIG. 6\n, lane 2). (The V\nH \n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL \n105 and V\nH \n106:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n43 disulfides tested did not produce as much intact scFv). Similarly, extending the length of the (Gly\n4\nSer)\nn \n(SEQ ID NO: 160) linker to n=4 (lane 3) or n=5 (not shown) also produced suitable amounts of protein in \nE. coli\n. Combining both the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 and (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker modifications into BHA10 scFv using the methods described in Example 3 also led to suitable amounts of expressed protein (\nFIG. 6\n, lane 4). DNA and amino acid sequences of BHA10 scFv containing the combination of V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 and (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker modifications are shown in \nFIGS. 7A and 7B\n, respectively. In both cases where the BHA10 scFv contains the V\nH\n4\n4\n:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 mutations, the scFvs were found to migrate with increased mobility in the denaturing, non-reducing polyacrylamide gel, yet migrated similarly to conventional BHA10 scFv under denaturing, reducing conditions (\nFIG. 6\n, \nlanes\n 2 and 4). This analysis suggests that the BHA10 scFv variants containing the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 mutations are likely forming intact disulfide bonds and may be attaining a more compact structure.\n\n\nB. Thermal Denaturation Assay.\n\n\nThe activities of the conventional and engineered BHA10 scFvs were then compared in a thermal challenge assay which can be used to determine the temperature at which 50% of scFv molecules retain their antigen binding activity following a thermal challenge event. The numerical value corresponding to this temperature is referred to as the “T\n50\n” value and the units are in ° C. In this assay, the scFvs were subjected to a range of temperatures that encompass the thermal transition temperature of conventional BHA10 scFv.\n\n\n \nE. coli \nstrain W3110 (ATCC, Manassas, Va. Cat. #27325) was transformed with plasmids encoding the conventional and engineered BHA10 scFvs under the control of an inducible ara C promoter. Transformants were grown overnight in expression media consisting of SB (Teknova, Half Moon Bay, Ca. Cat. #S0140) supplemented with 1% glycine, 1% Triton X100, 0.02% arabinose, and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at either 37° C. or 32° C. Bacteria was pelleted by centrifugation and supernatants harvested for further treatment. Including glycine and Triton X-100 in the media results in the release of periplasmic contents (native \nE. coli \nprotein and scFv) into the media (Yang et al. Applied and Environmental Microbiology. (1998) 64:2869-2874). The presence of \nE. coli \nproteins in the supernatant is essential to the performance of this assay because the thermally denatured proteins act as a “sink”, trapping transiently unfolded scFv molecules into irreversible inactive aggregates.\n\n\nEach library was screened in duplicate using a thermal challenge assay with supernatant from one replicate subjected to treatment conditions and the second supernatant serving as untreated reference. Thermal denaturation assays can be run at a single or range of temperatures for measuring stability. Thermocycler machines capable of generating stable thermal gradients were used for treating sample supernatants (iCycler, Bio-Rad, Gaithersburg, Md.).\n\n\nThe challenge temperature varied depending on the properties of the parental BHA10 scFv variant and was generally two to three degrees Celsius higher than the experimentally determined T\n50 \nvalue. Frozen Master plates were thawed and used to inoculate deep-well microtiter plates containing 250 μl of expression media per well, and cultures grown overnight at 32° C. As a control, cultures containing the parental plasmid were grown under the same conditions and processed simultaneously as the library. Bacteria were pelleted and 50-100 μl aliquots of test supernatant were placed in either PCR strip tubes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., Cat. #N801-535) or 96-well plates (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., Cat. #N801-560) and the samples were heated for 60-90 minutes. Samples were transferred to 96-well v-bottomed plates (Corning, Corning, N.Y., Cat. #3357) and centrifuged in a refrigerated clinical centrifuge (IEC model 8R, Thermo Electron, Waltham, Ma) for 30 minutes, and 100 μl of the supernatant was transferred to standard micotiter plates (Corning, Corning, N.Y., Cat. #3357). An aliquot of the supernatant was reserved for the reference DELFIA. For most libraries, the plates containing the remainder of the supernatants were sealed (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, N.Y., Cat. #235205) and placed in an incubator set to the appropriate challenge temperature (Echo Therm, Torrey Pines Scientific, San Marcos, Ca) for 90 minutes. For screens requiring multiple challenge temperatures (or for temperatures greater than 75° C.) the supernatants were transferred to 96-well PCR plates (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., Cat. #N801-560) and incubated for 90 minutes at the desired temperature.\n\n\nAfter thermal challenge, the samples were centrifuged at 2,000 RPM to remove aggregated material. Soluble BHA10 scFv samples remaining in the treated, cleared supernatant were assayed for binding to cognate LTβR Ig antigen by DELFIA assay. 96-well plates (MaxiSorp, Nalge Nunc, Rochester, N.Y., Cat. #437111) were coated with fusion protein consisting of the ectodomain of the LTβ receptor (LTβR) fused to a human Fc region at 1 μg/ml in 0.1M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5. Plates were coated overnight at 4° C., and blocked with DELFIA assay buffer (DAB, 10 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 20 μM EDTA, 0.5% BSA, 0.02\n% Tween\n 20, 0.01% NaN\n3\n, pH 7.4) for one hour with shaking at room temperature. Plates were washed 3 times with DAB without BSA (Wash buffer), and test samples diluted in DAB were added to the plates in a final volume of 100 μl. The plates were incubated for one hour with shaking at room temperature, and then washed 3 times with Wash buffer to remove unbound and functionally inactivated scFv molecules. Bound BHA10 scFv was detected by addition of 100 μl per well of DAB containing 40 ng/ml of Eu-labeled anti-His\n6 \nantibody (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass., Cat. # AD0109) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for one hour. The plates were washed 3 times with Wash buffer, and 100 μl of DELFIA enhancement solution (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass., Cat. #4001-0010) was added per well. Following incubation for 15 minutes, the plates were read using the Europium method on a Victor 2 (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.).\n\n\nAssay data was processed using Spotfire DecisionSite software (Spotfire, Somerville, Ma.) and expressed as the ratio of the DELFIA counts observed at challenge temperature to the reference temperature for each clone. Clones that reproducibly gave ratios greater than or equal to twice what was observed for the parental plasmid were considered hits. Plasmid DNAs from these positive clones were isolated by mini-prep (Wizard Plus, Promega, Madison, Wis.) and retransformed back into \nE. coli \nW3110 for confirmation secondary thermal challenge assays.\n\n\nFor thermal gradients, the data was analyzed using \nPrism\n 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.) using a sigmoidal dose response with variable slope as the model. The values obtained for the mid-point of the thermal denaturation curves are referred to as T\n50 \nvalues, and are not construed as being equivalent to biophysically derived Tm values.\n\n\nThe results of the thermal challenge assay are depicted in \nFIG. 8\n. As depicted in \nFIG. 8\n, all of the stabilized scFv molecules of the invention resulted in improvements in binding activity (T\n50\n>49° C.) as compared with the conventional scFv. In particular, the T\n50 \nvalues of BHA10 \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nL\n46 scFv (S46L), \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n16 scFv (S16E and S16Q), and library positions V\nL\n49: \nV\n \n \n \nL\n50 scFv exhibited increases in thermal stability ranging from +3° C. to +12° C. relative to the conventional BHA10 scFv. In addition, the T\n50 \nvalues of BHA10 \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nL\n3 scFv (Q3A, Q3G, Q3S, Q3V, and Q3D), \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n67 scFv (V67I and V67L), \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n48 scFv (M48I and M48G), \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n20 scFv (V20I) and \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n101 scFv (P101D) exhibited increases in thermal stability ranging from +4° C. to +18° C. relative to the conventional BHA10 scFv. One of the stabilizing mutations (V\nL \nK13E) serendipitously resulted from a PCR error. Incorporation of one of these stabilizing mutations into pIEH009 was found to further improve thermal stability and even exceed that of BHA10 Fab under these conditions. Importantly, the \nnon-covalent V\n \n \n \nL\n46, \nV\n \n \n \nH\n101 mutation, and \nV\n \n \n \nH\n55 mutations derived from one or more of the four design methods (V\nL\n/V\nH \ninterface homology modeling, consensus scoring, computational modeling, and covariation analysis) resulted in an improvement in scFv thermal stability nearly approaching that observed with the disulfide mutations and validating the utility and novelty of these design tools. In particular, the T\n50 \nof the pIEH006 construct, BHA10 V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 scFv (59° C.), differed from BHA10 Fab (62° C.) by only 3° C., while the pIEH009 construct, BHA10 scFv V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker, was found to be functionally equivalent to BHA10 Fab under these conditions. These results demonstate that the stabilized scFvs of the invention have improved activity following a thermal challenge event.\n\n\nc. Affinity Measurements\n\n\nIsothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to measure the affinity of sLTβR to the BHA10 Fab derived using enzymatic cleavage of the BHA10 IgG1 molecule. sLTβR was prepared as described previously (Eldredge et al., \nBiochemistry\n, (2006)). The Fab and sLTβR were concentrated to 6.0 and 2.0 mg/mL, respectively, using Amicon ultracentrifugal filter devices (MWCO 10,000). The concentrated stock solutions were simultaneously dialyzed against PBS prior to the ITC measurements. ITC was performed on a VP-ITC unit (MicroCal LLC, Northampton, Mass.) set to 30° C. Approximately 500 μL of a 7 μM sLTβR solution was placed into the sample cell and PBS dialysate was placed in the reference cell. A total of 234 μL of 70 μM BHA10 Fab was titrated into the sample cell in 7×10 μL, 12×7 μL, followed by 8×10 μL injections. The reaction stoichiometry was 1:1. ITC curves were analysed using the Origin Software supplied by the manufacturer.\n\n\nK\nD \nmeasurements of conventional BHA10 scFv, BHA10 (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv, and BHA10 V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly4Ser)\n4 \nscFv preparations as described in Examples 3 and expressed and purified using the methods described in Example 1 were performed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on a \nBiacore\n 3000 instrument (Biacore Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). All experiments were performed in HBS-EP buffer, pH 7.4. Biotinylated PENTA-His antibody (20 μg/mL, Cat#34440, Qiagen) was immobilized onto a streptavidin-coated CM5 chip at a flow rate of 10 μl/min for approximately 1 minute. 0.1 μM solutions of test scFvs were injected over the chip at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 10 minutes and captured onto the surface via the immobilized PENTA-His (SEQ ID NO: 159) antibody. To investigate binding between sLTβR and captured scFv, a concentration series of sLTβR (1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 nM) was double injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min onto the scFv-coated surface. Background was subtracted from test sample sensorgrams using sensorgram data from a flow cell containing buffer only and sensorgram data from the PENTA-His surface where scFv was injected followed by an injection of buffer instead of sLTβR. The curves were analyzed using the BiaEval 3.0 manufacturer's software. K\nD \nvalues were calculated by fitting kinetic association and dissociation curves to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. Chip surfaces were regenerated by two consecutive 10 μL injections of 0.1 M glycine, pH 3.0.\n\n\nTable 5 shows the results of the Biacore affinity assay. The binding affinity of recombinantly produced BHA10 scFv is essentially the same as the BHA10 Fab prepared as described in Example 1. Additionally, introduction of the (G\n4\nS)\n4 \nlinker alone or in the presence of the stabilizing disulfide (V\nH\n44:V\nL\n100), or the combination of the two did not result in any significant loss of affinity towards antigen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiacore affinity assay-binding to LTβR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConstruct\n\n\nKd (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBHA10 scFv\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBHA10 (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBHA10 V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBHA10 Fab (CHO)\n\n\n1.9 ± 1.0*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*Measured by isothermal titration calorimetry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD.

BHA10 V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv demonstrated superior thermostability properties compared to the wild-type scFv.

Increases in the “melting temperature” or T\nM \ncould be due to two separate factors, (i) an increase in the thermostability of the equilibrium folded state or (ii) a decreased tendency to aggregate. The ˜5° C. temperature difference between the conventional BHA10 scFv and BHA10 V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv was relatively independent of scan rate (between 0.2 and 4.0° C./min) suggesting the observed T\nM \nchange was due to stabilization of the equilibrium folded state.\n\n\nE. ANS Binding Studies\n\n\nThe ability to bind the hydrophobic fluorescent dye 1-anilino-8-naphthaline sulfonate (ANS) is often a hallmark of interactions with significantly large hydrophobic regions either in a protein's native state or partially unfolded state that can occur upon increased treatment with temperature. The intrinsic fluorescence of the dye is quenched in solvent and significantly increases when exposed to large hydrophobic surface areas. The conventional BHA10 scFv intrinsically bound ANS at a much stronger level than the BHA10 (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv, or BHA10 V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv indicating the presence of hydrophobic exposure forced upon the scFv by an inadequately sized linker. Addition of the longer linker, specifically (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4\n, appeared to mediate this effect. The apparent exposure of a hydrophobic surface by the conventional BHA10 scFv may lead to an increased level of aggregation in the presence of other proteins or molecules, or even in the presence of itself in isolation. Heating BHA10 scFv above its T\nM \nappeared to induce ANS binding for the conventional and engineered BHA10 scFvs. Interestingly, the conventional BHA10 scFv showed a gradual increase in ANS binding, as a function of increasing temperature, suggesting possible increases in hydrophobic exposure at temperatures below the T\nM\n—such as temperatures used in bacterial and mammalian cell culture (i.e. 37° C.) (\nFIG. 10\n). In contrast, both BHA10 (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nand BHA10 V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly4Ser)\n4 \nscFvs did not exhibit this property suggesting that the stabilizing mutations described in this invention decrease the tendency to self-associate or associate with other cell-culture protein components based on reduced exposure of hydrophobic surface areas.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nIdentification of Stabilizing Mutations which Confer Improved Intrinsic Protein Stability\n\n\n(i) Identification of Stabilizing Mutations\n\n\nA variety of sequence-based methods (e.g., consensus scoring, covariation analysis, VH/VL interface homology modeling) were used to identify stabilizing mutations which conferred improved protein stability to binding molecules of interest.\n\n\nThese stabilizing mutations were used in the design and construction of antibody variable region expression libraries.\n\n\nA. Covariation Analysis\n\n\nA number of designs were developed for stabilizing the BHA10 scFv V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains based on the strong covariation exhibited by two or more residues within a single sequence. Covariation analysis was performed on the BHA10 scFv V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains using methods similar to those described in Example 17 infra in order to identify missing or violative covariations such that stabilizing mutations could be predicted and included in an antibody variable region expression library for experimental screening.\n\n\nIn a first example, mutation from Ser to Leu at position 46 (S46L; Kabat numbering system) within the BHA10 V\nL \nexhibited a positive connection to an existing Tyr at \nresidue\n 36 which the Covariation Analysis Tool showed to covary strongly with Leu 46 (see \nFIG. 78\n). This mutation was also predicted to be stabilizing by residue frequency analysis.\n\n\nIn addition to S46L, a second mutation predicted by covariation to be stabilizing was a V55G mutation within the BHA10 V\nH \ndomain. While residue frequency indicated that Val is infrequently observed at this position, this position is embedded within CDR2 and is variable. Therefore, without additional information, no changes at this position were previously attempted. Upon inspection by covariation analysis, however, the covariation data suggested that this position was strongly correlated with at least 10 other amino acids that already exist within the BHA10 V\nH \ndomain. Mutation to Gly at \nposition\n 55 satisfied all 10 covariations.\n\n\nAnother example of the utility of the Covariation Analysis Tool was the predicted negative effect of a BHA10 V\nH \nQ6E mutation. Single residue frequency analysis suggested that mutation to the much more commonly observed Glu at this position would lead to an increase in stability. However, the Covariation Analysis Tool indicated that single mutation to Glu violates several existing covariations present within the BHA10 V\nH \nsequence. To obtain an improvement in stability, one must replace several amino acids that preferentially stabilize Glu at this position.\n\n\nYet, another example of the predictive value of the Covariation Analysis Tool is shown in \nFIG. 79\n. \nMet\n 80 was mutated to Leu as part of a single residue library design. It was thought that this single mutation would be highly stabilizing, as Leu is the most frequent amino acid observed at this position within the sequence database. However, covariation analyses indicate that two other amino acids must be mutated (V67F and T70S) in order to achieve covariation harmony.\n\n\nB. Consensus Scoring\n\n\nConsensus scoring was utilized as a method for identifying amino acid residues within the scFv V\nH \nand V\nL \nregions for mutagenesis to improve the intrinsic stability of the scFv. The scoring assesses the relative drift from consensus V\nH \nand V\nκ\n sequences due to hypersomatic mutations and evolutionary germline variations. Information derived from this analysis was then used to design a library to screen for scFv variants with improved stability.\n\n\nThe reference set of mammalian V\nH \nand V\nκ\n kappa sequences used to derive the consensus sequence for scoring and the individual amino acid frequencies at each residue position were collected, sorted, and culled as described previously (Demarest, et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n335, 41-48 (2004); Demarest, et al., \nProtein Eng. Des. Sel. In Press\n, (2006). The mammalian reference sets were naively constructed to include V-genes from various mammals in order to obtain diversity via the evolutionary drift between species. The V\nH \nmammalian reference set contains 61 V\nH \nsequences primarily from NCBI and TIGR representing a total of 17 different mammalian species. The V\nκ\n mammalian reference set contains 53 V\nκ\n sequences from 13 different mammalian species.\n\n\nStatistical analysis of the BHA10 V\nH \nand V\nL \nwere performed using custom designed IgG databases and a modified PERL script (Demarest et al., 2004; Demarest et al., 2006). The amino acid frequency of every residue within the BHA10 V\nH \nand V\nL \nwas calculated from the custom database. The residue frequency of each amino acid within the BHA10 VH and VL, S\ni\n(r), for each position, i, in an individual sequence was calculated by the number of times that particular residue-type (r=A, C, D . . . V, W, Y) is observed within the data set divided by the total number of sequences. \nFIG. 11\n shows the BHA10 V\nH \nand V\nL \nresidue frequencies divided by the residue frequency of the database consensus residues. By dividing by the consensus residue frequency, a stringent cutoff for the creation of libraries at residue positions where the BHA10 amino acid is infrequently observed among common V\nH \nor V\nL \nsequences is obtained. Library positions were determined by those whose residue frequency divided by the most frequent residue frequency (S\ni\n(r)/MFR\ni\n(r)) was <0.3. The residues listed to the right of the residue frequency calculations are those commonly found in human sequences as published (Chothia, et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n278, 457-479, (1998)) and can be specifically targeted in a library format to screen for the most stabilizing amino acid. The CDRs of the BHA10 V\nH \nand V\nL \nwere not considered for stability optimization due to potential interruption of the interaction with LTβR, but could be considered for second-generation designs.\n\n\nC. VH/VL Interface Homology Modeling\n\n\nAs described in Example 15 infra, differential scanning calorimetry analyses were performed on 17 human antibodies. The top candidates, BIIB1-4 all had exquisite (i.e., very high and desired) stability properties. These highly stable antibodies may be used as a platform for improving the stability of scFvs or antibody domains with low intrinsic stability. In particular, emphasis was placed on the interface between V\nH \nand V\nL \nto provide a potentially greater level of stability properties.\n\n\nConverting the BHA10 Fab toan scFv format resulted in a change in the DSC thermogram indicative of a fully cooperative unfolding event, as observed by a single, higher temperature unfolding transition (Fab), to a largely non-cooperative unfolding event, as observed by two individual, lower temperature unfolding transitions (scFv). In other words, in the Fab format, the interdomain contacts were strong enough to lock all the domains together into a single, higher temperature unfolding transition. Once the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and C\nL \ndomains were removed, the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of the scFv no longer had the ability to drive the unfolding transition into a cooperative event. It is postulated that by stabilizing the interface, on may not only stabilize both the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains simultaneously, but also promote the adherence of the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninterface and preclude aggregation.\n\n\nThe top 4 most stable BIIB antibodies (BIIB1-4) were used to design stabilizing mutations into the BHA10 scFv via a two-step procedure. First, a crystal structure of the humanized BHA10 Fab was utilized for structural analysis. Specifically, the crystal structure was employed to identify all the residues at the interface between V\nH \nand V\nL \nas well as the amount of surface area that each residue contributes to the interface (using MOLMOL software). The residues that bury significantly more surface area than others at the interface are considered to be more crucial to the interface. As an arbitrary limit prioritization, those that bury between 30 and 40 Å\n2 \nare considered important. Those that bury >40 Å\n2 \nare considered crucial. These two categories were given the highest priority in terms of homology modeling and mutagenesis. The amount of surface area each residue buries at the interface is listed in Table 6. Secondly, the amino acid types at the interface between V\nH \nand V\nL \nwere compared with the amino acids that exist at the same positions in BIIB1-4 (i.e. the extremely stable antibodies). This method allowed identification of a number of outstanding mutations for stabilizing the BHA10 scFv.\n\n\nTwo mutations, S46L in the V\nL \nand P101D in the V\nH \nwere experimentally validated as described in Example 8. In fact, these two mutations were the single most stabilizing mutations tested in the thermal challenge assay (e.g., see \nFIG. 50A\n and \nFIG. 50C\n). Both mutations stabilize both V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains simultaneously, suggesting that they help to build cooperativity among the domains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBHA10 V\nH\nV\nL \nSurface Area Analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition of\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nResidue\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH/VL\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterface\n\n\n \n\n\nBHA10 AA\n\n\nBuried\n\n\nwithin\n\n\nCorresponding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidue\n\n\n \n\n\nType\n\n\nSurface Area\n\n\nmammalian\n\n\nAA from Stable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Kabat #)\n\n\nRegion\n\n\n(Kabat)\n\n\n(Å\n2\n)\n\n\ndatabase\n\n\nAb (BIIB)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 35\n\n\nFR2\n\n\nHis\n\n\n16.4\n\n\n \n\n\nHis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 37\n\n\nFR2\n\n\nVal\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n \n\n\nVal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 39\n\n\nFR2\n\n\nGln\n\n\n37.4\n\n\n98%\n\n\nGln\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 44\n\n\nFR2\n\n\nGly\n\n\n13.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 45\n\n\nFR2\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n97.8\n\n\n97%\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 47\n\n\nCDR2\n\n\nTrp\n\n\n78.5\n\n\n97%\n\n\nTrp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 50\n\n\nCDR2\n\n\nTrp\n\n\n24.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 59\n\n\nCDR2\n\n\nGln\n\n\n28.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 61\n\n\nCDR2\n\n\nAsn\n\n\n26.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 90\n\n\nFR3\n\n\nTyr\n\n\n37.3\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 100I\n\n\nCDR3\n\n\nGlu\n\n\n101.8\n\n\nHighly Variable\n\n\nGly (BIIB1), Tyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(BIIB2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 100J\n\n\nCDR3\n\n\nGly\n\n\n36.4\n\n\nAla, Gly (MCR);\n\n\nPhe (BIIB1),\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTyr (uncommon);\n\n\nAla (BIIB2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 100K\n\n\nCDR3\n\n\nPhe\n\n\n66.7\n\n\nMet (MCR); Phe\n\n\nPhe (BIIB1);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(SMCR)\n\n\nMet (BIIB2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 101\n\n\nCDR3\n\n\nPro\n\n\n43.3\n\n\nAsp (V.

Computational Analysis\n\n\nComputational methods were used to analyze BHA10 for making recommendations on positions whereby amino acid substitutions might improve stability. These methods were composed of two steps: sequence-based analysis (step 1); and structure-based analysis (step 2). During the first step, a database of sequences of variable domains of antibodies was used. Amino acids present in low frequencies in their respective positions (less than in 10% of database sequences) or those that did not match the corresponding consensus amino acid were selected for substitutions to high-frequency or consensus amino acids (candidate mutations). During the second step a three-dimensional structure or model of an Fab fragment of the antibody was used. The candidate mutations were evaluated in their structural context and were prioritized for experimental testing based on structural properties, compatibility with complementarity determining regions (CDRs) conformations, role in V\nL\n/V\nH \ninterface packing, and folding of heavy and light chains.\n\n\nBHA10 is unusual in having a serine in \nposition\n 46 on the light chain. In the database, approximately 1% of V\nL \n(kappa subtype) sequences possess S46, whereas approximately 79% of V\nL \n(kappa subtype) sequences have L46. Also, human consensus KV1 has L46. Once identified as a candidate mutation, S46L substitution was evaluated in the context of a three-dimensional model of BHA10 Fab. \nPosition\n 46 was found to reside at the V\nL\n/V\nH \ninterface making contacts with Y101 and W103 of V\nH \nand Y36 and Y55 of V\nL\n. Structure-base analysis revealed that S46L substitution was compatible with the integrity V\nL\n/V\nH \ninterface, CDR conformations, and V\nL \nfolding.\n\n\nSerine is an infrequent amino acid at \nposition\n 16 of the heavy chain. In the database, approximately 5% of V\nH \nsequences possess S16, 25% have A16, 21% have G16, 11% have E16, and approximately 10% are Q16. Also human consensus HV1 has A16. Once identified as candidate mutations, S16A, G, E, and Q substitutions were evaluated in the context of three-dimensional model of BHA10 Fab. \nPosition\n 16 was found to reside in the loop proximal to the V\nH\n/\nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 interface making contacts with K13 and S16 of V\nH\n. Structure-base analysis revealed that S16A, G, E, and Q substitutions were compatible with the integrity of the V\nL\n/V\nH \ninterface, CDR conformations, and V\nH \nfolding. Also it was concluded that long hydrophilic sidechains of E16 and Q16 would be preferred. Accordingly, positions \nV\n \n \n \nL \n46 and \nV\n \n \n \nH \n16 were represented in the library design.\n\n\nA complementary approach to computational analysis made use of structure-based protein engineering techniques, such as Rosetta (Kuhlman B. et al., PNAS 200198(19):10687-91) and DEEK (Hanf K. J., Ph.D. Thesis, MIT, 2002). Given a three dimensional structure of a protein interface, these methods can yield mutations in amino acid sequence that lead to improved ΔΔG for VH to VL binding (difference between bound and unbound states) and/or ΔΔG for VH and VL folding (difference between folded and reference unfolded states). Use of these methods revealed that S46L is a mutation that improves VH to VL binding, whereas S16E is a mutation that improves folding of the VH.\n\n\nE. Combined Interface and Covariation Design Approaches\n\n\nCovariation analysis was used to determine residue networks important for providing and supporting the interface between VH and VL and maintaining a strong affinity between V\nH\n/V\nL\n, thereby resulting in increased scFv stability. Residues directly involved in the interface between VH and VL of the BHA10 scFv were identified as described in Example 5C and are listed in Table 6 supra. Residues that covary strongly with the most highly buried residues listed in Table 6 supra were calculated using the covariation methodology described in Section III (a) supra. The HMM used for covariation analysis eliminates the ability to investigate residues in CDR2 and CDR3 of both the VH and VL domains that are buried at the interface. Nevertheless, it is believed that no strong covariations would arise from these residue positions as they are highly variable due to intense selective pressures that exist for antibodies to be able to recognize antigens with high affinity. Therefore, the residues that were used for determining whether a covariation network exists for supporting the interface between both VH and VL were:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVH (kabat#)\n\n\nVL (kabat#)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV37/I37\n\n\nY36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQ39\n\n\nQ38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG44\n\n\nA43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL45\n\n\nP44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nW47\n\n\nL46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nW50\n\n\nY49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY91\n\n\nY95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nW103\n\n\nF98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidues whose appearance in the V-class sequence alignment correlated with the interface residues listed above were determined using a phi-value cutoff >0.25. No residue was considered as important for maintaining a strong interface between VH and VL if it was not correlated with at least 2 of the interface residues listed directly above. Tables 7 and 8 list those residues within the VH and VL domains, respectively, that demonstrate 2 or more correlations with interface residues. The larger the number of links, the greater the impact each of these amino acid positions is conceived to have for stabilizing the interface between VH and VL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidues with VH with multiple strong correlations to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstructural residues observed at the interface of the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBHA10 xray-crystal structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovar#\n\n\nAmino Acid\n\n\nBha10Xray#\n\n\nKabat#\n\n\n#Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nW\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV(I**)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nE\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n71\n\n\nI\n\n\n51\n\n\n51\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n85\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nY\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n142\n\n\nL\n\n\n112\n\n\n109 \n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n \nP\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n14\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n \nG\n \n\n\n26\n\n\n26\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n \nF\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n27\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n102\n\n\nI\n\n\n70\n\n\n69\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n135\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nW\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n106\n\n\n\n\n\n\n103 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n \nF\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n29\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nR\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nG\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nG\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n78\n\n\n \nG\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n55\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n93\n\n\n \nL\n \n\n\n64\n\n\n63\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n97\n\n\n \nG\n \n\n\n55\n\n\n54\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n101\n\n\n \nT\n \n\n\n69\n\n\n68\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n106\n\n\n \nD\n \n\n\n73\n\n\n72\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n109\n\n\n \nS\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n74\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n115\n\n\n \nY\n \n\n\n80\n\n\n79\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n120\n\n\nT(S*)\n\n\n85\n\n\n \n82b\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n \nE\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n 8\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\n \nY\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n32\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nQ\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nP\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n92\n\n\n \nS\n \n\n\n63\n\n\n62\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n124\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n85\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n131\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nY\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n91\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\nA, V, \nG\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n24\n\n\n 3*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA, N, \nP\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n \n3*\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidues in bold bury surface area at the interface.

Two supported from this analysis. First, covariations do not provide information (at this stage) about networks involving CDR2 and CDR3 residues at the interface. Second, covariations suggest that not only are residues that make direct contacts within the interface important for its maintenance, but that many other residues outside the direct interface residues are important for scaffolding and supporting the positions of the interface residues. This point is illustrated by those residues that are illustrated on the surface of the covariation network but are absent on the surface obtained simply using the structures to calculate those residues that directly bury surface at the interface.\n\n\nViolations of a few of these interface covariation networks were found to exist within the BHA10 or p5E8 (described below in Example 21) scFvs: VH or VL sequences. Mutation of the native/non-ideal amino acids at these positions to the ideally supportive interface amino acid residues described in Tables 7 and 8 were shown to be highly stabilizing to either the BHA10 or p5E8 scFvs: (a) BHA10 VL S46L, and (b) Idec152 VH S49G (kabat and Xray#)\n\n\nE72D(73 for Xray). One of these residues (S46L\nVL\n) was directly at the interface, one (S49G\nVH\n) was directly adjacent to the interface, and one was distal to the interface (E72D\nVH\n). However, all three were predicted based on Covariation Analysis to be stabilizing to the interface. Stabilization of the interface can be observed using DSC measurements as an increase in the thermal stability of both the V\nH \nand the V\nL\n.\n\n\nii) Construction and Screening of BHA10 scFv Libraries with Improved Thermal Stability\n\n\nA) Construction of scFv Libraries\n\n\nLibraries designed to contain the desired amino acid replacements in the conventional BHA10 scFv (pXWU002) using the methods described in Examples 4, 5, and 6 were created using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit following instructions provided by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) using oligonucleotides listed in Table 9.

Master plates were created by adding an equal volume of LB containing 20% glycerol to each well of the deep-well 96 well dishes and transferring 50 μl aliquots of the bacterial suspension to sterile microtiter plates (Corning, Corning, N.Y., Cat. #3359) and freezing for storage at −80° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOligonucleotides for stability engineering of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBHA10 scFv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBHA10 Library\n\n\n \n\n\nDesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition\n\n\nSequence†\n\n\nMethod(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nL \n49 and 50\n\n\n5′-GTACCGGTAGGAGGC\n\n\nConsensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 123)\n\n\n \nMNNRKA\nAATCAGTGATTT\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAGG -3\n′\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nL \n46\n\n\n5′-GGGAAGGCTCCTAAA\n\n\nConsensus,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 124)\n\n\n \nTTA\nCTGATTTCCTCGGC\n\n\nComputation,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nC -3′\n\n\nV\nL\n/V\nH \nInterface,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nCovariation\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nH \n16\n\n\n5′-GGACACCTTCACTGA\n\n\nConsensus,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 125)\n\n\n \nCBN\nCCCAGGCTTCTTCA\n\n\nComputation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nC -3\n′\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nH \n101\n\n\n5′-GATCCTGGGAAGGTT\n\n\nV\nL\n/V\nH \nInterface,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 126)\n\n\nTTGACTACTGGGGCCAAG\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGGAC -3\n′\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nH \n20\n\n\n5′-GGGTCCTCAGTGAAG\n\n\nConsensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 127)\n\n\nWTRTCCTGCAAGGCTTCT\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG -3\n′\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nH \n48\n\n\n5′-CAGGGACTTGAGTGG\n\n\nConsensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 128)\n\n\nVKKGGATGGATTTATCCT\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG -3\n′\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nH \n67\n\n\n5′-GAAGTTCAAGGGCAG\n\n\nConsensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 129)\n\n\nGNYCACAATCACTGCAGA\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nC -3\n′\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nH \n55\n\n\n5′-GGATGGATTTATCCT\n\n\nCovariation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 130)\n\n\nGGAAATGGTCATGCTCAG\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACAATGAG -3\n′\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nL \n3\n\n\n5′-GGTGGTAGTGACATT\n\n\nConsensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 131)\n\n\nVNSATGACCCAGTCTCCT\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAGC -3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Positions targeted for mutagenesis are indicated by underline.

Thermal Challenge Assay\n\n\nThe activities of the conventional and engineered BHA10 scFvs were then compared in a thermal challenge assay which can be used to determine the temperature at which 50% of scFv molecules retain their antigen binding activity following a thermal challenge event. The numerical value corresponding to this temperature is referred to as the T\n50 \nvalue and the units are in ° C. In this assay, the scFvs were subjected to a range of temperatures that encompass the thermal transition temperature of conventional BHA10 scFv.\n\n\n \nE. coli \nstrain W3110 (ATCC, Manassas, Va. Cat. #27325) was transformed with plasmids encoding conventional and engineered BHA10 scFvs under the control of an inducible ara C promoter. Transformants were grown overnight in expression media consisting of SB (Teknova, Half Moon Bay, Ca. Cat. #S0140) supplemented with 1% glycine, 1% Triton X100, 0.02% arabinose, and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at either 37° C. or 32° C. Bacteria was pelleted by centrifugation and supernatants harvested for further treatment. Including glycine and Triton X-100 in the media resulted in the release of periplasmic contents (native \nE. coli \nprotein and scFv) into the media. The presence of \nE. coli \nproteins in the supernatant is essential to the performance of this assay because the thermally denatured proteins act as a “sink”, trapping transiently unfolded scFv molecules into irreversible inactive aggregates.\n\n\nEach library was screened in duplicate using a thermal challenge assay with supernatant from one replicate subjected to treatment conditions and the second supernatant serving as untreated reference. Thermal challenge assays can be run at a single or range of temperatures for measuring stability. Thermocycler machines capable of generating stable thermal gradients are used for treating sample supernatants (iCycler, Bio-Rad, Gaithersburg, Md.).\n\n\nThe challenge temperature varied depending on the properties of the parental BHA10 scFv variant and was generally two to three degrees Celsius higher than the experimentally determined T\n50 \nvalue. Frozen Master plates were thawed and used to inoculate deep-well microtiter plates containing 250 μl of expression media per well, and cultures grown overnight at 32° C. As a control, cultures containing the parental plasmid were grown under the same conditions and processed simultaneously as the library. Bacteria were pelleted in the deep-well plates by centrifugation at 2000 rpm (IEC model 8R, Thermo Electron, Waltham, Ma) for 30 minutes, and 100 μl of the supernatant was transferred to standard micotiter plates (Corning, Corning, N.Y., Cat. #3357). An aliquot of the supernatant was reserved for the reference DELFIA. For most libraries, the plates containing the remainder of the supernatants were sealed (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, N.Y., Cat. #235205) and placed in an incubator set to the appropriate challenge temperature (Echo Therm, Torrey Pines Scientific, San Marcos, Ca) for 90 minutes. For screens requiring multiple challenge temperatures (or for temperatures greater than 75° C.) the supernatants were transferred to 96-well PCR plates (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., Cat. # N801-560) and incubated for 90 minutes at the desired temperature.\n\n\nAfter thermal challenge, the aggregated material was removed by centrifugation and soluble BHA10 scFv samples remaining in the treated, cleared supernatant were assayed for binding to cognate LTβR Ig antigen by DELFIA assay. 96-well plates (MaxiSorp, Nalge Nunc, Rochester, N.Y., Cat. #437111) were coated with fusion protein consisting of the ectodomain of the LTβ receptor (LTβR) fused to a human Fc region at 1 μg/ml in 0.1M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5. Plates were coated overnight at 4° C., and blocked with DELFIA assay buffer (DAB, 10 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 20 μM EDTA, 0.5% BSA, 0.02\n% Tween\n 20, 0.01% NaN\n3\n, pH 7.4) for one hour with shaking at room temperature. Plates were washed 3 times with DAB without BSA (Wash buffer), and test samples diluted in DAB were added to the plates in a final volume of 100 μl. The plates were incubated for one hour with shaking at room temperature, and then washed 3 times with Wash buffer to remove unbound and functionally inactivated scFv molecules. Bound BHA10 scFv was detected by addition of 100 μl per well of DAB containing 40 ng/ml of Eu-labeled anti-His\n6 \nantibody (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass., Cat. # AD0109) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for one hour. The plates were washed 3 times with Wash buffer, and 100 μl of DELFIA enhancement solution (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass., Cat. #4001-0010) was added per well. Following incubation for 15 minutes, the plates were read using the Europium method on a Victor 2 (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.).\n\n\nAssay data was processed using Spotfire DecisionSite software (Spotfire, Somerville, Ma.) and expressed as the ratio of the DELFIA counts observed at challenge temperature to the reference temperature for each clone. Clones that reproducibly gave ratios greater than or equal to twice what was observed for the parental plasmid were considered hits. Plasmid DNAs from these positive clones were isolated by mini-prep (Wizard Plus, Promega, Madison, Wis.) and retransformed back into \nE. coli \nW3110 for confirmation secondary thermal challenge assays.\n\n\nFor thermal gradients, the data was analyzed using \nPrism\n 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.) using a sigmoidal dose response with variable slope as the model. The values obtained for the mid-point of the thermal denaturation curves are referred to as T\n50 \nvalues, and are not construed as being equivalent to biophysically derived Tm values.\n\n\nPrimary and confirmatory results from these assays are shown in Table 10. Several of the stabilized scFv molecules of the invention resulted in improvements in binding activity (T\n50\n>49° C.) as compared with the conventional scFv. In particular, the T\n50 \nvalues of BHA10 \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nL\n46 scFv (S46L), \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n16 scFv (S16E and S16Q), and library positions V\nL\n49: \nV\n \n \n \nL\n50 scFv exhibited increases in thermal stability ranging from +3° C. to +12° C. relative to the conventional BHA10 scFv. stability ranging from +3° C. to +12° C. relative to the conventional BHA10 scFv. In addition, the T\n50 \nvalues of BHA10 \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nL\n3 scFv (Q3A, Q3G, Q3S, Q3V, and Q3D), \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n67 scFv (V67I and V67L), \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n48 scFv (M48I and M48G), \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n20 scFv (V20I) and \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n101 scFv (P101D) exhibited increases in thermal stability ranging from +4° C. to +18° C. relative to the conventional BHA10 scFv. One of the stabilizing mutations (V\nL \nK13E) serendipitously resulted from a PCR error. Incorporation of one of these stabilizing mutations into pIEH009 was found to further improve thermal stability and even exceed that of BHA10 Fab under these conditions (\nFIG. 12\n). Importantly, the \nnon-covalent V\n \n \n \nL\n46 mutation and \nV\n \n \n \nH\n55 mutations derived from one or more of the four design methods (V\nL\n/V\nH \ninterface homology modeling, consensus scoring, computational modeling, and covariation analysis) resulted in an improvement in scFv thermal stability nearly approaching that observed with the disulfide mutations and validating the utility and novelty of these design tools.\n\n\n \nFIG. 1B\n shows the amino acid sequences of conventional BHA10 scFv (SEQ ID NO: 4) and \nFIGS. 94A\n and B shows the amino acid sequence of stabilized BHA10 scFVs containing the S46L(VL) stabilizing mutation (SEQ ID NO: 137), and the V55G (VH) stabilizing mutation (SEQ ID NO: 138), respectively.

As depicted in \nFIGS. 50A\n and B, both of these mutations led to significant increases in the T\n50 \nof the BHA10 scFv. In particular, the VL_S46L mutation stabilizes the scFv by ˜7-8° C. while the VH_V55G mutation stabilizes the scFv by ˜12° C. Both of these mutations also significantly shrink the T\nM \ngap between V\nH \nand V\nL \nas determined by DSC (see \nFIG. 51\n). The DSC data shows that both mutations lead to significant increases in both the T\nM \n(midpoint of the thermal unfolding transitions) of both of the VH and VL domains and in the calorimetric enthalpy (i.e. area under the curve) for the scFv. Increases in these values provide experimental validation that these predicted stabilizing mutations are in fact stabilizing to the scFv. Furthermore, since these two mutations stabilize both V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains simultaneously, they are likely important in building cooperativity between the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains. Accordingly, it is expected that strengthening the interface between V\nH \nand V\nL \nmay not only help increase stability, but reduce the tendency to form aggregates as well.\n\n\nThe V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L stabilizing mutation and a third stabilizing mutation (VH_P101D) were also predicted to be stabilizing based on VH/VL interface homology modeling described in Example 4 supra. The VH_P101D stabilizing mutation stabilized the scFv by ˜15° C. as measured by thermal challenge assay (\nFIG. 50C\n). In addition, DSC (see \nFIG. 52\n) shows that this stabilizing mutation leads to significant increases in T\nM \nboth of the VH and VL domains and in the calorimetric enthalpy, indicating that this mutation is also likely cooperatively stabilize the scFv as a whole via the VH/VL interface.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nBiophysical Characterization of Stabilized BHA10 scFvs Comprising Stabilizing Mutations\n\n\nV region gene sequences from various plasmids listed in Table 11 were subcloned into a modified \nE. coli \nexpression vector to drive recombinant protein expression under the control of an inducible ara C promoter. Variant BHA10 scFvs were expressed and purified using methods described above. An apparent cleavage site at the N-terminus of the V\nL \ndomain led to a low level of V\nL \nin most scFv preparations as judged by SDS-Page analysis (\nFIG. 53\n).\n\n\nThe hydrodynamic properties of each scFv were investigated by size exclusion HPLC (Agilent Technologies) with static light scattering and refractive index detectors (MiniDAWN/ReX, Wyatt Technology). Each scFv was found to be predominantly monomeric; however, a few of the scFvs, including the wild-type (unstabilized) scFv, exhibited a low level of dimeric material (Table 12). None of the purified scFvs had detectable levels of oligomers larger than dimer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEC/Light Scattering Results of scFvs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpressed\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYield\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% Larger\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample\n\n\n(mg/L)\na\n \n\n\n% Monomer\n\n\n% Dimer\n\n\nAggregates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT\n\n\nn.d.\nb\n \n\n\n87\n\n\n13\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGS4\n\n\n0.6 ± 0.1\n\n\n97\n\n\n 3\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n009 (ss)\n\n\nn.d.\n\n\n99\n\n\n 1\nc\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n072 V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n85\n\n\n15\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n073 V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L + ss\n\n\n*0.15\n\n\n78\n\n\n22\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n074 V\nH\n \n \n—\n \nS16E\n\n\n2.4 ± 1.7\n\n\n94\n\n\n 6\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n075 V\nH\n \n \n—\n \nS16Q\n\n\n1.1 ± 0.5\n\n\n96\n\n\n 4\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n076 V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L +\n\n\n1.8 ± 0.4\n\n\n80\n\n\n20\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nH\n \n \n—\n \nS16E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n077 V\nH\n \n \n—\n \nP101D\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n93\n\n\n 7\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n078 V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L +\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n85\n\n\n15\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nH\n \n \n—\n \nS16Q\n\n\n\n\n\n\n079 V\nH\n \n \n—\n \nV55G\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n92\n\n\n 8\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n080 V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L +\n\n\n*0.21\n\n\n76\n\n\n24\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nH\n \n \n—\n \nS16E + ss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n087 V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L +\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n76\n\n\n24\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nH\n \n \n—\n \nS16E, V55G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n094 V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L +\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n79\n\n\n21\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nH\n \n \n—\n \nS16E, V55G,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP101D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nProteins without standard error were expressed one time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nb\nn.d., not determined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nc\nThese values were determined AFTER preparative SEC was performed to reduce aggregates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ultimate goal of the experiment was to investigate whether the designed mutations enhance stability and lead to a lower propensity for aggregation. The thermostability of each scFv was assessed using two separate methods. First, thermal unfolding of the scFvs was analyzed using DSC (\nFIG. 54A\n). Secondly, the thermostability of each scFv was investigated by heating the proteins in the presence of a fluorescent hydrophobic dye, 1-anilino-8-sulfonate (ANS, \nFIG. 54B\n). ANS generally binds to partially unfolded proteins or heat-denatured proteins in compact unfolded states. Upon association with exposed hydrophobic surface areas, the fluorescence of ANS increases significantly presumably due to sequestration of the quenching affects of solvent.\n\n\nThe temperature dependent ANS curves were fitted to a two-state protein unfolding transition as described below. The buffer was PBS and the concentration of scFv used in every experiment was 750 nM. Fluorecence measurements were performed on a JASCO model 812 Circular Dichroism spectropolarimeter equipped with a peltier heating device and external water bath. Fluorescence was collected using an accessory containing a photomultiplier tube perpendicular to the light path. The accessory is equipped with an adjustable monochrometer set to 480 nm. The sensitivity was set to 600 V. Heating was performed at a continuous rate of 120° C./min. The excitation monochrometer was set to 370 nm.\n\n\nThermal unfolding of every scFv in this study led to an increase in ANS fluorescence. The midpoint of thermal unfolding (i.e. the T\nM\n) of each scFv protein domain was determined using DSC by fitting each unfolding peak to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation using the Origin 7.0 software provided by the manufacturer (MicroCal, Inc). T\nM\ns were also derived using ANS fluorescence by incorporation of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation into the non-linear curve fitting routine in KaleighdaGraph™:\n\n\nΔ\nG\n \nU\n°(\nT\n)=Δ\nH\n \nU\n°(\nT\n)−\nTΔS\n \nU\n°(\nT\n),  (1)\n\n\nwhere ΔG\nU\n°(T) is the temperature-dependent change in Gibbs free energy upon unfolding, ΔH\nU\n°(T) is the enthalpy change associated with unfolding, and ΔS\nU\n°(T) is the entropy associated with unfolded.

Funct. Genet. \n16: 115-140, (1993); Myers et al., \nProtein Sci. \n4: 2138-2148 (1995)).\n\n\n\nThe thermostability measurements for all the scFvs derived from DSC and ANS-binding experiments were comparable. Unfolding of each scFv was irreversible; therefore, aggregation had an affect on the absolute T\nM \nmeasured by DSC or ANS-binding. Since the two techniques heated the samples differently and at different rates, the T\nM\ns were not expected to be identical across the experimental formats (Sánchez-Ruiz et al., \nBiochemistry, \n27:1648-1652 (1988)). However, the trend observed for each experimental technique was identical (see Table 13). The DSC experiments readily discriminated between the V\nH \nand V\nL \nunfolding transitions. The ANS-binding experiments were not capable of accurately discriminating 2 transitions (i.e. V\nH \nvs. V\nL \nunfolding); thus, only the apparent T\nM \nwas provided for the ANS-binding experiments. The apparent T\nM \nobserved by ANS-binding appeared to correlate well with the T\nM \nof the last domain to unfold, either V\nH \nor V\nL \ndepending on the mutation, as determined by DSC. Due to aggregation of unfolded material in both assay formats, the T\nM\ns were used as a guide to rank order the stability enhancements afforded by each mutation without additional interpretation of scFv free-energies of unfolding, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 13\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThermostability measurements of each scFv.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nscFv K\nD\n \n \n \n \n \n \nV\nH \nT\nM\n \n \nV\nL \nT\nM\n \n \nV\nH \nT\nM\n \n \nscFv T\nM\n \n \n(M) * 10\n−9\n \n \n \n \nConstruct\n \n(° C.

The rationale behind testing these positions for stability enhancements often came from multiple forms of analysis. Consensus methods predicted that all of the mutations V\nH \nS16E, S16Q, V55G, P101D and V\nL \nS46L would stabilize the BHA10 scFv (Example 3). However, V\nH \nV55G and P101 D (incidentally, the two most stabilizing mutations) are positioned within CDR2 and CDR3 of V\nH\n, respectively, and were not considered for mutagenesis until further predictive evidence was compiled that suggested that mutation at these two positions could lead to stabilizing events. Both V\nH \nV55G and V\nL \nS46L were also predicted to be stabilizing based on Covariation Analyses. Finally, V\nH \nP101D and V\nL \nS46L were predicted to be potentially stabilizing to the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninterface based on the interface composition of highly stable human antibodies (Example 3).\n\n\nSingle mutations at the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninterface increased the stability of both domains, while V\nH \nmutations outside the interface only stabilized the V\nH \ndomain itself. V\nH \nS16E, S16Q, and V55G were outside the interface and increased the apparent T\nM \nof the BHA10 V\nH \nby 3, 2, and 11° C., respectively. The V\nL \nstability was relatively unaffected by these mutations. V\nH \nV55G mutation appeared to increase the stability of the V\nH \nto match that of the V\nL \ndomain, without leading to detectable increases in V\nL \nstability. Both mutations at the interface, V\nH \nP101D and V\nL \nS46L significantly increased the stability of both domains. The P101D mutation in particular led to the fully cooperative unfolding of the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains suggesting that the interface and cooperativity of folding between V\nH \nand V\nL \nwas significantly strengthened. Thus, mutations at the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninterface may provide the most effective means of forming a stabilized Fv region and provide a rationale for prioritizing stability designs to the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninterface of scFvs over designs directed towards at residues outside the Fv interface.\n\n\nCombining V\nH \nmutations eventually led to a disconnect between the cooperativity of V\nH\n/V\nL \nunfolding (Table 13). As the V\nH \nT\nM \nclimbed above 75° C. (the result of combinations of V\nH \nmutations), the T\nM \nof the V\nL \nbegan to move towards lower temperatures. This suggests hyperstabilization of the V\nH \ndomain without building in compensating mutations within the V\nL \ndomain may lead to decreased folding cooperativity and a weakened interaction between the two domains. While the T\nM\ns of the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains (including the T\nM \nof the wild-type BHA10 scFv) were often quite different, evidence that mutations at the interface between the two domains could stabilize both domains simultaneously suggests that the two domains are interacting at some level with one another—although the apparent affinity between the isolated domains is not expected to be extremely high, except perhaps in the V\nH \nP101D stabilized variant (Brandts & Lin, \nBiochemistry, \n29:6927-6940, (1990)).\n\n\nIncreasing the stability of the scFv led to decreased intrinsic binding of the hydrophobic, fluorescent dye ANS at ambient temperature (15° C., \nFIG. 55\n). The wild-type scFv binds weakly to ANS suggesting that the protein may permanently or transiently expose hydrophobic surface area to solvent. Stabilized scFvs appeared to completely lose the ability to bind ANS under ambient conditions—the fluorescence of ANS in the presence of the most stabilized scFvs was no greater than that of ANS alone in solvent. Plots of V\nH\n \n \n—\n \nT\nM \n(measured by DSC or temperature-dependent ANS-binding experiments) vs. ANS-fluorescence in the presence of folded protein at 15° C. demonstrate that scFv-dependent ANS fluorescence decreases as scFv stability increases (\nFIG. 55\n). Reduction of ANS-binding by scFv stabilization may indicate that less hydrophobic surface area gets exposed to solvent and that stabilized scFvs may have a lower intrinsic propensity for aggregation.\n\n\nK\nD \nmeasurements of various individual and combined stabilizing BHA10 scFv mutations were performed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on a \nBiacore\n 3000 instrument. Table 13 shows the results of the Biacore affinity assay. The binding affinity of the variant BHA10 scFvs ranged from 1×-2.5× of the parent BHA10 scFv.\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nProduction of Stabilized Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies\n\n\nBoth conventional BHA10 scFv and the stabilized BHA10 scFvs of the invention were used to construct a panel of bispecific antibodies referred to as “Hercules”. Hercules bispecific antibodies comprise a fusion of chimeric 14A2 IgG antibody that binds to TRAIL R2 receptor with a BHA10 scFv that binds to LTβR. The Hercules antibodies were constructed both as N-terminal and C-terminal BHA10 scFv fusions (see \nFIG. 13\n). N-terminal scFv fusions can be engineered as light chain and/or heavy chain fusions (“N\nL\n-Hercules” or “N\nH\n-Hercules”, respectively). The decision as to which amino terminal V region (heavy or light) is selected for adjoining the scFv is primarily driven by which chain is thought to tolerate a fused scFv which is capable of recognizing the first target antigen while not appreciably interfering with the binding of the Fab domain to the second target antigen.\n\n\nIt is also possible using the methods described in this invention to engineer tetravalent or bispecific antibodies consisting solely of stabilized scFvs fused directly to antibody hinge regions or to CH2 or CH3 domains as depicted, for example, in \nFIGS. 42-49\n. Said antibodies may comprise full-length Fc regions (see, for example, \nFIG. 46\n) or CH\n2\n-domain deleted Fc regions (see, for example, \nFIG. 42\n). In other exemplary embodiments, two or more stabilized scFv domains may be fused to the same terminus of a heavy or light chain (see, for example, \nFIG. 43\n).\n\n\nA.

A (Gly\n4\nSer)\n5 \nlinker was used to connect the BHA10 scFvs to the mature amino terminus of chi14A2 heavy chain. The forward 5′ VH PCR primer (scFvBHA10-F1) includes an Mlu I restriction endonuclease site (underlined sequence) for cloning followed by sequence encoding the last three amino acids of the heavy chain signal peptide and the amino terminus of BHA10 VH. Two reverse 3′ PCR primers were used to generate the PCR products with internal reverse primer XWU005-R encoding the carboxyl terminus of BHA10 VL followed by the (Gly\n4\nSer)\n5 \nlinker, and reverse primer scFvBHA10-R1 encoding a partial anti-TRAIL R2 VH region and a Bgl II site (underlined sequence) for cloning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOligonucleotides for PCR amplification of N-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHercules with conventional, (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4\n, V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n100 and V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFvs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscFvBHA10-\nF1\n \n\n\n5′-AGAGAG\nACGCGT\nGTCCTGTCCCAGGTCCAAC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 134)\n\n\nTGGTGCAG-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nXWU005-\nR\n \n\n\n5′-AGCCACCTCCCCCCGATCCACCGCCCCCTGA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 135)\n\n\nACCGCCCCCTCCAGAGCCCCCTCCACCGGACCCT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCCACCGCCTTTGATCTCCACCTTG -3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nscFvBHA10-\nR1\n \n\n\n5′-AGAGAG\nAGATCT\nTGACTGTCTCTCCAGGCTT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 136)\n\n\nCTTCAGCTCAGGTCCAGACTGCACCAACTGGATC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTGGGAGCCACCTCCCCCCGATCCAC-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe BHA10 scFv+(Gly\n4\nSer)\n5 \nlinker+partial anti-TRAIL R2 VH gene sequences were amplified in two sequential PCR reactions through the common overlapping sequences encoding the (Gly\n4\nSer)\n5 \nlinker as represented in \nFIG. 14A\n to prepare conventional BHA10 scFv from plasmid DNA pXWU034, BHA10 scFv (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nfrom plasmid pXWU002, BHA10 scFv V\nH\n44:V\nL\n100 from plasmid pIEH006, and BHA10 scFv V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nfrom plasmid pIEH009. The PCR products from the panel of amplified BHA10 scFvs were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis using the Millipore Ultrafree-DA extraction kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Millipore; Bedford, Mass.). The purified PCR products were digested with Mlu I/Bgl II restriction endonculeases and ligated into an Mlu I/Bgl II digested, pN5KG1 vector containing the chi14A2 IgG1 previously modified to remove an internal Bgl H site present in the chi14A2 IgG1 coding sequence. The mammalian expression vector pN5KG1 contains a translation-impaired, modified (intron-containing) neomycin phosphotransferase gene to select for transcriptionally active integration events, and a murine dihydrofolate reductase gene to permit amplification with methotrexate (Barnett, et al., Antibody Expression and Engineering. (Imanaka, H. Y. W. a. T., ed), pp. 27-40, Oxford University Press, New York, N.Y., (1995)).\n\n\nThe resulting panel of constructs form fusion proteins of the variant BHA10 scFvs to the amino terminus of the anti-TRAIL R2 antibody VH domain through the 25 amino acid (Gly\n4\nSer)\n5 \nlinker.

The BHA10 scFvs DNAs described in Example 3 were used to construct a panel of C-Hercules bispecific antibodies by PCR amplification using the oligonucleotide primers described in Table 15. A Ser(Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinker was used to connect the BHA10 scFvs to the carboxyl terminus of chi14A2 heavy chain. The forward 5′ VH PCR primer (XWU006-F1) includes a BamH I restriction endonuclease site (underlined sequence) for cloning followed by sequence encoding a portion of the Ser(Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinker peptide and the amino terminus of BHA10 VH.

These PCR conditions were used to prepare conventional BHA10 scFv from plasmid pXWU034, BHA10 scFv (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nfrom plasmid pXWU002, BHA10 scFv V\nH\n44:V\nL\n100 from plasmid pIEH006, and BHA10 scFv V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nfrom plasmid pIEH009. The PCR products from the panel of amplified BHA10 scFvs were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis using the Millipore Ultrafree-DA extraction kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Millipore; Bedford, Mass.). The purified PCR products were digested with BamH I restriction endonuclease and ligated into a single BamH I site of the pN5KG1 vector previously engineered to contain several modifications. Briefly, the pN5KG1 vector containing chi14A2 IgG1 was modified to remove the stop codon at the 3′ end of the heavy chain gene and introduce nucleotides coding for the amino acid sequence Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly (SEQ ID NO: 161) immediately followed by a BamH I restriction endonuclease site (coding for Gly-Ser) for cloning. Lastly, an internal unwanted BamH I restriction endonuclease site in chi14A2 VL region was also eliminated.\n\n\nThe resulting panel of constructs form fusion proteins of the variant BHA10 scFvs to the carboxyl terminus of the anti-TRAIL R2 antibody heavy chain through the 16 amino acid Ser(Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinker. Fusion of the conventional BHA10 scFv gene sequence to the carboxyl terminus of the anti-TRAIL R2 antibody heavy chain gene sequence produced plasmid pXWU006. Fusion of BHA10 scFv (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \ngene sequence to the carboxyl terminus of the anti-TRAIL R2 antibody heavy chain gene sequence produced plasmid pXWU034. Fusion of BHA10 scFv V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 gene sequence to the carboxyl terminus of the anti-TRAIL R2 antibody heavy chain gene sequence produced plasmid pXWU035.

Transient Expression of Bispecific Antibodies in CHO Cells\n\n\nPlasmid DNAs pXWU005, pXWU026, pXWU027, pXWU028; and pXWU006, pXWU034, pXWU035, and pXWU036 (Table 16) were used to transform CHO DG44 cells for transient production of antibody protein. Each 20 ug of plasmid DNA was combined with 4×10\n6 \ncells in a volume of 0.4 mls of 1×PBS. The mixture was added to a 0.4 cm cuvette (BioRad) and placed on ice for 15 min. The cells were electroporated at 600 uF and 350 volts with a Gene Pulser electroporator (BioRad). The cells were placed in the CHO-SSFM II media containing 100 uM Hypoxanthine and 16 uM Thymidine into a T-25 flask and incubated at 37° for 4 days.\n\n\nSupernatants containing Hercules proteins produced by this transient CHO expression system were collected and evaluated by Western Blot. \nFIG. 32\n shows that the Hercules antibodies containing either the V\nH\n44:V\nL\n100 (ds=disulfide) or V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFvs dramatically improved expression yields independent of whether the scFv was fused to the N\nH\n- or C-terminus (\n \n \nlanes\n \n \n 3, 4, 7, 8). Surprisingly, no secreted protein was detected with wild type BHA10 scFv nor (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker BHA10 scFv N-terminal fusions indicating the benefit of scFv stabilization on expression (\nlanes\n 6 and 7). In addition, conventional BHA10 scFv and (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker BHA10 scFv C-terminal fusions displayed a significant amount of a ˜55-60 molecular weight byproduct which is substantially reduced in the stabilized constructs suggesting that scFv stabilization may improve product quality.\n\n\nD. Bispecific Binding ELISA Assay\n\n\nSupernatants were tested for individual binding activity to recombinantly produced TRAIL R2 and LTβR receptors in ELISA assays. In both assays, receptor was immobilized onto plates and test samples incubated to permit binding to receptor. Bound samples were detected with labeled antibody.\n\n\n96-well microtiter Immulon II plates (Fisher, Cat#14245-61) were coated with 100 μl/well of 2 μg/ml LTβR-Ig in Na\n2\nCO\n3\n/NaHCO\n3 \nbuffer pH 9.5, overnight at 4° C. and blocked with 200 μl dilution Buffer (0.5% Nonfat Dry Milk in PBS plus 0.01% Thimerosal) for 1 h at 37° C. In the next step, 100 μl individual ‘Hercules’ supernatant or purified protein in dilution buffer was added to duplicate wells and incubated for 1 h at 37° C. After washing with tap water, 100 μl of 10 ng/ml TRAIL-\nR2 Fc\n 6×-His tagged fusion protein (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37° C. After washing, 100 μl of a 1/2000 dilution of Penta-His HRP Conjugate (QIAGEN, Cat#34460) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37° C. After washing, 100 μl/well of a HRPO Substrate combined TMB Peroxidase Substrate/Peroxidase Solution B (Kirdgaard and Perry Labs, Cat. 50-76-00) was added. The reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 2M H\n2\nSO\n4 \nafter 5 to 10 min. The OD was measured at 450 nm and 540 nm using a Molecular Devices plate reader and binding curves were generated.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 33 and 34\n show that both the N-terminal (\nFIG. 33A\n, \n34\nA) and the C-terminal (\nFIG. 33B\n, \n34\nB) Hercules antibodies containing either the V\nH\n44:V\nL\n100 (ds=disulfide) or V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv show improved binding to LTβR (\nFIG. 33\n) and TRAIL R2 (\nFIG. 34\n), respectively, compared to Hercules containing a conventional BHA10 scFv (wt).\n\n\nE. Stable Expression of Bispecific Antibodies in CHO Cells, Antibody Purification, and Characterization.\n\n\nPlasmid DNAs pXWU027, pXWU028, and pXWU006, pXWU035, and pXWU036 (Table 16) were used to transform DHFR-deficient CHO DG44 cells for stable production of antibody protein. Transfected cells were grown in alpha minus MEM medium containing 2 mM glutamine supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Corporation) and enriched as a stable bulk culture pool using fluorescently labeled antibodies and reiterative fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Brezinsky, et al. \nJ Immunol Methods. \n277(1-2):141-55 (2003)). FACS was also used to generate individual cell lines. Cell pools or cell lines were adapted to serum-free conditions and scaled for antibody production.\n\n\nSupernatants from transfected CHO cell pools or cells lines expressing 1) C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and 2) C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv, as well as clonal CHO cell lines expressing 3) N-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and 4) N-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv were collected and purified using Protein A Sepharose FF (6 mL) column using a PBS, 10 mM EDTA running buffer. Hercules proteins were eluted using 0.1 M glycine, pH 3.0 and neutralized immediately to pH 7.5-8.5 using Tris base. In addition, C-Hercules containing the conventional BHA10 scFv was expressed and purified by Protein A chromatography for comparison. Protein A eluates from C-Hercules containing the conventional BHA10 scFv, C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 BHA10 scFv, and C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv were examined for the presence of aggregates by analytical size exclusion chromatography (\nFIG. 35\n). The chromatogram profile of C-Hercules containing the conventional BHA10 scFv showed ˜40% aggregates. In contrast, C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 BHA10 scFv reduced the aggregate level to 20% and further stabilization achieved through C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv reduced the level of aggregates to 10%. The level of aggregation appeared to depend upon the properties of the scFv and not whether it was appended to the N\nH\n- or C-terminus of the 14A2 IgG (data not shown). The protein A Hercules eluants were further purified by dialysis into 0.1 M acetate, pH 5.0, and purification by MonoS (GE Healthcare) cation exchange chromatography using an identical running buffer as the dialysate. Hercules proteins were eluted using a step gradient to 0.1 M acetate, pH 5.0, 0.5 M NaCl. The MonoS eluants were collected and passed through a TosoHaas preparative SEC column to remove aggregates.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 36A and 36B\n show SDS-PAGE gels of purified N-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and N\nH\n-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv and C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv, respectively. The reduced lanes show the expected sizes of the heavy and light chain proteins. Importantly, there is no significant level of degraded or unwanted lower molecular weight byproducts that has often been observed with Hercules containing wild type scFv domains.\n\n\n \nFIG. 37\n (Panels A and C) shows the analytical SEC elution profiles of N\nH\n-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and N\nH\n-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv, respectively, subsequent to the initial protein A purification step. \nFIG. 37\n (Panels B and D) also shows the analytical SEC elution profiles of N\nH\n-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and N\nH\n-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv, respectively, following preparative SEC removal of residual non-monomeric protein contaminants. Similarly, \nFIG. 38\n (Panels A and C) shows the analytical SEC elution profiles of C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv, respectively, subsequent to the initial protein A purification step. \nFIG. 38\n (Panels B and D) shows the analytical SEC elution profiles of C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly4Ser)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv, respectively, following preparative SEC removal of residual non-monomeric protein contaminants. These studies demonstrate that stabilization of the BHA10 scFv by addition of either the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 disulfide or the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 disulfide and (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker results in preparative quantities of >98% pure, monomeric Hercules bispecific antibody that is essentially free of higher order molecular weight species.\n\n\nDSC studies performed under identical conditions demonstrate that C-Hercules V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv is more thermostable than C-Hercules containing conventional BHA10 scFv (\nFIG. 39\n). The denaturation profile for C-Hercules containing conventional BHA10 scFv begins ˜5° C. lower temperature than the profile observed for the C-Hercules V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv. These results suggest that the scFv may limit the overall thermostability of the Hercules molecules. This correlates with a 5° C. T\nM \nobserved increase for the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly4Ser)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv over that of the conventional BHA10 scFv.\n\n\nPurified versions of the stabilized Hercules constructs were then tested for bispecific binding activity to recombinantly produced TRAIL-R2 and LTβR receptors in an ELISA assay. In this assay LTβR Ig receptor was immobilized onto plates and test samples were then incubated to permit binding to receptor. Unbound samples were removed by washing followed by a second incubation step with TRAIL R2-(His)\n6\n. Following a wash step, doubly-bound complexes were detected with a labeled anti-(His)\n6 \nantibody. The results of this study and the effective concentration (EC50, in μg/ml) at which each construct are depicted in \nFIG. 40\n. \nFIG. 40\n shows that both the N-terminal and C-terminal Hercules antibodies with either the V\nH\n44:V\nL\n100 (ds=disulfide) or V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv demonstrate clear bispecific binding to both LTβR and TRAIL R2. A multivalent (pentameric) version of an LTβR-binding antibody (CBE11) was used as a control to demonstrate that single recognition of LTβR alone does not induce signal in the binding assay.\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nScale-up Production of Stabilized Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies in CHO Cells\n\n\nDHFR-deficient CHO cell lines stably transfected with plasmid DNAs pXWU028 and pXWU036 (Table 16) were screened to select for single cell isolates that are capable of expressing high levels of solubilized and properly-folded Hercules molecules that were stabilized using the methods of the invention. The cell screening methods employed the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of Brezinky et al. (Brezinky et al., J Immunol Meth (2003). 277:141-155). Briefly, fluorescently tagged anti-Hercules antibodies were used to label CHO cells exhibiting transient expression of Hercules antibodies on their surface. Cells exhibiting a signature fluorescence intensity were then selected by tailoring the gating of the cell sorter apparatus to that signature. Single cells exhibiting high levels of productivity were thereby selected and adapted to serum-free conditions to establish stable producer cell lines. The producer cell lines were subsequently scaled-up for production and purification of the bispecific antibody protein.\n\n\n80 L of N-terminal Hercules containing V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv (XWU028) supernatant from an 11 day bioreactor run was harvested and precleared by ultrafiltration. The bispecific antibody was captured by Protein A chromatography and eluted in 1218 mls volume. The Protein A fraction was further purified in two separate batches by anion exchange chromatography followed by preparative size exclusion chromatography. The first batch yielded 825.5 mg at a concentration of 4.85 mg/ml in PBS with 98.9% purity and an endotoxin load of 0.13 EU/mg. The second batch yielded 318 mg at a concentration of 10.3 mg/ml with a purity of 99.1% and an endotoxin load of 2.37 EU/mg. A total of 1143.5 mg highly purified, monomeric N-terminal Hercules containing V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv was recovered.\n\n\n24 L of C-terminal Hercules containing V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv (XWU036) supernatant from an 11 day bioreactor run was harvested and precleared by ultrafiltration. The bispecific antibody was purified in two separate batches as described above using Protein A chromatography to capture crude product followed by anion exchange chromatography and preparative size exclusion chromatography. The first batch yielded 985.5 mg at a concentration of 13 mg/ml with 98.5% purity and an endotoxin load of 0.01 EU/mg. The second batch yielded 570 mg at a concentration of 11.42 mg/ml with a purity of 99% and an endotoxin load of 1.91 EU/mg. A total of 1555.5 mg highly purified, monomeric C-terminal Hercules containing V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv was recovered.\n\n\nA CHO cell line producing the XWU054 bispecific antibody was isolated and found to produce 21.5 mg/L. This is within the expected range for research grade unamplified CHO cell lines and we would anticipate much higher productivity if we were to generate a Production Cell Line.\n\n\nThese scale-up production studies were conducted with non-amplified CHO cell lines and yet resulted in yields exceeding 1 gm of high quality, biophysically stable bispecific antibodies. Presumably a cell line amplification strategy would greatly enhance the cellular productivity of the transfected CHO cell lines enabling the development of processes suitable for commercial applications. These studies exemplify the utility of the methods described in this invention for enabling the scale-up production of stable bispecific antibodies in a cell line (e.g. CHO) suitable for manufacturing.\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nBiological Activity of Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies\n\n\nTumor cell lines WiDr, (ATCC CCL-218) a human colon carcinoma cell line, Me180, (ATCC HTB 33) a human cervical epithelial carcinoma cell line, and MDA231, (Dr. Dajun Yang, University of Michigan) a human breast carcinoma cell line were cultured in MEM-Earles with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1× non-essential amino acids, 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate, and Penicillin/Streptomycin. Tumor cell lines were rinsed once with PBS and cells released by digestion with trypsin. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in complete media, counted and 96-well tissue culture plates seeded at 5000 cells/well for WiDr and Me180 and 1500 cell/well for MDA231. Human IFNγ (Biogen Idec, Corp) is added to the cell suspensions to result in a final cytokine concentration of 80 U/ml for WiDr and MDA231 and 50 U/ml for Me180. 50 μl of the tumor cell/IFNγ suspension were mixed with 50 μl of 2× concentrated 3-fold serial dilutions of test antibodies prepared in complete media. The final concentrations of test antibodies typically ranged from 5000 pM to 0.07 pM. Cells were grown for 4 days (WiDr & Me180) or 3 days (MDA231) at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2 \nhumidified chamber and cell killing assessed by the addition of 20 μL/well \nPromega CellTiter\n 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay reagent (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis.). Plates were read in a micotiter plate reader at 490 nM (Spectromax Plus, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale Calif.). Data was graphed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Inc, WA).\n\n\nResults from these studies are shown in \nFIGS. 41A-41D\n. \nFIG. 41A\n shows that 14A2 IgG antibody had modest activity in inhibiting growth of WiDr tumor cells and in combination with BHA10 IgG exhibited a slight increase in anti-tumor cell activity compared to BHA10 IgG alone. In contrast, both of the bispecific Hercules antibodies showed enhanced tumor cell killing of the WiDr cells. \nFIG. 41B\n shows that both the 14A2 IgG and BHA10 IgG antibodies had modest, if not negligible, activity in inhibiting growth of Me180 tumor cells as single agents or in combination. In contrast, both of the bispecific Hercules antibodies showed tumor cell killing of the Me180 cells. \nFIG. 41C\n shows that both the 14A2 IgG and BHA10 IgG antibodies had negligible activity in inhibiting growth of MDA231 tumor cells as single agents and perhaps some activity when used in combination. In contrast, the bispecific Hercules antibody XWU036 (C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv) showed tumor cell killing of the MDA231 cells. \nFIG. 41D\n shows that none of the antibodies demonstrate any activity towards control cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) demonstrating that the cell killing activity of the bispecific antibodies is not indiscriminant. HUVEC shows positive staining for LTβR and TRAIL-R2 by FACS analysis (data not shown) indicating presence of receptors and that the activity of the bispecific antibody may be dependent on triggering specific or unique pathway components in tumor cells.\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\nStability Studies of Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies\n\n\nReal-time stability studies of the N- and C-terminal bispecific antibody samples XWU028 (BHA10 scFv V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly4Ser)\n4 \nN-Hercules) and XWU036 (BHA10 scFv V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nC-Hercules) stored at 2-8° C. for three months were conducted. Protein quality was assessed for (1) aggregation, (2) precipitation, (3) polypeptide cleavage or proteolysis, and (4) post-translational modifications such as deamidation or oxidation.\n\n\nHigh and low concentration N- and C-terminal bispecific antibody samples used for the studies were XWU028 at 1.8 mg/mL (Low) and 10.3 mg/mL (High) and XWU036 at 5.0 mg/mL (Low) and 11.4 mg/mL (High). Antibodies were formulated in PBS. For the stability study, initial (T=0), intermediate (T=1 wk, 2 wk, 1 mo, 2 mo) and final (T=3 mo) time point samples were analyzed immediately following sample collection. In addition, initial (T=0) samples were frozen and stored at −70° C. until thawed for secondary analyses at the end of the 3-month study. BHA10 IgG (8.7 mg/mL) was used as control and was similarly handled.\n\n\nA. Protein Aggregation and Precipitation Analysis\n\n\nProtein aggregation or precipitation was monitored using analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) linked to inline light scattering and refractive index detectors (Wyatt Technologies, MiniDawn and rEX, respectively). SEC/Light, scattering analysis showed no evidence of aggregation or material loss that might occur through precipitation. The SEC elution profiles of the initial, T=0, and final, T=3 mo, time points for XWU028, XWU036, and the BHA10 antibody were nearly identical (\nFIGS. 56A\n, \n56\nB, and \n56\nC, respectively). XWU028 and XWU036 samples both accumulated ˜1% aggregated material by the completion of the study; however detection of these aggregates was near the lower limit of detection determined for this method (Table 17). Aggregate formation was independent of protein concentration. Based on the molecular masses determined using light scattering detection, it is possible that that the low levels of aggregates in the test samples are likely a product of monomeric species converting to dimers. Neither of the bispecific antibodies samples, XWU028 or XWU036, accumulated detectable levels of high-order aggregates, even though this type of aggregate would have easily been observed using these methods. The BHA10 antibody demonstrated no increase in aggregates over the 3-month course of the study (Table 17).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent monomer detected using analytical size exclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchromatography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nT =\n\n\nT =\n\n\nT =\n\n\nT =\n\n\nT =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nT = 0\n\n\n1 \nweek\n \n\n\n2 \nweek\n \n\n\n1 \nmo\n \n\n\n2 \nmo\n \n\n\n3 \nmo\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQID#\n \n \n \n \n \n \n49 Low\n\n\n99.0\n\n\n98.7\n\n\n98.4\n\n\n98.3\n\n\n98.2\n\n\n97.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSEQID#\n49 High\n\n\n99.1\n\n\n99.0\n\n\n98.9\n\n\n98.6\n\n\n98.2\n\n\n98.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSEQID#\n51 Low\n\n\n98.8\n\n\n97.5\n\n\n97.5\n\n\n97.4\n\n\n97.2\n\n\n96.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSEQID#\n51 High\n\n\n98.9\n\n\n98.8\n\n\n98.7\n\n\n98.5\n\n\n98.1\n\n\n96.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBHA10 IgG\n\n\n97.4\n\n\n97.5\n\n\n97.5\n\n\n97.5\n\n\n97.3\n\n\n97.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Proteolysis and Post-translational Modification Analyses\n\n\nProteolysis was monitored using SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) intact mass analysis (Agilent LC/MSD TOF coupled to an Agilent 1100 LC system via an electrospray interface). For SDS-PAGE analysis, 5 ug of protein was loaded per lane. Reduced samples were prepared in 1× Tris-glycine sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. XWU028 and XWU036 showed no evidence of proteolysis over the 3-month storage period at 2-8° C. as determined by non-reducing and reducing SDS-PAGE analysis (\nFIGS. 57A\n and B). Similarly, XWU028 and XWU036 showed no evidence of lower molecular weight proteolytic products over the 3-month storage period at 2-8° C. as determined by LC/MS analysis (\nFIG. 58\n).\n\n\nPost-translational modifications were monitored using LC/MS. T=0, T=1 mo, and T=3 mo samples were analyzed in both the non-reduced and reduced form. Reduced samples were prepared by treating in 50 mM DTT/4M guanidine hydrochloride for 1 hour at 37° C. HPLC Buffer A consists of 0.03% TFA in water and HPLC buffer B contains 0.025% TFA in acetonitrile. Flow rate was kept constant at 100 μl per minute. 7.5 μg of each sample (reduced and non-reduced) was injected onto a 2.1×50 mm C4 column and analyzed by Agilent ESI-TOF. A bind-and-elute method was used for non-reduced samples while a gradient method was used for reduced samples. Spectra were obtained using the Analyst and deconvoluted using the MaxEnt1 software packages included with the instrumentation. Deconvoluted mass spectra of XWU028 and XWU036 (high concentrations) at T=0, T=1 mo, and T=3 mo are shown in \nFIG. 58\n. Neither XWU028, nor XWU036, demonstrated any detectable changes in their mass spectra, indicating absence of post-translational modification that could potentially adversely affect bispecific antibody function or stability.\n\n\nTaken together, the data indicate that both the N- and C-terminal bispecific antibodies containing stabilized scFv domains are stable under extended storage conditions such as those required for biological drug products. These results are particularly encouraging because these stability studies were conducted with the N- and C-terminal bispecific antibodies prepared in a simple buffer (PBS) and not with solutions prepared with optimal formulations.\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\nIn Vivo Pharmacokinetic Activity and Serum Stability of Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies\n\n\nA single bolus injection of 10 mg/kg (1 mg/ml) of N-terminal Hercules (XWU028) or C-terminal Hercules (XWU036) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was administered intraperitoneally into male CB17-scid mice. Mice were sacrificed at 0, 0.5, 2, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168, 240, and 336 hours post-injection using three mice per timepoint for each bispecific antibody. Serum samples were prepared for analysis by ELISA assay to quantify levels of the bispecific antibodies. ELISA plates were coated with goat-anti-human IgG, blocked with PBS/1% BSA, and dilutions of serum containing the bispecific antibodies were serially diluted in PBS/1% BSA, added to the plates and incubated. Captured antibodies were detected with a goat-anti-human kappa chain-HRP-linked antibody. Results of the pharmacokinetic study are shown in Table 18. N-terminal Hercules (XWU028) has an elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) of 10.3 days with a peak serum concentration of 85.67 μg/ml. C-terminal Hercules (XWU036) has a longer elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) of 15.1 days with a peak serum concentration of 105.67 μg/ml. Both molecules have similar volumes of distribution (Vd) though these values have not been adjusted for bioavailability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetic Parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nN-terminal Hercules\n\n\nC-terminal Hercules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(XWU028)\n\n\n(XWU036)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nUnits\n\n\nValue\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT½\n\n\nhr\n\n\n247.9386\n\n\n362.3607\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCmax\n\n\nug/ml\n\n\n85.67\n\n\n105.67\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVd*\n\n\nL/kg\n\n\n0.1707\n\n\n0.1748\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCl*\n\n\nml/min/kg\n\n\n0.008\n\n\n0.0056\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*not adjusted for bioavailability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSerum samples were also analyzed in the bispecific binding ELISA described in Example 7. In this assay, the serum samples containing N-terminal Hercules (XWU028) or C-terminal Hercules (XWU036) described above were tested for bispecific binding activity to recombinantly produced TRAIL-R2 and LTβR receptors in an ELISA assay. \nFIGS. 59A\n and B show that serum samples from N- and C-terminal Hercules treated mice contain antibodies that bispecifically bind to both TRAIL-R2 and LTβR and closely parallel the elimination profiles observed from the PK study indicating that the bispecific antibodies are remaining intact under physiological conditions for extended periods of time.\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\nIn Vivo Biological Activity of Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies\n\n\n(A) In Vivo Biological Activity of Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies in a Colon Cancer Tumor Model\n\n\nWiDr human colon carcinoma (2×10E6 cells per mouse) cells were implanted subcutaneously into 125 athymic nude mice. The tumors were grown until they reached approximately 100 mg, at which point a total of 70 mice were selected for the study, divided into 7 groups of 10 mice. IP treatments were administered, beginning on \nday\n 13 post-implantation, as follows: \nGroup\n 1=pyrogen-free PBS; \nGroup\n 2=CBE11, 2 mg/kg, 1×/wk; \nGroup\n 3=hBHA10, 2 mg/kg, 2×/wk; \nGroup\n 4=ch14A2, 2 mg/kg, 2×/wk; \nGroup\n 5=Hercules-II XWU028, 2 mg/kg, 1×/wk; \nGroup\n 6=Hercules-II XWU036, 2 mg/kg, 1×/wk; \nGroup\n 7=hBHA10+ch14A2, 1 mg/kg each, 2×/wk. Tumor sizes and body weights were recorded bi-weekly. Study was terminated when average tumor size of vehicle group reached approximately 2000 mg. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula: (L×W\n2\n/2). Interim analyses of mice treated with the XWU028 and XWU036 showed significant anti-tumor activity (p<0.001) for both bispecific antibodies compared to PBS vehicle control (\nFIG. 60\n).\n\n\nFor XWU028, significant anti-tumor responses (p<0.05) were observed compared to responses with single hBHA10 or ch14A2 mAb treatment. For XWU036, a significant anti-tumor response (p<0.05) was observed compared to the response with ch14A2 mAb treatment and, notably, a greater significant response (p<0.01) compared to hBHA10 mAb. Importantly, the bispecific antibodies showed superior in vivo anti-tumor activity though administered only once per week suggesting that the stability enhancements described in this invention result in improved antibody properties and physical stability under physiological conditions.\n\n\n(B) In Vivo Biological Activity of Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies in a Breast Cancer Tumor Model\n\n\nMDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells were implanted subcutaneously into 135 athymic nude mice (2×10 E6 cells per mouse). The tumors were grown until \nday\n 13 at which \npoint\n 75 tumor-bearing mice with an average size of approximately 168 mg were assigned to treatment (N=10) and vehicle control (N=15) groups. Mice received antibodies and vehicle IP starting at \nday\n 13. Exemplary groups are shown as follows: \nGroup\n 1=pyrogen-free PBS; 1×/wk; \nGroup\n 2=hBHA10, 2 mg/kg, 2×/wk; \nGroup\n 3=ch14A2, 2 mg/kg, 2×/wk; \nGroup\n 4=Hercules-II XWU036, 2 mg/kg, 1×/wk; \nGroup\n 5=hBHA10+ch14A2, 1 mg/kg each, 2×/wk. Tumor sizes and body weights were recorded bi-weekly. Study was terminated when average tumor size of vehicle group reached approximately 2800 mg. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula: (L×W\n2\n/2). XWU036 demonstrated statistically significant (p<0.001) anti-tumor activity compared to either single treatment with hBHA10 or ch14A2 mAbs or to treatment with a mixture of the two antibodies. Importantly, the bispecific antibody XWU036 demonstrated good anti-tumor activity in vivo administered on a once per week dosing schedule suggesting that the stability enhancements described in this invention result in improved antibody properties and physical stability under physiological conditions (see \nFIG. 86\n).\n\n\nExample 13\n\n\nProduction of Stabilized Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies Containing Non-covalent Stabilizing scFv Mutations\n\n\nBHA10 scFvs of the invention containing non-covalent stabilizing mutations alone and in combination with a V\nH\n44-\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 disulfide bond were used to construct stabilized bispecific C-Hercules antibodies comprising a fusion of chimeric 14A2 IgG antibody that binds to TRAIL R2 receptor with a BHA10 scFv that binds to LTβR. The bispecific antibodies were constructed as C-terminal BHA10 scFv fusions using methods essentially as described in Example 7.\n\n\nA.

The variant BHA10 scFv gene fragments were gel isolated. Due to a BamHI site in the linker region of plasmids pIEH-050 and pIEH-052, the gene fragments were digested with pPuM I and Kpn I restriction endonucleases and ligated to the modified plasmid pN5KG1 digested with the same restriction endonucleases resulting in a fusion product of the stabilized anti-LTBR (BHA10) scFvs to the carboxyl terminus of the anti-TRAILR2 (14A2) antibody CH3 domain through a 16 amino acid Ser(Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinker.

Stable Expression of Bispecific Antibodies in CHO Cells, Antibody Purification, and Characterization.\n\n\nDHFR-deficient CHO cell lines stably transfected with plasmid DNAs pXWU054 and pXWU055 and adapted to serum-free conditions were scaled for production of bispecific antibody protein and proteins purified as described in Example 8. Protein A eluates from supernatants containing C-Hercules with the stabilized V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L BHA10 scFv and C-bispecific antibody with the stabilized V\nH\n44-\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L BHA10 scFv were examined for the presence of aggregates by analytical size exclusion chromatography (\nFIG. 65\n). The chromatogram profile of C-Hercules containing the conventional BHA10 scFv showed ˜40% aggregates. In contrast, C-terminal Hercules with the stabilized V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L BHA10 scFv significantly reduced aggregates to levels comparable to that observed with standard IgGs.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 66A and 66B\n show SDS-PAGE gels of purified C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L BHA10 scFv and C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L BHA10 scFv, respectively. The reduced lanes show the expected sizes of the heavy and light chain proteins. Importantly, there is no significant level of degraded or unwanted lower molecular weight byproducts that has often been observed with Hercules containing wild type scFv domains.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 67A and 67B\n show the analytical SEC elution profiles of C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L BHA10 scFv and C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/V\nH \nS16E+VL S46L BHA10 scFv, respectively, subsequent to the initial protein A purification step. These studies demonstrate that stabilization of the BHA10 scFv by addition of V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L mutations alone and in combination with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 disulfide results in preparative quantities of >98% pure, monomeric Hercules bispecific antibody that is essentially free of higher order molecular weight species.\n\n\nExample 14\n\n\nBiological Activity of Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies Containing Non-covalent Stabilizing scFv Mutations\n\n\nIn vitro biological activity of C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L BHA10 scFv (XWU054) and C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L BHA10 scFv (XWU055) were tested in the tumor cell proliferation assay as described in Example 7.\n\n\nResults from these studies are shown in \nFIG. 68\n. \nFIG. 68B\n shows that 14A2 IgG antibody had moderate activity in inhibiting growth of WiDr tumor cells and in combination with BHA10 IgG exhibited a slight increase in anti-tumor cell activity compared to BHA10 IgG alone. In contrast, both of the bispecific Hercules antibodies (XWU054 and XWU055) showed enhanced tumor cell killing of the WiDr cells comparable to that observed with the XWU036 molecule (C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv) described in Example 10. \nFIG. 68A\n shows that both the 14A2 IgG and BHA10 IgG antibodies had negligible activity in inhibiting growth of MDA231 tumor cells as single agents as well as when used in combination. In contrast, the bispecific Hercules antibodies (XWU054 and XWU055) showed enhanced tumor cell killing of the MDA231 cells comparable to that observed with the XWU036 molecule (C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv) described in Example 10.\n\n\nExample 15\n\n\nUtilization of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) to Measure Thermal Stability of Human or Humanized Antibody Sequences\n\n\nTo assess the range of apparent stabilities of antibodies, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a set of 17 human or humanized BIIB antibodies.\n\n\nThe BIIB antibodies were dialyzed exhaustively against a 20 mM sodium citrate, 150 mM sodium chloride buffer at pH 6.0. Dialysates were used within the reference cell of a calorimeter to define the baseline of each antibody scan. Subsequent to dialysis, the concentrations of BIIB1-17 were measured by 280 nm absorbance (Pace et al., \nProtein Sci. \n4, 2411-2423, 1995). Antibody solutions used for DSC were universally prepared at 1 mg/mL by diluting the concentrated stocks with their dialysates.\n\n\nScans were performed using an automated capillary differential scanning calorimeter (capDSC, MicroCal, LLC). Protein and reference solutions were sampled automatically from 96-well plates using the robotic attachment. Prior to each protein scan, 2 scans were performed with buffer in the sample cell and used for background subtraction. A single cleaning scan was performed using 5% Liquinox after every protein scan. After every scan, the instrument automatically rinsed both the reference and sample cells with 3×-2 mL distilled deionized H\n2\nO containing 0.01% sodium azide. Scans were performed at 1° C./min using the medium feedback mode for enhanced peak resolution. The scan range was 20-95° C. All 96-well plates containing protein were stored within the instrument at 6° C.\n\n\nScans were analyzed using the Origin software supplied by the manufacturer. Subsequent to background subtraction, non-zero baselines were corrected using a third order polynomial. The unfolding transitions of each IgG1 domain were deconvoluted by fitting the multi-peak curves to 3 separate transitions. Recombinant IgG1 and IgG4 Fcγ domains were utilized to identify the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 peaks within each transition. The remaining transition(s) was assumed to correspond to the unfolding of the Fab portion of the antibody.\n\n\nMost of the Fab portions of the 17 antibodies unfolded in apparent single transitions with midpoints of thermal unfolding (T\nM\ns) ranging from 57 to 82° C. depending on the unique properties of each individual Fv. Only three antibodies, BIIB15, BIIB16, and BIIB17 exhibited 4 transitions. A typical IgG1 DSC trace is shown in \nFIG. 69A\n. The C\nPmax \n(i.e. the height of a DSC peak) for Fab portions is generally significantly greater than that of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 or \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains. This is reasonable considering the Fab protein mass within an antibody is 4-fold greater than that of either the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 or the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains, and the Fab portion of the antibody also contains buried surface area between 4 domains as opposed to the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains whose transitions each involve the disruption of only a single homodimeric interface. In general, the transitions observed for the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains of each IgG1 antibody superimposed well upon one another. The same is true for the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains of the 3 IgG4s. For these reasons, the Fab transitions of each IgG1 or IgG4 molecule were readily identified. One antibody (BIIB18) was not studied by DSC. BIIB18 expressed poorly and never resulted in soluble/non-aggregated material. This antibody was included in the sequence analyses described in Example 16.\n\n\nOne of the antibodies, BIIB7, was analyzed in both the human IgG1 and IgG4 format. The apparent Fab thermostabilities of BIIB7 in the IgG1 and IgG4 format as measured by the midpoints of their thermal unfolding transitions (T\nM\n) were very similar (see \nFIG. 69B\n). Variation in the constant domain subclass did not affect the Fab T\nM \nor Fab calorimetric unfolding enthalpy.\n\n\nThe overlapping transitions corresponding to the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains of the IgG4 Fc occur at significantly lower temperatures than those of IgG1 and artificially make the Fab transitions look ˜1-2° C. lower for IgG4. Once the IgG transitions are completely deconvoluted, the Fab T\nM\ns are much closer than they appear in the DSC traces (ΔT\nM\n<1° C.). The fact that the Fab DSC curves of BIIB7 in the IgG1 and IgG4 formats were highly similar suggests that the thermostability of the IgG1 Fabs and IgG4 Fabs can be directly compared.\n\n\nDSC measurements with 17 of the humanized BIIB antibodies indicate that the Fv regions heavily influenced the apparent stability of their respective Fabs. For example, \nFIG. 70\n demonstrates the very different DSC curves obtained for \nBIIB\n 1, BIIB4, BIIB6 and BIIB16. All four antibodies are IgG1, and the only sequence differences between them reside in the Fv region. The position and magnitude of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 DSC transitions of all 17 antibodies are independent of the Fab to which they are attached (see \nFIG. 70\n). The range of Fab T\nM\ns for the top 17 antibodies in Table 20 was between 57.2 and 81.6° C. (±24.4° C.), with BIIB1 exhibiting the highest apparent Fab stability and BIIB17 the lowest.\n\n\nThe three antibodies with the lowest measureable Fab T\nM \nvalues, BIIB15, BIIB16, and BIIB17, demonstrate a disconnect between domain unfolding transitions within the Fab (See \nFIG. 70\n for BIIB16's DSC curve). The expected Fab peak was split into two separate transitions. The lower T\nM \ntransitions were listed in Table 20, but a second transition, which may represent the unfolding of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1/C\nL \nstructural unit, occurred with T\nM\ns of 74, 72 and 70° C. for BIIB15, BIIB16 and BIIB17, respectively. BIIB18 was included in the study as an example of an antibody which would not express and whose V\nH \nsequence diverged significantly from consensus (see Example 16).\n\n\nThe DSC analyses clearly showed that the unique properties of individual Fv-regions can highly attenuate the apparent T\nM\ns of an entire Fab portion of an antibody. In the extreme cases of BIIB15, BIIB16 and BIIB17, the apparent Fv stabilities were low enough that the unfolding transitions of the domains within the Fab portion became uncoupled from one another. In order to maintain an apparent single transition for the unfolding of all four domains of the Fab, there may be a minimum overall T\nM \nlimit (>70° C. for IgG1s under the scan conditions described here), otherwise multiple transitions appear. It would be convenient to assign the low temperature unfolding transitions of BIIB15, BIIB16, and BIIB17 to the Fv and the second, higher temperature transitions, to the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1/C\nL \ndomain. However, Ewert and coworkers have shown that V\nH\n/V\nL \ndomain unfolding is not always coupled and can depend on subclass, V\nH\n/V\nL \nstability, and V\nH\n/V\nL \ncomplementarity (Ewert et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n325: 531-553, 2003). In fact, very few of their V\nH\n/V\nL \nscFv constructs with consensus-derived frameworks exhibited cooperative unfolding. Therefore, it is likely that, as the transitions uncouple, the unfolding scenario may be more complicated than a simple split into two transitions representing the Fv-region and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1/C\nL\n-regions.\n\n\nThe apparent stabilities as measured by DSC for the BIIB7 IgG1 and IgG4 Fabs were highly similar even though there are substantial inherent differences in \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 sequence and disulfide-bonding between the two subclasses. There are many possible explanations for this such as (1) the biophysical properties of the Fv set the thermostability ceiling of the BIIB7 Fab regardless of whether the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 is IgG1 or IgG4, (2) the apparent stability of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1/C\nL \nregion is identical between IgG1 and IgG4, or (3) the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1/C\nL \nstructural unit does not unfold within the timeframe of the DSC experiment. The fact that the BIIB7 Fab unfolded at a single T\nM \nand with a similar calorimetric enthalpy in both the IgG1 and IgG4 formats suggests a potential stability dependence upon the Fv and not the constant regions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB IgG Fab T\nM\n-values, V\nH \nand V\nκ \nscores and germlines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFab\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nV\nH\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nT\nM\n \n\n\nV\nH\n \n\n\n \n\n\nV\nH\n \n\n\nsubclass\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nκ\n \n\n\n \n\n\nV\nκ\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgG\n\n\n(° C.)\n\n\nsubclass\n\n\nV\nH \ngermline\na\n \n\n\nscore\n\n\nscore\n\n\nΔscore\n\n\nsubclass\n\n\nV\nκ \ngermline\na\n \n\n\nscore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB1\n\n\n81.6\n\n\nVH1\n\n\nX92340VH1\n\n\n58.8\n\n\n70.1 +/− 3.1\n\n\n+3.7\n\n\nVK1\n\n\nM64855VK1\n\n\n78.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB2\n\n\n78.5\n\n\nVH1\n\n\nX92340VH1\n\n\n72.2\n\n\n70.1 +/− 3.1\n\n\n+2.1\n\n\nVK1\n\n\nM64855VK1\n\n\n72.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB3\n\n\n78.2\n\n\nVH1\n\n\nAB019438VH1\n\n\n72.6\n\n\n70.1 +/− 3.1\n\n\n+2.5\n\n\nVK2\n\n\nX12684VK2\n\n\n82.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB4\n\n\n77.7\n\n\nVH3\n\n\nM99649VH3\n\n\n96.1\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n+3.9\n\n\nVK2\n\n\nX12684VK2\n\n\n83.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB5\n\n\n77.1\n\n\nVH2\n\n\nX56365VH4\n\n\n69.8\n\n\n68.1 +/− 5.5\n\n\n+1.7\n\n\nVK1\n\n\nX59316VK1\n\n\n83.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB6\n\n\n76.8\n\n\nVH3\n\n\nM99649VH3\n\n\n97.7\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n+5.6\n\n\nVK1\n\n\nM64855VK1\n\n\n77.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB7\n\n\n75.9\n\n\nVH1\n\n\nAB019438VH1\n\n\n72.7\n\n\n70.1 +/− 3.1\n\n\n+2.6\n\n\nVK3\n\n\nX72812VK3\n\n\n83.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB8\n\n\n75.6\n\n\nVH1\n\n\nZ14300VH1\n\n\n58.0\n\n\n70.1 +/− 3.1\n\n\n+2.9\n\n\nVK1\n\n\nX59316VK1\n\n\n79.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB9\n\n\n74.7\n\n\nVH3\n\n\nZ12358VH3\n\n\n95.2\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n+3.0\n\n\nVK4\n\n\nZ00023VK4\n\n\n88.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB10\n\n\n74.7\n\n\nVH4\n\n\nX56365VH4\n\n\n69.3\n\n\n68.1 +/− 5.5\n\n\n+0.8\n\n\nVK1\n\n\nX59316VK1\n\n\n84.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB11\n\n\n58.1\n\n\nVH1\n\n\nAB019438VH1\n\n\n71.3\n\n\n70.1 +/− 3.1\n\n\n+1.2\n\n\nVK4\n\n\nZ00023VK4\n\n\n94.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB12\n\n\n71.2\n\n\nVH1\n\n\nAB019438VH1\n\n\n67.9\n\n\n70.1 +/− 3.1\n\n\n−2.2\n\n\nVK4\n\n\nZ00023VK4\n\n\n92.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB13\n\n\n70.8\n\n\nVH3\n\n\nM99657VH3\n\n\n91.1\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n−1.3\n\n\nVK4\n\n\nZ00023VK4\n\n\n93.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB14\n\n\n70.6\n\n\nVH7\n\n\nL10057VH7\n\n\n65.1\n\n\n70.2 +/− 3.2\n\n\n−5.1\n\n\nVK-\n\n\n—\n\n\n56.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB15\n\n\n68.5\n\n\nVH3\n\n\nM99660VH3\n\n\n92.4\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n+0.2\nb\n \n\n\nVK1\n\n\nM64858VK1\n\n\n81.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB16\n\n\n68.0\n\n\nVH3\n\n\nM99649VH3\n\n\n95.6\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n+3.3\nb\n \n\n\nVK3\n\n\nX72812VK3\n\n\n82.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB17\n\n\n57.2\n\n\nVH3\n\n\nJ00239VH3\n\n\n89.4\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n−3.0\n\n\nVK2\n\n\nX63397VK2\n\n\n84.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB18\n\n\n—\nc\n \n\n\nVH3\n\n\nM99400VH3\n\n\n80.0\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n−12.3\nb\n \n\n\nVK2\n\n\nX63397VK2\n\n\n84.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nLefranc et al., 1999;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nb\nUnusual insertion/deletion in CDR1 or CDR2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nc\nDid not express\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 16\n\n\nUtilization of Consensus Scoring to Identify Antibody Variable Region with Sub-optimal Stability\n\n\nConsensus scoring was utilized as a method for identifying which of the BIIB antibodies contained significantly large numbers of non-optimal amino acids within their Fv regions. The scoring assesses the relative drift from consensus V\nH \nand V\nκ\n sequences due to hypersomatic mutations and evolutionary germline variations. The DSC measurements for the 17 antibodies were used to qualify the ability of the consensus scoring approach for predicting poor antibody stability.\n\n\nThe reference set of mammalian V\nH \nand V\nκ\n kappa sequences used to derive the consensus sequence for scoring and the individual amino acid frequencies at each residue position were collected, sorted, and culled as described previously (Demarest et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n335: 41-48, 2004). The mammalian reference sets were naively constructed to include V-genes from various mammals in order to obtain diversity via the evolutionary drift between species. The V\nH \nmammalian reference set contains 61 V\nH \nsequences primarily from NCBI and TIGR representing a total of 17 different mammalian species. The V\nκ\n mammalian reference set contains 53 V\nκ\n sequences from 13 different mammalian species.\n\n\nHuman V\nH \nand V\nκ\n sequences for building a reference set (or for use as test sequences) were gathered from the NCBI database using the search criteria “\nhomo sapiens \nantibody variable heavy chain” and “\nhomo sapiens \nantibody kappa variable light chain”, respectively. A total of 182 human V-gene sequences, 114 V\nH \nand 68 V\nκ\n, were semi-randomly selected from the NCBI database for comparison against mammalian V\nH \nand V\nκ\n databases. The subclass distribution of human V\nH \nand V\nκ\n sequences obtained by semi-random cherry-picking of the NCBI database yielded the expected subclass representation based on natural germline V\nH \nor V\nκ\n usage (Guigou et al., 1990) suggesting little bias in the way sequences were chosen from the NCBI.\n\n\nThe sequences were then categorized into their individual variable domain subclasses (V\nH\n1-\nV\n \n \n \nH\n7 and V\nκ\n1-V\nκ\n4) by ClustalW alignment against the subclass consensus sequences obtained from Aho's Amazing Atlas of Antibody Anatomy website. The subclasses were additionally confirmed by alignment against the publicly available human germline sequences (Lefranc et al., \nNucleic Acids Res. \n27, 209-212, 1999). No more than 5 human sequences from any one multi-sequence NCBI submission were included within the reference sets to reduce potential bias introduced by primer sets or antigen-based V-gene usage. The sequence gathering was performed naively; therefore, there was a natural abundance of \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 and \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n1 sequences after subclass grouping. The average score and standard deviation (described below and in Table 20) were calculated for each subclass using 25 \nV\n \n \n \nH\n1, 3 \nV\n \n \n \nH\n2, 44 \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3, 34 \nV\n \n \n \nH\n4, 5 \nV\n \n \n \nH\n5, 3 \nV\n \n \n \nH\n7, 29 \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n1, 4 \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n2, 19 \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n3 and 16 \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n4 human sequences. Only 2 of the 18 antibodies (BIIB5 and BIIB14) contained V\nH \ndomains with minimal subgroup sequence populations (i.e. \nV\n \n \n \nH\n2, \nV\n \n \n \nH\n5 or V\nH\n7). Four of the 18 antibodies (BIIB3, BIIB4, BIIB17 and BIIB18) contained \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n2 subclass variable domains whose subclass was underrepresented in sequence space and whose scoring accuracy was ill defined. No \nnatural V\n \n \n \nH\n6 sequences were found within the human V\nH \nsequence reference set. This was not a concern as none of the BIIB antibody constructs contained a \nV\n \n \n \nH\n6 domain.\n\n\nThe variable domain sequences of the 18 BIIB antibodies and the 182 human V\nH \nand V\nκ\n sequences obtained from the NCBI were scored against the reference set of mammalian antibody sequences. All V\nH \nand V\nκ\n sequences were truncated prior to CDR3 (two residues after the consensus YYC residues) to reduce the unpredictability introduced by the hypervariable nature of the V-(D-)J-C joining region. Residue frequencies (p\ni\n(r)), at every position within the mammalian database were calculated by summing the number of times each amino acid (A, C, D . . . V, W, Y,-) occurs at each residue position within the database divided by the total number of sequences. Scores were evaluated for each human V\nH \nand V\nκ\n test sequence using the following formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscore\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n∑\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n⁡\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nr\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n⁡\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nr\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein c\ni\n(r) equals the consensus residue frequency at each position of the mammalian variable domain databases and h\ni\n(r) equals the test residue frequency of each amino acid of the human variable domain test sequence. Perfect consenus scores for the consensus sequences of the mammalian databases were 104 for V\nH \nand 100 for V\nκ\n.\n\n\nA. Scoring Random V\nH \nand V\nκ\n Sequences Using a Mammalian V-Gene Database\n\n\nV\nH \nand V\nκ\n subclass consensus sequences were scored against the mammalian databases consensus and plotted in \nFIGS. 71A and 71C\n, respectively. The V\nH\n3-subclass consensus scored only 1 point lower than the hypothetical “perfect” score of the mammalian database consensus and differed from the mammalian database consensus by a total of three residues. Thus, it is apparent that the mammalian database is biased towards V\nH\n3-like sequences. All other human V\nH \nsubclass consensus sequences scored significantly lower. A bias towards \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n4 sequences was observed for the mammalian V\nκ\n database (\nFIG. 71C\n). The human or humanized BIIB sequence scores were analyzed based on the performance of human NCBI sequences of comparable subclass. Distributions of the individual V\nH \nsequence scores are shown in \nFIG. 71B\n, and distributions of the individual V\nκ\n sequence scores are shown in \nFIG. 71D\n.\n\n\nB. Scoring Results for BIIB1 through BIIB18\n\n\nV\nH \nand V\nκ\n scores for all 18 BIIB antibodies were calculated and compared to the relative numbers derived from the NCBI human V-gene sequence reference set (Table 20). Also included in Table 20 is the difference between the BIIB V-gene score and the average subclass score. It is the difference between these scores that was used for examining potential stability trends. BIIB1 through 18 were labeled in descending order of their measured Fab stabilities. The V-gene subclass and the closest individual human germline for the BIIB V\nH \nand V\nκ\n genes were determined by ClustalW analysis.\n\n\nConsensus-based scores were derived for the 18 BIIB antibodies and compared to the experimentally determined Fab thermal unfolding profiles. BIIB antibodies with greatest difference between the BIIB V-gene score and their average subclass score (ie. lowest sequence scores) was correlated with the low Fab T\nM\ns measured in Example 15 (Table 20, \nFIG. 72A\n). There was no apparent trend correlating V\nκ\n scores with the TMS measured by DSC (\nFIG. 72B\n). In fact, the lowest scoring V\nκ\n sequence belonged to BIIB2 which had the second highest apparent Fab stability.\n\n\nUnusual CDR amino acid insertions and deletions were found in BIIB15 and BIIB16, as well as in BIIB18, which had the worst V\nH \nscore of all the BIIB antibodies and never expressed at appreciable levels. V\nH \nscoring did not suggest potential stability problems for BIIB15 and BIIB16; however, their Fab T\nM\ns were two of the lowest tested (\nFIG. 72A\n). BIIB15 contained an unusually long CDR1 (13 amino acids in length and 2 longer than any V\nH\n3-like domain in our mammalian database or \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain in our set of human sequences) and BIIB16 contained an unusually short CDR2 (15 amino acids in length and 1 amino acid shorter than the significant majority of the \nother V\n \n \n \nH\n3 CDR2s in both our mammalian V\nH \ndatabase and our reference set of human V\nH\ns).\n\n\nC. Utility of Small Mammalian Sequence Databases for Residue\n\n\nFrequency Analysis and Stability Prediction of the BIIB Fabs\n\n\nScoring the BIIB V\nH \ndomains against the mammalian database of V\nH \nsequences proved to be a useful tool for determining the abundance of non-optimal amino acids within each V\nH \ndomain, which may in turn limit the overall stability of a Fab. The scores were useful for picking out Fabs with low stability and the potential for reduced in vitro longevity and increased aggregation rates. Based on the subclass biases observed for the mammalian V-gene databases, one might question whether it would be best to use strictly human V-gene databases for performing the consensus scoring as opposed to the mammalian database used here. However, based on the significant number of stability determining variables that the scoring does not reflect, such as the exact residue positions of non-consensus amino acids, the strength of the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninteraction, the nature of the V-(D-)J-C joining and the incidence of hypersomatic insertions or deletions, it is difficult to believe that an all-human V\nH \ndatabase would provide a significant improvement. A strictly human database used for scoring may also require a significantly greater number of sequences to match the evolutionary diversity naively included within the mammalian database. One piece of data that indicates the mammalian database approach works well is that the human subclass consensus V\nH \nsequences scored in ascending order of their genomic subclass abundance and apparent subclass usage (Guigou et al., 1990; Teale and Medina, 1992; Tomlinson et al., 1992). The mammalian V\nH \ndatabase appears to weight the overall contributions of the human V\nH \nsubclasses appropriately. The fact that each V\nH \nand V\nκ\n subclass consensus sequence generally scored higher than the vast majority of the individual and unique human sequences picked from the NCBI suggests that the mammalian database is capturing consensus information for all subclasses, even though a bias exists towards \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3. Therefore, due to the existence of other stability-influencing factors that the scoring does not incorporate, the trend observed in \nFIG. 72A\n is unlikely to improve by fine-tuning of the V\nH \nsequence database used for scoring.\n\n\nUnusual insertions or deletions in V\nH \ndomains appear to have significant effects on stability not reflected by consensus scoring. The unusually long (13 amino acids) CDR1 of BIIB15 and the unusually short (15 amino acids) CDR2 of BIIB16 are likely carry-overs of humanization from the original mouse sequence. In fact, the BIIB16 V\nH \nsequence aligns closely with two mouse V\nH \nsequences in our mammalian database that also contained a 15 amino acid CDR2. Forcing the unusually small CDR onto the human framework may have adversely affected the stability of this antibody. BIIB18 not only displayed the lowest V\nH \nscore of all the BIIB sequences but also contained an extraordinarily long CDR2 (22 residues compared to the usual 19 amino acid maximum). Thus, it is not surprising considering the multiple possible problems inherent within the sequence of BIIB18 that it never reached expression levels allowing for anything other than extremely crude biological assays with unpurified supernatants. The results for BIIB15, BIIB16 and BIIB18 suggest that unusual V\nH \ninsertions or deletions may have a greater effect on antibody thermostability than most single point mutations. The exceptionally poor behavior of BIIB18 was not predicted based on a perfunctory glance over its sequence as its Fv contained all the “essential” amino acids strictly conserved within the V-gene folds. Having the ability to pick out troublesome antibodies using a somewhat finer comb is the real the utility of the scoring approach.\n\n\nNo trends were apparent when comparing the measured Fab stabilities against the V\nκ\n scores. Combining the V\nκ\n scores with the V\nH \nscores simply reduced the trending observed for the V\nH \nscores alone. Unlike the V\nH \nscoring results, the human V\nκ\n consensus scores were not in line with the natural abundance of V\nκ\n germlines and gene usage (Guigou et al., 1990; Meindl et al., 1990; Cox et al., 1994); even though the consensus scores themselves all scored better than their individual human kappa subclass sequences (\nFIG. 72B\n). It is only speculation that these deviations from the expected order of V\nκ\n consensus scores may deter the mammalian databases' ability to accurately predict low stability V\nκ\n domains. Also, there were not \nenough V\n \n \n \nK\n2 sequences for defining the \nV\n \n \n \nK\n2 subclass average score. After subclass distributions were determined for the 68 human V\nκ\n sequences, only 4 were V\nκ\n2 (which reflects \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n2 usage pretty well). Even with these drawbacks, the V\nκ\n results still suggest that the greater sequence diversity of V\nH \ngenes may, more often than not, make V\nH \ndomains the stability-determining component of Fabs (Demarest et al., 2006); although examples of the opposite are available in the literature (Röthlisberger et al., 2006).\n\n\nD. Stability Dependence upon V\nH \nor V\nL \nGermline and V\nH\n/V\nL \nPairing\n\n\nMany of the 18 antibodies contained overlapping germlines V-genes whose CDRs and hypersomatic mutations varied and whose V\nH \nor V\nκ\n pairing was the same or different. This allowed for a comparison of antibody Fab stabilities against the individual germlines from which they were derived. The two most stable Fabs, BIIB1 and BIIB2, have the \nsame V\n \n \n \nH\n1 and \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n1 germline combinations. V\nH \nand V\nκ\n pairings do not appear to have clear intrinsic biases based on a study by Winter and coworkers, but are believed to be “receptor driven” (de Wildt et al., 1999b). BIIB1 and BIIB2 bind relatively dissimilar antigens, CCL2 and VLA4; therefore, the combination either occurred randomly or was the result of humanization. There was a clear abundance of non-optimal amino-acids within the V\nH \ndomains of the least stable Fabs, BIIB17 and BIIB18 (i.e. low sequence scores and BIIB18 contained an unusual insertion). Both of these antibodies also contained the \nsame V\n \n \n \nκ\n2 germline, potentially suggesting light chain protein stability issues on top of the V\nH\n-based issues identified by the scoring. An interesting future study would be to determine whether this \nparticular V\n \n \n \nκ\n2 was a contributor to the poor biophysical behavior of these two antibodies. \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n2 subclass in general was not associated with poor Fab stabilities as BIIB3 and BIIB4 also contain a \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n2 subclass gene. The \nAB019438V\n \n \n \nH\n1 germline (Lefranc et al., 1999) cropped up four times. The T\nM\n-values for these Fabs (BIIB12, BIIB11, BIIB7 and BIIB3) ranged from 71.2 to 78.2. Interestingly, their V\nH \nsequence scores correlated with their apparent Fab stabilities (BIIB12<BIIB11<BIIB7≈BIIB3). A positive V\nH \nscoring correlation was also found in the BIIB1 and BIIB2 antibodies described above with the \nsame V\n \n \n \nH\n1 germline. The apparent imprecision of the V\nH \nscoring, however, was emphasized by a negative stability correlation observed for BIIB4 and BIIB6 which both contained the \nM99649V\n \n \n \nH\n3 germline.\n\n\nWhile usage of V\nH \ngermline families in adult humans appears to be fairly random, the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 family contains the most members in humans. \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 or V\nH\n3-like genes stochastically appeared more often in the human reference set and the mammalian database. Ewert and Plückthun's results demonstrated that a consensus-derived \nhuman V\n \n \n \nH\n3 sequence was the most stable of the consensus-derived V\nH \ndomains (Ewert and Pluckthun, 2003). This result may not be entirely unexpected considering the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 subclass has more germline sequences to contribute to the creation of an optimal consensus compared to the other subclasses. Our stability data shows that \nIgGs containing V\n \n \n \nH\n3 germlines do not in general exhibit higher Fab T\nM\n-values. There are \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 and \nV\n \n \n \nH\n1 subclass genes at both the top and bottom of the stability list. While many other factors contribute to the overall stability of the Fab, especially the properties of the V\nκ\n counterpart within the Fv, one might expect a trend towards higher Fab stabilities for those containing \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 subclass germlines if the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains in general were more stable than the other subclasses. This does not appear to be the case from the limited stability studies described here.\n\n\nExample 17\n\n\nCovariation Analysis of Ig-fold Polypeptides\n\n\nA. Collecting and Filtering Ig-Fold Structures\n\n\nStructures of Ig-Fold proteins or Ig-Fold domains from multidomain proteins were gathered from the ASTRAL database, which contains domain structures matching the SCOP hierarchy. Immunoglobulin specific Ig-domains were found under the following classifications within the SCOP hierarchy: “All beta proteins”-->“Immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich”-->“Immunoglobulin”. Under immunoglobulin, four sets of structures were available: “V set,” “C1 set,” “C2 set,” and “I set.” Four custom download scripts were separately run to obtain “V-class”, “C1-class”, “I-class”, and “C2-class” pdb files.\n\n\nOnce the structure files for each subfamily were downloaded, some filtering performed to remove erroneously categorized, incomplete, redundant, or domain-swapped structures (Liu Y, et al., \nProtein Sci\n. (2002), 1285-1299). There were 4 main filtering steps, described below:\n\n\n \nStep #\n1. Removal Sequences that have Breaks\n\n\nStructures from each subclass were visually inspected, using SwissPDB Viewer, for breaks in sequence (either unresolved densities or missing sections due to domain swapping). The PDB files of faulty structures were manually removed from the V-, C1-, C2-, and I-class structure datasets.\n\n\n \nStep #\n2. Removal of 100% Identical Sequences\n\n\nPDB format structures were converted to FASTA format amino acid sequences, and filtered to remove any sequences that were either 100% identical to, or perfect match substrings of, remaining sequences.\n\n\n \nStep #\n3. Removal of Sequences of Aberrant Length\n\n\nPDB structures with aberrantly long or short amino acid sequences were removed from the structure datasets. The length cutoff criteria were determined by examining the histogram of all sequence lengths (\nFIG. 74\n). The histograms appeared somewhat normally distributed. Sequences outside two standard deviations from the mean were removed from each subfamily dataset. The overall mean number of residues for the immunoglobulin superfamily was 106.10 and the standard deviation was 12.19. Consequently, the global cutoffs used were <=81 and >=131 residues. A breakdown of the mean lengths and standard deviations is shown in Table 21.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 21\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSequence Length Criteria of Structure Datasets\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubclass\n \nAverage Length\n \nStandard Deviation\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nC1\n \n99.44\n \n8.79\n \n \n \n \n \nC2\n \n88.07\n \n15.14\n \n \n \n \n \nI\n \n95.5\n \n4.94\n \n \n \n \n \nV\n \n111.95\n \n10.62\n \n \n \n \n \nOverall\n \n106.10\n \n12.19\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nStep #\n4. Removal of Misfolded Sequences\n\n\n\nThe structures were visually inspected, using SwissPDB Viewer, for misfolding. Any structures that did not conform to the two beta-sheet sandwich topology were discarded. Since only five C2-class domains were obtained from SCOP, C2-subclass Ig-Folds were not pursued further. Hereafter, C1-class is referred to as C-class.\n\n\nB. Obtaining Sequence Alignments from Structure Alignments For each separate class, the Ig-Fold structures were superimposed upon one another using Secondary Structure Matching (SSM) within the Schrödinger structalign package (See Schrödinger Prime program documentation for instructions on creating superpositions). Superpositions were performed on an ‘all-to-all’ or an ‘all-to-one’ basis. Each algorithm led to similar quality alignments, so ‘all-to-one’ was chosen for the superpositions. Some superimpositions were corrected to insure that the core regions of each structure were superimposed instead of the loops. The superimpositions were then used to generate structure-based sequence alignments of all the V-class, 1-class, and C-class sequences within each structural alignment. Alignment of each sequence onto another was performed using the Schrödinger package by matching amino acids from one sequence to that of second sequence based on the shortest distance between α-carbons of the polypeptide backbones.\n\n\nC. Construction of a Curated Ig-Fold Sequence Database\n\n\nA number of defined steps were created to generate a curated Ig-Fold dataset for calculating robust covariation statistics:\n\n\n \nStep #\n1. Construction of HMM Profiles\n\n\nThree Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles were built, each based upon the structure-based sequence alignments for one of the three Ig-Fold classes. The profiles were created with the HMMER software package (version 1.8), using the commands “hmmbuild” and “hmmcalibrate” with standard options. These HMMs were then used to detect and align additional Ig-Fold sequences in the NR-database maintained at the NCBI.\n\n\n \nStep #\n2. Searching NR Using the New V-, I-, and C-Class HMM Profiles.\n\n\nThe three class-specific HMMs were used to search for similar sequences in a local NR database. The NR database is a large file containing ˜3 million non-redundant protein sequences. For each of the V-, I-, and C-class HMMs, the HMMER command “hmmsearch” was used to search NR. Each output ranked NR sequences by their scores relative to the HMM used, and provided information about the number of regions hit by the HMM and the positions of the hit regions within each NR sequence. For each Ig-Fold class-specific HMM search, hit NR sequences above a recommended criterion score threshold were retained as candidate members of the Ig-Fold class whose HMM was used. For those hit regions that were subsequences of an NR sequence, the exact NR subsequence hit was extracted from the full NR sequence using a custom program.\n\n\n \nStep #\n3. Validation of Ig-Fold Class Assignment Using PFAM.\n\n\nPFAM is a protein family and domain classification tool, created and maintained at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Fin, et al., \nNuc. Acids. Res\n., (2006), 34: D247-D251), that can be applied to individual protein sequences. A Pfam tool ‘pfamverify’ was applied to each Ig-Fold candidate sequence obtained in \nstep\n 2 above, to confirm that it was correctly classified by the Ig-Fold class-specific HMMs created from the structure-based sequence alignments. PFAM's Ig-clan HMM profiles (including V-, I-, C1-, C2-, and less specific Ig HMMs) were downloaded from the PFAM website. Each sequence from NR was scored by the Ig-clan HMMs, revealing how well each sequence conforms to each PFAM HMM. Sequences whose scores lay below recommended cutoffs (TC1-defined at the PFAM website) for the V-, I-, or C-classes were removed from the respective sequence sets. Thus, the candidate class-specific Ig-Fold sequences found in \nstep\n 2 were retained only if their PFAM scores validated their Ig-Fold class assignments.\n\n\n \nStep #\n4. Aligning the New Ig-Fold Sequences.\n\n\nThe Ig-Fold sequences that were pulled from NR with HMM searches and that survived \nstep\n 3 above, were next aligned to our custom HMMs of their assigned class. Since these HMMs had been based upon careful structural alignments, this process insured a structure-guided alignment of the new sequences. The HMMER package was utilized to generate ‘mapali’ alignments in fasta output format, to be used in the Sequence Covariation Tool described below. The alignments were also output in ‘Stockholm’ output format, and inspected for aberrant or misaligned sequences, which were manually omitted. The resulting alignments, consisting of the original structurally-aligned sequences and the added HMM-aligned sequences from NR, contained the following numbers of sequences: ˜50,000 V-class; ˜10,000 C-class; ˜10,000 I-class.\n\n\n \nStep #\n5. Removing Redundant or Similar Sequences.\n\n\nWe expected these alignments to be biased towards frequently observed sequences, with under-representation of rare sequences and a consequent masking of sequence diversity. For example, we expected a large bias in the V-class Ig-Fold sequence alignment towards murine and human immunoglobulin variable domains. Since over-representation of particular sequence types limits the usefulness of covariation analyses, a filtering tool was created and applied to reduce the alignment redundancy. The tool used a novel heuristic algorithm to find sequences with >80% identity to one another, and removed them from the alignments. In brief, percent identities were calculated for all sequence pairs. The identity values were then grouped into bins of percent identity (i.e. 99% bin, 98% bin, 97% bin, etc.). During the reduction of each bin, the sequences of each bin were ranked by decreasing non-gap residue count, and then by their Henikoff sequence weight (Henikoff S and Henikoff J G, \nJ. Mol. Biol\n., (1994), 243: 184-199). After this step, the remaining number of sequences in each alignment were: 2,786 V-class; 1,587 I-class; and 518 C-class.\n\n\n \nStep #\n6. Removal of Gaps to Create the Final Alignments\n\n\nIn the final alignments, columns that were not match states in the HMM profile used to find these sequences (see HMMER manual) were removed. Therefore, while many of the sequences contain more amino acids than the final alignment length, the lengths were truncated to avoid calculations on the less informative gap regions of the alignment. The final numbers of residues (including gaps) within the alignments were 144 for the V-class, 60 for the I-class, and 111 for the C-class.\n\n\nD. General Description of the Final Alignments\n\n\na) V-Class\n\n\nAfter the final 80% filter was applied, the 2,786 V-class sequences could be divided into three categories: (1) Immunoglobulin variable gene class, 49%, which include both the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of diverse immunoglobulins; (2) T-Cell Receptor V-class genes, 16%, which contained the hypervariable domains; and (3) Other V-class genes, 35%. The Immunoglobulin V-class genes come from a huge variety of species ranging from cartilaginous fish to primates. There was a bias towards human V-class sequences (537 of the 1272 sequences). However, other vertebrate species were only minimally represented: mouse (33), cow (5), camel (23), llama (31), macaque (17), chicken (6), etc. The T-cell receptor set of sequences was nearly as diverse ranging from fish to primate and did not contain a bias towards human sequences. The “Other” category comprised a large number of diverse sequences with no real subcategories comprising over 1-2% of the remaining sequences. The “Other” category contained an even wider array of species including chordates (primarily), cartilaginous fish, cephalopods, and insects.\n\n\nb) C-Class\n\n\nAfter the final 80% filter was applied, the 518 C-class sequences could be divided into three categories: (1) Immunoglobulin constant domains, 44%; (2) MHC-type Ig-Folds, 21%; and (3) Other C-class Ig-Folds, 35%. The Immunoglobulin constant domain category contained diverse sequences ranging from cartilaginous fish to primates. The C-class immunoglobulin subcategory was not biased by primate or even mammalian sequences (only 3 human sequences remained unfiltered: IgE-\nC\n \n \n \nH\n4, a kappa C\nL\n, and a lambda C\nL\n). The MHC subcategory also ranged from cartilaginous fish to primates and also showed little bias towards one evolutionary group. The “Other” C-class category contained many unknown proteins, a very small subcategory of various beta-2-microglobulins, and many other proteins that were not observed with a frequency deserved of a subcategory.\n\n\nc) I-Class\n\n\nThe I-class did not have any clear subcategories. Titan or titan-like molecules cropped up commonly as did cell-adhesion or cell-adhesion-like molecules.\n\n\nE. Calculation of Covariation Statistics\n\n\nCorrelation strength (in terms of a φ-value) and significance (in terms of a χ\n2\n-value) of covariations between all possible pairs of amino acids in the alignments was calculated based on art-recognized methods, but included the following variations: 1) Gaps were included as a distinct residue type; (2) the Henikoff weighing scheme was not performed; (3) Sequence Average Identities (SAI) were not used to filter out covarying pairs; (4) χ\n2 \nvalues were calculated using event based counts (number of occurrences), rather than frequencies; and (5) covarying pairs were not reported by the program unless they were observed a minimum number of times. Two bodies of statistics were created, the first (and smaller set) with an event cutoff of 10 and a second (much larger set) with an event cutoff of 6 events. The ability to calculate these parameters on any given sequence alignment was encoded into a Java executable and tested with Java Runtime Engine (JRE) version 1.4.2.\n\n\nBased on the number of positions within the alignment and a total of 23 possible residues at each position (including gaps, B, and Z ambiguous residues), there were 2.4 million correlations calculated for the C-class, 700 thousand calculated for the I-class, and 4.1 million calculated for the V-class. \nFIG. 75\n shows the φ values calculated for the V-class with high χ\n2 \nsignificance. φ values range from −1 to +1. As positive φ values move away from 0 (i.e. toward +1), the strength of the correlation (i.e. the covariation) between two amino acids at defined positions within the alignments increases. Negative correlations (i.e. the presence of one amino acid at one site in the alignment forcing the absence of another specific amino acid at a second site) increase as φ values move towards −1. Cutoffs for what is a real covariation are somewhat arbitrary, but those with a φ value >0.5 are strongly correlated with one another. Thus, according to \nFIG. 75\n, only 370 of the possible 2.4 million correlations within the C-class are strong. However, correlations above 0.3 have been reported as important and would increase the number of positive correlations observed for all three classes by ˜10-fold. These correlations represent the very small, but important piece of the dataset that is used for further analyses, generating protein designs, or prediction of functional residue positions.\n\n\nF. Validation of Covariation Statistics\n\n\nThere were several criteria used to validate that the strong covariations that were derived from the Ig-Fold database were significant and meaningful apart from the statistical strengths based on the calculations. The first was to analyze whether there was a trend between residues that covaried with one another and their proximity inside Ig-Folds of known structure. Previous studies in the literature have demonstrated that a correlation between covarying positions and their proximity to one another do exist—although they are very weak—in agreement with our results. A second criterion looked at whether the Ig-Fold covariation calculations generated known connections between amino acid positions that have already been reported to exist within known Ig-Fold subsets. One clear test case was at N-terminus of human/murine IgG variable heavy chain folds (part of the V-class). Residues 6-10 are known to adopt very specific conformations based on the conservation of covarying pairs of amino acids (Ewert S, et al., \nMethods\n, (2004), 24: 184-199). Two of the three reported pairs of covarying amino acids were found to have φ values above 0.3—well above the apparent background of the dataset.\n\n\nExample 18\n\n\nPreparation of a PRIMATIZED® p5E8 Tetravalent Antibody Comprising a Conventional p5E8 scFv\n\n\nPRIMATIZED® p5E8G1 is a chimeric macaque/human (PRIMATIZED®) monoclonal antibody containing macaque heavy and light variable regions fused to \nhuman gamma\n 1 and kappa constant regions, respectively. PRIMATIZED® p5E8G1 binds to human CD23, the low affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRII) (Mavromatis and Cheson. 2003. J. Clin. Oncol. 21:1874; US Patent Application 20030059424). A tetravalent PRIMATIZED® p5E8 antibody was constructed using a similar strategy as that described in Examples 1-8. The PRIMATIZED® p5E8 scFv used for constructing the tetravalent antibody is comprised of p5E8 VL and VH region sequences tethered by a short linker in the VL→(Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinker→VH orientation and is described in greater detail in Example 19. Correct sequences were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.

Oligonucleotides used in the construction are shown in Table 22.\n\n\nPRIMATIZED p5E8 scFvs (VL/VH) was constructed by PCR using the forward primer P5E8-VL01F which contains 29 bases encoding part of the gpIII leader sequence followed by 15 bases of sequence complementary to the p5E8 N-terminal light variable domain gene and the reverse primer, P5E8-VH01R, which contains 15 bases of sequence complementary to the p5E8 C-terminal heavy variable domain followed by a unique adjacent Sal I endonuclease site (endonuclease site is underlined). Similarly, PRIMATIZED p5E8 scFvs (VH/VL) was constructed by PCR using the forward primer P5E8-VH01F which contains 29 bases encoding part of the gpIII leader sequence followed by 18 bases of sequence complementary to the p5E8 N-terminal variable heavy domain gene and the reverse primer, P5E8-VL01R, which contains 12 bases of sequence complementary to the p5E8 C-terminal variable light domain gene followed by a unique adjacent Sal I endonuclease site (endonuclease site is underlined).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOligonucleotides for PCR amplification of a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconventional PRIMATIZED ® p5E8 scFvs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimers\n\n\nSequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nP5E8-\nVL01F\n \n\n\n5′- CGCTGGTGGTGCCGTTCTATAGCCATAGTGAC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 71)\n\n\nATCCAGATGACC -3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nP5E8-\nVL01R\n \n\n\n5′- GTG\nGTCGAC\nTTTGATTTCCAC -3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 72)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nP5E8-\nVH01F\n \n\n\n5′- CGCTGGTGGTGCCGTTCTATAGCCATAGTGAG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 73)\n\n\nGTGCAGCTGGTGGAG -3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nP5E8-\nVH01R\n \n\n\n5′- GTG\nGTCGAC\nTGAGGAGACGGTGAC -3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 74)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nP5E8-\nLeader01\n \n\n\n5′- GG\nCATATG\nAAAAAACTGCTGTTCGCGATTCCG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 75)\n\n\nCTGGTGGTGCCGTTCTATAG -3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing PCR amplification, primer P5E8-Leader01 was added to both reactions for a second PCR reaction. Primer P5E8-Leader01 contains a unique Nde I endonuclease site followed by 25 bases encoding the N-terminal portion of the gpIII leader sequence, followed by 22 bases complementary to the 5′ ends of P5E8-VL01F and P5E8-VH01F and PCR amplified again. PCR products corresponding to the expected sizes were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, excised, and purified using the Millipore Ultrafree-DA extraction kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Millipore; Bedford, Mass.). The purified PCR products were subsequently digested with Nde I and Sal I and cloned into the Nde I/Sal I sites of a modified \nE. coli \nexpression vector designed to drive recombinant protein expression under the control of an inducible ara C promoter. The expression vector contained a modification encoding a unique Nde I site overlapping the start codon of the BHA10 scFv. Individual ligation reactions were performed with each of the gel purified PCR products and the digested expression vector and a portion of each of the ligation mixtures were used to transform \nE. coli \nstrain XL1-Blue. Ampicillin drug resistant colonies were screened and DNA sequence analysis confirmed the correct sequence of the final p5E8 (VH/VL) encoding pIEH-162 and p5E8 (VL/VH) encoding pIEH-163 constructs. DNA and amino acid sequences of p5E8 (VL/VH) scFv are shown in \nFIGS. 83A and 83B\n, respectively. DNA and amino acid sequences of p5E8 (VH/VL) scFv are shown in \nFIGS. 84A and 84B\n, respectively.\n\n\nFor expression of conventional p5E8 scFvs, freshly isolated colonies of \nE. coli \nstrain W3110 (ATCC, Manassas, Va. Cat. #27325) transformed with plasmids pIEH-162 and pIEH-163 were cultivated and either culture supernatants or periplasm extracts were prepared as described in Example 4.\n\n\nPRIMATIZED® p5E8 Fab was prepared by enzymatic digestion of PRIMATIZED® p5E8 IgG following methods described in Example 1. Purified Fab was concentrated to between 2-11 mg/mL. Fab concentrations were determined using an ε\n280 nm\n=1.5 mL mg\n−1 \ncm\n−1\n.\n\n\nExample 20\n\n\nThermal Stability of Conventional p5E8 scFv Antibodies\n\n\nSince an excellent correlation has been observed between T50 values obtained using the thermal challenge assay described in Examples 4 and 5 and Tm values calculated by DSC analysis (r\n2\n=0.93), a thermal challenge assay was employed to evaluate the relative thermal stabilities of the p5E8 (VL/VH) and p5E8 (VH/VL) scFvs. The thermal challenge assay was utilized as described in Examples 4 and 5 except that soluble CD23 antigen at 1 ug/ml was used to coat the plates and the concentration of the Eu-labelled anti-6 His antibody (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass., Cat. # AD0109) was increased to 250 ng/ml. Results from this assay determined the T50 value of p5E8 (VL/VH) to be 38° C. and p5E8 (VH/VL) to be slightly lower at 34° C. (\nFIG. 85\n). Given the remarkably low T50 values of both scFvs and the observation that of the two p5E8 (VL/VH) was slightly more thermally stabile, p5E8 (VL/VH) was selected for further stability engineering.\n\n\nExample 21\n\n\nConstruction of p5E8 scFv Molecules with Improved Thermal Stability\n\n\nIndividual variants and libraries designed to contain the desired amino acid replacements in the conventional p5E8 (VL/VH) scFv using the methods described in Examples 3 and 5 were created as previously described using oligonucleotides listed in Table 23.\n\n\nIn Table 23, each oligonucleotide name gives reference to amino acid substitutions at position(s) in VH or VL according to Kabat numbering system. “Rationale” refers to the design method employed. Said methods are described in detail in Example 5 supra. Mutagenic residues are shown as capital letters. Oligonucleotide pairs for introducing VH/VL disulfides are boxed. Abbreviations are: “COMP”—Computational Analysis, “COVAR”—Covariation Analysis, “CONS”—Consensus Scoring, “INTER-VH/VL” Interface Design, “SS”—VH/VL disulfide bond, and “TBD”—to be

Ambiguous bases are abbreviated as follows: W = A or T, V = A or C or G, Y = C or T, S = C or G, M = A or C, N = A or C or G or T, R = A or G, K = G or T, B = C or G or T (J Biol Chem. 261(1):13-7 (1986)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual transformed colonies were picked into deep-well 96 well dishes, processed, and screened according to the methods detailed in Example 5. Transformants were grown overnight in expression media consisting of SB (Teknova, Half Moon Bay, Ca. Cat. # S0140) supplemented with 0.6% glycine, 0.6% Triton X100, 0.02% arabinose, and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at either 37° C. or 32° C.\n\n\nAfter thermal challenge, the aggregated material was removed by centrifugation and assayed in the soluble CD23 DELFIA as described in Example 3. Assay data was processed using Spotfire DecisionSite software (Spotfire, Somerville, Ma.) and expressed as the ratio of the DELFIA counts observed at challenge temperature to the reference temperature for each clone. Clones that reproducibly gave ratios greater than or equal to twice what was observed for the parental plasmid were considered hits. Plasmid DNAs from these positive clones were isolated by mini-prep (Wizard Plus, Promega, Madison, Wis.) and retransformed back into \nE. coli \nW3110 for confirmation secondary thermal challenge assays as well as for DNA sequence determination.\n\n\nPrimary and confirmatory results from these assays are shown in Table 24. Several of the stabilized scFv molecules of the invention resulted in improvements in binding activity (T\n50\n>38° C.) as compared with the conventional p5E8 scFv.

Construction of N\nH\n-p5E8 Tetravalent Antibody\n\n\nThe p5E8 scFvs DNAs described in Example 21 are used to construct an N\nH\n-p5E8 tetravalent antibody similar to that described in Example 7 supra. A (Gly\n4\nSer)\n5 \nlinker is used to connect the p5E8 scFv to the mature amino terminus of PRIMATIZED® p5E8 IgG heavy chain. The organization of the molecule is a p5E8 scFv-(Gly4Ser)\n5 \nlinker-PRIMATIZED® p5E8 IgG heavy chain. This molecule assembles with the light chain to form the tetravalent antibody. The correct sequence would be confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The construct could be used for transfecting CHO cells as described in Example 8 for scaled-up production of a N\nH\n-p5E8 Tetravalent Antibody. Transfected CHO cells can be screened for binding to immobilized CD23 antigen by DELFIA assay. 96-well plates. For example, (MaxiSorp, Nalge Nunc, Rochester, N.Y., Cat. # 437111) can be coated with soluble CD23 antigen at 1 ug/ml in 0.1M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5. Plates are coated overnight at 4° C., and blocked with DELFIA assay buffer (DAB, 10 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 0.5% BSA, 0.02\n% Tween\n 20, 0.01% NaN\n3\n, pH 7.4) for one hour with shaking at room temperature. Plates are washed 3 times with DAB without BSA (Wash buffer), and test samples diluted in DAB added to the plates in a final volume of 100 ul. The plates are incubated for one hour with shaking at room temperature, and then washed 3 times with Wash buffer to remove unbound material. Bound antibody is detected by addition of 100 ul per well of DAB containing 250 ng/ml of Eu-labeled anti-human antibody (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass., Cat. #1244-330) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for one hour. The plates are washed 3 times with Wash buffer, and 100 ul of DELFIA enhancement solution (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass., Cat. #4001-0010) is added per well. Following incubation for 15 minutes, the plates are read using the Europium method on a \nVictor\n 2 plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.).\n\n\nB. Construction of C— p5E8 Tetravalent Antibody\n\n\nThe p5E8 scFvs DNAs described in Example 21 supra are used to construct a C-p5E8 tetravalent antibody as described in Example 7 supra. A Ser(Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinker peptide is used to connect the p5E8 scFv to the carboxy terminus of PRIMATIZED® p5E8 IgG heavy chain. The organization of the molecule is a PRIMATIZED® p5E8 IgG heavy chain-Ser(Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinker-p5E8 scFv. This molecule assembles with the light chain to form the tetravalent antibody. The correct sequence would be confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The construct could be used for transfecting CHO cells as described in Example 8 for scaled-up production of a C-p5E8 Tetravalent Antibody. Transfected CHO cells can be screened as described above.\n\n\nEquivalents\n\n\nThose skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments of the invention described herein.
