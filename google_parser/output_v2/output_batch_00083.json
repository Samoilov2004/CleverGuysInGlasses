No. 7,790,760, which claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 61/059,485 filed Jun. 6, 2008.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to isoxazole derivatives that function as potentiators of glutamate receptors, methods for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nThe metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) constitute a family of GTP-binding-protein (G-protein) coupled receptors that are activated by glutamate, and have important roles in synaptic activity in the central nervous system, including neural plasticity, neural development and neurodegeneration.\n\n\nActivation of mGluRs in intact mammalian neurons elicits one or more of the following responses: activation of phospholipase C; increases in phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis; intracellular calcium release; activation of phospholipase D; activation or inhibition of adenyl cyclase; increases or decreases in the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP); activation of guanylyl cyclase; increases in the formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP); activation of phospholipase A\n2\n; increases in arachidonic acid release; and increases or decreases in the activity of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels (Schoepp et al., 1993, Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 14:13; Schoepp, 1994, Neurochem. Int., 24:439; Pin et al., 1995, Neuropharmacology 34:1; Bordi & Ugolini, 1999, Prog. Neurobiol. 59:55).\n\n\nEight mGluR subtypes have been identified, which are divided into three groups based upon primary sequence similarity, signal transduction linkages, and pharmacological profile. Group-I includes mGluR1 and mGluR5, which activate phospholipase C and the generation of an intracellular calcium signal. The Group-II (mGluR2 and mGluR3) and Group-III (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8) mGluRs mediate an inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity and cyclic AMP levels. For a review, see Pin et al., 1999, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 375:277-294.\n\n\nActivity of mGluR family receptors are implicated in a number of normal processes in the mammalian CNS, and are important targets for compounds for the treatment of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Activation of mGluRs is required for induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation and cerebellar long-term depression (Bashir et al., 1993, Nature, 363:347; Bortolotto et al., 1994, Nature, 368:740; Aiba et al., 1994, Cell, 79:365; Aiba et al., 1994, Cell, 79:377). A role for mGluR activation in nociception and analgesia also has been demonstrated (Meller et al., 1993, Neuroreport, 4: 879; Bordi & Ugolini, 1999, Brain Res., 871:223). In addition, mGluR activation has been suggested to play a modulatory role in a variety of other normal processes including synaptic transmission, neuronal development, apoptotic neuronal death, synaptic plasticity, spatial learning, olfactory memory, central control of cardiac activity, waking, motor control and control of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (Nakanishi, 1994, Neuron, 13:1031; Pin et al., 1995, Neuropharmacology, supra; Knopfel et al., 1995, J. Med. Chem., 38:1417).\n\n\nRecent advances in the elucidation of the neurophysiological roles of mGluRs have established these receptors as promising drug targets in the therapy of acute and chronic neurological and psychiatric disorders and chronic and acute pain disorders. Because of the physiological and pathophysiological significance of the mGluRs, there is a need for new drugs and compounds that can modulate mGluR function.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nWe have identified a class of compounds that modulate mGluR function.

All reported chemical shifts are in ppm on the delta-scale, and the fine splitting of the signals as appearing in the recordings (s: singlet, br s: broad singlet, d: doublet, t: triplet, q: quartet, m: multiplet).\n\n\nAnalytical in-line liquid chromatography separations followed by mass spectra detections, were recorded on a Waters LCMS consisting of an Alliance 2795 (LC) and a ZQ single quadrapole mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was equipped with an electrospray ion source operated in a positive and/or negative ion mode. The ion spray voltage was ±3 kV and the mass spectrometer was scanned from m/z 100-700 at a scan time of 0.8 s. To the column, X-Terra MS, Waters, C8, 2.1×50 mm, 3.5 mm, was applied a linear gradient from 5% to 100% acetonitrile in 10 mM ammonium acetate (aq.), or in 0.05 to 0.1% formic acid (aq.).\n\n\nPurification of products was done using Silicycle SilicaFlash Catridges (cat # FLH-R10030B) on an ISCO automated flash chromatography system, or by flash chromatography in silica-filled glass columns.\n\n\nMicrowave heating was performed in an Emrys Optimizer Single-mode microwave cavity producing continuous irradiation at 2450 MHz (Personal Chemistry AB, Uppsala, Sweden).\n\n\nLC-MS HPLC Conditions:\n\n\nMethod A: Column: Waters Acquity UPLC BEH-C18, 1.7 μm, 2.1 mm ID×50 mm Flow: 1.0 mL/min.

Where A=2% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid and B=2% water in acetonitrile with 0.05% formic acid. UV-DAD 210-400 nm.\n\n\nMethod B: Column: Agilent Zorbax SB-C8, 5 μm, 2.1 mm ID×50 mm Flow: 1.4 mL/min, Gradient: 95% A to 90% B over 3 minutes hold 1 minute ramp down to 95% A over 1 minute and hold 1 minute following a standard linear gradient. Where A=2% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid and B=2% water in acetonitrile with 0.05% formic acid.

Those of skill in the art will appreciate that other instruments and methods may be used to make the measurements or achieve the separations described.\n\n\nSynthetic Processes:\n\n\nScheme 1 illustrates a representative synthesis of a 6-substituted 4-bromo-2-bromomethyl-benzoic acid methyl ester from commercially available precursors wherein the respective reaction steps comprise as follows: (a) NaNO\n2\n, aq. HCl; (b) NaCN, CuCN and HCl; (c) NaOH; (d) nitrososulphuric acid; (e) MeI and K\n2\nCO\n3\n, and (f) NBS and (PhCO\n2\n)\n2\n. Briefly, a 4-bromo-aniline may be diazotized under Sandmeyer reaction conditions, followed by conversion to the nitrile using sodium cyanide and copper cyanide. The nitrile may then be hydrolyzed to an amide by basic hydrolysis. The amide can then be hydrolyzed with nitrososulphuric acid to provide a benzoic acid, which may be converted to a methyl ester under standard conditions. The benzylic methyl group may be monobrominated with N-bromosuccinimide using benzoyl peroxide as a radical initiator to yield a desired 6-substituted 4-bromo-2-bromomethyl-benzoic acid methyl ester.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 6-substituted 4-bromo-2-bromomethyl-benzoic acid methyl ester may be cyclized to an isoindolone with an amine, or a chiral amine if a chiral compound is desired, (g) CH\n3\nCHR\n2\nNH\n2\n, K\n2\nCO\n3\n, B(OH)\n3\n, as shown in Scheme 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA compound of Formula I (or Formula II) may be prepared from an isoindolone by a series of reactions steps as shown in Scheme 3, as follows: (h) Pd(BnCN)\n2\nCl\n2\n, TMS-≡, Cu(OAc)\n2\n, PPh\n3 \nin diisopropyl amine under gentle heating for 2 hrs; (i) KOH, EtOH/H\n2\nO, 1 Hr at RT; (j) ethyl 2-chloro-2-(hydroxyimino)acetate, KHCO\n3\n, EA/H\n2\nO, 16 Hr at RT and (k) NaOH, MeOH/H\n2\nO, 1 Hr at RT, followed by (1) IBCF, NMM, R\n3\nR\n4\nNH in THF at −20° C. Briefly, a 4-bromo-isoindolone may be reacted under Sonagashira conditions with a protected acetylene. Deprotection of the acetylene with base, followed by reaction with ethyl 2-chloro-2-(hydroxyimino)acetate will generate an isoxazole ester. Finally, hydrolysis of the ester to the acid and amidation using isobutylchloroformate, N-methyl morpholine and an appropriate amine, will generate a desired amide. Alternatively, an amide can be generated via an isoxazole ester directly by step (m) by reaction with an amine, R\n3\nR\n4\nNH in ethanol, and heating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n5-(7-chloro-2-((S)-1-cyclopropylethyl)-1-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindolin-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylisoxazole-3-carboxamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA solution of ethyl 5-(7-chloro-2-((S)-1-cyclopropylethyl)-1-oxoisoindolin-5-yl)isoxazole-3-carboxylate (29.59 g, 78.94 mmol) in ethanol (500 mL) was treated with a 33% solution of ethanolic dimethylamine (352 mL, 1973.6 mmol). The resulting light-green solution was gently warmed for approximately 3 hours, with sufficient heating to maintain a clear solution (approximately 50° C.). The reaction was cooled to room temperature and the volatiles removed under reduced pressure. The material was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel eluting with a gradient of 0 to 50% ethyl acetate in methylene chloride to afford the desired compound. The isolated product was then subjected to an additional purification step by crystallization in ethanol. The 5-(7-chloro-2-((S)-1-cyclopropylethyl)-1-oxoisoindolin-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylisoxazole-3-carboxamide (34.88 g, 93.30 mmol) was taken up in approximately 350 mL of ethanol and warmed to 70-80° C. until all of the product dissolved. The solution was quickly filtered through a medium glass frit, warmed back up to 70-80° C. and filtered through a paper filter (Whatman #1). The filtrate was heated again to 70-80° C. to assure a clear solution and allowed to slowly cool to room temperature (the final volume of solvent was 450 mL). After sitting overnight, fine crystals of the title product formed. The mixture was cooled in a refrigerator for an additional 2 hours. The crystals were isolated by filtration, washed with cold ethanol and dried under high vacuum at room temperature to afford white, small needle-like crystals (27.21 g, 78%).

To this solution was added ethyl 2-chloro-2-(hydroxyimino)acetate (66.9 g, 441.38 mmol). The ethyl 2-chloro-2-(hydroxyimino)acetate was added at room temperature as a solution in 160 mL of ethyl acetate via syringe pump at a rate of 5 mL/Hr.

The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include, but are not limited to, powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets, and suppositories.\n\n\nA solid carrier can be one or more substance, which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders or table disintegrating agents. A solid carrier can also be an encapsulating material.\n\n\nIn powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid, which is in a mixture with the finely divided compound active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.\n\n\nFor preparing suppository compositions, a low-melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides and cocoa butter is first melted and the active ingredient is dispersed therein by, for example, stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized moulds and allowed to cool and solidify.\n\n\nSuitable carriers include, but are not limited to, magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, lactose, sugar, pectin, dextrin, starch, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, low-melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like.\n\n\nThe term composition is also intended to include the formulation of the active component with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component (with or without other carriers) is surrounded by a carrier which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets are included.\n\n\nTablets, powders, cachets, and capsules can be made as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.\n\n\nLiquid form compositions include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. For example, sterile water or water propylene glycol solutions of the active compounds may be liquid preparations suitable for parenteral administration. Liquid compositions can also be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.\n\n\nAqueous solutions for oral administration can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavoring agents, stabilizers, and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water together with a viscous material such as natural synthetic gums, resins, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and other suspending agents known to the pharmaceutical formulation art. Exemplary compositions intended for oral use may contain one or more coloring, sweetening, flavoring and/or preservative agents.\n\n\nDepending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will include from about 0.05% w (percent by weight) to about 99% w, more particularly, from about 0.10% w to 50% w, of the compound of the invention, all percentages by weight being based on the total weight of the composition.\n\n\nA therapeutically effective amount for the practice of the present invention can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using known criteria including the age, weight and response of the individual patient, and interpreted within the context of the disease that is being treated or being prevented.\n\n\nMedical Uses\n\n\nCompounds described herein exhibit activity as modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptors and more particularly exhibit activity as potentiators of the mGluR2 receptor. It is contemplated that the compounds will be useful in therapy as pharmaceuticals, in particular for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with glutamate dysfunction in an animal and particularly in a human.\n\n\nMore specifically, the neurological and psychiatric disorders include, but are not limited to, disorders such as cerebral deficit subsequent to cardiac bypass surgery and grafting, stroke, cerebral ischemia, spinal cord trauma, head trauma, perinatal hypoxia, cardiac arrest, hypoglycemic neuronal damage, dementia (including AIDS-induced dementia), Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's Chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ocular damage, retinopathy, cognitive disorders, idiopathic and drug-induced Parkinson's disease, muscular spasms and disorders associated with muscular spasticity including tremors, epilepsy, convulsions, cerebral deficits secondary to prolonged status epilepticus, migraine (including migraine headache), urinary incontinence, substance tolerance, substance withdrawal (including, substances such as opiates, nicotine, tobacco products, alcohol, benzodiazepines, cocaine, sedatives, hypnotics, etc.), psychosis, schizophrenia, anxiety (including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)), mood disorders (including depression, mania, bipolar disorders), circadian rhythm disorders (including jet lag and shift work), trigeminal neuralgia, hearing loss, tinnitus, macular degeneration of the eye, emesis, brain edema, pain (including acute and chronic pain states, severe pain, intractable pain, neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and post-traumatic pain), tardive dyskinesia, sleep disorders (including narcolepsy), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and conduct disorder.\n\n\nThe invention thus provides a use of any of the compounds according to Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of any of the conditions discussed above.\n\n\nAdditionally, the invention provides a method for the treatment of a subject suffering from any of the conditions discussed above, whereby an effective amount of a compound according to Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, is administered to a patient in need of such treatment. The invention also provides a compound of Formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, as hereinbefore defined for use in therapy.\n\n\nIn the context of the present specification, the term “therapy” also includes “prophylaxis” unless there are specific indications to the contrary. The term “therapeutic” and “therapeutically” should be construed accordingly. The term “therapy” within the context of the present invention further encompasses the administration of an effective amount of a compound of the present invention, to mitigate either a pre-existing disease state, acute or chronic, or to mitigate a recurring condition. This definition also encompasses prophylactic therapies for prevention of recurring conditions and continued therapy for chronic disorders.\n\n\nIn use for therapy in a warm-blooded animal such as a human, the compounds of the present invention may be administered in the form of a conventional pharmaceutical composition by any route including orally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, topically, intranasally, intraperitoneally, intrathoracically, intravenously, epidurally, intrathecally, intracerebroventricularly and by injection into the joints. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the route of administration is oral, intravenous, or intramuscular.\n\n\nThe dosage will depend on the route of administration, the severity of the disease, age and weight of the patient and other factors normally considered by the attending physician, who determines the individual regimen and dosage level for a particular patient.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the compounds described herein may be provided or delivered in a form suitable for oral use, for example, in a tablet, lozenge, hard and soft capsule, aqueous solution, oily solution, emulsion, and suspension. Alternatively, the compounds may be formulated into a topical administration, for example, as a cream, ointment, gel, spray, or aqueous solution, oily solution, emulsion or suspension. The compounds described herein also may be provided in a form that is suitable for nasal administration, for example, as a nasal spray, nasal drops, or dry powder. The compounds can be administered to the vagina or rectum in the form of a suppository. The compounds described herein also may be administered parentally, for example, by intravenous, intravesicular, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injection or infusion. The compounds can be administered by insufflation (for example as a finely divided powder). The compounds may also be administered transdermally or sublingually.\n\n\nIn addition to their use in therapeutic medicine, the compounds of Formula I, or salts thereof, are useful as pharmacological tools in the development and standardization of in vitro and in vivo test systems for the evaluation of the effects of inhibitors of mGluR-related activity in laboratory animals as part of the search for new therapeutics agents. Such animals include, for example, cats, dogs, rabbits, monkeys, rats and mice.\n\n\nA compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof, or a

Neuroscience, 15:6103; Balazs, et al., 1997, J. Neurochemistry, 1997,69:151. The methodology described in these publications is incorporated herein by reference. Conveniently, the compounds of the invention can be studied by means of an assay that measures the mobilization of intracellular calcium, [Ca\n2+\n]\ni \nin cells expressing mGluR2.\n\n\nhERG activity was assessed using the process described by Bridgland-Taylor, M. H., et al, J. Pharm. Tox. Methods 54 (2006) 189-199.\n\n\nSolubility was determined in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer after equilibration for 24 h at 25° C. and HPLC-UV and LC-MSMS were used for quantitation.\n\n\nA [\n35\nS]-GTPγS binding assay was used to functionally assay mGluR2 receptor activation. The allosteric activator activity of compounds at the human mGluR2 receptor were measured using a [\n35\nS]-GTPγS binding assay with membranes prepared from CHO cells that stably express the human mGluR2. The assay is based upon the principle that agonists bind to G-protein coupled receptors to stimulate GDP-GTP exchange at the G-protein. Since [\n35\nS]-GTPγS is a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, it can be used to provide an index of GDP-GTP exchange and, thus, receptor activation. The GTPγS binding assay therefore provides a quantitative measure of receptor activation.\n\n\nMembranes were prepared from CHO cells stably transfected with human mGluR2. Membranes (30 μg protein) were incubated with test compound (3 nM to 300 μM) for 15 minutes at room temperature prior to the addition of 1 μM glutamate, and incubated for 30 min at 30° C. in 500 μl assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n), containing 30 μM GDP and 0.1 nM [\n35\nS]-GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol). Reactions were carried out in triplicate in 2 ml polypropylene 96-well plates. Reactions were terminated by vacuum filtration using a Packard 96-well harvester and Unifilter-96, GF/B filter microplates. The filter plates were washed 4×1.5 ml with ice-cold wash buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). The filter plates were dried and 35 μl of scintillation fluid (Microscint 20) was added to each well. The amount of radioactivity bound was determined by counting plates on the Packard TopCount. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism, and EC\n50 \nand E\nmax \nvalues (relative to the maximum glutamate effect) were calculated using non-linear regression.\n\n\nAs illustrated in Table 2, below, generally, compounds described herein have favourable solubility, low capacity to activate the hERG ion channel and were highly active in assays described herein for mGluR2 modulator activity, having EC\n50 \nvalues as shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHu GTPgS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nHu GTPgS\n\n\nMedian Top\n\n\nSolubility\n\n\nhERG Mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\nEffect (%)\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\nIC50 (M)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n64\n\n\n127\n\n\n33.4\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n600\n\n\n114\n\n\n6.82\n\n\n2.10E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n214\n\n\n117\n\n\n21.4\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n150\n\n\n130\n\n\n9.53\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n425\n\n\n67\n\n\n19.2\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n510\n\n\n110\n\n\n17.5\n\n\n2.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n230\n\n\n139\n\n\n16.6\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n115\n\n\n123\n\n\n31.1\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n37\n\n\n101\n\n\n3.57\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n618\n\n\n103\n\n\n54.1\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n66\n\n\n114\n\n\n4.35\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n36\n\n\n100\n\n\n11.2\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n479\n\n\n78\n\n\n153\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n60\n\n\n97\n\n\n3.53\n\n\n1.90E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n530\n\n\n100\n\n\n66.3\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n664\n\n\n79\n\n\n435\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n84\n\n\n139\n\n\n15.5\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n56\n\n\n109\n\n\n4.65\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n443\n\n\n141\n\n\n273\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n85\n\n\n122\n\n\n5.74\n\n\n>3.30E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n514\n\n\n106\n\n\n9.32\n\n\n>3.30E−05"
