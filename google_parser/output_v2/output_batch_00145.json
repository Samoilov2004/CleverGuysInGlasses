A method for enhancing cognition and memory in a patient in need thereof, which comprise providing to said patient a compound of formula (I): Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel aryl indolyl sulfonamide compounds of the formula (I), their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates described herein and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions containing them.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of above said novel compounds, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates described herein and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions containing them. This invention also relates to the process of their preparation. This invention also relates to the novel intermediates involved therein and process of their preparation. These compounds are useful in the treatment/prevention of various disorders that are related to 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor functions:\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nVarious central nervous system disorders such as anxiety, depression, motor disorders etc., are believed to involve a disturbance of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin. Serotonin is localized in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is known to affect many types of conditions including psychiatric disorders, motor activity, feeding behavior, sexual activity and neuroendocrine regulation among others. 5-HT receptor subtypes regulate the various effects of serotonin. Known 5-HT receptor family includes the 5-HT\n1 \nfamily (e.g. 5-HT\n1A\n), the 5-HT\n2 \nfamily (e.g.5-HT\n2A \n& 5-HT\n2C\n), 5-HT\n3\n, 5-HT\n4\n, 5-HT\n5\n, 5-HT\n6 \nand 5-HT\n7 \nsubtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor subtype was first cloned from rat tissue in 1993 (Monsma, F. J.; Shen, Y.; Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W., Sibley, D. R., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327) and subsequently from human tissue (Kohen, R.; Metcalf, M. A.; Khan, N.; Druck, T.; Huebner, K.; Sibley, D. R., Journal of Neurochemistry, 1996, 66, 47-56). The receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) positively coupled to adenylate cyclase (Ruat, M.; Traiffort, E.; Arrang, J -M.; Tardivel-Lacombe, L.; Diaz, L.; Leurs, R.; Schwartz, J -C., Biochemical Biophysical Research Communications, 1993, 193, 268-276). The receptor is found almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS) areas both in rats as well as in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn situ hybridization studies of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in rat brain using mRNA indicate principal localization in the areas of 5-1-IT projection including striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and hippocampal formation (Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W.; Lachowicz, J. E.; Hoffman, B. J.; Sibley, D. R.; Dorsa, D. M., Neuroscience, 1995, 64, 1105-1111). Highest levels of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor mRNA has been observed in the olfactory tubercle, the striatum, nucleus accumbens and dentate gyms as well as CA\n1\n, CA\n2 \nand CA\n3 \nregions of the hippocampus Lower levels of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor, mRNA-mere seen in the granular layer of the cerebellum, several diencephalic nuclei, amygdala and in the cortex. Northern blots have revealed that 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor mRNA appears to be exclusively present in the brain, with little evidence for its presence in peripheral tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSignificant, efforts are being made to understand the possible role of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in psychiatry, cognitive dysfunction, motor function and control, memory, mood and the like. The compounds which demonstrate a binding affinity for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor are earnestly sought both as an aid in the study of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor and as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of central nervous system disorders, for example see Reavill C. and Rogers D. C., Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2001, 2(1): 104-109, Pharma Press Ltd.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonsma F. J. et al. (1993) and Kohen, R. et al. (2001) have shown that several tricyclic antidepressant compounds, such as amitriptyline and atypical antidepressant compounds, such as mianserin have high affinity for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor. These findings have led to the hypothesis that the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor is, involved in the pathogenesis and/or treatment of affective disorders. Rodent models of anxiety-related behaviour yield conflicting results about the role of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in anxiety. Treatment with 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonists increases seizure threshold in a rat maximal electroconvulsive-shock test [Stean, T. et al. (1999) Anticonvulsant properties of the selective 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonist SB-271046 in the rat maximal electroshock seizure threshold test. Br. J. Pharmacol. 127, 131P; Routledge, C. et al. (2000) Characterization of SB-271046: a potent, selective and orally active 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonist. Br. J. Pharmacol. 130, 1606-1612]. Although this indicates that 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors might regulate seizure threshold, the effect is not as pronounced as that of known anticonvulsant drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOur understanding of the roles of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands is most advanced in two therapeutic indications in which this receptor is likely to have a major role: learning and memory deficits and abnormal feeding behaviour. The exact role of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor is yet to be established in other CNS indications such as anxiety; although one 5-HT\n6 \nagonist has reached Phase I clinical trials recently, the exact role of the receptor is still to be established and is the focus of significant investigation. There are many potential therapeutic uses for 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands in humans based on direct effects and on indications from available scientific studies. These studies include the localization of the receptor, the affinity of ligands with known in-vivo activity and various animal studies conducted so far. Preferably, antagonist compounds of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors are sought after as therapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne potential therapeutic use of modulators of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor functions is in the enhancement of cognition and memory in human diseases such as Alzheimer's. The high levels of receptor found in structures such as the forebrain, including the caudate/putamen, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and cortex suggests a role for the receptor in memory and cognition since these areas are known to play a vital role in memory (Gerard, C.; Martres, M. P.; Lefevre, K.; Miguel, M. C.; Verge, D.; Lanfumey, R.; Doucet, E.; Hamon, M.; E I Mestikawy, S., Brain Research, 1997, 746, 207-219). The ability of known 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands to enhance cholinergic transmission also supports the potential cognition use (Bentley, J. C.;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies have found that a known 5-HT\n6 \nselective antagonist significantly increased glutamate and aspartate levels in the frontal cortex without elevating levels of noradrenaline, dopamine or 5-HT. This selective elevation of certain neurochemicals is noted during memory and cognition, strongly suggests a role for 5-HT\n6 \nligands in cognition (Dawson, L. A.; Nguyen, H. Q.; Li, P. British. Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 130 (1), 23-26). Animal studies of memory and learning with a known selective 5-HT\n6 \nantagonist has some positive effects (Rogers, D. C.; Hatcher, P. D.; Hagan, J. J. Society of Neuroscience, Abstracts, 2000, 26, 680).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA related potential therapeutic use for 5-HT\n6 \nligands is in the treatment of attention deficit disorders (ADD, also known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD) in children as well as adults. As 5-HT\n6 \nantagonists appear to enhance the activity of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and ADHD has been linked to abnormalities in the caudate (Ernst, M; Zametkin, A. J.; Matochik, J. H.; Jons, P. A.; Cohen, R. M., Journal of Neuroscience, 1998, 18(15), 5901-5907), 5-HT\n6 \nantagonists may attenuate attention deficit disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt present, a few fully selective agonists are available. The Wyeth agonist WAY-181187 is currently in Phase I trials to target anxiety [Cole, D. C. et al. (2005) Discovery of a potent, selective and orally active 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor agonist, WAY-181187. 230th ACS Natl. Meet. (August 28-September 1, Washington D.C.), Abstract MEDI 17.]\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternational Patent Publication WO 03/066056 A1 reports that antagonism of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor could promote neuronal growth within the central nervous system of a mammal. Another International Patent Publication WO 03/065046 A2 discloses new variant of human 5-HT\n6\nreceptor and proposes that 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor is associated with numerous other disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEarly studies examining the affinity of various CNS ligands with known therapeutic utility or a strong structural resemblance to known drugs suggests a role for 5-HT\n6 \nligands in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. For example, clozapine (an effective clinical antipsychotic) has high affinity for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor subtype. Also, several clinical antidepressants have high affinity for the receptor as well and act as antagonists at this site (Branchek, T. A.; Blackburn, T. P., Annual Reviews in Pharmacology and Toxicology, 2000, 40, 319-334).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, recent in-vivo studies in rats indicate that 5-HT\n6 \nmodulators may be useful in the treatment of movement disorders including epilepsy (Stean, T.; Routledge; C.; Upton, N., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 127 Proc. Supplement-131 P; and Routledge, C.; Bromidge, S. M.; Moss, S. F.; Price, G. W.; Hirst, W.; Newman, H.; Riley, G.; Gager, T.; Stean, T.; Upton, N.; Clarke, S. E.; Brown, A. M.; British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 30 (7), 1606-1612).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together, the above studies strongly suggest that compounds which are 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor modulators, i.e. ligands, may be useful for therapeutic indications including, the treatment of diseases associated with a deficit in memory, cognition and learning such as Alzheimer's and attention deficit disorder; the treatment of personality disorders such as schizophrenia; the treatment of behavioral disorders, e.g. anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive, disorders; the treatment of motion or motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy; the treatment of diseases associated with neurodegeneration such as stroke or head trauma; or withdrawal from drug addiction including addiction to nicotine, alcohol and other substances of abuse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder. See for example, Roth, B. L.; et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 1994, 268, pages 1403-1412; Sibley, D. R.; et al., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the effect of 5-HT\n6 \nantagonist and 5-HT\n6 \nantisense oligonucleotides to reduce food intake in rats has been reported, thus potentially in treatment of obesity. See for example, Bentley, J. C.; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542); Wooley et al., Neuropharmacology, 2001, 41: 210-129, British Journal of Pharmacology (2006) 1-11, Petrus Johan Pauwels et al and WO 02/098878.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently a review by Holenz, Jo″rg et.al., Drug Discovery Today, 11, 7/8, April 2006, Medicinal chemistry strategies to 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands as potential cognitive enhancers and antiobesity agents, gives elaborate discussion on evolution of 5-HT\n6 \nligands. It had summarized pharmacological tools and preclinical candidates used in evaluation of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in illnesses such as schizophrenia, other dopamine-related disorders and depression and to profile the neurochemical and electrophysiological effects of either blockade or activation of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors. Furthermore, they have been used to characterize the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor and to investigate its distribution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSo far several clinical candidates form the part of indole-type structures and are closely related structurallyto the endogenous ligand 541T, for example compounds by Glennon, RIA. et.al., 2-Substituted tryptamines: agents with selectivity for 5-HT\n6 \nserotonin receptors, J.

J. Jr., et al., Molecular Cloning and Expression of Novel Serotonin Receptor with High Affinity for Tricyclic Psychotropic Drugs. Mol. Pharmacol. (43): 320-327 (1993).\n\n\n \nExample 59\n\n\n5-HT\n6 \nFunctional Assay Cyclic AMP\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antagonist property of the compounds at the human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors was determined by testing their effect on cAMP accumulation in stably transfected HEK293 cells. Binding of an agonist to the human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor will lead to an increase in adenyl cyclase activity. A compound that is an, agonist will show an increase in cAMP production and a compound that is an antagonist will block the agonist effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors were cloned and stably expressed in HEK293 cells. These cells were plated in 6 well plates in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 500 μg/mL G418 and incubated at 37° C. in a CO\n2 \nincubator. The cells were allowed to grow to about 70% confluence before initiation of the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the culture media was removed and the cells were washed once with serum free medium (SFM). Two mL of SFM+IBMX media was added and incubated at 37° C. for 10 minutes. The media were removed and fresh SFM+IBMX media containing various compounds and 1 serotonin (as antagonist) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes. Following incubation, the media were removed and the cells were washed once with 1 mL of PBS (phosphate buffered saline). Each well was treated with 1 mL cold 95% ethanol and 5 μM EDTA (2:1) at 4° C. for 1 hour. The cells were then scraped and transferred into Eppendorf tubes. The tubes, were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4° C. and the supernatants were stored at 4° C. until assayed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncAMP content was determined by EIA (enzyme-immunoassay) using the Amersham Biotrak cAMP EIA kit (Amersham RPN 225). The procedure used is as described for the kit. Briefly, cAMP is determined by the competition between unlabeled cAMP and a fixed quantity of peroxidase-labelled cAMP for the binding sites on anti-cAMP antibody. The antibody is immobilized onto polystyrene microtitre wells precoated with a second antibody. The reaction is started by adding 50 μl, peroxidase-labeled cAMP to the sample (100 μL) pre-incubated with the antiserum (100 mL) for 2 hours at 4° C. Following 1 hour incubation at 4° C., the unbound ligand is separated by a simple washing procedure. Then an enzyme substrate, trimethylbenzidine (1), is added and incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. The reaction is stopped by the addition of 100 mL 1.0 M sulphuric acid and the resultant color read by a microtitre plate spectrophotometer at 450 nm within 30 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the functional adenylyl cyclase assay, some of the compound of this invention was found to be a competitive antagonist with good selectivity over a number of other receptors including other serotonin receptors such as 5-HT\n1A \nand 5-HT\n7\n.\n\n\n \nExample 60\n\n\nRodent Pharmacokinetic Study\n\n\n \n \n \nMale wistar rats (230-280 grams) obtained from NIN (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as an experimental animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree to five animals were housed in each cage.

Animals were kept on 20% food deprivation before one day and given water ad libitum throughout the experiment and-maintained on a 12 hours light/dark cycle. Also the rats were habituated to individual arenas for 1 hour in the absence of any objects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne group of 12 rats received vehicle (1 mL/Kg) orally and another set of animals received compound of the formula (I) either orally or i.p., before one hour of the familiar (T1) and choice trial (T2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experiment was carried out in a 50×50×50 cm open field made up of acrylic. In the familiarilation phase, (T1), the rats were placed individually in the open field for 3 minutes, in which two identical objects (plastic bottles, 12.5 cm height×5.5 cm diameter) covered in yellow masking tape alone (a1 and a2) were positioned in two adjacent corners, 10 cm. from the walls. After 24 hours of the (T1) trial for long-term memory test, the same rats were placed in the same arena as they were, placed in T1 trial. Choice phase (T2) rats were allowed to explore the open field for 3 minutes in presence of one familiar object (a3) and one novel object (b) (Amber color glass'bottle, 12 cm high and 5 cm in diameter). Familiar objects presented similar textures, colors and sizes. During the T1 and T2 trial, explorations of each object (defined as sniffing, licking, chewing or having moving vibrissae whilst directing the nose towards the object at a distance of less than 1 cm) were recorded separately by stopwatch. Sitting on an object was not regarded as exploratory activity, however, it was rarely observed. T1 is the total time spent exploring the familiar objects (a1+a2). T2 is the total time spent exploring the familiar object and novel object (a3+b).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe object recognition test was performed as described by Ennaceur, A., Delacour, J., 1988, A new one-trial test for neurobiological studies of memory in rats—Behavioral data, Behay. Brain Res., 31, 47-59.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome representative compounds have shown positive effects indicating the increased novel object recognition viz; increased exploration time with novel object and higher discrimination index.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNORT\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDiscriminative Index\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n(DI) = Treatment (Vehicle)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\n\n\n10 mg/kg, p.o.\n\n\n30 mg/kg, p.o.\n\n\nInference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\n\n0.58 (0.45)\n\n\n—\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.\n\n\n0.57 (0.54)\n\n\n—\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23.\n\n\n—\n\n\n0.58 (0.49)\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35.\n\n\n—\n\n\n0.63 (0.49)\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 65\n\n\nWater Maze\n\n\n \n \n \nThe water maze apparatus consisted of a circular pool (1.8 m diameter, 0.6 m high) constructed in black Perspex (TSE systems, Germany) filled with water (24±2° C.) and positioned underneath a wide-angled video camera to track animal. The 10 cm\n2 \nperspex platform, lying 1 cm below the water surface, was placed in the centre of one of the four imaginary quadrants, which remained constant for all rats. The black Perspex used in the construction of the maze and platform offered no intramaze cues to guide escape behavior. By contrast, the training room offered several strong extramaze visual cues to aid the formation of the spatial map necessary for escape, learning. An automated tracking system, [Videomot 2 (5.51), TSE systems, Germany] was employed. This program analyzes video images acquired via a digital camera and an image acquisition board that determined path length, swim speed and the number of dutation of swim time spent in each quadrant of the water maze.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\n\n\nScopolamine Induced Reversal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.\n\n\n≧30 mg/kg, p.o\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.\n\n\n >30 mg/kg, p.o\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23.\n\n\n≧30 mg/kg, p.o\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35.\n\n\n >30 mg/kg, p.o\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 66\n\n\nChewing/Yawning/Stretching Induction by 5-HT\n6 \nR Antagonists\n\n\n \n \n \nMale Wister rats weighing 200-250 grams were used. Rats were given vehicle injections and placed in individual, transparent chambers for 1 hour each day for 2 days before the test day, to habituate them to the observation chambers and testing procedure. On the test day, rats were placed in the observation chambers immediately after drug administration and observed continuously for yawning, stretching, and chewing behaviors from 60 to 90 minutes after drug or vehicle injections. 60 minutes prior to the drug administration Physostigmine, 0.1 mg/kg i.p, was administered to all the animals. Average number of yawns, stretches and vacuous chewing movements during the 30 minutes observation period were recorded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference: (A) King M. V., Sleight A., J., Woolley M.

The training apparatus consisted of a chamber 300 mm in length, 260 mm wide, and 270 mm in height, constructed to established designs. The front and top were transparent, allowing the experimenter to observe the behavior of the animal inside the apparatus. The chamber was divided into two compartments, separated by a central shutter that contained a small opening 50 mm wide and 75 mm high set close to the front of the chamber. The smaller of the compartments measured 9 mm in width and contained a low-power (6V) illumination source. The larger compartment measured 210 mm in width and was not illuminated. The floor of this dark compartment consisted of a grid of 16 horizontal stainless-steel bars that were 5 mm in diameter and spaced 12.5 mm apart. A current generator supplied 0.75 mA to the grid floor, which was scrambled once every 0.5 seconds across the 16 bars. A resistance range of 40-60 micro ohms was calculated for a control group of rats and the apparatus was calibrated accordingly. An electronic circuit detecting the resistance of the animal ensured an accurate current delivery by automatic variation of the voltage with change in resistance.\n\n\n \nExperimental Procedure\n\n\n \n \n \nThis was carried out as described previously. Adult male Wister rats weighing 200-230 grams were used. Animals were brought to the laboratory 1 hour before the experiment. On the day of training, animals were placed facing the rear of the light compartment of the apparatus. The timer was started once the animal has completely turned to face the front of the chamber. Latency to enter the dark chamber was recorded (usually <20 seconds) and having completely entered the dark compartment an inescapable foot shock of 0.75 mA for 3 seconds was administered to the animal. Animals were then returned to their home cages. Between each training session, both compartments of the chamber were cleaned to remove any confounding olfactory cues. Recall of this inhibitory stimulus was evaluated 24 hours, 72 hours and on 7 day post-training by returning the animal into the light chamber and recording their latency to enter the dark chamber, a criterion time of 300 seconds was employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference: (A) Callahan P.
