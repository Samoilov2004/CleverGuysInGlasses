Priority is claimed to Japanese Application No. 2002-378729, filed Dec. 26, 2002. The entire contents of each of these applications is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a novel compound, which is a selective estrogen receptor modulator.\n\n\nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\nEstrogen is a “female hormone” whose various physiological activities have been described in a number of references (for instance, D. S. Loose-Mitchell and G. M. Stancel, \nGoodman and Gilman's, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics\n, 10\nth \nEd., J. G. Hardman and L. E. Limbird Eds, 2001, p. 1597-1634). In addition, estrogen regulates the development and function of the reproduction system, and affects a variety of physiological function (including maintenance of vaginal inner layer, retention of bone density and temperature regulation). In recent years, investigations showed that estrogen has a number of function other than physiological functions associated with female reproduction and genital tissue functions. On the other hand, in males, it is also known that estrogen is present in the body, and that the estrogen receptor is present in a variety of tissues (for instance, G. Lombardi et al., \nMol Cell Endocrinol, \n2001, Vol. 178 (1-2), p. 51-55). In addition, estrogen decreases low density lipoproteins (LDLs) and regulates the production of cholesterol in liver. Furthermore, estrogen is thought to be involved in decreasing the risk of manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, and to alleviate the manifestation thereof (for instance, V. W. Henderson, \nNeurology, \n1997, Vol. 48, (5 Suppl 7), S27-35).\n\n\nThus, estrogen is involved in a variety of functions in vivo, and when estrogen can no longer be produced, physiologically important alterations arise. Among others, estrogen production in healthy females is known to decrease sharply at menopause. Examples of effects of decrease in estrogen production include, in addition to the problems of urinary incontinence, vaginal dryness and decrease in skin tone, the problems of neurological symptoms, emotional instability and modulation of temperature regulation, as well as increase in blood lipid (leading to a large increase of the occurrence of cardiac diseases) and decrease in bone density (osteoporosis) and the like.\n\n\nFor example, in addition to urinary incontinence, vaginal dryness, increase in the rate of incidence of autoimmune diseases and loss of skin tone, problems related to the increase in the occurrence of autoimmune diseases, vasomotor complications (hot flashes), and neurological symptoms and the like, are symptoms which are associated with menopause, and are known to be alleviated or improved by estrogen replacement therapy.\n\n\nHowever, estrogen administration leads to the increase of serious dangers such as breast cancer and endometrial cancer as well as thrombus formation.\n\n\nA estrogen-dependent breast cancer is an example of pathological state associated with abnormal cell response to endogenous tissue estrogen. Estrogen-dependent tumor cells proliferate in the presence of estrogen. Current chemotherapies against these cancers largely rely on the use of anti-estrogen compounds, for instance, tamoxifen. Altough such estrogen agonists-antagonists have beneficial effects in the treatment of these cancers and are acceptable in situations where adverse events of estrogen is life-threatening, they are not ideal. For instance, these agents, due to the estrogen (agonist) characteristics that they have, sometimes exhibit estrogenic stimulation of a group of cancer cells present in the uterus. A better therapy to treat these cancers is an agent, which is an anti-estrogen compound whose estrogen agonist characteristics may be ignored against the proliferating tissue or is completely inexistent.\n\n\nAnother estrogen-dependent symptom is uterine fibrosis (uterine fibroid tumor disease). This uterine fibrosis is fundamentally a state where a deposition of fibroid tissue is present on the uterine wall. This state is responsible for dysmenorrhea and infecundity in females. Except for the suggested evidence of an inadequate response of the fibroid tissue to estrogen, the exact cause of this state is not well known. The most general treatment of uterine fibrosis include surgical operations, which is expensive and sometimes cause complications such as abdominal adhesion and infection and the like.\n\n\nIn addition, another estrogen-dependent disease is endometritis, a serious dysmenorrhea state accompanied by sharp pain and hemorrhage into the endometrial mass or peritonea, often leading to infecundity. The cause for the occurrence of this state is thought to be the growth of a heterotropic endometrium present in an inadequate tissue, which respond inadequately to a normally hormonal regulation.\n\n\nFor a long time, estrogen replacement therapy has been practised for a number of important health problems caused by the inability to produce estrogen; however, due to an increase in the adverse effects and risks thereof, the use thereof became limited.\n\n\nIn addition, in case of problems related to osteoporosis caused by estrogen being no longer produced, one of the most general types of osteoporosis is associated with menopause. Here, osteoporosis means a group of diseases resulting from various causes of disease, and is characterized by the net loss of bone mass. This loss of bone mass and the resulting fracture lead to weakening of the skeleton that sufficiently maintains the body in structural terms. The majority of females lose approximately 20% to approximately 60% of bone mass in the trabecular constituent portion of the bone within 3 to 6 years after missed menstruation. Osteoporosis is a general and serious illness for postmenopausal females. Osteoporosis induces psychological damages to patients and family members; in addition, due to the chronical nature of this disease, large economical losses are sustained, and wide-range and lengthy care (hospitalization and home care nursing) is required due to the aftereffects of this illness. An excellent method for treating osteoporosis is estrogen replacement therapy (for instance, R. L. Prince et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med., \n1991, Vol. 325, p. 1189-1195 and J. E. Compston, \nPhysiol Rev, \n2001, Vol. 81, p. 419-447). As mentioned above, estrogen therapy often provokes undesirable adverse effects, in particular in uterine and mammary tissues, the use of estrogen is limited, although this therapy has a therapeutic effect.\n\n\nFurther, in case of cardiovascular related problems, it has been long known that during the premenopausal period, the rate of incidence of cardiovascular illness for a majority of females is lower than males of the same age. However, at postmenopause, the rate of incidence of cardiovascular illness in females increases slowly in comparison to the proportion seen in males. This increase in rate of incidence is associated with a loss of estrogen, and particularly to a loss of estrogen that adjusts the serum lipid level. Postmenopausal females receiving estrogen replacement therapy have been reported to make their cardiovascular protection improve to a level that is equivalent to premenopausal state. Therefore, estrogen is thought to be a rational treatment for this state (for instance, M. E. Mendelsohn et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med., \n1999, Vol. 340, p. 1801-1811). However, the adverse effects of estrogen replacement therapy cannot be accepted by a number of females, such that the use of this therapy is limited.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Alzheimer's disease (hereinafter referred to as “AD”) is clinically a regressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the gradual loss of memory, recognition, deduction, judgement and emotional stability, provoking gradually remarkable psychological depression and ultimately leading to death. AD is a general cause of progressive psychological impairment (dementia) in the elderly, and in the U.S. it is believed to be the 4\nth \ngeneral medical cause of death. AD is observed in a variety of populations and ethnic groups in the world and represents a present and future major public health problem. The frequency of occurrence of this disease increases with age, and approximately 10% of the elderly population of 65 years and older is estimated to be affected (for instance, Evans et al., \nJ. Amer. Med. Assoc., \n1989, Vol. 262, p. 2551-2556). Thus far, AD has been shown to be incurable, and AD is expected to multiply in the world as human life span becomes longer.\n\n\nSeveral studies in human have shown that the use of estrogen prevented the decline of the recognition function, then led to recovery (for instance, B. B. Sherwin, \nPsychoneuroendocrinology, \n1988, Vol. 13, No. 4, p. 345-357 and T. Duka et al., \nPsychopharmacology, \n2000, Vol. 149, No. 2, p. 129-139). Several epidemiological studies reported that the use of estrogen also decreases the risk of AD episode (for instance, V. W. Henderson, \nNeurology, \n1997, Vol. 48, (5 Suppl 7), S27-35). In addition, estrogen appears to improve recognition function in AD patients (for instance, Ohkura et al., \nEndocrine J, \n1994, Vol. 41, p. 361-371 and V. W. Henderson, \nCNS Drugs, \n1997, Vol. 8, No. 5, p. 343-351). Further, estrogen is known to possess an action of protecting nerve cells, which are beneficial to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, and an action of activating neurotrophic factors. However, the use of estrogen is also associated with a number of disadvantageous adverse effects including the increase in the risk of breast cancer and uterine cancer. It is possible that estrogen agonists or antagonists, while maintaining a large number of estrogen actions, lack adverse effects on tissues such as mammary gland and uterus.\n\n\nThus far, the discovery that a number of agents worked as estrogen agonists on some tissues (for instance, bone) and as antagonists on other tissues (for instance, mammary gland) provided effective treatments for symptoms provoked by a decrease in estrogen or estrogen-dependent diseases. Best known among these so-called selective estrogen receptor modulators (hereinafter referred to as “SERM”), tamoxifen, that is 1-(4-β-dimethylaminoethoxyphenyl)-1,2-diphenylbut-1-ene, has been demonstrated to be therapeutically useful in the treatment and the prophylaxis of breast cancers, as well as in the decrease in LDL concentration. However, as tamoxifen simultaneously has an estrogenic stimulatory action on the uterus, it turned out to increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\n\n\nIn recent years, newer SERMs, for instance, raloxifene, that is 6-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-[4-(2-piperidinoethoxy)benzoyl]benz[b]thiophene, were reported to be, in regard to bone and lipid, similar to the desired action of estrogen, but in contrast to estrogen, uterine stimulation was minimal (for instance, \nScrip, \n1993, Apr. 16/20, No. 1812/13, p. 31 and \nBreast Cancer Research and Treatment, \n1987, Vol. 10, No. 1, p. 31-36).\n\n\nRaloxifene and related compounds are described as anti-estrogen substances and anti-androgen substances that are effective for the treatment of breast cancers and prostate cancers (for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 4,418,068 and \nJournal of Medicinal Chemistry, \n1984, Vol. 27, No. 8, p. 1057-1066).\n\n\nOther compounds such as those mentioned below are known as SERMs.\n\n\nDerivatives of 2-phenyl-3-aroylbenzothiophene and 2-phenyl-3-aroylbenzothiophene-1-oxide, which are useful as contraceptive drugs and useful in inhibiting the growth of breast cancers, have been disclosed (for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 4,133,814).\n\n\nAn estrogen antagonist represented by the following formula;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(wherein R\n2 \nrepresents phenyl or cyclopentyl and R\n3 \nrepresents H,\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor —CH\n2\nCHOHCH\n2\nOH) has been described (for instance, \nJournal of Medicinal Chemistry, \n1969, Vol. 12, No. 5, p. 881-885).\n\n\n\nPreparation of a series of tetrahydronaphthalenes intended to achieve the separation of estrogen activity, contraception activity, and hypocholesterolemia activity has been described. These structures are represented by the formula;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(wherein R\n1 \nrepresents H or OCH\n3\n; R\n2 \nrepresents H, OH, OCH\n3\n, OPO(OC2H\n5\n)\n2\n, OCH\n2\nCH\n2\nN(C2H\n5\n)\n2\n, OCH\n2\nCOOH or OCH(CH\n3\n)COOH) (for instance, \nJournal of Medicinal Chemistry, \n1967, Vol. 10, No. 2, p. 138-144).\n\n\n\nAn estrogen agonist and antagonist represented by the following formula;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nhave been disclosed (for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 6,204,286).\n\n\n\nA compound represented by the following formula;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(wherein R\n3 \nrepresents a lower alkyl, R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare selected from the group consisting of lower alkyls and 5 to 7 membered saturated heteocyclic ring formed by bonding lower alkyls to each other) has been disclosed (for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 3,274,213 and \nJournal of Medicinal Chemistry, \n1967, Vol. 10, No. 1, p. 78-84).\n\n\n\nAn estrogenic compound represented by the following formula;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nis disclosed (for instance, European patent application No. 802,183).\n\n\n\nHowever, so far, there may be the current situation that no therapeutic agent exists, which is effective against symptoms caused by a decrease in estrogen and a variety of estrogen-dependent diseases and symptoms, furthermore, against central nervous system diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, there is a need for development of a compound that selectively has the activity which is an estrogen receptor modulator, and the property which is satisfactory as a desired medicine.\n\n\nDISCLOSURE OF INVENTION\n\n\nThus, as a result of the earnest studies undertaken in view of the situation described above, the present inventors discovered a novel compound having the

The binding affinity measures the ability of the compound according to the present invention to remove [\n3\nH]-estradiol from estrogen receptor derived from bovine uterus. The following materials were used in this assay: (1) the assay buffer solution was 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM EDTA and 10% glycerol; (2) radioactive ligand was [\n3\nH]-estradiol purchased from Amersham Life Science; (3) the cold ligand was diethylstilbestrol purchased from sigma (Sigma); and (4) the estrogen receptor was derived from bovine uterus.\n\n\nThe compound to be tested was prepared as a 10% DMSO solution. [\n3\nH]-estradiol was dissolved in the assay buffer solution so as to obtain a final concentration of 1 nM. The estrogen receptor derived from bovine uterus was diluted with the assay buffer solution so that 10 to 20 μg total protein was present in each assay well. Using a small titration plate, in each assay well were added a solution (10 μl) of cold diethylstilbestrol (non-specific binding) or compound, [\n3\nH]-estradiol (10 μl) and a solution (80 μl) of estrogen receptor derived from bovine uterus. Each plate contains total binding, non-specific binding and the binding which were not inhibited by various concentrations of the compound. The plate was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, by adding 2% charcoal dextran (100 μl) to the assay buffer solution, mixing and incubating the solution at room temperature for 10 minutes, the binding reaction was terminated. These mixtures were centrifuged, and the supernatent thereof was evaluated for its radioactivity using a liquid scintillation counter. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting non-specific binding dpm (counts remaining in the supernatant obtained by centrifugal separation of a reaction mixture containing estrogen receptor derived from bovine uterus, radioactive ligand and excess cold ligand) from the total binding dpm (counts remaining in the supernatant obtained by centrifugal separation of a reaction mixture containing estrogen receptor derived from bovine uterus and radioactive ligand only). The effectiveness of the compound was evaluated by Ki. Ki was determined according to the following calculation formula: Ki=IC\n50\n/(1+(C/Kd)), wherein IC\n50 \n(concentration of the compound required to inhibit the total specific [\n3\nH]-estradiol binding by 50%) is a value obtained by measuring the specific binding in the presence of various concentrations of the compound, then calculating the percentage of binding relative to the total specific binding and producing a plot with the latter as the vertical axis and the compound concentration (log scale) as the horizontal axis. C is the concentration of [\n3\nH]-estradiol in the reaction mixture, and Kd is the [\n3\nH]-estradiol dissociation constant. The Kd was determined by Scatchard analysis. That is to say, various concentrations of [\n3\nH]-estradiol were used to measure the concentration of specifically bound [\n3\nH]-estradiol, which served as the horizontal axis, the value which was obtained by dividing the concentration of specifically bound [\n3\nH]-estradiol by the concentration [\n3\nH]-estradiol not bound to the receptor served as the vertical axis to produce a plot, and the negative value of the inverse of the slope of the resulting straight line was used as Kd.\n\n\nResults:\n\n\nTamoxifen, a well known selective estrogen receptor modulator, was used as a comparative example.

It shows that the higher the agonist activity, the less it is desirable in the reproduction system. On the other hand, the antagonist activity demonstrates that the compound is effective in the treatment of cancers whose growth is dependent on steroid hormones in particular breast cancers. The present test was carried out according to the following procedures. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were cultured in the preservation medium until the compound evaluation. The preservation medium is the MEM (minimum essential medium, phenol red-free, Gibco, ##51200-038) supplemented with 10% (volume/volume) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids (0.1 mM, Gibco, #15240-062), and antibiotic-antimycotic solution ( 1/50 of culture medium volume, Gibco). Five days prior to analysis, the preservation medium was exchanged with analytical medium to which 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (charcoal-FBS) was added instead of 10% FBS, so as to deprive the MCF-7 cells of endogenous steroids. Twenty-four hours after exchange to the analytical medium, the MCF-7 cells were removed from the preservation flask using cell isolation medium (trypsin-EDTA solution, Gibco). The cells were washed with analytical medium once, and cell suspension at 50,000 cell/ml was prepared using the analytical medium. The prepared cell suspension was added to a 96 well flat-bottomed microculture at 100 μl (5,000 cells) per well, the cells were cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 hours at 37° C., to equilibrate the cells after cell transfer. Serial dilution of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution of each drug was carried out using analytical medium to serve as a drug or diluent control, drug/DMSO solution was added to the microculture at 10 μl per well, then the analytical medium (10 μl) or 120 pM 17β-estradiol analytical medium solution (10 μl) was added for agonist activity assay or antagonist activity assay respectively so that the final volume of each well was set to 120 μl. The cells were further cultured in the 5% CO2 incubator for 72 hours at 37° C. After culturing, the cell growth was examined by the MTT assay. MTT assay was carried out as the following protocols. MTT solution at 8 mg/ml (MTT dissolved in phosphate saline water buffer) was added to the microculture at 10 μl/well, and the cells were cultured in the 5% CO2 incubator for 30 minutes at 37° C. Thereafter, resulting from the reduction of MTT by the cells, formazan crystals were dissolved by adding a dissolution buffer (400 g/l of an aqueous solution of SDS (50%) and dimethylformamide (50%)) to the microculture at 100 μl/well, and incubated the microculture for more than 4 hours in the dark. For each well of the microculture, the optical density at 590 nm due to the dissolved formazan crystals was measured.\n\n\nThe results of the evaluation of the compound according to the present invention by the above-mentioned test are shown below (Table 2). Identically to Test Example 1, tamoxifen, a well known selective estrogen receptor modulator, was used as the comparative example. The agonist activity is a value converted from the growth rate for 100 nM test compound, by taking the growth rate for the diluent control as 100, and the growth rate for 17β-estradiol (1 nM) as 200. The antagonist activity is a value obtained by measuring the concentration of test compound required to inhibit the growth by 50% (IC\n50\n) when culturing with 17β-estradiol (10 pM) and the test compound present simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAgonist activity:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ngrowth rate\n\n\nAntagonist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(100 nM test\n\n\nactivity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample No.\n\n\ncompound)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n190\n\n\n124\n\n\n7.95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n228\n\n\n101\n\n\n2.62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n255\n\n\n106\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n259\n\n\n103\n\n\n4.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n618\n\n\n96\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n736\n\n\n73\n\n\n0.74\n\n\n\n\n\n\n741\n\n\n98\n\n\n2.06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n814\n\n\n95\n\n\n3.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparative\n\n\n133\n\n\n86.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Example 3\n\n\nEffect of SERM Compounds on Bone Resorption in Ovariectomized Rats\n\n\nExperimental Method\n\n\nAnimals\n\n\nTen weeks old Female Fischer rats (F344/N, Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) were used.

The compounds in Examples 736 and 814, and Raloxifene were suspended in sesame oil to 5, 5 and 1.5 mg/mL, respectively. Samples were divided into aliquots for daily administration and preserved at −18° C. until use.\n\n\nAdministration:\n\n\nThe samples were orally administered at 2 mL/kg. Administration was carried out once a day from Monday to Friday for 8 weeks.\n\n\nThe measurement of deoxypyridinoline in urine:\n\n\nUrine was gathered overnight (17 hours) using the metabolic cage under fasting. The amount of urinary deoxypyridinoline was measured with ELISA kit, Osteorincs-DPD (Sumitomo Seiyaku Biomedical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and evaluated as total amount produced in 17 hours or as the amount per 1 mg of creatinine.\n\n\nThe measurement of bone density:\n\n\nAfter animals were sacrificed by decapitation, left femur and the fifth lumbar vertebrae were removed. The bone density was measured by using QDR-1000/W (Hologic Inc., Bedford, Mass.).\n\n\nThe measurement of uterus wet weight:\n\n\nAfter animals were sacrificed by decapitation, uterus was removed and adipose tissue and vagina was separated from uterus prior to uterus weight measurement.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe results are summarized in Table 3, the results show the following effects;\n\n\nThe effects on excretion of deoxypyridinoline in urine:\n\n\nExcretion of deoxypyridinoline in urinary was increased two-fold after ovariectomy over sham-operated rats. The compounds in Examples 736 and 814 significantly attenuated the excretion of deoxypyridinoline after 5 and 8 weeks administrations.\n\n\nThe effects on bone mineral density of femur and fifth lumbar vertebrae:\n\n\nEight weeks after ovariectomy, the bone mineral density of total femur, distal femur and fifth lumber vertebrae was decreased about 4, 5 and 10% compared with sham-operated rats, respectively. The compounds in Examples 736 and 814 preserved bone mineral density at the level in sham-operated rats.\n\n\nThe effects on uterus wet weight:\n\n\nAfter eight weeks administrations, the compound in Example 736 did not influence the wet weight of the uterus at all. On the other hand, both Raloxifene and the compound in Example 814 slightly increased uterus wet weight to the same level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of the effect of SERM compounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDose\n\n\nDeoxypyridinoline (nM/mg/dl)\n\n\nBone Mineral Density (g/cm\n2\n)\n\n\nUterus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\n(mg/kg)\n\n\n5 weeks\n\n\n8 weeks\n\n\nWhole femur\n\n\nDistal femur\n\n\nLumber 5\n\n\n(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSham\n\n\nVehicle\n\n\n—\n\n\n10.89 ± 1.51  \n\n\n10.55 ± 1.52  \n\n\n0.241 ± 0.003 \n\n\n0.254 ± 0.005  \n\n\n0.164 ± 0.003  \n\n\n0.285 ± 0.023  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX\n\n\nVehicle\n\n\n—\n\n\n17.49 ± 1.10## \n\n\n21.49 ± 1.68###\n\n\n0.231 ± 0.001# \n\n\n0.241 ± 0.002# \n\n\n0.149 ± 0.001## \n\n\n0.064 ± 0.003###\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX\n\n\nEstradiol\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n12.06 ± 1.60* \n\n\n11.61 ± 2.10** \n\n\n0.237 ± 0.001**\n\n\n0.250 ± 0.001** \n\n\n0.150 ± 0.005  \n\n\n0.213 ± 0.013***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX\n\n\nRaloxifene\n\n\n3\n\n\n 8.83 ± 0.41***\n\n\n10.87 ± 1.16***\n\n\n0.239 ± 0.002**\n\n\n0.254 ± 0.002***\n\n\n0.160 ± 0.003** \n\n\n0.098 ± 0.005***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX\n\n\nExample 736\n\n\n10\n\n\n10.48 ± 0.52***\n\n\n15.33 ± 0.78** \n\n\n0.241 ± 0.002**\n\n\n0.256 ± 0.002***\n\n\n0.156 ± 0.003* \n\n\n0.071 ± 0.004  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX\n\n\nExample 814\n\n\n10\n\n\n11.22 ± 1.12***\n\n\n15.48 ± 0.98* \n\n\n0.237 ± 0.002* \n\n\n0.248 ± 0.002* \n\n\n0.159 ± 0.001***\n\n\n0.107 ± 0.008** \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*p < 0.05;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**p < 0.01;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***p < 0.001 treatment group versus vehicle group in ovariectomized rats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#p < 0.05;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##p < 0.01;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###p < 0.001 vehicle group in ovariectomized rats versus sham-operated rats\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn = 7 for Sham and Vehicle Group,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn = 6 for treatment Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY\n\n\nFrom the above results, it was confirmed that the compound according to the present invention exhibits an affinity for estrogen receptor, and not has an undesirable effect in cells from the reproduction system.

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application No. 60/374,434 filed Apr. 19, 2002 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThis invention relates to compounds and pharmaceutical compositions that regulate TNF-alpha levels and activity and methods for using them. The invention also relates to kits comprising a compound or pharmaceutical composition of this invention and a tool for measuring TNF-alpha levels and/or activity.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nGenerally, the term tumor necrosis factor (TNF) refers to two closely related cytokines (encoded by separate genes) known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF, cachectin) and tumor necrosis factor-beta (lymphotoxin, TNF-beta). Both cytokines interact with the same cell membrane receptors, and both have been implicated as pathogenic mediators of human illness.\n\n\nTNF-alpha participates in the signaling pathways that regulate cell apoptosis and inflammation. TNF-alpha is also known as TNFSF2, TNFA and DIF. TNF-alpha is a pro-inflammatory mammalian protein capable of inducing cellular effects by virtue of its interaction with specific cellular receptors. It is produced primarily by activated monocytes and macrophages. Lipopoly-sacccharide (LPS, also called endotoxin), derived from the cell wall of gram negative bacteria, is a potent stimulator of TNF-alpha synthesis.\n\n\nDue to the deleterious effects which can result from an over-production or an unregulated production of TNF-alpha, considerable efforts have been made to regulate the tissue or serum level of TNF-alpha. The pathology of a number of diseases are affected by TNF-alpha, including, restinosis, inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, demyelinating diseases of the nervous system, multiple sclerosis, septic arthritis, aneurysmal aortic disease, traumatic joint injury, periodontal disease, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, occular inflammation, keratoconus, Sjogren's syndrome, corneal graft rejection, cachexia, and anorexia.\n\n\nWhile a number of inhibitors of TNF-alpha levels and activity have been reported, it is not clear whether they possess the appropriate pharmacological properties to be therapeutically useful. Therefore, there is a continued need for small molecule TNF-alpha inhibitors that are potent, stable, and have good penetration through membranes to provide effective inhibition of apoptosis in vivo. Such compounds would be extremely useful in treating the aforementioned disease states where TNF-alpha cytokines play a role.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to compounds that are potent inhibitors of TNF activity. In addition, these compounds are expected to have improved cell penetration and pharmacokinetic properties and, as a consequence of their potency, have improved efficacy against diseases where caspases and/or TNF-alpha are implicated.\n\n\nThe invention also relates to methods for inhibiting the release of TNF-alpha from various cells and decreasing TNF-alpha levels or activity using the compounds and compositions of this invention. The invention also relates to methods for identifying agents useful for decreasing TNF-alpha levels or activity and treating TNF-alpha mediated diseases. The invention additionally relates to kits comprising the compounds and compositions disclosed herein and a tool for measuring TNF-alpha levels or activity.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n depicts compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, which are depicted as a series of partial views extended over \nFIGS. 1\n (\na\n-\nf\n). \nFIGS. 1\n (\na\n-\nf\n), taken together in sequence, are intended to form one complete view of said compounds and pharmaceutical compositions, in which like reference characters and numbers therein refer to like parts throughout \nFIGS. 1\n (\na\n-\nf\n).

No. 10/127324.\n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThis invention provides compounds disclosed herein and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof that are particularly effective as regulators of TNF alpha levels and/or activity. The compounds can be useful to treat TNF-alpha mediated disease states in mammals. The compounds of this invention are recited in \nFIGS. 1-20\n.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention inhibit TNF-alpha activity and/or decrease TNF-alpha levels. These compounds can be assayed, for example, for their ability to inhibit the release of TNF-alpha, and/or regulate TNF-alpha levels and/or TNF-alpha activity. Assays for each of the activities are known in the art, including those described below in detail in the Examples. Accordingly, these compounds are capable of targeting and inhibiting events in TNF-alpha mediated diseases, and the ultimate activity of the relevant protein in a number of diseases, such as inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases, and degenerative diseases.\n\n\nCompounds of this invention also inhibit the release of TNF-alpha from activated cells. For example, cells activated to produce TNF-alpha due to the presence of lipopolysaccharide, bacteria and/or virus will release less TNF-alpha after exposure to the compounds of this invention.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions and methods of this invention, therefore, will be useful for controlling TNF-alpha levels and/or activity in vitro or in vivo. The compositions and methods of this invention will thus be useful for controlling TNF-alpha levels in vivo and for treating or reducing the advancement, severity or effects of TNF-alpha mediated conditions, including diseases, disorders or effects.\n\n\nAccording to another embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising a compound of this invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative (e.g., salt) thereof, as described above, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\nAccording to another embodiment, the compositions of this invention may further comprise another therapeutic agent. Such agents include, but are not limited to, a thrombolytic agent such as tissue plasminogen activator and streptokinase, an anti-inflammatory agent, a matrix metalloprotease inhibitor, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, a cytokine antagonist, an immunosuppressant, an anti-cancer agent, an anti-viral agent, a cytokine, a growth factor, an immunomodulator (e.g., bropirimine, anti-human alpha interferon antibody, IL-2, GM-CSF, methionine enkephalin, interferon alpha, diethyldithiocarbamate, tumor necrosis factor, naltrexone and rEPO), a prostaglandin, or an anti-vascular hyperproliferation compound.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a non-toxic carrier that may be administered to a patient, together with a compound of this invention, and which does not destroy the pharmacological activity thereof.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable carriers that may be used in these compositions include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat.\n\n\nIn pharmaceutical compositions comprising only a compound of this invention as the active component, methods for administering these compositions may additionally comprise the step of administering to the subject an additional agent. Such agents include, but are not limited to, a thrombolytic agent such as tissue plasminogen activator and streptokinase, an anti-inflammatory agent, a matrix metalloprotease inhibitor, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, a cytokine antagonist, an immunosuppressant, an anti-cancer agent, an anti-viral agent, a cytokine, a growth factor, an immunomodulator (e.g., bropirimine, anti-human alpha interferon antibody, IL-2, GM-CSF, methionine enkephalin, interferon alpha, diethyldithiocarbamate, tumor necrosis factor, naltrexone and rEPO), a prostaglandin, or an anti-vascular hyperproliferation compound. When a second agent is used, the second agent may be administered either as a separate dosage form or as part of a single dosage form with the compounds or compositions of this invention.\n\n\nThe amount of compound present in the above-described compositions should be sufficient to cause a detectable decrease in the severity of the disease, or in TNF-alpha levels or activity.\n\n\nIf pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention are utilized in these compositions, those salts are preferably derived from inorganic or organic acids and bases. Included among such acid salts are the following: acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzene sulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphor sulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenyl-propionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate and undecanoate. Base salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts, such as sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases, such as dicyclohexylamine salts, N-methyl-D-glucamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and so forth.\n\n\nAlso, the basic nitrogen-containing groups can be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates, such as dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; aralkyl halides, such as benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are thereby obtained.\n\n\nThe compounds utilized in the compositions and methods of this invention may also be modified by appending appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, or central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and/or alter rate of excretion.\n\n\nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the compositions of this invention are formulated for pharmaceutical administration to a subject, e.g., a mammal, preferably a human being.\n\n\nSuch pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. The term “parenteral” as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional and intracranial injection and infusion techniques. Preferably, the compositions are administered orally or intravenously.\n\n\nSterile injectable forms of the compositions of this invention may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension. These suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono-or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil and castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents which are commonly used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation.\n\n\nIf a solid carrier is used, the preparation can be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form, or in the form of a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier will vary, e.g., from about 25 mg to 400 mg. When a liquid carrier is used, the preparation can be, e.g., in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile injectable liquid such as an ampule or nonaqueous liquid suspension. Where the composition is in the form of a capsule, any routine encapsulation is suitable, for example, using the aforementioned carriers in a hard gelatin capsule shell.\n\n\nA syrup formulation can consist of a suspension or solution of the compound in a liquid carrier for example, ethanol, glycerin, or water with a flavoring or coloring agent. An aerosol preparation can consist of a solution or suspension of the compound in a liquid carrier such as water, ethanol or glycerin; whereas in a powder dry aerosol, the preparation can include e.g., a wetting agent.\n\n\nFormulations of the present invention comprise an active ingredient together with one or more acceptable carrier(s) thereof and optionally any other therapeutic ingredient(s). The carrier(s) should be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, and aqueous suspensions or solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers that are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried cornstarch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents may also be added.\n\n\nAlternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These can be prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be administered topically, especially when the target of treatment includes areas or organs readily accessible by topical application, including diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs.\n\n\nTopical application for the lower intestinal tract can be effected in a rectal suppository formulation (see above) or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches may also be used.\n\n\nFor topical applications, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one or more carriers. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or cream containing the active components suspended or dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, \npolysorbate\n 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.\n\n\nFor ophthalmic use, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated as micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with or without a preservative such as benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic uses, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art.\n\n\nIt will be recognized by one of skill in the art that the form and character of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent is dictated by the amount of active ingredient with which it is to be combined, the route of administration, and other well-known variables.\n\n\nThe above-described compounds and compositions are also useful in therapeutic applications relating to a TNF mediated disease. The phrase “TNF-alpha mediated disease” means, all diseases states in which TNF-alpha plays a role, either by excessive production or release of TNF-alpha itself, or by TNF-alpha causing an event such as production or release of another pathophysiological biochemical agent or cytokine. In one preferred embodiment, TNF-alpha plays a direct role in the disease.\n\n\nSuch diseases can include, e.g., restinosis, inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, demyelinating diseases of the nervous system, multiple sclerosis, septic arthritis, aneurysmal aortic disease, traumatic joint injury, peridontal disease, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, occular inflammation, keratoconus, Sjogren's syndrome, corneal graft rejection, cachexia, and anorexia.\n\n\nExcessive TNF-alpha tissue levels have been implicated in mediating or exacerbating a number of diseases including: rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions, general sepsis, gram-negative sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, toxic shock syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, asbestosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, bone resorption diseases, graft vs. host reactions, allograft rejections, fever and myalgias due to bacterial or viral infections, influenza, cachexia secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), keloid formation, scar tissue formation, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pyresis, a number of “autoimmune diseases”, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune diabetes, and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n\nTNF-alpha inhibitors are useful in the treatment of a variety of allergic, traumatic and other injurious disorders including: asthma, chronic bronchitis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, eosiniophilic granuloma, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, reperfusion injury of the myocardium and brain, chronic glomerulonephritis, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention can inhibit the release of TNF-alpha and thus can be useful for inhibiting or blocking several pathophysiological effects of TNF-alpha at injury or surgery sites and thus also inhibit the release of other pathophysiological biochemical products from cells such as histamines, prostaglandins, bradykinins, and peroxidases.\n\n\nAs discussed above, TNF-alpha inhibitors can be very effective in the treatment of disorders which follow cellular, tissue or organ injury or surgery, and can be as effective, or even more potent, than corticosteroids or immunosuppressants without producing the side effects common to these agents.\n\n\nThis invention also relates to a therapeutic method of (1) inhibiting TNF-alpha release from cells and/or (2) preventing the untoward, toxic or lethal effects of excessively high tissue levels of TNF-alpha in a mammal, including a human. This method comprises administering to a mammal an effective TNF-alpha inhibiting quantity of one or more of the above compounds. This method also can be used for the prophylactic treatment or prevention of certain TNF-alpha mediated or exacerbated diseases amenable thereto. The invention provides a method for the treatment of allergic, traumatic, radiation, chemical, microbial and other injurious disorders by administering to a mammal, including a human, in need thereof an effective amount of such compounds.\n\n\nThe compounds, by inhibiting or blocking the release of TNF-alpha or decreasing TNF-alpha levels and activity, as well as the pathophysiologic actions of excessive levels of TNF-alpha in each of these circumstances, directly facilitate the arrest or resolution of the tissue or organ damage, and facilitates the restoration of normal function. Together, these actions relate their novel use in treating tissue trauma, or other injury disorders caused by infection, allergy, immunologic phenomena, burns, radiation exposure, neoplastic disease, toxic chemicals and expressed as cardiovascular damage, neurologic injury, renal damage, liver damage, pancreatic damage, as well as ascites, localized edema, dermal damage and dermal blister.\n\n\nThe term “inhibiting the release of TNF-alpha”, means:\n\n \n \na) decrease of in vivo TNF-alpha levels in a mammal such as a human;\n \nb) a down regulation of TNF-alpha levels in vitro or in-vivo; or\n \nc) a down regulation of TNF-alpha activity, by inhibition of the direct synthesis of TNF-alpha or a post-translation event in vivo or in vitro.\n \n\n\nThe compounds can be useful in inhibiting the release of TNF-alpha by monocytes, macrophages, neuronal cells, endothelial cells, epidermal cells, mesenchymal cells (for example: fibroblasts, skeletal myocytes, smooth muscle myocytes, cardiac myocytes) and many other types of cells.\n\n\nThe term “condition” or “state” refers to any disease, disorder or effect that produces deleterious biological consequences in a subject.\n\n\nThe level of TNF-alpha protein in the blood or cell of a patient or a cell culture (i.e., within the cell or the cell culture media) can be determined by for example, assaying for immunospecific binding to TNF-alpha or to other proteins known to be produced as a result of the presence of active TNF-alpha. Such methods are known in the art. For example, immunoassays which can be used include, but are not limited to competitive and non-competitive assay systems, western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), “sandwich” immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays and FACS analysis with labeled antibodies. Such assays well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).\n\n\nCompetitive binding assays can also be used to determine the level of TNF-alpha. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled proteins from cells expressing TNF-alpha (e.g., \n3\nH or \n125\nI) with a TNF-alpha antibody in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled TNF-alpha, and the detection of the TNF-alpha antibody bound to the labeled TNF-alpha. The affinity of the antibody of interest for a particular antigen and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by Scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, the antigen is incubated with antibody of interest conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g., \n3\nH or \n125\nI) in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody.\n\n\nTNF-alpha levels can also be assayed by activity, for example, TNF-alpha levels can be assayed by a cell line that is capable of detecting bioactive levels of cytokines like TNF-alpha or a growth factor. According to one embodiment, the levels of bioactive TNF-alpha in a biological sample is detected by incubating a cell line genetically engineered with isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The cell line is incubated with the sample to be tested and cell death in the cell line is monitored by determining the intensity of blue color which is indicative of a bioactive cytokine or growth factor in the sample tested. See also, e.g., Burns (1994) 20(1):40-44 for TNF activity assay of serum of patients.\n\n\nA cytotoxicity assay can be used to e.g., determine TNF-alpha activity with actinomycin D-treated ME180 cells and L929 cells can be used in an assay described by Ostrove and Gifford (Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 160, 354-358 (1979)), Aggarwal and Essalu (J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10000-10007 (1987)) and Levesque et al. (J. Immun. Meth. 178, 71-76 (1995)). L929 cells (CCLI: American Type Culture Collection) are maintained in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Confluent cultures were treated briefly with 0.25% trypsin in physiological solution and resuspended in a fresh medium. The trypsinized cells per well are plated in 96-Well plates (Corning) and incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. Then actinomycin D was added to a final concentration of 0.25 ug/ml. Samples containing the compounds to be tested are added to the wells and incubation is continued overnight at the same temperature. After microscopic evaluation, the medium is decanted, and the wells are rinsed with PBS. The wells are then filled with a crystal violet dye solution. The dye is extracted and the absorbance of the dye retained in viable cells is determined at 570 nm.\n\n\nDosage levels of between about 0.01 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably between about 0.5 and about 75 mg/kg body weight per day and most preferably between about 1 and about 50 mg/kg body weight per day of the active ingredient compound are useful in a monotherapy.\n\n\nTypically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be administered from about 1 to 5 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. A typical preparation will contain from about 5% to about 95% active compound (w/w). Preferably, such preparations contain from about 20% to about 80% active compound.\n\n\nWhen the compositions of this invention comprise a combination of a compound of this invention and one or more additional therapeutic agents, both the compound and the additional agent should be present at dosage levels of between about 10% to about 80% of the dosage normally administered in a monotherapy regime.\n\n\nUpon improvement of a patient's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of this invention may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained. When the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level, treatment should cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence or disease symptoms.\n\n\nIt should also be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the judgment of the treating physician and the severity of the particular disease being treated. The amount of active ingredients will also depend upon the particular compound and other therapeutic agent, if present, in the composition.\n\n\nAccordingly, a method for treating or preventing a disease of this invention in a subject comprises the step of administering to the subject any compound, pharmaceutical composition, or combination described herein.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating a mammal, having one of the aforementioned diseases, comprising the step of administering to said mammal a pharmaceutically acceptable composition described above. In this embodiment, if the patient is also administered another therapeutic agent, it may be delivered together with the compound of this invention in a single dosage form, or, as a separate dosage form. When administered as a separate dosage form, the other therapeutic agent may be administered prior to, at the same time as, or following administration of a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a compound of this invention.\n\n\nA kit according to this invention comprises a compound or pharmaceutical composition of this invention and a tool for measuring TNF-alpha levels or activity in vitro or in vivo. The kit can further comprise instructions for using the contents of the kit. A tool for measuring TNF-alpha levels or activity according to this invention refers to materials that can be used to measure the TNF gene product (i.e., RNA or protein) or activity. Such methods are described for example above. Thus, a tool according to this invention can include, e.g., an anti-TNF antibody, a TNF-alpha DNA probe or a genetically engineered cell line responsive to TNF-alpha levels described above.\n\n\nThe methods for identifying a compound or composition that decreases TNF-alpha activity and/or levels according to this invention include methods for screening of a plurality of compounds or compositions for their ability to decrease TNF-alpha activity and/or levels. For example, high-throughput screening is a desired embodiment of this invention. According to one embodiment of this invention, high throughput screening can be achieved by having cells in culture in a plurality of wells in a microtiter plate, adding a different compound or composition to each well and comparing the TNF-alpha levels and/or activity in each cell culture to the TNF-alpha levels or activity present in a cell culture in a control well. Controls that are useful for the comparison step according to this invention include cells or subjects that have not been treated with a compound or composition and cells or subjects have been treated with a compound or composition that is known to have no effect on TNF-alpha levels or activity. According to one embodiment of this invention, the high throughput screening is automated so that the steps including the addition of the cells to the plate up to the data collection and analysis after addition of the compound or composition are done by machine. Instruments that are useful in the comparison step of this invention, e.g., instruments that can detect labeled objects (e.g., radiolabelled, fluorescent or colored objects) or objects that are themselves detectable, are commercially available and/or known in the art. Accordingly, compounds and compositions according to this invention that are useful for decreasing TNF-alpha levels and/or activity can be quickly and efficiently screened.\n\n\nAll applications, patents and references disclosed herein are incorporated by reference. In order that this invention be more fully understood, the following preparative and testing examples are set forth. These examples are for the purpose of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n[3S/R, (2S)]-5-Fluoro-4-oxo-3-{[1-(phenothiazine-10-carbonyl)piperidine-2-carbonyl]amino}-pentanoic acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod A\n\n\n(S)-(1-Phenothiazine-10-carbonyl)piperidine-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a stirred solution of methyl pipecolate hydrochloride (1 g, 5.57 mmol) in THF (10 ml) was added phenothiazine carbonyl chloride (1.457 g, 5.57 mmol) followed by diisopropylethylamine (2.02 ml, 11.68 mmol).

Blood was diluted 1:2 in PBS (tissue culture, pyrogen free) in a sterile bottle and inverted to mix well. Aliquots of 0.5 ml of blood mixture were dispensed into cluster tubes in 96 well format.\n\n\nDilutions of the test compounds were prepared in RPMI by taking 100 mM DMSO stocks of the compounds and diluting 1:10 in RPMI medium in eppendorfs, to give a 10 mM stock. 1:5 serial dilutions were prepared from the stock solutions.\n\n\nLPS was kept at a frozen stock (−20 degrees C.) at 1 mg/ml in PBS and then diluted to 1:10 with RPMI medium and finally diluted in the medium again 1:350. 50 μl of each test compound (first concentration was 100 uM) were added to the blood samples and then stimulated with 10 μl LPS (final concentration in the well is 5 ng/ml). The contents were gently mixed using an 8 well multi-channel pipette and incubated at 37° C. overnight. At the end of the incubation time, contents were gently mixed, then spun down at 1000×g for 5 mins at 20° C. The serum supernatants were transferred to a fresh plate without disturbing the RBCs and diluted 1:2 with the diluent RD6C.\n\n\nTNF-alpha levels of supernatants were assayed using the R+D systems ELISA kit, using R+D systems protocol. Samples were read at 450 nm. The compounds shown in Table 1 were tested in the above assay. In this TNF-alpha assay, category “A” indicates an IC50 value of <500 nM. Category “B” indicates an IC50 value of 500-1000 nM. Category “C” indicates an IC50 value of 1001-2000 nM. Category “D” indicates an IC50 value of >2000 nM.
