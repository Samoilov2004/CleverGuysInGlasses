FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds, compositions comprising an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound and methods to treat or prevent a condition, such as pain, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound.\n\n\n \n2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nChronic pain is a major contributor to disability and is the cause of much suffering. The successful treatment of severe and chronic pain is a primary goal of the physician, with opioid analgesics being preferred drugs for doing so.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUntil recently, there was evidence of three major classes of opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), with each class having subtype receptors. These receptor classes are known as μ, δ and κ. As opiates have a high affinity for these receptors while not being endogenous to the body, research followed in order to identify and isolate the endogenous ligands to these receptors. These ligands were identified as enkephalins, endorphins and dynorphins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent experimentation has led to the identification of a cDNA encoding an opioid receptor-like (ORL-1) receptor with a high degree of homology to the known receptor classes. The ORL-1 receptor was classified as an opioid receptor based only on structural grounds, as the receptor did not exhibit pharmacological homology. It was initially demonstrated that non-selective ligands having a high affinity for μ, δ\n0\n and κ receptors had low affinity for the ORL-1 receptor. This characteristic, along with the fact that an endogenous ligand had not yet been discovered, led to the term “orphan receptor”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubsequent research led to the isolation and structure of the endogenous ligand of the ORL-1 receptor (i.e. nociceptin). This ligand is a seventeen amino acid peptide structurally similar to members of the opioid peptide family.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe discovery of the ORL-1 receptor presents an opportunity in drug discovery for novel compounds that can be administered for pain management or other syndromes modulated by this receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe publications “From Hit to Lead: Combining Two Complementary Methods” and “From Hit to Lead: Analyzing Structure-Profile Relationships” of Poulain et al.

In another embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable derivative is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, e.g., of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable salt,” as used herein, is any pharmaceutically acceptable salt that can be prepared from a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound including a salt formed from an acid and a basic functional group, such as a nitrogen group, of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound. Illustrative salts include, but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucoronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., 1,1′-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” also includes a salt prepared from a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound having an acidic functional group, such as a carboxylic acid functional group, and a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic base. Suitable bases include, but are not limited to, hydroxides of alkali metals such as sodium, potassium, cesium, and lithium; hydroxides of alkaline earth metal such as calcium and magnesium; hydroxides of other metals, such as aluminum and zinc; ammonia and organic amines, such as unsubstituted or hydroxy-substituted mono-, di-, or trialkylamines; dicyclohexylamine; tributyl amine; pyridine; picoline; N-methyl, N-ethylamine; diethylamine; triethylamine; mono-, bis-, or tris-(2-hydroxy-(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl amines), such as mono-, bis-, or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, 2-hydroxy-tert-butylamine, or tris-(hydroxymethyl)methylamine, N,N-di-[(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl]-N-(hydroxy-(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl)-amines, such as N,N-dimethyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, or tri-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine; N-methyl-D-glucamine; and amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and the like. One skilled in the art will recognize that, e.g., acid addition salts of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be prepared by reaction of the compounds with the appropriate acid via a variety of known methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention disclosed herein is also meant to encompass all solvates of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds. “Solvates” are known in the art and are considered to be a combination, physical association and/or solvation of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound with a solvent molecule, e.g., a disolvate, monosolvate or hemisolvate when the solvent molecule:Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound molecule ratio is 2:1, 1:1 or 1:2, respectively. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances, the solvate can be isolated, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated into the crystal lattice of a crystalline solid. Thus, “solvate,” as used herein, encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of the invention can be present as a solvated form with a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as water, methanol, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention include both solvated and unsolvated Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound forms. As “hydrate” relates to a particular subgroup of solvates, i.e., where the solvent molecule is water, hydrates are included within the solvates of the invention. Preparation of solvates is known in the art. For example, M. Caira et al., \nJ. Pharmaceut. Sci., \n93(3):601-611 (2004), describes the preparation of solvates of fluconazole with ethyl acetate and with water. Similar preparations of solvates, hemisolvate, hydrates, and the like are described by E. C. van Tonder et al., \nAAPS Pharm. Sci. Tech., \n5(1):Article 12 (2004), and A. L. Bingham et al., \nChem. Commun., \n603-604 (2001). A typical, non-limiting, process involves dissolving the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound in a desired amount of the desired solvent (organic, water or mixtures thereof) at temperatures above about 20° C. to about 25° C., cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals, and isolating the crystals by known methods, e.g., filtration. Analytical techniques, for example, infrared spectroscopy, can be used to show the presence of the solvent in a crystal of the solvate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention disclosed herein is also meant to encompass all prodrugs of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds. “Prodrugs” are known in the art and, while not necessarily possessing any pharmaceutical activity as such, are considered to be any covalently bonded carrier(s) that releases the active parent drug in vivo. In general, such prodrugs will be a functional derivative of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of Formulas (I), (II), (III) and/or (W) which is readily convertible in vivo, e.g., by being metabolized, into the required Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of Formulas (I), (II), (III) and/or (IV). Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described in, for example, \nDesign of Prodrugs\n, H. Bundgaard ed., Elsevier (1985); “Drug and Enzyme Targeting, Part A,” K. Widder et al. eds., Vol. 112 in \nMethods in Enzymology\n, Academic Press (1985); Bundgaard, “Design and Application of Prodrugs,” Chapter 5 (pp. 113-191) in \nA Textbook of Drug Design and Development\n, P. Krogsgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard eds., Harwood Academic Publishers (1991); Bundgaard et al., \nAdv. Drug Delivery Revs. \n8:1-38 (1992); Bundgaard et al., \nJ. Pharmaceut. Sci. \n77:285 (1988); and Kakeya et al., \nChem. Pharm. Bull. \n32:692 (1984).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, one or more hydrogen, carbon or other atoms of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be replaced by an isotope of the hydrogen, carbon or other atoms. Such a “radiolabeled,” “radiolabeled form”, and the like of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound, each of which is encompassed by the invention, is useful as a research and/or diagnostic tool in metabolism pharmacokinetic studies and in binding assays. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, and \n36\nCl, respectively. Radiolabeled compounds of the invention can be prepared by methods known in the art. For example, tritiated compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared by introducing tritium into the particular compound of Formula (I), for example, by catalytic dehalogenation with tritium. This method can include reacting a suitably halogen-substituted precursor of a compound of Formula (I) with tritium gas in the presence of a suitable catalyst, for example, Pd/C, in the presence or absence of a base. Other suitable methods for preparing tritiated compounds can be found in Filer, \nIsotopes in the Physical and Biomedical Sciences, Vol. \n1\n, Labeled Compounds \n(\nPart A\n), Chapter 6 (1987). \n14\nC-labeled compounds can be prepared by employing starting materials having a \n14\nC carbon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms. The invention is also meant to encompass all such possible forms as well as their racemic and resolved forms or any mixture thereof. When a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound contains an olefinic double bond or other center of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended to include all “geometric isomers,” e.g., both E and Z geometric isomers. All “tautomers,” e.g., ketone-enol, amide-imidic acid, lactam-lactim, enamine-imine, amine-imine, and enamine-enimine tautomers, are intended to be encompassed by the invention as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “stereoisomer,” “stereoisomeric form”, and the like are general terms for all isomers of individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space.

In one embodiment, the Compound of Formula \nH1\n can be made by reacting a Compound of Formula \nA5\n with Lawesson's reagent in a nonpolar solvent such as THF or toluene at a temperature of about 100° C. for about 2-3 hours, as shown above.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound \nC1\n can be converted to compound \nA4\n using a catalyst, such as Raney nickel, in a suitable solvent, such as ethanol, under a hydrogen atmosphere.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound \nA5\n can be reacted with epichlorohydrin in the presence of a suitable base to provide compound \nJ1\n. Compound \nJ1\n can be reacted with a suitable amine, such as NH(R)\n2\n, in a suitable solvent to provide compound \nJ2\n.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe piperidine nitrogen of compound \nA2\n can be protected as, e.g., the trifluoroacetamide or carbobenzyloxy carbamate using trifluoroacetic anhydride or benzychloroformate, respectively, in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane in the presence of an organic base such as triethylamine to provide compound \nK1\n. Compound \nK1\n can be reductively aminated with a substituted or unsubstituted 1,2-phenylenediamine using sodium triacetoxyborohydride in a solvent such as dichloromethane in the presence of acetic acid to provide compound \nK1\n. Compound \nK2\n can be cyclized with a cyclizing reagent, such as a di-acid chloride, e.g., oxalyl dichloride or malonyl dichloride, to provide compound \nK3\n. The protecting group (such as —C(O)R illustrated above) can be removed under standard conditions (see, e.g., “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis,” T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 3\nrd \nEd., New York (1999), pp. 531-535, 556-557) to provide compound \nK4\n.

Substituted pyridine compound \nL1\n can be treated with di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate and 4-dimethylamino pyridine in a suitable solvent to provide a di-BOC protected intermediate. The intermediate can be treated with potassium carbonate to provide the mono-BOC protected intermediate which can be converted to compound \nL2\n by hydrogenating using Raney nickel or other standard conditions (using palladium on carbon or the like). Compound \nL2\n can be reductively aminated with a suitably functionalized 4-piperidone (containing a Z—R\n1 \ngroup on the piperidine nitrogen and substituents A and B) using sodium triacetoxyborohydride and an acid such as acetic acid in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane to provide compound \nL3\n.

As described in Scheme D, compound \nM2\n can be converted to compound \nM3\n using ethoxycarbonyl isocyanate in a microwave reactor. Alternatively, compound \nA4\n can be reacted with a cyclizing reagent, such as ethyl 2-chloro-2-oxoacetate or ethyl 3-chloro-3-oxopropanoate, and a base such as triethylamine in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane to provide compound \nM4\n. Compound \nM4\n can be converted to compound \nA5\n using an alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium ethoxide in a suitable solvent such as ethanol.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound \nN1\n can be converted to compound \nN2\n using lithium diisopropylamide in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran followed by treatment with a D having a leaving group substituent, e.g., iodomethane. Compound \nN2\n can be converted to compound \nN3\n in a two step procedure. First, the ester can be hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid using an aqueous base such as sodium hydroxide. This can be followed by treatment with diphenylphosphoryl azide and benzyl alcohol under Curtius rearrangement conditions. The benzyloxycarbonyl group of compound \nN3\n can be removed under hydrogenolysis conditions, e.g., using palladium on charcoal, to provide compound \nN4\n. Compound \nN4\n can be converted to compound \nN5\n by reaction with a substituted or unsubstituted 2-halo-1-nitrobenzene, such substituted or unsubstituted as 2-fluoro-1-nitrobenzene, in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile. Compound \nN5\n can be converted to compound \nN6\n in a two step procedure. First, reduction of the nitro group can be carried out by hydrogenation using a metal catalyst such as Raney nickel in a suitable solvent such as ethanol. This can be followed by reaction with a cyclizing reagent, such as ethyl 2-chloro-2-oxoacetate or ethyl 3-chloro-3-oxopropanoate, and a base such as triethylamine and a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane. Compound \nN6\n can be converted to compound \nN7\n using an alkali metal alkoxide, such as sodium ethoxide, in a suitable solvent, such as ethanol, followed by removal of the protecting group R under standard conditions.

Hartwig, \nTetrahedron Lett. \n36(21):3609-3612 (1995).\n\n\n \n4.7 Therapeutic Uses of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the invention, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are administered to an animal in need of treatment or prevention of a Condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be used to treat or prevent any condition treatable or preventable by inhibiting the activity of the ORL-1 receptor. Examples of conditions that are treatable or preventable by inhibiting the activity of the ORL-1 receptor include, but are not limited to, pain (CNS effect), memory disorders, obesity, constipation, depression, dementia, and Parkinsonism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be used to treat or prevent any condition treatable or preventable by activating the ORL-1 receptor. Examples of conditions that are treatable or preventable by activating the ORL-1 receptor include, but are not limited to, pain (PNS effect), anxiety, cough, diarrhea, blood pressure disorder (via vasodilation and via diuresis), epilepsy, anorexia/cachexia, urinary incontinence, and drug abuse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds can be used to treat or prevent acute or chronic pain. Examples of pain that can be treated or prevented using a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound include, but are not limited to, cancer pain, neuropathic pain, labor pain, myocardial infarction pain, pancreatic pain, colic pain, post-operative pain, headache pain, muscle pain, arthritic pain, and pain associated with a periodontal disease, including gingivitis and periodontitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds can also be used to treat or prevent pain associated with inflammation or with an inflammatory disease in an animal. Such pain can arise where there is an inflammation of the body tissue which can be a local inflammatory response or a systemic inflammation. For example, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be used to treat or prevent pain associated with inflammatory diseases including, but not limited to, organ transplant rejection; reoxygenation injury resulting from organ transplantation (see Grupp et al., \nJ. Mol, Cell Cardiol. \n31:297-303 (1999)) including, but not limited to, transplantation of the heart, lung, liver, or kidney; chronic inflammatory diseases of the joints, including arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and bone diseases associated with increased bone resorption; inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ileitis, ulcerative colitis, Barrett's syndrome, and Crohn's disease; inflammatory lung diseases, such as asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and chronic obstructive airway disease; inflammatory diseases of the eye, including corneal dystrophy, trachoma, onchocerciasis, uveitis, sympathetic ophthalmitis and endophthalmitis; chronic inflammatory disease of the gum, including gingivitis and periodontitis; tuberculosis; leprosy; inflammatory diseases of the kidney, including uremic complications, glomerulonephritis and nephrosis; inflammatory disease of the skin, including sclerodermatitis, psoriasis and eczema; inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, including chronic demyelinating diseases of the nervous system, multiple sclerosis, AIDS-related neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease, infectious meningitis, encephalomyelitis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and viral or autoimmune encephalitis; autoimmune diseases, including Type I and Type II diabetes mellitus; diabetic complications, including, but not limited to, diabetic cataract, glaucoma, retinopathy, nephropathy (such as microaluminuria and progressive diabetic nephropathy), gangrene of the feet, atherosclerotic coronary arterial disease, peripheral arterial disease, nonketotic hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar coma, foot ulcers, joint problems, and a skin or mucous membrane complication (such as an infection, a shin spot, a candidal infection or necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum), immune-complex vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); inflammatory disease of the heart, such as cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease hypercholesterolemia, and artherosclerosis; as well as various other diseases that can have significant inflammatory components, including preeclampsia, chronic liver failure, brain and spinal cord trauma, and cancer. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can also be used to treat or prevent pain associated with inflammatory disease that can, for example, be a systemic inflammation of the body, exemplified by gram-positive or gram negative shock, hemorrhagic or anaphylactic shock, or shock induced by cancer chemotherapy in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., shock associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Such shock can be induced, e.g., by a chemotherapeutic agent that is administered as a treatment for cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds can also be used to treat or prevent pain associated with nerve injury (i.e., neuropathic pain). Chronic neuropathic pain is a heterogenous disease state with an unclear etiology. In chronic neuropathic pain, the pain can be mediated by multiple mechanisms. This type of pain generally arises from injury to the peripheral or central nervous tissue. The syndromes include pain associated with spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, phantom pain, causalgia, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy and lower back pain. The chronic pain is different from acute pain in that chronic neuropathic pain patients suffer the abnormal pain sensations that can be described as spontaneous pain, continuous superficial burning and/or deep aching pain. The pain can be evoked by heat-, cold-, and mechano-hyperalgesia, or by heat-, cold-, or mechano-allodynia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChronic neuropathic pain can be caused by injury or infection of peripheral sensory nerves. It includes, but is not limited to, pain from peripheral nerve trauma, herpes virus infection, diabetes mellitus, causalgia, plexus avulsion, neuroma, limb amputation, and vasculitis. Neuropathic pain can also be caused by nerve damage from chronic alcoholism, human immunodeficiency virus infection, hypothyroidism, uremia, or vitamin deficiencies. Stroke (spinal or brain) and spinal cord injury can also induce neuropathic pain. Cancer-related neuropathic pain results from tumor growth compression of adjacent nerves, brain, or spinal cord. In addition, cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can cause nerve injury. Neuropathic pain includes but is not limited to pain caused by nerve injury such as, for example, the pain from which diabetics suffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds can be used to treat or prevent a migraine including, but not limited to, migraine without aura (“common migraine”), migraine with aura (“classic migraine”), migraine without headache, basilar migraine, familial hemiplegic migraine, migrainous infarction, and migraine with prolonged aura.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, some of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are agonists at the ORL-1 receptor, and some of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are antagonists at the ORL-1 receptor. In another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is an agonist at the ORL-1 receptor and an agonist at a μ, κ and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a μ opioid receptor. In another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is an antagonist at the ORL-1 receptor and an agonist at a μ, κ and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a μ opioid receptor. In another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is an agonist at the ORL-1 receptor and an antagonist at a μ, κ and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a μ opioid receptor. In another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is an antagonist at the ORL-1 receptor and an antagonist at a μ, κ and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a μ opioid receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides methods for inhibiting ORL-1 receptor function in a cell, comprising contacting a cell capable of expressing the ORL-1 receptor with an amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound effective to inhibit ORL-1 receptor function in the cell. This method can be adapted for use in vitro as part of an assay to select compounds that may be useful for treating or preventing a Condition in an animal. Alternatively, this method can be adapted for use in vivo, (i.e., in an animal such as a human) by contacting a cell in the animal with an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound. In one embodiment, the method is useful for treating or preventing pain in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention. In another embodiment, the method is useful for treating or preventing a memory disorder, obesity, constipation, depression, dementia, or Parkinsonism in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to methods for activating ORL-1 receptor function in a cell, comprising contacting a cell capable of expressing the ORL-1 receptor with an amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound effective to activate ORL-1 receptor function in the cell. This method can be adapted for use in vitro as part of an assay to select compounds useful for treating or preventing, pain, anxiety, cough, diarrhea, high blood pressure, epilepsy, anorexia/cachexia, urinary incontinence, or drug abuse. Alternatively, the method can be adapted for use in vivo (i.e., in an animal such as a human), by contacting a cell in the animal with an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine compound. In one embodiment the method is useful for treating or preventing pain in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention. In another embodiment, the method is useful for treating or preventing anxiety, cough, diarrhea, high blood pressure, epilepsy, anorexia/cachexia, urinary incontinence, or drug abuse in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of tissue comprising cells capable of expressing the ORL-1 receptor include but are not limited to brain, spinal cord, vas deferens, and gastrointestinal tract tissue. Methods for assaying cells that express the ORL-1 receptor are known in the art; for example, see Y. Shimohigashi et al., “Sensitivity of opioid receptor-like receptor ORL1 for chemical modification on nociceptin, a naturally occurring nociceptive peptide,” \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n271(39):23642-23645 (1996); M. Narita et al., “Identification of the G-protein coupled ORL1 receptor in the mouse spinal cord by [\n35\nS]-GTPγS binding and immunohistochemistry,” \nBrit. J. Pharmacol. \n128:1300-1306 (1999); G. Milligan, “Principles: Extending then utility of [\n35\nS]GTPγS binding assays,” \nTIPS \n14:110-112 (2003); and S. Lazareno, “Measurement of agonist-stimulated [\n35\nS]GTPγS binding to cell membranes,” \nMethods in Molecular Biology \n106:231-245 (1999).\n\n\n \n4.8 Therapeutic/Prophylactic Administration and Compositions of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nDue to their activity, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are advantageously useful in human and veterinary medicine. As described above, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are useful for treating or preventing a Condition in an animal in need thereof. The Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds of the invention can be administered to any animal requiring modulation of the opioid and/or ORL-1 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen administered to an animal, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be administered as a component of a composition that comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The invention compositions, which comprise a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound, can be administered orally. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can also be administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral, rectal, and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and can be administered together with a second therapeutically active agent. Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, multiparticulates, capsules, etc., and can be used to administer a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of administration include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, parenteral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectal, by inhalation, or topical, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The method of administration is left to the discretion of the practitioner. In most instances, administration will result in the release of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound into the bloodstream.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn specific embodiments, it can be desirable to administer a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound locally. This can be achieved, for example and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository or enema, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, it can be desirable to introduce a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound into the central nervous system or gastrointestinal tract by any suitable route, including intraventricular, intrathecal, and epidural injection, and enema. Intraventricular injection can be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent, or via perfusion in a fluorocarbon or synthetic pulmonary surfactant. In certain embodiments, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and excipients such as triglycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of the invention is incorporated for parenteral administration by injection (e.g., continuous infusion or bolus injection), the formulation for parenteral administration can be in the form of a suspension, solution, emulsion in an oily or aqueous vehicle, and such formulations can further comprise pharmaceutically necessary additives such as one or more stabilizing agents, suspending agents, dispersing agents, and the like. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of the invention can also be in the form of a powder for reconstitution as an injectable formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, \nScience \n249:1527-1533 (1990); and Treat et al., \nLiposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer \n317-327 and 353-365 (1989)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be delivered in a controlled-release system or sustained-release system (see, e.g., Goodson, “Dental Applications” (pp. 115-138) in \nMedical Applications of Controlled Release, Vol. \n2\n, Applications and Evaluation\n, R. S. Langer and D. L. Wise eds., CRC Press (1984)). Other controlled- or sustained-release systems discussed in the review by Langer, \nScience \n249:1527-1533 (1990) can be used. In one embodiment, a pump can be used (Langer, \nScience \n249:1527-1533 (1990); Sefton, \nCRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. \n14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., \nSurgery \n88:507 (1980); and Saudek et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see \nMedical Applications of Controlled Release \n(Langer and Wise eds., 1974); \nControlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance \n(Smolen and Ball eds., 1984); Ranger and Peppas, \nJ. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. \n23:61 (1983); Levy et al., \nScience \n228:190 (1985); During et al., \nAnn. Neurol. \n25:351 (1989); and Howard et al., \nJ. Neurosurg. \n71:105 (1989)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release system can be placed in proximity of a target of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound, e.g., the spinal column, brain, or gastrointestinal tract, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention compositions can optionally comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient so as to provide the form for proper administration to the animal. Such a pharmaceutical excipient can be a diluent, suspending agent, solubilizer, binder, disintegrant, preservative, coloring agent, lubricant, and the like. The pharmaceutical excipient can be a liquid, such as water or an oil, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. The pharmaceutical excipient can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating, and coloring agents can be used. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is sterile when administered to an animal. Water is a particularly useful excipient when a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid excipients, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients also include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The invention compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. Specific examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients that can be used to formulate oral dosage forms are described in the \nHandbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients\n, American Pharmaceutical Association (1986).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the composition is in the form of a capsule (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical excipients are described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., 19th ed. 1995), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a composition adapted for oral administration to human beings. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound to be orally delivered can be in the form of tablets, capsules, gelcaps, caplets, lozenges, aqueous or oily solutions, suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, for example. When a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is incorporated into oral tablets, such tablets can be compressed, tablet triturates, enteric-coated, sugar-coated, film-coated, multiply compressed or multiply layered. Techniques and compositions for making solid oral dosage forms are described in \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets \n(Lieberman, Lachman and Schwartz, eds., 2nd ed.) published by Marcel Dekker, Inc. Techniques and compositions for making tablets (compressed and molded), capsules (hard and soft gelatin) and pills are also described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n1553-1593 (Arthur Osol, ed., 16\nth \ned., Mack Publishing, Easton, Pa. 1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid oral dosage forms include aqueous and nonaqueous solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and solutions and/or suspensions reconstituted from non-effervescent granules, optionally containing one or more suitable solvents, preservatives, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, diluents, sweeteners, coloring agents, flavoring agents, and the like. Techniques and composition for making liquid oral dosage forms are described in \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems\n, (Lieberman, Rieger and Banker, eds.) published by Marcel Dekker, Inc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is to be injected parenterally, it can be, e.g., in the form of an isotonic sterile solution. Alternatively, when a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is to be inhaled, it can be formulated into a dry aerosol or can be formulated into an aqueous or partially aqueous solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn orally administered Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can contain one or more agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In these latter platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time-delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate can also be used. Oral compositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate. In one embodiment, the excipients are of pharmaceutical grade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds can be formulated for intravenous administration. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration comprise sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions can also include a solubilizing agent. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound for intravenous administration can optionally include a local anesthetic such as benzocaine or prilocalne to lessen pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is administered by injection, an ampule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be administered by controlled-release or sustained-release means or by delivery devices that are known to those in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; and 5,733,566, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide controlled- or sustained-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, multiparticulates, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled- or sustained-release formulations known to those in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active ingredients of the invention. The invention thus encompasses single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled- or sustained-release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControlled- or sustained-release pharmaceutical compositions can have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled or non-sustained-release counterparts. In one embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release composition comprises a minimal amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound to treat or prevent the Condition or a symptom thereof in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled- or sustained-release compositions include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased compliance. In addition, controlled- or sustained-release compositions can favorably affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound, and can thus reduce the occurrence of adverse side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControlled- or sustained-release compositions can initially release an amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound that promptly produces the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, and gradually and continually release other amounts of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. To maintain a constant level of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound in the body, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled- or sustained-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions, including but not limited to, changes in pH, changes in temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or availability of water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound that is effective for the treatment or prevention of a condition can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro and/or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed will also depend on, e.g., the route of administration and the seriousness of the Condition, and can be decided according to the judgment of a practitioner and/or each animal's circumstances. In other examples thereof, variations will necessarily occur depending upon the weight and physical condition (e.g., hepatic and renal function) of the animal being treated, the affliction to be treated, the severity of the symptoms, the frequency of the dosage interval, the presence of any deleterious side-effects, and the particular compound utilized, among other things.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable effective dosage amounts, however, range from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 3000 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day, although they are typically from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 2500 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day or from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 1000 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day. In one embodiment, the effective dosage amount is about 100 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day or less.

In one embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 24 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 12 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 8 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 6 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 4 h until the Condition is abated. The effective dosage amounts described herein refer to total amounts administered; that is, if more than one Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is administered, the effective dosage amounts correspond to the total amount administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere a cell capable of expressing the ORL-1 receptor is contacted with a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound in vitro, the amount effective for inhibiting or activating the ORL-1 receptor function in a cell will typically range from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−4 \nmol/L, in one embodiment, from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−5 \nmol/L, in another embodiment, from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−6 \nmol/L, and in another embodiment, from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−9 \nmol/L of a solution or suspension of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.

the experiment. The rats are group-housed and have free access to food and water at all times, except prior to oral administration of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound when food is removed for 16 hours before dosing. A control group acts as a comparison to rats treated with a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound. The control group is administered the carrier for the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound. The volume of carrier administered to the control group is the same as the volume of carrier and Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound administered to the test group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcute Pain: To assess the actions of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound for the treatment or prevention of acute pain, the rat tail flick test can be used. Rats are gently restrained by hand and the tail exposed to a focused beam of radiant heat at a point 5 cm from the tip using a tail flick unit (Model 7360, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy). Tail flick latencies are defined as the interval between the onset of the thermal stimulus and the flick of the tail. Animals not responding within 20 seconds are removed from the tail flick unit and assigned a withdrawal latency of 20 seconds. Tail flick latencies are measured immediately before (pre-treatment) and 1, 3, and 5 hours following administration of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound.

FCA-induced inflammation of the rat hind paw is associated with the development of persistent inflammatory mechanical hyperalgesia and provides reliable prediction of the anti-hyperalgesic action of clinically useful analgesic drugs (L. Bartho et al., “Involvement of Capsaicin-sensitive Neurones in Hyperalgesia and Enhanced Opioid Antinociception in Inflammation,” \nNaunyn\n-\nSchmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacol. \n342:666-670 (1990)). The left hind paw of each animal is administered a 50 μL intraplantar injection of 50% FCA. 24 hour post injection, the animal is assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining the PWT, as described below. Rats are then administered a single injection of 1, 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of either a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound; 30 mg/kg of a control selected from Celebrex, indomethacin or naproxen; or carrier. Responses to noxious mechanical stimuli are then determined 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours post administration.

Seltzer et al., “A Novel Behavioral Model of Neuropathic Pain Disorders Produced in Rats by Partial Sciatic Nerve Injury,” \nPain \n43:205-218 (1990)). Partial ligation of the left sciatic nerve is performed under isoflurane/O\n2 \ninhalation anaesthesia. Following induction of anesthesia, the left thigh of the rat is shaved and the sciatic nerve exposed at high thigh level through a small incision and is carefully cleared of surrounding connective tissues at a site near the trocanther just distal to the point at which the posterior biceps semitendinosus nerve branches off of the common sciatic nerve. A 7-0 silk suture is inserted into the nerve with a 3/8 curved, reversed-cutting mini-needle and tightly ligated so that the dorsal ⅓ to ½ of the nerve thickness is held within the ligature. The wound is closed with a single muscle suture (4-0 nylon (Vicryl)) and vetbond tissue glue. Following surgery, the wound area is dusted with antibiotic powder. Sham-treated rats undergo an identical surgical procedure except that the sciatic nerve is not manipulated. Following surgery, animals are weighed and placed on a warm pad until they recover from anesthesia. Animals are then returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animal is assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, prior to surgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1, 3, and 5 hours after drug administration for rear paw of the animal.

Surgery is performed under isoflurane/O\n2 \ninhalation anaesthesia. Following induction of anaesthesia, a 3 cm incision is made and the left paraspinal muscles are separated from the spinous process at the L\n4\n-S\n2 \nlevels. The L\n6 \ntransverse process is carefully removed with a pair of small rongeurs to identify visually the L\n4\n-L\n6 \nspinal nerves. The left L\n5 \n(or L\n5 \nand L\n6\n) spinal nerve(s) is isolated and tightly ligated with silk thread. A complete hemostasis is confirmed and the wound is sutured using non-absorbable sutures, such as nylon sutures or stainless steel staples. Sham-treated rats undergo an identical surgical procedure except that the spinal nerve(s) is not manipulated. Following surgery animals are weighed, administered a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of saline or ringers lactate, the wound area is dusted with antibiotic powder and they are kept on a warm pad until they recover from the anesthesia. Animals are then returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animals are assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, prior to surgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1, 3, and 5 hours after being administered a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound for the left rear paw of the animal. The animal can also be assessed for response to noxious thermal stimuli or for tactile allodynia, as described below. The Chung model for neuropathic pain is described in S.H. Kim, “An Experimental Model for Peripheral Neuropathy Produced by Segmental Spinal Nerve Ligation in the Rat,” \nPain \n50(3):355-363 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResponse to Mechanical Stimuli as an Assessment of Mechanical Hyperalgesia: The paw pressure assay can be used to assess mechanical hyperalgesia. For this assay, hind paw withdrawal thresholds (PWT) to a noxious mechanical stimulus are determined using an analgesymeter (Model 7200, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy) as described in C. Stein, “Unilateral Inflammation of the Hindpaw in Rats as a Model of Prolonged Noxious Stimulation: Alterations in Behavior and Nociceptive Thresholds,” \nPharmacol. Biochem. and Behavior \n31:451-455 (1988). The maximum weight that can be applied to the hind paw is set at 250 g and the end point is taken as complete withdrawal of the paw. PWT is determined once for each rat at each time point and either only the affected (ipsilateral) paw is tested, or both the ipsilateral and contralateral (non-injured) paw are tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResponse to Thermal Stimuli as an Assessment of Thermal Hyperalgesia: The plantar test can be used to assess thermal hyperalgesia. For this test, hind paw withdrawal latencies to a noxious thermal stimulus are determined using a plantar test apparatus (commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy) following the technique described by K. Hargreaves et al., “A New and Sensitive Method for Measuring Thermal Nociception in Cutaneous Hyperalgesia,” \nPain \n32(1):77-88 (1988). The maximum exposure time is set at 32 seconds to avoid tissue damage and any directed paw withdrawal from the heat source is taken as the end point. Three latencies are determined at each time point and averaged. Either only the affected (ipsilateral) paw is tested, or both the ipsilateral and contralateral (non-injured) paw are tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssessment of Tactile Allodynia: To assess tactile allodynia, rats are placed in clear, plexiglass compartments with a wire mesh floor and allowed to habituate for a period of at least 15 minutes. After habituation, a series of von Frey monofilaments are presented to the plantar surface of the left (operated) foot of each rat. The series of von Frey monofilaments consists of six monofilaments of increasing diameter, with the smallest diameter fiber presented first. Five trials are conducted with each filament with each trial separated by approximately 2 minutes. Each presentation lasts for a period of 4-8 seconds or until a nociceptive withdrawal behavior is observed. Flinching, paw withdrawal or licking of the paw are considered nociceptive behavioral responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments disclosed in the examples that are intended as illustrations of a few aspects of the invention and any embodiments that are functionally equivalent are within the scope of this invention.
