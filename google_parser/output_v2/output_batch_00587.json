Description\n\n\n\n\n SELECTIVE PROTON COUPLED FOLATE TRANSPORTER AND FOLATE\n\n\nRECEPTOR, AND GARFTASE INHIBITOR COMPOUNDS AND\n\n\nMETHODS OF USING THE SAME\n\n\nGOVERNMENT INTEREST\n\n\nThis invention was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under Contract No. ROl CA125153. The Government may have certain rights in this invention.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to selective proton coupled folate transporter (PCFT) and alpha folate receptor (FR alpha), beta folate receptor (FR beta), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFTase) enzyme inhibitor compounds, and their methods of use. Preferably, these compounds have heterocycloalkyl-carbonyl-L-glutamate substituents or heterocycloaryl-carbonyl-L-glutamate substituents. The compounds of this invention may be made into salts that are water soluble for providing orally active selective antitumor agents.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nKnown cancer chemotherapy agents target both normal and cancerous tumor cells. This lack of selectivity for tumor cells results in cytotoxicity to the normal cells and is one of the major causes of chemo therapeutic failure in the treatment of cancer. Further, advanced stage and chemotherapeutic agent resistant tumors may be difficult to treat with know chemotherapeutic agents such as for example but not limited to carboplatin or paclitaxel (docitaxel).\n\n\nFolates are members of the B Class of vitamins that are cofactors for the synthesis of nucleotide precursors, serine and methionine in one-carbon transfer reactions. Since mammals \n\n cannot synthesize folates de novo, cellular uptake of these derivatives is essential for cell growth and tissue regeneration. Reflecting their hydrophilic anionic character, folates do not cross biological membranes by diffusion alone. Accordingly, mammalian cells have evolved sophisticated membrane transport systems for facilitating accumulation of folates.\n\n\nThe ubiquitously expressed reduced folate carrier (RFC) is the major transport system for folates in mammalian cells and mediates concentrative uptake of folate substrates. RFC is a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters and is an integral transmembrane protein with micromolar affinity for its physiologic substrate, 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate. Importantly, RFC is also the primary transporter of clinically relevant antifolate drugs used for cancer including methotrexate (MTX), raltitrexed (ZD1694, Tomudex) (RTX), and pemetrexed (LY231514, Alimta) (PMX). Loss of RFC levels or function is a common mode of antifolate resistance. While a previously unrecognized proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) was recently reported to contribute to folate absorption in the duodenum, its tissue-specificity and overall role in folate homeostasis are not clear yet.\n\n\nThe family of folate receptors (FRs) represents yet another mode of folate uptake into mammalian cells. The FRs are high affinity folate binding proteins encoded by three distinct genes, designated FR alpha, FR beta and FR gamma, localized to chromosome I lql3.3-ql3.5. In contrast to RFC and PCFT, FR alpha and FR beta are anchored in plasma membranes by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. FR gamma contains no GPI anchor and is secreted. Whereas FR alpha and FR beta (but not FR gamma) mediate cellular accumulation of folate at low (nanomolar) concentrations by receptor-mediated endocytosis, these homologous proteins show differences in binding affinities for reduced folate substrates. \n\n The high affinity FRs offer a potential means of selective tumor targeting, given their restricted pattern of tissue expression and function. For instance, FR alpha is expressed on the apical membrane surface of normal tissues such as kidney, placenta, and choroid plexus, whereas FR beta is expressed in placenta, spleen, and thymus. Importantly, FR alpha is overexpressed in a number of carcinomas including up to 90% of ovarian cancers. Close associations were reported between FR alpha expression levels with grade and differentiation status of ovarian tumors. FR alpha in normal tissues (unlike tumors) is reported to be inaccessible to the circulation. FR beta is expressed in a wide range of myeloid leukemia cells. FR beta in normal hematopoetic cells differs from that in leukemia cells in its inability to bind folate ligand.\n\n\nFolate-conjugated cytotoxins, liposomes, or radionuclides, or cytoxic antifolates have all been used to target FRs. Unfortunately, for most folate-based therapeutics such as classical antifolates (including RTX, PMX, and lometrexol (LMX)), tumor selectivity is lost since substrates are shared between FRs and the ubiquitously expressed RFC. Indeed, this likely explains the severe myelosupression encountered in phase 1 studies with LMX.\n\n\nIf, a FR-targeted ligand were itself cytotoxic without RFC activity, selective tumor targeting would ensue. Antifolates that selectively target FRs over RFC have been described including CB3717 and, more recently, cyclopenta[g]quinazoline antifolates BGC638 and BGC945, all of which potently inhibit thymidylate synthase (TS) within cells. When BGC945 was tested in mice, there was no toxicity to normal tissues, as reflected in weight loss, nor were there any macroscopic signs of toxicity to major organs, consistent with the premise that FR targeting is highly selective.\n\n\nAs is known by those skilled in the art, FRs such as FR alpha and FR beta are overexpressed on a substantial amount of certain surfaces of a number of types of cancerous \n\n tumors. FR alpha is known to be overexpressed in ovarian, endometrial, kidney, lung, mesothelioma, breast and brain tumors. FR beta is known to be overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemias\n\n\nIn most normal cells, the FRs are not present. In most normal cells, folic acid is not taken up by way of a reduced folate carrier (RFC) system. Uptake of folates and antifolates by tissues and tumors is primarily by the ubiquitously expressed RFC system. In light of the specificity of folic acid, conjugates of folic acid have been used to selectively deliver toxins, liposomes, imaging agents, and cytotoxic agents to FR expressing tumors. The major limitation of the folic acid conjugates is that they require cleavage from the folic acid moiety to release, for example, the cytotoxic agent. Cleavage of the cytotoxic agent moiety from the folic acid conjugate is often difficult to achieve and the anti-tumor activity is hindered or is nonexistent as a result of the inability or reduced ability to release the cytotoxic agent. Another limitation of the folic acid conjugates entails premature release of the cytotoxic agent during transport and before reaching the cancerous tumor. The premature release thus leads to undesired toxicity in normal cells.\n\n\nThe FRs alpha and beta represent another mode of folate uptake and are considered by those skilled in the art to be potential chemotherapeutic targets for selective tumor uptake.

Compounds of Formula I or II can be in the form of a \n\n powder or granule, a solution or suspension in an aqueous liquid or non-aqueous liquid, or in an oil-in- water emulsion.\n\n\nThe tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like also can contain, for example, a binder, such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch; gelating excipients, such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent, such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate; a sweetening agent, such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can contain, in addition to the materials described above, a liquid carrier. Various other materials can be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For example, tablets, pills, or capsules can be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir can contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring. Any material used in preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceutically pure and substantially non-toxic. Additionally, the compounds of Formulas I, II, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, solvate or hydrate of Formulas I or II, can be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and formulations.\n\n\nThe compounds of Formula I, II, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, solvate or hydrate thereof, can be administered to the central nervous system, parenterally or intraperitoneally. Solutions of the compound as a free base or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can be prepared in water mixed with a suitable surfactant, such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions also can be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof, and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations can contain a preservative and/or antioxidants to prevent the growth of microorganisms or chemical degeneration. \n\n The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include, without limitation, sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It can be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention may be contained within, mixed with, or associated with, a suitable (acceptable) pharmaceutical carrier for administration to a patient according to the particular route of administration desired. Suitable or acceptable pharmaceutical carriers refer to any pharmaceutical carrier that will solubilize the compounds of the present invention and that will not give rise to incompatability problems, and includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic agents, absorption delaying agents, and the like. The use of such suitable or acceptable pharmaceutical carriers are well known by those skilled in the art. Preferred carriers include sterile water, physiologic saline, and five percent dextrose in water. Examples of other suitable or acceptable pharmaceutical carriers include, but are not limited to, ethanol, polyol (such as propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, or vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size (in the case of a dispersion) and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and anti-fungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. \n\n Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating a compound of Formula I or II in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the sterilized compound of Formula I or II into a sterile vehicle that contains the basic dispersion medium and any of the other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for administration to the nose and buccal cavity include, without limitation, self-propelling and spray formulations, such as aerosol, atomizers and nebulizers.\n\n\nThe therapeutic compounds of Formula I or II, as described herein, can be administered to a patient alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or hydrates thereof, the proportion of which is determined by the solubility and chemical nature of the compound, chosen route of administration to the patient and standard pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\nThe present invention is more particularly described in the following non-limiting examples, which are intended to be illustrative only, as numerous modifications and variations therein will be apparent to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nFigure 2 shows the biological effects of various compounds of the present invention, namely, Samples: AAG 154353, AAG154360, AAG154484, AAG154468, AAG154479, and AAG154489. These compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity towards assorted cell lines, \n\n namely, KB human tumor cells expressing FRs and RFC, PC43-10, and Chinese hamster ovary expressing RFC, and RT16 Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing FRs but no RFC. Figure 2 shows the IC \n50\n of each of the Sample compounds of the present invention towards each cancer cell line. The IC\n50\n is the inhibitory concentration required to effectuate fifty percent inhibition of cell growth.\n\n\nCompounds AAG154353, AAG154360, AAG154489 and AAG154468 are potent inhibitors of KB human tumor cells known to express high levels of folate receptor alpha (FRa) with values of 0.25, 3.4, 0.3 and 122 nM respectively (see Figure 2). In addition, the compounds are potently inhibitory against RT16 cells that express FRa and D4 cells that express folate receptor beta (FRβ). All the compounds as anticipated were inactive against cells engineered to lack FRa or FRβ, such as PC43 (only RFC) and R2 cells that lack FRa or β, as well as RFC. These results show that compounds AAG154353, AAG154360, AAG145489 and AAG154468 are selectively inhibitory only against cells and tumor cells that express FRs.\n\n\nInhibitory effects of AAG154353 and AAG154360, as examples of the heteroaroyl side chain analogs of the compounds of the present invention of Formula I, on RFC transport and FR binding were also evaluated. The PC43 cells, (RFC containing cells) that express RFC only, were used and the ability of the compounds to inhibit [\n3\nH] MTX (methotrexate) uptake. Both example compounds AAG154353 and AAG154360 had very poor inhibitory activity, < 20%, showing that these compounds do not inhibit [\n3\nH] MTX uptake in PC43 cells. In contrast, the evaluation of the FRa binding affinity compared to folic acid showed very high binding affinities with relative affinities similar to folic acid set to a value of 1 (see Figure 2). Similar results were obtained with FRβ and show that the prototype analogs are selective for and are excellent substrates for FRa and FRβ. \n\n IN-VIVO EVALUATION OF SAMPLE: AAG154353 IN ADVANCED TUMOR\n\n\nXENOGRAFT\n\n\nSCID female mice bearing advanced stage human KB cervical tumors as xenografts (xenograft tumors) were administered compound AAG154353 of the present invention intravenously at various doses and schedules.\n\n\nMice were maintained on a Folic Acid deficient diet (Harlan-Teklad Diet #00434; Madison, WI) exclusively for approximately three weeks at the start of treatment. Three mice bearing late stage KB tumor xenografts (446 to 650mg at the start of treatment) were each treated on various dose/schedules with AAG154353 IV. In all three cases, tumors regressed completely. Thus, significant antitumor activity was detected. Toxicity as reflected in weight loss was modest.\n\n\nDose/schedules tested:\n\n\n1) Q3dx4 does starting day 37; 750mg/kg total dose - mouse tumor free for one month, 30 days;\n\n\n2) Q2dx4 doses starting day 43; 500mg/kg total dose - mouse with 63mg tumor; tumor free up to day 60.\n\n\n3) Q4dx3 doses starting day 48; 187.5mg/kg total dose - mouse tumor free for one month, 30 days.\n\n\nDescription of FR and human Proton-coupled Folate Transporter (hPCFT) Studies with Pyrrolor2,3-</1pyrimidine antifolates\n\n\nFolate receptor studies: Following the inventors' initial studies of pyrrolo[2,3-rf]pyrimidine antifolates with 1 or 3 to 6 carbon bridge substitutions as represented by Compound \n\n AAG120366-2, structure shown in Figure 3) to identify FR targeted agents with low level transport by human reduced folate carrier (hRFC) (Deng et al., 2008), we tested compounds of Formula I of the present invention, namely Example compounds AAG154353 and AAG154360, each having a thienoyl side chain in KB human tumor cells (see Table 1). The compounds AAG154353 and AAG154360 were initially tested for their growth inhibitory effects against KB human tumor cells, which express FR alpha and hRFC but insignificant levels human proton coupled folate transporter (hPCFT), using a fluorescence-based (\"Cell Titer-blue\") cytotoxicity screen. In KB cells, IC50s of 0.25 and 3.4 nM were measured from compounds AAG154353 and AAG154360. FR-targeted activity by AAG154353 and AAG154360 was confirmed by co-treatments with folic acid (200 nM) which completely reversed growth inhibition of these agents. AAG154353 and AAG154360 were also tested in isogenic Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) sublines, engineered to express human FR- (RT16) or hRFC (PC43-10). For PC43-10, results were compared to those for hRFC- and FR-null R2 CHO cells from which they were derived, whereas those for RT 16 cells were compared to those for a parallel incubation in the presence of an elevated concentration of folic acid, as with the KB cells. AAG154353 and AAG154360 showed a high level of FR-targeted activity toward RT 16 cells. Neither AAG154353 and AAG154360 showed appreciable growth inhibition of hRFC-expressing PC43-10 cells. These results are summarized in Table 1.\n\n\nTable 1.

Experiments were performed in standard RPMI 1640/ 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Growth inhibition results are presented as mean values IC50 values (nM) from 2-3 experiments.

Following reports of a novel pH transporter termed PCFT in the proximal small intestine and possibly solid tumors, the inventors' established an expression profile of this transporter compared to hRFC and FRa in a wide range of cell lines derived from human solid tumors and leukemias. mRNA levels for hPCFT, hRFC and FRa were measured by real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) and normalized to levels of glyceraldyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Results shown in Figure 4 clearly demonstrate appreciable hPCFT transcripts in a large number of human solid tumor cell lines of different origins (e.g., breast, prostate, ovarian, etc.) and uniformly low level hPCFT in human leukemias. hPCFT levels were highest in SKO V3 (ovarian), HepG2 (hepatoma), HeLa (cervical), and T47D (breast) cancer cells. hRFC transcripts were detected in all cell lines with exception of HeLa R5 and MDA-MB-231 (both documented to express low to undetectable hRFC). FRa was only detected in a small subset of ovarian, cervical, and breast cell lines (inset). Figure 4 sets forth hRFC and hPCFT transcript levels in solid tumor and leukemia cell lines. Transcripts levels were measured by qPCR from total RNAs using a Roche 480 Lightcycler and Sybr Green 1 detection. hRFC/hPCFT transcript levels were normalized to GAPDH transcripts. The inset (black bars) shows results for solid tumors in which FR alpha transcripts could be detected. FR alpha could \n\n not be detected in the remaining solid tumors and all of the leukemia cells. The tumor types for the solid tumors shown in Figure 4 are as follows: DU- 145, PC-3 (prostate); UCVA-I (pancreas); SKOV3, Ovcar-3, Igrov-1 (ovary); HTB139 (muscle); H2591, MET5A, H2452, H2313 (mesothelioma); SK-MEL-28 (melanoma); HepG2 (hepatoma); HT1080 (fibrosarcoma); Y79 (eye); SW-620, HCG-116 (colon); HeLa, R5, KB (cervical); T-47D, MDA-MB435, MDA- MB231, MCF-7 (breast); SK-N-MC (brain); and HTB166, TE-85 (bone).\n\n\nTo study the functional and biochemical properties of hPCFT, the inventors prepared a myc-his6 tagged hPCFT (hPCFT\nmyc hls6\n) cDNA construct by RT-PCR from RNA prepared from wild type (wt) HeLa cells. hPCFT\nmyc\"hls6\n (in pCDNA3.1 plasmid) was transiently expressed in R5 HeLa cells (expresses some low level of hPCFT), and assayed for hPCFT^\n0'1\n\"\n86\n protein on westerns with Myc-specific antibody and transport activity at pH 5.5 for comparison with mock (vector control) transfected R5 cells (Figure 5, upper panel). To generate stable transfectants, PCFT- and RFC-null R2 CHO cells were electroporated with the hPCFT\nmyc hls6\n -pCDNA3.1 construct. Cells were selected with G418 and screened for hPCFT\nmyc\"hls6\n protein. The best clone (designated R2-hPCFT#4) was further characterized (Figure 5, lower panel). A high level of hPCFT\nMyc\"Hls6\n protein was detected on Western blots (westerns) accompanying significant [\n3\nH]MtX transport at pH 5.5. Transport was negligible at pH 7.2- 7.4 (not shown). For hRFC-expressing pC43-10 cells, [\n3\nH]MTX transport was active at pH 7.2- 7.4 but was undetectable at pH 5.5 (data not shown). Figure 5 shows transfection of HeLa R5 and CHO R2 Cells with hPCFTMyc-hislO. Cells were transfected with hPCFTMyc-hisό either transiently (HeLa) or stably (R2). PCFTMyc-HislO protein was measured on westerns with Myc specific antibody (insets) and hPCFT activity was measured in MES -buffered saline at pH 5.5 with 1 micromolar 3H-Mtx as substrate. \n\n In growth inhibition assays, the inventors found that sensitivities to assorted classical antifolates including methotrexate (MTX), GW1843U89, lometrexol, pemetrexed, PT523, and raltitrexed for hPCFT\nMyc~hls6\n -expressing R2-hPCFT#4 cells and hRFC-expressing pC43-10 cells were all increased (~4 to 8-fold and -10- to 150-fold, respectively), in comparison with vector control R2 cells (Tables 1 and 2). Thus, even at the relatively neutral pH (-7.2) of tissue culture media, classical antifolates appear to be substrates for hPCFT, as reflected in patterns of growth inhibition in the hPCFT-transfected and mock transfected CHO cells. By comparing results with R2-hPCFT#4 and pC43-10 cells, only the antifolate PT523 was completely selective in its effects toward hRFC over hPCFT, whereas none of these agents showed significant selectivity toward hPCFT over hRFC.\n\n\nThe compounds of Formula I of the present invention, for example, have structures with modifications in several regions, including but not limited to the pteridine moeity, the carbon bridge region of the side chain, the /7-aminobenzoic acid, or terminal glutamate, and combinations thereof. For example, by standard growth inhibition assays, we identified a novel 6-substituted pyrrolo[2,3-rf]pyrimidine antifolate, namely AAG154353, with striking sensitivity toward R2-hPCFT#4 cells (-20- to 30-fold greater than those for vector-control R2 cells) (Table 2) and a nearly complete lack of drug activity toward hRFC-expressing pC43-10 cells (Table 1). Specificity for hPCFT over hRFC was further suggested by assays of direct competition with [\n3\nH]MTX for cellular uptake by R2-hPCFT#4 (Figure 6). In both transport and cytotoxicity experiments, compound AAG154353 exhibited potencies similar to that for pemetrexed, the best substrate yet described for hPCFT. However, the hRFC substrate, PT523, was completely inert in inhibiting cell proliferation or [\n3\nH]MTX uptake with R2-hPCFT#4 cells. \n\n In contrast to pemetrexed, compound AAG154353 showed negligible inhibition of [\n3\nH]MTX transport from hRFC in pC43-10 cells (at pH 7.2-7.4) (not shown).\n\n\nIdentification of intracellular enzyme target. Compound AAG120366-2 was previously reported by this applicant to potently inhibit GARFTase, the first folate-dependent step in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway (Deng et al., 2008). To localize the probable enzyme target(s) for compound AAG154353, we tested the growth inhibitory effects of this compounds toward KB in the presence of adenosine (60 μM) or thymidine (10 μM). Thymidine (10 μM) did not alter the growth inhibitory effects of AAG154353 whereas adenosine (60 μM) was completely protective, thus establishing the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway as the primary target. Compound AAG154353 was completely protected by 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide (AICA) (320 μM) which identified GARFTase as the likely intracellular target. We used in vitro and in situ GARFTase inhibition assays with antifolate analogs to confirm inhibitions of this enzyme target. With the purified recombinant mouse GARFTase, compounds AAG154353 and AAG154360 were inhibitory with IC50s of 0.06 μM and 3.31 μM, respectively (Table 1). In the in situ GARFTase assay, incorporation of \n14\nC-glycine into formyl glycinamide ribonucleotide was measured and was inhibited at nM concentrations of the drugs, with the most potent effects by inhibitor AAG154353 (Table 1). The dramatic differences in inhibition potencies by in situ versus in vitro assays of GARFTase for all these agents likely reflect an exacerbation of enzyme binding affinities by drug polyglutamates within cells.\n\n\nTable 2. Growth inhibition by antifolate drugs toward hPCFT- and hRFC stable R2 CHO transfectants. Experiments were performed in folate-free RPMI1640/10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum supplemented with 25nM leucovorin. Growth inhibition was measured by a florescence (Cell TiterBlue)-based assay after 96 h of exposure to a range of inhibitor concentrations.\n\n\nResults are presented as 50% inhibitory concentrations. (IC\n50\n's)\n\n\nAnalogs | R2-hPCFT#4 | R2/VC \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur results establish a high frequency of expression of hPCFT in solid tumors over leukemias. hRFT is expressed in both solid tumors and leukemias whereas FRa is expressed exclusively in a subset of solid tumors. Our results with compound AAG154353 are unprecedented in that they are the first to exhibit a unique and selective binding to FRa and hPCFT over hRFC that results in a potent growth inhibition even at physiologic pH. Given the acidic pH optimum for hPCFT (pH 5.5-6.8), these growth inhibitory effects are clearly exascerbated at lower pH values (6.5-6.8) as occurs, for example, in a solid tumor environment. Indeed, our initial studies over a range of pH values establish a 2-3-fold increased inhibition of hPCFT transport at acid (ph<7) over neutral (pH>7) conditions.\n\n\nThe development of novel small molecule cytotoxins such as the compounds of Formula I of the present invention that are selectively transported by hPCFT provide exciting new therapeutic applications for solid tumor targeting. This is based on the notion of effectively \"highjacking\" an essential biological characteristic of solid tumors, namely their acidic microenvironment, for selective delivery of the cytotoxic compounds of the present invention. \n\n SYNTHESIS OF COMPOUNDS\n\n\nChemistry Scheme 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7a n=1 95% AAG154353 n=1 95% 7b n=2 94% AAG154360 n=2 95% 7c n=3 95% AAG154484 n=3 95%\n\n\nCOOEt \n\n\n\n\n\nCOOEt a. oxalyl chloride, CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, reflux, Ih; b. diazomethane, Et\n2\nO, r.t, Ih; c.

Commercially available pent-4-ynoic acid Ia or hex-5-ynoic acid Ib or hept-6-ynoic acid Ic (Scheme 1) was converted to the acid chlorides 2a-c and immediately reacted with \n\n diazomethane followed by 48% HBr to give the desired α-bromomethylketones 4a-c. Condensation of 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine with 4a-c at room temperature for 3 days afforded the 6-substituted pyrrolo[2,3-<i]pyrimidines 5a-c (51-74% yield). Compounds 6a-c were obtained by a Sonogashira coupling of 5a-c with (S)-2-[(5-bromo-thiophene-2-carbonyl)-amino]- pentanedioic acid diethyl ester 9. Hydrogenation and saponification of 6a-c afforded AAG154353, AAG154360 and AAG154484, respectively.

Compound 13 (Scheme 3) was synthesized by coupling the commercially available 5-bromo-2-furan-carboxylic acid 12 and L-glutamate diethyl ester hydrochloride in 72% yield.

Direct saponification of 10 afforded\n\n\nAAG154485 in 95% yield. \n\n Experimental Section\n\n\nAll evaporations were carried out in vacuo with a rotary evaporator. Analytical samples were dried in a CHEM-DRY vacuum (0.2 mm Hg) drying oven over P\n2\nO\n5\n. Melting points were determined on a MELTEMP II melting point apparatus with FLUKE 51 K/J electronic thermometer and are uncorrected. NMR spectra for proton (\n1\nH) were recorded on a Bruker WH- 300 (300 MHz) spectrometer. The chemical shift values are expressed in ppm (parts per million) relative to tetramethylsilane as internal standard; s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet, br = broad singlet. The relative integrals of peak areas agreed with those expected for the assigned structures. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on PE SIL G/UV silica gel plates with fluorescent indicator, and the spots were visualized under 254 and 365 nm illumination. Proportions of solvents used for TLC are by volume. Column chromatography was performed on 230-400 mesh silica gel purchased from Fisher, Somerville, NJ. Elemental analyses were performed by Atlantic Microlab, Inc., Norcross, GA. Element compositions are within ±0.4% of the calculated values. Fractional moles of water or organic solvents frequently found in some analytical samples of antifolates were not prevented despite 24-48 h of drying in vacuo and were confirmed where possible by their presence in the \n1\nH NMR spectra. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed on a Waters Q-TOF (API-US) by Department of Chemistry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. All solvents and chemicals were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Fisher Scientific and were used as received.\n\n\nGeneral procedure for the synthesis of compounds 5a-c\n\n\nTo la-c (10 mmol) in a 250 mL flask were added oxalyl chloride (7.6 Ig, 60mmol) and anhydrous CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (20 mL). The resulting solution was refluxed for Ih and then cooled to room \n\n temperature. After evaporating the solvent under reduced pressure, the residue 2a-c were dissolved in 20 rnL of Et\n2\nO. The resulting solution was added drop wise to an ice-cooled diazomethane (generated in situ from 15g diazald by using Aldrich Mini Diazald Apparatus) in an ice bath over 10 min. The resulting mixture was allowed to stand for 30 min and then stirred for an additional Ih. To this solution was added 48% HBr (20 mL). The resulting mixture was refluxed for 1.5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer extracted with Et\n2\nO (200 mLx2). The combined organic layer and Et\n2\nO extract was washed with two portions of 10% Na\n2\nCO\n3\n solution and dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n. Evaporation of the solvent afforded 4a-c in 94% yield. To a suspension of 2,6-diaminopyrimidin-4-one (1.26 g, lOmmol) in anhydrous DMF (25 mL) was added 4a-c (about 9.4mmol). The resulting mixture was stirred under N\n2\n at room temperature for 3 days.

Palladium-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling of 5-bromo-thiophene-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester with but-3-yn-l-ol 1 (Scheme 1) afforded thiophenebutynyl alcohol 2 (70%), which was catalytically hydrogenated to give the saturated alcohol 3 in quantitative yield. Subsequent oxidation of 3 using Jones' reagent afforded the carboxylic acid 4 (47%), which was converted to the acid chloride 5 and immediately reacted with diazomethane followed by 48% HBr to give the desired α- bromomethylketone 7. Condensation of 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine with 7 at room temperature for 3 days afforded the 6-substituted pyrrolo[2,3-rf]pyrimidines 8 (38%). Hydrolysis of 8 afforded the corresponding free acid 9 (89%). Subsequent coupling with L-glutamate diethyl ester using 2-chloro-4,6-dimethoxy-l,3,5-triazine as the activating agent afforded the diesters 10. Final saponification of the diesters gave the desired compound AAG154544.\n\n\nExperimental Section\n\n\nAll evaporations were carried out in vacuo with a rotary evaporator. Analytical samples were dried in a CHEM-DRY vacuum (0.2 mm Hg) drying oven over P\n2\nO\n5\n. Melting points were determined on a MELTEMP II melting point apparatus with FLUKE 51 K/J electronic thermometer and are uncorrected. NMR spectra for proton (\n1\nH) were recorded on a Bruker WH- 300 (300 MHz) spectrometer. The chemical shift values are expressed in ppm (parts per million) relative to tetramethylsilane as internal standard; s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet, br = broad singlet. The relative integrals of peak areas agreed with those expected for the assigned structures. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on PE SIL G/UV silica gel plates with fluorescent indicator, and the spots were visualized under 254 and 365 nm illumination. Proportions of solvents used for TLC are by volume. Column chromatography was performed on 230-400 mesh silica gel purchased from Fisher, Somerville, NJ. Elemental \n\n analyses were performed by Atlantic Microlab, Inc., Norcross, GA. Element compositions are within ±0.4% of the calculated values. Fractional moles of water or organic solvents frequently found in some analytical samples of antifolates were not prevented despite 24-48 h of drying in vacuo and were confirmed where possible by their presence in the \n1\nH NMR spectra. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed on a Waters Q-TOF (API-US) by Department of Chemistry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. All solvents and chemicals were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and Fisher Scientific and were used as received.\n\n\n5-(4-Hydroxy-but-l-ynyl)-thiophene-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester (2)\n\n\nTo a 20-mL vial for microwave reaction, were added a mixture of palladium chloride (57 mg, 0.32 mmol), triphenylphosphine (104 mg, 0.32 mmol), copper iodide (243 mg, 1.28 mmol), triethylamine (8.08 g, 80 mmol), 5-bromo-thiophene-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester (1.77 g, 8 mmol) and anhydrous acetonitrile (10 mL). To the stirred mixture, were added copper iodide (243 mg, 1.28 mmol) and but-3-yn-l-ol, 1 (588 mg, 8.4 mmol), and the vial was sealed and put into the microwave reactor at 100\n0\nC for 10 min. After evaporation of solvent under reduced pressure, MeOH (20 mL) was added followed by silica gel (5g). The resulting plug was loaded on to a silica gel column (3.5x12 cm) and eluted with hexane followed by 20% EtOAc in hexane. Fractions with an Rf= 0.42 (hexane/EtOAc 4:1) were pooled and evaporated to afford 1.17 g of 2 as yellow oil. \n1\nH NMR (DMSO-J\n6\n): δ 2.59-2.63 (t, J = 6.4 Hz, 2H), 3.56-3.59 (t, J = 6.4 Hz, 2H), 3.81 (s, 3H), 4.95-4.98 (t, J = 5.6 Hz, IH), 7.27-7.28 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, IH), 7.69-7.70 (d, J= 4.0 Hz, IH).\n\n\n5-(4-Hydroxy-butyl)-thiophene-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester (3) \n\n To a Parr flask were added 2 (1.17 g, 5.6 mmol), 10% palladium on activated carbon (600 mg), and MeOH (100 rnL). Hydrogenation was carried out at 55 psi of H\n2\n for 4 h.

After the addition, the resulting solution was stirred in an ice bath for an additional 2 h and the solution was allowed to warm to room temperature overnight. TLC indicated the disappearance of the starting alcohol and the formation of one major spot at Rf= 0.35 (hexane/EtOAc 2:1). The solution was extracted with 5x30 mL of ethyl ether and dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n. After evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure, the resulting residue was flash chromatographed through silica gel column (3.5x15 cm) using hexane/EtOAc (2:1) as eluent.

The resulting solution was added dropwise to an ice-cooled diazomethane (generated in situ from 10 g of diazald by using Aldrich Mini Diazald Apparatus) in an ice bath over 10 min. The resulting mixture was allowed to stand for 30 min and then stirred for an additional Ih. To this solution was added 48% HBr (20 mL). The resulting mixture was refluxed for 1.5 h.
