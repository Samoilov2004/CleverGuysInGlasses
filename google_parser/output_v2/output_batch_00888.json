Description\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a pharmaceutical, and particularly a compound useful as a therapeutic agent for chronic renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy.\n\n\n \nBackground Art\n\n\n \n \n \nPGE2 is known as one of the metabolites in an arachidonic acid cascade. The PGE2 exhibits various activities such as a pain inducing and increasing action, a pro- or anti-inflammatory action, an uterine contractile action, a digestive peristalsis promoting action, an awaking action, a suppressive effect on gastric acid secretion, a hypotensive action, a platelet aggregation inhibition action, a bone-resorption promoting action, an angiogenic action, and the like.\n\nPGE2 receptors are divided into four subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4, which have a wide distribution in various tissues. The activation of the EP1 receptor is believed to increase intracellular Ca\n2+\n. The EP3 receptor is one of the receptors having different routes for second-messenger systems. Further, the activation of the EP2 and EP4 receptors is believed to cause the activation of an adenylate cyclase, and thus increase the intracellular cAMP level. Especially, the EP4 receptor is considered to be associated with smooth muscle relaxation, pro- or anti-inflammatory reactions, lymphocyte differentiation, mesangial cell relaxation or proliferation, gastric or enteric mucus secretion, or the like.\n\nThe inhibitors of the PGE2 receptor, that is, the \"PGE2 antagonists\", exhibit binding activities to the PGE2 receptors. That is, the PGE2 antagonists exhibit a PGE2-antagonistic or PGE2-inhibiting action. Therefore, the PGE2 antagonists are expected as pharmaceuticals to treat PGE2-mediated diseases. It is expected that these PGE2 antagonists can be used as therapeutic drugs to treat EP4 receptors-related diseases, such as renal diseases, inflammatory diseases, various pains, or the like, by acting on the EP4 receptors, in humans or animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n As a compound having a PGE2 antagonistic action, there has been reported a compound represented by the following formula, and particularly, such a compound is useful as an EP4 receptor agonist (Patent Document 1).\n\n \n \n\n(wherein particularly X represents -CO- or lower alkylene, R\n5\n represents H or lower alkyl, and R\n2\n represents lower alkyl or aryl which may be substituted.

At this time, depending on the types of the functional groups, it is in some cases effective from the viewpoint of the production techniques to substitute the functional group with an appropriate protecting group (a group which is capable of being easily converted into the functional group), during the steps from starting materials to intermediates.

The reaction of the reactive derivative and the compound (III) can be carried out, from under cooling to under heating, preferably at -20°C to 60°C, in a solvent which is inert to the reaction, such as halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, and the like.\n\n\n \n(Production Process 2)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe present production process is a method for obtaining a compound (I-b) of the present invention by carrying out the amidation of an amine (IV) and a carboxylic acid (V).

Here, the solvent is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, halogenated hydrocarbons, DMF, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile as shown in Production Process 1, or a mixture thereof.\n\nIt may be advantageous in some cases for the smooth progress of the reaction to carry out the reaction in the presence of an organic base such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, and the like, or an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium hydroxide, and the like.\n\nAs the compound (VIII), various alkyl chloroformates or alkyl 4-nitrophenylcarbamates can be used. The alkyl 4-nitrophenylcarbamate can be prepared by performing a reaction using 4-nitrophenyl chlorocarbamate and a corresponding alcohol in equivalent amounts or either thereof in an excessive amount at -20°C to 80°C usually for about 0.1 hour to 1 day, from under cooling to under heating, in the presence of a base, in a solvent which is inert to the reaction.\n\nFurther, in the compound (I-a) and the compound (I-b) of the present invention, by hydrolysis at an ester site with an acid or an alkali, or by removal of the protecting group of a carboxylic acid, the compound of the formula (I) in which the R site is H can be obtained.\n\n\n \n(Production Process 4)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe present production process is a method for obtaining a compound (I-c) of the present invention by reacting a compound (IX) with a compound (X).\n\nThe reaction is carried out by using the compound (IX) and the compound (X) in equivalent amounts or either thereof in an excessive amount at -45°C to heating under reflux in the presence of a reducing agent in a solvent which is inert to the reaction, and in an embodiment, by stirring it at 0°C to room temperature, usually for 0.1 hour to 5 days.\n\nHere, the solvent is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and the like, ethers, or a mixture thereof. Examples of the reducing agent include sodium cyanoborohydride, triacetoxy sodium borohydride, sodium borohydride, and the like.

Depending on the reaction, when an imine compound formed as an intermediate in the reaction system may be stably isolated, a reducing reaction may be separately carried out after obtaining the imine compound. Further, the reaction can be carried out in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, and the like, in the presence or absence of an acid such as acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and the like, using a reduction catalyst (for example, palladium-carbon, Raney nickel, and the like), instead of treatment with the reducing agent.

For example, the optical isomer can be derived into an optically pure isomer by means of general optical resolution methods (for example, fractional crystallization for inducing diastereomers with optically active bases or acids, chromatography using a chiral column, etc., and the like). In addition, the isomers can also be prepared from an appropriate optically active starting material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacological activity of the compound of the formula (I) was confirmed by the following test.\n\n\n \nTest Example 1: Evaluation test on rat EP4 receptor affinity\n\n\nCell culture and transfection\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing a 10 cm collagen-coated dish (Asahi Glass), HEK293 cells were cultured in a D-MEM culture medium, washed with a phosphate buffer saline (PBS), the culture medium was removed off at a confluence (90 to 100% density state), and then the cells were detached with N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(carboxymethyl)ethylenediamine (EDTA).

Dilution of [\n3\nH]PGE2 and the membrane fraction was carried out using an assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n), and dilution of the test compound and the unlabeled PGE2 was carried out using DMSO and an assay buffer. Further, in the case of the addition of a human serum albumin (HSA), dilution was carried out using an assay buffer containing 4% HSA (final concentration 1%; Sigma).
