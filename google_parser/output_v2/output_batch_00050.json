Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a new class of cyanopyrazoles, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds, and their use to modulate the activity of the G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR119.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nDiabetes mellitus are disorders in which high levels of blood glucose occur as a consequence of abnormal glucose homeostasis. The most common forms of diabetes mellitus are Type I (also referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and Type II diabetes (also referred to as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). Type II diabetes, accounting for roughly 90% of all diabetic cases, is a serious progressive disease that results in microvascular complications (including retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy) as well as macrovascular complications (including accelerated atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease and stroke).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCurrently, there is no cure for diabetes. Standard treatments for the disease are limited, and focus on controlling blood glucose levels to minimize or delay complications. Current treatments target either insulin resistance (metformin, thiazolidinediones, or insulin release from beta cells (sulphonylureas, exanatide). Sulphonylureas and other compounds that act via depolarization of the beta cell promote hypoglycemia as they stimulate insulin secretion independent of circulating glucose concentrations. One approved drug, exanatide, stimulates insulin secretion only in the presence of high glucose, but must be injected due to a lack of oral bioavailability. Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor, is a new drug that increases blood levels of incretin hormones, which can increase insulin secretion, reduce glucagon secretion and have other less well characterized effects. However, sitagliptin and other dipeptidyl peptidases IV inhibitors may also influence the tissue levels of other hormones and peptides, and the long-term consequences of this broader effect have not been fully investigated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Type II diabetes, muscle, fat and liver cells fail to respond normally to insulin. This condition (insulin resistance) may be due to reduced numbers of cellular insulin receptors, disruption of cellular signaling pathways, or both. At first, the beta cells compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin output. Eventually, however, the beta cells become unable to produce sufficient insulin to maintain normal glucose levels (euglycemia), indicating progression to Type II diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Type II diabetes, fasting hyperglycemia occurs due to insulin resistance combined with beta cell dysfunction. There are two aspects of beta cell defect dysfunction: 1) increased basal insulin release (occurring at low, non-stimulatory glucose concentrations). This is observed in obese, insulin-resistant pre-diabetic stages as well as in Type II diabetes, and 2) in response to a hyperglycemic challenge, a failure to increase insulin release above the already elevated basal level. This does not occur in pre-diabetic stages and may signal the transition from normo-glycemic insulin-resistant states to frank Type II diabetes. Current therapies to treat the latter aspect include inhibitors of the beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel to trigger the release of endogenous insulin stores, and administration of exogenous insulin. Neither achieves accurate normalization of blood glucose levels and both carry the risk of eliciting hypoglycemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, there has been great interest in the discovery of agents that function in a glucose-dependent manner. Physiological signaling pathways which function in this way are well known, including gut peptides GLP-1 and GIP. These hormones signal via cognate G-protein coupled receptors to stimulate production of cAMP in pancreatic beta-cells. Increased cAMP apparently does not result in stimulation of insulin release during the fasting or pre-prandial state. However, a number of biochemical targets of cAMP, including the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, voltage-sensitive potassium channels and the exocytotic machinery, are modulated such that insulin secretion due to postprandial glucose stimulation is significantly enhanced. Therefore, agonist modulators of novel, similarly functioning, beta-cell GPCRs, including GPR119, would also stimulate the release of endogenous insulin and promote normalization of glucose levels in Type II diabetes patients. It has also been shown that increased cAMP, for example as a result of GLP-1 stimulation, promotes beta-cell proliferation, inhibits beta-cell death and thus improves islet mass. This positive effect on beta-cell mass should be beneficial in Type II diabetes where insufficient insulin is produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well known that metabolic diseases have negative effects on other physiological systems and there is often co-occurrence of multiple disease states (e.g. Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes, inadequate glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, obesity or cardiovascular disease in “Syndrome X”) or secondary diseases which occur secondary to diabetes such as kidney disease, and peripheral neuropathy. Thus, treatment of the diabetic condition should be of benefit to such interconnected disease states.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, a new class of GPR 119 modulators has been discovered.

The starting materials are generally available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, Wis.) or are readily prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art (e.g., prepared by methods generally described in Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser, \nReagents for Organic Synthesis, \nv. 1-19, Wiley, New York (1967-1999 ed.), or \nBeilsteins Handbuch der organischen Chemie, \n4, Aufl. ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, including supplements (also available via the \nBeilstein \nonline database).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula I can be prepared using methods analogously known in the art for the production of ethers. The reader's attention is directed to texts such as: 1) Hughes, D. L.; \nOrganic Reactions \n1992, 42 Hoboken, N.J., United States; 2) Tikad, A.; Routier, S.; Akssira, M.; Leger, J.-M. I; Jarry, C.; Guillaumet, G. \nSynlett \n2006, 12, 1938-42; and 3) Loksha, Y. M.; Globisch, D.; Pedersen, E. B.; La Colla, P.; Collu, G.; Loddo, R. J. Het. Chem. 2008, 45, 1161-6 which describe such reactions in greater detail.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of Formula I wherein R\n2b \nis H, may be prepared as shown in \nScheme\n 1. In \nStep\n 1, compounds of Formula C can be prepared via a condensation reaction of compounds of Formula A and the commercial compound B (Sigma-Aldrich) in a diverse array of solvents including but not limited to ethanol, toluene and acetonitrile at temperatures ranging from 22° C. to 130° C. depending upon the solvent utilized for a period of 1 to 72 hours. In cases where compounds of Formula A are hydrogen chloride or trifluoroacetic acid salts, base modifiers such as sodium acetate or sodium bicarbonate may be added in one to three equivalents to neutralize the salts. The reaction may be conducted in polar protic solvents such as methanol and ethanol at temperatures ranging from 22° C. to 85° C. Typical conditions for this transformation include the use of 3 equivalents of sodium acetate in ethanol heated at 85° C. for 3 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of Formula A can be prepared via a four-step procedure starting with substituted or unsubstituted 4-piperidinone hydrochloride salts (\nJ. Med. Chem. \n2004, 47, 2180). First these salts are treated with an appropriate alkyl chloroformate or bis(alkyl) IS dicarbonate in the presence of excess base to form the corresponding alkyl carbamate. The ketone group is then condensed with tert-butoxycarbonyl hydrazide to form the corresponding N-(tert-butoxy)carbonyl (BOC) protected hydrazone derivative. This is subsequently reduced to the corresponding BOC protected hydrazine derivative using reducing agents such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride. Finally, the N-(tert-butoxy)carbonyl group is cleaved under acidic conditions such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid to give compounds of Formula A, which are typically isolated and used as the corresponding salts (e.g., dihydrochloride salt).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Step 2, compounds of Formula D may be prepared from compounds of Formula C via the formation of intermediate diazonium salts via the Sandmeyer reaction (\nComp. Org. Synth., \n1991, 6, 203) These salts may be prepared via diazotization of compounds of Formula C with sodium nitrite and aqueous acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric and acetic alone or in combinations. This reaction is typically carried out in water at 0° C. to 100° C. Alternatively, anhydrous conditions using alkyl nitrites such as tert-butylnitrite with solvents such as acetonitrile may be utilized (\nJ. Med. Chem. \n2006, 49, 1562) at temperatures ranging from 0° C. to 95° C. These diazonium intermediates are then allowed to react with copper salts such as copper(II) bromide, copper(I) bromide or with tribromomethane to form compounds of Formula D. Typical conditions for this transformation include the use of tert-butylnitrite, copper(II) bromide in acetonitrile at 65° C. for 30 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Step 3, compounds of Formula E may be prepared from compounds of Formula D via the use of reducing agents such as lithium aluminum hydride, sodium borohydride, lithium borohydride, borane-dimethylsulfide, borane-tetrahydrofuran in polar aprotic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, 1,4-dioxane or 1,2-dimethoxyethane at temperatures ranging from 0° C. to 110° C. for 1 to 24 hours. Typical conditions include the use of borane-dimethylsulfide in tetrahydrofuran at 70° C. for 14 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to prepare compounds of Formula F from compounds of Formula E, a cyano group must be introduced (Step 4) This may be achieved via a range of conditions. One method of cyano group introduction may be the use of a copper salt such as copper cyanide in a polar aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) at temperatures ranging from 22° C. to 200° C. for 1 to 24 hours. Copper cyanide in N,N-dimethylformamide heated at 165° C. for 5 hours is a typical protocol for this transformation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively in Step 4, alkali cyanide salts such as potassium or sodium cyanide may be used in conjunction with catalysts such as 18-crown-6 (US2005020564) and or tetrabutylammonium bromide (\nJ. Med. Chem. \n2003, 46, 1144) in polar aprotic solvents such acetonitrile and dimethylsulfoxide at temperatures ranging from 22° C. to 100° C. for the addition of a cyano group to this template.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, the use of metal catalysis is common for the transformation depicted in Step 4. Common cyanide salts used in catalytic procedures include zinc cyanide, copper cyanide, sodium cyanide, and potassium hexacyanoferrate (II). The metal catalysts can be copper catalysts such as copper iodide and or palladium catalysts such as tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (Pd\n2\n(dba)\n3\n), palladium tetrakis-triphenylphosphine (Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n4\n), or dichloro(diphenyl-phosphinoferrocene)-palladium (Pd(dppf)Cl\n2\n). These catalysts may be used alone or in any combination with any of the above cyanide salts. To these reactions may be added ligands such as 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene (dppf) or metal additives such as zinc or copper metal. The reactions are carried out in polar aprotic solvents such as NMP, DMF, DMA with or without water as an additive. The reactions are carried out at temperatures ranging from 22° C. to 150° C. via conventional or microwave heating for 1 to 48 hours and may be conducted in a sealed or non-sealed reaction vessel. Typical conditions for Step 4 include the use of zinc cyanide, Pd\n2\n(dba)\n3\n, dppf, and zinc dust in DMA heated at 120° C. in a microwave for 1 hour (\nJ. Med. Chem. \n2005, 48, 1132).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Step 5, compounds of Formula G, wherein X, Z and R\n2a \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I, can be synthesized from compounds of Formula F via the Mitsunobu reaction. The Mitusunobu reaction has been reviewed in the synthetic literature (e.g., \nChem. Asian. J. \n2007, 2, 1340; \nEur. J. Org. Chem. \n2004, 2763; \nS. Chem. Eur. J. \n2004, 10, 3130), and many of the synthetic protocols listed in these reviews may be used. The use of Mitsunobu reaction protocols utilizing azodicarboxylates such as diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD), di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate (TBAD), diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) and a phosphine reagent such as triphenylphosphine (PPh\n3\n), tributylphoshine (PBu\n3\n) and polymer supported triphenylphosphine (PS-PPh\n3\n) are combined with compounds of Formula F and a compound of general structure X—OH, wherein X is as defined for compounds of Formula I. Solvents utilized in this reaction may include aprotic solvents such as toluene, benzene, THF, 1,4-dioxane and acetonitrile at temperatures ranging from 0° C. to 130° C. depending on the solvent and azodicarboxylates utilized. Typical conditions for this transformation are the use of DEAD with PS-PPh\n3 \nin 1,4-dioxane at 22° C. for 15 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alternative to the Mitsunobu reaction for preparing compounds of Formula G, wherein X, Z, and R\n2a \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I, is to convert the compounds of Formula F to the corresponding methanesulfonate or para- toluenesulphonate derivatives using methanesulfonyl chloride or para-toluenesulfonyl chloride, respectively, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or pyridine. The intermediate sulfonate ester is then combined with a compound of general X—OH, wherein X is as defined for compounds of Formula I, in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, sodium hydride, or potassium tert-butoxide to yield compounds of Formula G, wherein X, Z, and R\n2a \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of Formula K, wherein R\n1 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl or C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl and X, Z and R\n2a \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I, may be prepared from compounds of Formula F in three Steps: 1) oxidation of the primary alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde of Formula H (Step 6, Scheme 1), 2) reaction of the aldehyde intermediate of Formula H with an organometallic reagent of the Formula R\n1\nM, wherein M is lithium (Li) or magnesium halide (MgCl, MgBr or MgI) to provide a secondary alcohol of Formula J, wherein R\n1 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl or C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl (Step 7), and 3) reaction of the secondary alcohol of Formula J with a phenol of the Formula X—OH, wherein X is as defined for compounds of Formula I, under Mitsunobu reaction conditions (Step 8).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Step 6 (Scheme 1), compounds of Formula H can are formed via oxidation procedures including the use of 1 to 20 equivalents of activated manganese dioxide in solvents including but not limited to dichloromethane, acetonitrile, hexane or acetone alone or in combinations for 1 to 72 hours at 22° C. to 80° C. Alternatively, this oxidation can be conducted with 1 to 3 equivalents of trichloroisocyanuric acid in the presence of 0.1 to 1 equivalents of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) in dichloromethane or chloroform at temperatures ranging from 0° C. to 22° C. for 0.1 to 12 hours. Typical conditions for this transformation are the use of trichloroisocyanuric acid in the presence of 0.1 equivalent of TEMPO in dichloromethane at 22° C. for 1 hour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation of compounds of Formula I wherein Y is NR\n5 \nis also shown in \nScheme\n 1. Compounds of Formula L wherein X, Z, R\n2a \nand R\n5 \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I may be prepared from the intermediate compound of Formula H (Scheme 1) by reaction with an amino compound of the Formula X—NH—R\n5\n, wherein X and R\n5 \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I, under reductive amination conditions (Step 9) (\nJ. Org. Chem., \n1996, 61, 3849; \nOrg. React. \n2002, 59, 1). Similarly compounds of Formula N, wherein R\n1 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl or C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl and X, Z, R\n2a \nand R\n5 \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I, may be prepared in two steps from the intermediate of Formula J wherein R\n1 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl or C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl, by 1) oxidation to the corresponding ketone of Formula M (Step 10), and 2) reaction of the ketone of Formula M with an amino compound of the Formula X—NH—R\n5\n, wherein X and R\n5 \nare as defined for compounds of-Formula I, under reductive amination conditions (Step 11). Alternatively compounds of Formula L and Formula N, wherein R\n5 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl may be prepared from the corresponding compounds of Formula L, wherein R\n5 \nis H, or the corresponding compounds of Formula N, wherein R\n5 \nis H, by alkylation with an alkyl halide of Formula (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)—Cl, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)—Br or (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)—I in the presence of a base.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of Formula I wherein Y is CHR\n5 \nand R\n2b \nis hydrogen may be prepared as shown in Schemes 2 and 3. Compounds of Formula R, wherein X, Z and R\n2a \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I may be prepared as shown in Scheme 2.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nStep\n 1 of Scheme 2, compounds of the Formula O can be formed from aldehydes of Formula H (see also Scheme 1) via the use of either dimethyl(diazomethyl)phosphonate or dimethyl-1-diazo-2-oxopropylphosphonate and bases such as potassium carbonate or potassium tert-butoxide in solvents including methanol, ethanol or tetrahydrofuran at temperatures ranging from −78° C. to 22° C. for 0.1 to 24 hours. Typical conditions for this transformation include the use of dimethyl-1-diazo-2-oxopropylphosphonate and 2 equivalents of potassium carbonate in methanol at 22° C. for 0.75 hour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Step 2, compounds of Formula Q can be formed from compounds of Formula O via a metal-catalyzed Sonagashira coupling procedure with compounds of general structure X—P wherein X is as defined for compounds of Formula I and P is a halide or trifluoromethsulfonate(triflate). The Sonogashira reaction has been extensively reviewed (\nChem. Rev. \n2007, 107, 874; \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. \n2007, 46, 834; \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. \n2008, 47, 6954), and many of the synthetic protocols listed in these reviews may be used for the synthesis of compounds of Formula Q. Typically, the use of metal catalysts in this reaction can be copper catalysts such as copper iodide and or palladium catalysts such as Pd\n2\n(dba)\n3\n, Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n4\n, Pd(dppf)Cl\n2 \nor Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n2\nCl\n2\n. These catalysts may be used alone or in any combination. Base additives are typically used in this reaction and may include amine bases such as diethylamine, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine or pyrrolidine or inorganic bases such as potassium carbonate or potassium fluoride. The reactions are carried out in solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, acetonitrile, DMF, toluene or 1,4-dioxane with or without water as an additive. The reactions are carried out at temperatures ranging from 0° C. to 150° C. depending on the solvent for times ranging from 0.1 to 48 hours. Typical conditions for this transformation include the use of CuI and Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n2\nCl\n2 \nin DMF at 90° C. for 2 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, in Step 3 compounds of Formula R, wherein X, Z and R\n2a \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I, can be formed from compounds of Formula Q via hydrogenation in the presence of transition metal catalysts. Common catalysts include the use of 5-20% palladium on carbon or 5-20% palladium hydroxide on carbon. These reactions can be conducted in a Parr shaker apparatus or in an H-Cube hydrogenation flow reactor (ThalesNano, U.K.) under pressures of hydrogen ranging from 1 to 50 psi in polar solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, methanol or ethanol at temperatures of 22° C. to 50° C. for times ranging from 0.1 to 24 hours. Typical conditions for Step 3 include the use compound of Formula Q in ethyl acetate at a flow rate of 1 mL/min through a 10% palladium on carbon cartridge on the H-Cube flow apparatus set at the “full hydrogen” setting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 3 shows methods for the preparation of compounds of Formula W, wherein X, Z, R\n2a \nand R\n5 \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nStep\n 1 of Scheme 3, compounds of Formula F (see also Scheme 2) can be treated with reagents such as phosphorus tribromide or carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine to give compounds of Formula S. In Step 2, compounds of Formula S are then allowed to react with triphenylphosphine in solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, toluene, benzene, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or acetonitrile to give triphenylphosphonium salts of Formula T. The salts of Formula T, are then combined with carbonyl compounds of Formula U, where X and R\n5 \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I, in the presence of bases such as n-butyllithium, sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide or lithium diisopropylamide in solvents such as THF, diethylether or 1,4-dioxane, to yield alkene compounds of Formula V, which are typically isolated as mixtures of E and Z geometric isomers (Step 3). This reaction, commonly known as the Wittig olefination reaction, has been reviewed extensively in the literature (\nChem. Rev. \n1989, 89, 863; \nModern Carbonyl Olefination \n2004, 1-17; \nLiebigs Ann. Chem. \n1997, 1283).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Step 4, compounds of Formula W, wherein X, Z, R\n2a \nand R\n5 \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I, are formed from compounds of Formula V via hydrogenation in the presence of transition metal catalysts. Common catalysts include the use of 5-20% palladium on carbon or 5-20% palladium hydroxide on carbon. These reactions can be conducted in a similar manner as described for Step 3 of Scheme 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively compounds of Formula W, wherein X, Z, and R\n2a \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I, may be prepared from aldehydes of Formula H via Wittig reaction with triphenylphosphonium salts of Formula AA (Step 5, Scheme 3). As for Step 3, this reaction produces alkene compounds of Formula V, which again are typically isolated as mixtures of E and Z geometric isomers, and may be converted to compounds of Formula W, wherein X, Z, R\n2a \nand R\n5 \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I, by hydrogenation. The salts of Formula AA are obtained in a similar manner to that used for preparing salts of Formula T via conversion of the corresponding alcohol to the bromide and subsequent reaction with triphenylphosphine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of Formula BB shown below, wherein X, Z, R\n1 \nand R\n2a \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I, can be prepared from secondary alcohols of Formula J (see Scheme 2) or ketones of Formula M (see Scheme 2) through reaction sequences similar to those shown in Scheme 3. Conversion of compounds of Formula J to the corresponding bromides, followed by Wittig olefination with aldehydes of general formula X—CHO, wherein X is as defined for compounds of Formula I, provides alkenes of Formula CC. Alkenes of Formula CC may also be obtained via Wittig reaction of ketones of Formula M with salts of the general structure X—CH\n2\n—PPh\n3\n \n+\nBr\n−\n. The alkenes of Formula CC are then converted to compounds of Formula BB, wherein X, Z, R\n1 \nand R\n2a \nare as defined for compounds of Formula I, by hydrogenation.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances it is possible to change the order of steps shown in \nSchemes\n 1, 2 and 3. For example, in \nScheme\n 1, it is sometimes possible to introduce the cyano group on the pyrazole ring as the last step, i.e., inverting the order in which Steps 4 and 5 are carried out. Also, in certain cases, it is preferable to introduce or modify substituents R\n3 \non the group X (wherein R\n3 \nand X are as defined for compounds of Formula I) later in the synthesis, even as the last step. For example, when R\n3 \nis SO\n2\nR\n7\n, the SO\n2\nR\n7 \ngroup may be in formed in the last step by oxidation of the corresponding compound bearing a substituent of general formula S—R\n7\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of Formula I wherein R\n2a \nand R\n2b \nare fluoro may be prepared according to sequences analogous to those shown in \nSchemes\n 1, 2 and 3 starting with 3,3-difluoro-4,4-dihydroxy 1-\npiperidine carboxylic acid\n 1,1-dimethylethyl ester (WO 2008121687). In a manner similar to that described for the preparation of intermediates of formula A in \nScheme\n 1, this material may be converted to hydrazine derivatives of formula DD, which are then used similarly to the intermediates of formula A in \nScheme\n 1 for the preparation of compounds of Formula I wherein R\n2a \nand R\n2-b \nare fluoro.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is readily apparent to one skilled in the art, protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary or secondary amine) of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino-protecting groups (NH-Pg) include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ) and 9-fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). Similarly, a “hydroxy-protecting group” refers to a substituent of a hydroxy group that blocks or protects the hydroxy functionality. Suitable hydroxyl-protecting groups (O-Pg) include for example, allyl, acetyl, silyl, benzyl, para-methoxybenzyl, trityl, and the like. The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene, \nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis, \nJohn Wiley & Sons, New York, 1991.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, some of the compounds of this invention are acidic and they form salts with pharmaceutically acceptable cations. Some of the compounds of this invention are basic and form salts with pharmaceutically acceptable anions. All such salts are within the scope of this invention and they can be prepared by conventional methods such as combining the acidic and basic entities, usually in a stoichiometric ratio, in either an aqueous, non-aqueous or partially aqueous medium, as appropriate. The salts are recovered either by filtration, by precipitation with a non-solvent followed by filtration, by evaporation of the solvent, or, in the case of aqueous solutions, by lyophilization, as appropriate. The compounds are obtained in crystalline form according to procedures known in the art, such as by dissolution in an appropriate solvent(s) such as ethanol, hexanes or water/ethanol mixtures\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, some of the compounds exist as isomers. These isomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual isomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereoisomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column. Alternatively, the specific stereoisomers may be synthesized by using an optically active starting material, by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting one stereoisomer into the other by asymmetric transformation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, iodine, and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n11\nC, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n13\nN, \n15\nN, \n15\nO, \n17\nO, \n18\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, \n123\nI, \n125\nI and \n36\nCl, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention (e.g., those labeled with \n3\nH and \n14\nC) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Certain isotopically labeled ligands including tritium, \n14\nC, \n35\nS and \n125\nI could be useful in radioligand binding assays. Tritiated (i.e., \n3\nH) and carbon-14 (i.e., \n14\nC) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as \n15\nO, \n13\nN, \n11\nC, and \n18\nF are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of the present invention may exist in more than one crystal form (generally referred to as “polymorphs”). Polymorphs may be prepared by crystallization under various conditions, for example, using different solvents or different solvent mixtures for recrystallization; crystallization at different temperatures; and/or various modes of cooling, ranging from very fast to very slow cooling during crystallization. Polymorphs may also be obtained by heating or melting the compound of the present invention followed by gradual or fast cooling. The presence of polymorphs may be determined by solid probe NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction or such other techniques.\n\n\n \nMedical Uses\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention modulate the activity of G-protein-coupled receptor GPR119.

The source of supply is provided in parenthesis.\n\n\n \nIn-Vitro Functional Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nβ-lactamase:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay for GPR119 agonists utilizes a cell-based (hGPR119 HEK293-CRE beta-lactamase) reporter construct where agonist activation of human GPR119 is coupled to beta-lactamase production via a cyclic AMP response element (CRE). GPR119 activity is then measured utilizing a FRET-enabled beta-lactamase substrate, CCF4-AM (Live Blazer FRET-B/G Loading kit, Invitrogen cat #K1027). Specifically, hGPR119-HEK-CRE-beta-lactamase cells (Invitrogen 2.5×10\n7\n/mL) were removed from liquid nitrogen storage, and diluted in plating medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium high glucose (DMEM; Gibco Cat #11995-065), 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS; Sigma Cat #F4135), 1× MEM Nonessential amino acids (Gibco Cat #15630-080), 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (Gibco Cat #15630-080), 200 nM potassium clavulanate (Sigma Cat #P3494). The cell concentration was adjusted using cell plating medium and 50 microL of this cell suspension (12.5×10\n4 \nviable cells) was added into each well of a black, clear bottom, poly-d-lysine coated 384-well plate (Greiner Bio-One cat #781946) and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment containing 5% carbon dioxide. After 4 hours the plating medium was removed and replaced with 40 microL of assay medium (Assay medium is plating medium without potassium clavulanate and HIFBS). Varying concentrations of each compound to be tested was then added in a volume of 10 microL (final DMSO≦0.5%) and the cells were incubated for 16 hours at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment containing 5% carbon dioxide. Plates were removed from the incubator and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for approximately 15 minutes. 10 microL of 6×CCF4/AM working dye solution (prepared according to instructions in the Live Blazer FRET-B/G Loading kit, Invitrogen cat #K1027) was added per well and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours in the dark. Fluorescence was measured on an EnVision fluorimetric plate reader, excitation 405 nm, emission 460 nm/535 nm. EC\n50 \ndeterminations were made from agonist-response curves analyzed with a curve fitting program using a 4-parameter logistic dose-response equation.\n\n\n \n \ncAMP:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGPR119 agonist activity was also determined with a cell-based assay utilizing an HTRF (Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence) cAMP detection kit (cAMP dynamic 2 Assay Kit; Cis Bio cat #62AM4PEC) that measures cAMP levels in the cell. The method is a competitive immunoassay between native cAMP produced by the cells and the cAMP labeled with the dye d2. The tracer binding is visualized by a Mab anti-cAMP labeled with Cryptate. The specific signal (i.e. energy transfer) is inversely proportional to the concentration of cAMP in either standard or sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, hGPR119 HEK-CRE beta-lactamase cells (Invitrogen 2.5×10\n7\n/mL; the same cell line used in the beta-lactamase assay described above) are removed from cryopreservation and diluted in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium high glucose (DMEM; Gibco Cat #11995-065), 1% charcoal dextran treated fetal bovine serum (CD serum; HyClone Cat #SH30068.03), 1× MEM Nonessential amino acids (Gibco Cat #15630-080) and 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (Gibco Cat #15630-080)). The cell concentration was adjusted to 1.5×10\n5 \ncells/mL and 30 mLs of this suspension was added to a T-175 flask and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment in 5% carbon dioxide. After 16 hours (overnight), the cells were removed from the T-175 flask (by rapping the side of the flask), centrifuged at 800×g and then re-suspended in assay medium (1× HBSS+CaCl\n2\n+MgCl\n2 \n(Gibco Cat #14025-092) and 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (Gibco Cat #15630-080)). The cell concentration was adjusted to 6.25×10\n5 \ncells/mL with assay medium and 8 μl of this cell suspension (5000 cells) was added to each well of a white Greiner 384-well, low-volume assay plate (VWR cat #82051-458).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarying concentrations of each compound to be tested were diluted in assay buffer containing 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthin (IBMX; Sigma cat #I5879) and added to the assay plate wells in a volume of 2 microL (final IBMX concentration was 400 microM and final DMSO concentration was 0.58%). Following 30 minutes incubation at room temperature, 5 microL of labeled d2 cAMP and 5 microL of anti-cAMP antibody (both diluted 1:20 in cell lysis buffer; as described in the manufacturers assay protocol) were added to each well of the assay plate. The plates were then incubated at room temperature and after 60 minutes, changes in the HTRF signal were read with an Envision 2104 multilabel plate reader using excitation of 330 nm and emissions of 615 and 665 nm. Raw data were converted to nM cAMP by interpolation from a cAMP standard curve (as described in the manufacturer's assay protocol) and EC50 determinations were made from an agonist-response curves analyzed with a curve fitting program using a 4-parameter logistic dose response equation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is recognized that cAMP responses due to activation of GPR119 could be generated in cells other than the specific cell line used herein.\n\n\n \nβ-Arrestin:\n\n\n \n \n \nGPR119 agonist activity was also determined with a cell-based assay utilizing DiscoverX PathHunter β-arrestin cell assay technology and their U2OS hGPR119 β-arrestin cell line (DiscoverX Cat #93-0356C3). In this assay, agonist activation is determined by measuring agonist-induced interaction of 13-arrestin with activated GPR119. A small, 42 amino acid enzyme fragment, called ProLink was appended to the C-terminus of GPR119. Arrestin was fused to the larger enzyme fragment, termed EA (Enzyme Acceptor). Activation of GPR119 stimulates binding of arrestin and forces the complementation of the two enzyme fragments, resulting in formation of a functional β-galactosidase enzyme capable of hydrolyzing substrate and generating a chemiluminescent signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, U2OS hGPR119 β-arrestin cells (\nDiscoverX\n 1×10\n7\n/mL) are removed from cryopreservation and diluted in growth medium (Minimum essential medium (MEM; Gibco Cat #11095-080), 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS; Sigma Cat #F4135-100), 100 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma Cat #S8636), 500 microg/mL G418 (Sigma Cat #G8168) and 250 microg/mL Hygromycin B (Invitrogen Cat #10687-010). The cell concentration was adjusted to 1.66×10\n5 \ncells/mL and 30 mLs of this suspension was added to a T-175 flask and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment in 5% carbon dioxide. After 48 hours, the cells were removed from the T-175 flask with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Gibco cat #13151-014), centrifuged at 800×g and then re-suspended in plating medium (Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen/BRL Cat #31985-070) and 2% charcoal dextran treated fetal bovine serum (CD serum; HyClone Cat #SH30068.03). The cell concentration was adjusted to 2.5×10\n5 \ncells/mL with plating medium and 10 microL of this cell suspension (2500 cells) was added to each well of a white Greiner 384-well low volume assay plate (VWR cat #82051-458) and the plates were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment in 5% carbon dioxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter 16 hours (overnight) the assay plates were removed from the incubator and varying concentrations of each compound to be tested (diluted in assay buffer (1× HBSS+CaCl\n2\n+MgCl\n2 \n(Gibco Cat #14025-092), 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (Gibco Cat #15630-080) and 0.1% BSA (Sigma Cat #A9576)) were added to the assay plate wells in a volume of 2.5 microL (final DMSO concentration was 0.5%). After a 90 minute incubation at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment in 5% carbon dioxide, 7.5 microL of Galacton Star β-galactosidase substrate (PathHunter Detection Kit (DiscoveRx Cat #93-0001); prepared as described in the manufacturers assay protocol) was added to each well of the assay plate. The plates were incubated at room temperature and after 60 minutes, changes in the luminescence were read with an Envision 2104 multilabel plate reader at 0.1 seconds per well. EC50 determinations were made from an agonist-response curves analyzed with a curve fitting program using a 4-parameter logistic dose response equation.\n\n\n \nExpression of GPR119 using BacMam and GPR119 Binding Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nWild-type human GPR119 (\nFIG. 1\n) was amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Pfu Turbo Mater Mix, Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) using pIRES-puro-hGPR119 as a template and the following primers:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhGPR119 BamH1, Upper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-TAAATTGGATCCACCATGGAATCATCTTTCTCATTTGGAG-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(inserts a BamHI site at the 5′ end)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhGPR119 EcoRI, Lower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-TAAATTGAATTCTTATCAGCCATCAAACTCTGAGC-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(inserts a EcoRI site at the 3′ end)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amplified product was purified (Qiaquick Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) and digested with BamH1 and EcoRI (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, Mass.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The vector pFB-VSVG-CMV-poly (\nFIG. 2\n) was digested with BamHI and EcoRI (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, Mass.). The digested DNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel; the fragments were excised from the gel and purified (Qiaquick Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.). The vector and gene fragments were ligated (Rapid Ligase Kit, Roche, Pleasanton, Calif.) and transformed into OneShot DH5alpha T1R cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Eight ampicillin-resistant colonies (“clones 1-8”) were grown for miniprep (Qiagen Miniprep Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) and sequenced to confirm identity and correct insert orientation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pFB-VSVG-CMV-poly-hGPR119 construct (clone #1) was transformed into OneShot DH10Bac cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) according to manufacturers' protocols. Eight positive (i.e. white) colonies were re-streaked to confirm as “positives” and subsequently grown for bacmid isolation. The recombinant hGPR119 bacmid was isolated via a modified Alkaline Lysis procedure using the buffers from a Qiagen Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.). Briefly, pelleted cells were lysed in buffer P1, neutralized in buffer P2, and precipitated with buffer N3. Precipitate was pelleted via centrifugation (17,900×g for 10 minutes) and the supernatant was combined with isopropanol to precipitate the DNA. The DNA was pelleted via centrifugation (17,900×g for 30 minutes), washed once with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 50 μL buffer EB (Tris-HCL, pH 8.5). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with commercially available primers (M13F, M13R, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) was used to confirm the presence of the hGPR119 insert in the Bacmid.\n\n\n \n \nGeneration of hGPR119 Recombinant Baculovirus\n\n\n \nCreation of P0 Virus Stock\n\n\n \n \n \nSuspension adapted Sf9 cells grown in Sf900II medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) were transfected with 10 microL hGPR119 bacmid DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cellfectin, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). After five days of incubation, the conditioned medium (i.e. “P0” virus stock) was centrifuged and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter (Steriflip, Millipore, Billerica, Mass.).\n\n\n \nCreation of Frozen Virus (BIIC) Stocks\n\n\n \n \n \nFor long term virus storage and generation of working (i.e. “P1”) viral stocks, frozen BIIC (Baculovirus Infected Insect Cells) stocks were created as follows: suspension adapted Sf9 cells were grown in Sf900II medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and infected with hGPR119 P0 virus stock. After 24 hours of growth, the infected cells were gently centrifuged (approximately 100×g), resuspended in Freezing Medium (10% DMSO, 1% Albumin in Sf900II medium) to a final density of 1×10\n7 \ncells/mL and frozen according to standard freezing protocols in 1 mL aliquots.\n\n\n \nCreation of Working (“P1”) Virus Stock\n\n\n \n \n \nSuspension adapted Sf9 cells grown in Sf900II medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) were infected with a 1:100 dilution of a thawed hGPR119 BIIC stock and incubated for several days (27 degrees Celsius with shaking). When the viability of the cells reached 70%, the conditioned medium was harvested by centrifugation and the virus titer determined by ELISA (BaculoElisa Kit, Clontech, Mountain View, Calif.)\n\n\n \n \nOver-Expression of hGPR119 in Suspension-Adapted HEK 293FT Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHEK 293FT cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) were grown in a shake flask in 293Freestyle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 microg/mL neomycin and 10 mM HEPES (37 C, 8% carbon dioxide, shaking). The cells were centrifuged gently (approximately 500×g, 10 minutes) and the pellet resuspended in a mixture of Dulbecco's PBS (minus Mg++/−Ca++) supplemented with 18% fetal bovine serum (Sigma Aldrich) and P1 virus such that the multiplicity of infection (MOI) was 10 and the final cell density was 1.3×10\n6\n/mL (total volume 2.5 liters). The cells were transferred to a 5 liter Wave Bioreactor Wavebag (Wave Technologies, MA) and incubated for 4 hours at 27 degrees Celsius (17 rocks/min, 7 degrees platform angle); at the end of the incubation period, an equal volume(2.5 liters) of 293Freestyle medium supplemented with 30 mM sodium butyrate (Sigma Aldrich) was added (final concentration=15 mM), and the cells were grown for 20 hours (37 degrees Celsius, 8% CO2 [0.2 liters/min}, 25 rocks/minute, 7 degrees platform angle). Cells were harvested via centrifugation (3,000×g, 10 minutes), washed once on DPBS (minus Ca++/Mg++), resuspended in 0.25M sucrose, 25 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4 and frozen at −80 degrees Celsius.\n\n\n \nMembrane Preparation for Radioligand Binding Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nThe frozen cells were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 700×g (1400 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mL phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 10 minutes. The cell pellet was then resuspended in homogenization buffer (10 mM HEPES (Gibco #15630), pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA (BioSolutions, #BIO260-15), 1 mM EGTA (Sigma, #E-4378), 0.01 mg/mL benzamidine (Sigma #B 6506), 0.01 mg/mL bacitracin (Sigma #B 0125), 0.005 mg/mL leupeptin (Sigma #L 8511), 0.005 mg/mL aprotinin (Sigma #A 1153)) and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Cells were then lysed with 15 gentle strokes of a tight-fitting glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000×g (2200 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was transferred into fresh centrifuge tubes on ice. The cell pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer, and centrifuged again at 1000×g (2200 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius after which the supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in homogenization buffer. This process was repeated a third time, after which the supernatants were combined, Benzonase (Novagen #71206) and MgCl\n2 \n(Fluka #63020) were added to final concentrations of 1 U/mL and 6 mM, respectively, and incubated on ice for one hour. The solution was then centrifuged at 25,000×g (15000 rpm) for 20 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in fresh homogenization buffer (minus Benzonase and MgCl\n2\n). After repeating the 25,000×g centrifugation step, the final membrane pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer and frozen at −80 degrees Celsius. The protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Pierce reagents A #23223 and B #23224).\n\n\n \nSynthesis and Purification of [\n3\nH]-Compound A\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound A (isopropyl 4-(1-(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-3a,7a-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-yloxy)piperidine-1-carboxylate, as shown above) (4 mg, 0.009 mmol) was dissolved in 0.5 mL of dichloromethane, and the resulting solution was treated with (1,5-cyclooctadiene)(pyridine)(tricyclohexylphosphine)-iridium(1) hexaflurophosphate (\nJ.
