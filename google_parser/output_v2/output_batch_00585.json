Description\n\n\n\n\n PYRAZOLE COMPOUNDS AS CRTH2 ANTAGONISTS \n\n\nThe present invention relates to pyrazole compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof having CRTH2 antagonistic activity, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein W, L\n1\n, L\n2\n, L\n3\n, Y, R\n1\n and R\n2\n have one of the meanings given in the specification, to the use of said compounds as medicaments; to pharmaceutical formulations, containing said compounds, and to pharmaceutical formulations, containing said compounds in combination with one or more active substances. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nProstaglandin D2 (PGD2) is an eicosanoid generated by the metabolism of arachidonic acids upon stimulation of inflammatory cells with allergens, inflammatory stimuli or by tissue damage. PGD2 is primarily released by mast cells with Th2 cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages being secondary sources. PGD2 is the major arachidonic acid metabolite produced by mast cells upon allergen challenge (Lewis et al., J. Immunol. 1982, 129:1627- 1631 ) and has been detected in high concentrations in the airways of asthmatic patients (Murray et al, N Engl J Med, 1986, 315:800-804; Liu et al., Am Rev Respir Dis, 1990, 142 126-132; Zehr et al., Chest, 1989, 95:1059-63; Wenzel et al., J Allergy Clin Immunol, 1991 , 87540-548). PGD2 production is also increased in patients with systemic mastocytosis (Roberts N. Engl. J. Med. 1980, 303, 1400-1404; Butterfield et al., Int Arch Allergy Immunol, 2008,147:338-343) allergic rhinitis (Naclerio et al., Am Rev Respir Dis, 1983, 128:597-602; Brown et al., Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, 1987, 1 13:179-183; Lebel et al., J Allergy Clin Immunol, 1988, 82:869-877), urticaria (Heavy et al., J Allergy Clin Immunol, 1986, 78:458-461 ), chronic rhinosinusitis (Yoshimura et al., Allergol Int, 2008, 57:429-436), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Csanky et al., Electrophoresis, 2009, 30:1228-1234) and during anaphylaxis (Ono et al., Clin Exp Allergy, 2009, 39:72-80). \n\n Instillation of PGD2 into airways can provoke features of asthmatic response including bronchoconstriction (Hardy et al., 1984, N Engl J. Med 31 1 :209-213; Sampson et al 1997, Thorax 52: 513-518) and eosinophil accumulation (Emery et al., 1989, J. Applied Physiol 67: 959-962). The potential of PGD2 to trigger inflammatory responses has been confirmed by the overexpression of human PGD2 synthase in mice resulting in elevated eosinophil lung inflammation and Th2 cytokine production in response to allergen (Fujitani et al, 2002 J. Immunol. 168:443-449). \n\n\nPGD2 is an agonist of two 7-transmembrane type G protein-coupled receptors, the PGD2 receptor DP1 (Boie et al., J Biol Chem, 1995, 270:18910-6) and the recently identified CRTH2 (chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells) receptor (also referred to as DP2 receptor) (Nagata et al., J. Immunol., 1999, 162:1278-86). \n\n\nCRTH2 is expressed on Th2 cells, eosinophils, basophils and mast cells (Nagata et al., FEBS Lett, 1999, 459: 195-199; Nagata et al., J Immunol, 1999, 162: 1278-1286; Cosmi et al., Eur J Immunol, 2000, 30:2972-2979; Boehme et al., Int Immunol, 2009, 21 : 621 -32). Using selective CRTH2 agonists like 13,14 dihydro-15-keto-PGD2 (DK-PGD2) and 15R- methyl-PGD2, it has been shown that CRTH2 activation initiates cellular processes that lead to the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells (Spik et al., J. Immunol., \n\n\n2005;174:3703-8; Shiraishi, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 2005, 312:954-60; Monneret et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 2003, 304:349-355). Using CRTH2 selective antagonists it has been shown that inflammatory responses and pathophysiological changes in animal models of diseases like asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and COPD can be diminished (Uller et al., Respir Res. 2007, 8:16; Lukacs et al., Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2008, 295:L767-79; Stearns, Bioorg. Med Chem Lett. 2009,19:4647-51 ; Nomiya, J Immunol, 2008, 180:5680-5688; Boehme et al., Int Immunol, 2009, 21 :1 -17; Boehme et al., Int Immunol, 2009, 21 :81 -93; Takeshita et al., Int Immunol, 2004, 16:947-59; Stebbins et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2009). Moreover, genetic deletion of CRTH2 in mice diminished inflammatory responses in animal models of allergy (Shiraishi et al., J Immunol. 2008;180:541 -549; Oiwa, Clin Exp Allergy, 2008, 38:1357-66; Satoh et al., J Immunol, 2006,177:2621 -9). In contrast, the selective DP1 agonist BW245C does not promote inflammatory responses, like migration or activation of Th2 lymphocytes, basophils or eosinophils (Yoshimura-Uchiyama et al., Clin Exp Allergy, 2004, 34:1283-90; Xue et al., Immunol, 2005, 175:6531 -6; Gervais et al., J Allergy Clin Immunol, 2001 , 108:982-8).

Preferably, these substances have no pharmacological effect or, in connection with the desired therapy, no appreciable or at least no undesirable pharmacological effect. The excipients and additives include, for example, surfactants such as soya lecithin, oleic acid, sorbitan esters, such as polysorbates, polyvinylpyrrolidone, other stabilizers, complexing agents, antioxidants and/or preservatives which guarantee or prolong the shelf life of the finished pharmaceutical formulation, flavorings, vitamins and/or other additives known in the art. The additives also include pharmacologically acceptable salts such as sodium chloride as isotonic agents. \n\n\nThe preferred excipients include antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, for example, provided that it has not already been used to adjust the pH, vitamin A, vitamin E, tocopherols and similar vitamins and provitamins occurring in the human body. \n\n\nPreservatives may be used to protect the formulation from contamination with pathogens. Suitable preservatives are those which are known in the art, particularly cetyl pyridinium chloride, benzalkonium chloride or benzoic acid or benzoates such as sodium benzoate in the concentration known from the prior art. The preservatives mentioned above are \n\n preferably present in concentrations of up to 50 mg/100 ml, more preferably between 5 and 20 mg/100 ml. \n\n\nThe dosage of the compounds according to the invention is naturally highly dependent on the method of administration and the complaint which is being treated.

To produce cell membranes the CHO-K1 - hCRTH2 cells are cultured in suspension in CHO SFMII medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418. The cells are harvested by centrifugation at 300 g for 10 min at room temperature. The cell pellet is resuspended in Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) including a \n\n protease inhibitor mix (Complete, Roche) and adjusted to a concentration of 10E7 cells/ml. The CHO-K1 -hCRTH2 cells are disrupted by nitrogen decomposition to obtain the membrane preparation. Cell debris is removed by centrifugation (500 g at 4°C, 30 min) and the supernatant is transferred into fresh tubes followed by a second centrifugation at 40000 g for 1 h at 4 °C to sediment the membranes. The membranes are suspended in SPA incubation buffer (50mM Tris HCI, 10 mM MgCI\n2\n, 150 mM NaCI, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) without bovine serum albumin, homogenized by passing through a single use needle (Terumo, 23Gx1 \"), and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. \n\n\nThe CRTH2 receptor binding assay is performed in a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) format with the radioligand [\n3\nH]-PGD\n2\n (Perkin Elmer, NET616000MC). CHO-K1 -hCRTH2 cell membranes are again homogenized by passing through a single use needle (Terumo, 23Gx1 \") and diluted in SPA incubation buffer in suitable concentrations (0.5 -10 μg protein/well). The SPA assay is set up in 96 well microtiter plates (Perkin Elmer, CatNo. 6005040) in SPA incubation buffer with a final volume of 200 μΙ per well and final \n\n\nconcentration of 50 mM Tris-HCI, 10 mM MgCI\n2\n, 150 mM NaCI, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.4, 0.1 % bovine serum albumin). The SPA assay mixture contains 60 μΙ of the membrane suspension, 80 μΙ of Wheat Germ Agglutinin coated PVT beads (GE Healthcare, RPNQ-0001 , 0.3 mg/well) , 40 μΙ of [3H]-PGD\n2\n diluted in SPA buffer to a final concentration of 1 nM (50 000 dpm) and 20 μΙ of the test compound (dissolved in dimethylsulfoxid). The SPA assay mixture is incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Bound radioactivity is determined with a scintillation counter (Micro Beta Trilux, Wallac). \n\n\n The binding of [\n3\nH]-PGD\n2\n to CHO-K1 -hCRTH2 cell membranes is determined in the absence (total binding, Bo) and presence (non-specific binding, NSB) of unlabelled PGD\n2\n (1 μΜ, Cayman Chemical, Cat No 12010) or a reference CRTH2 antagonist (10 μΜ CAY10471 , Cayman Chemical, Cat No 10006735). \n\n\n Determination of the affinity of a test compound is calculated by subtraction of the nonspecific binding (NSB) from the total binding (Bo) or the binding in the presence of the test compound (B) at a given compound concentration. The NSB value is set to 100% inhibition. The Bo-NSB value is set to 0% inhibition. \n\n\n% inhibition values were obtained at a defined compound concentration, e.g. at 1 μΜ, % inhibition of the test compound was calculated by the formula 100-((B-NSB)\n*\n100/(Bo- NSB)). % inhibition values above 100% are founded by assay variance. \n\n The dissociation constant K, was calculated by iterative fitting of experimental data obtained at several compound concentrations over a dose range from 0.1 to 30 000 nM using the law of mass action based program \"easy sys\" (Schittkowski, Num Math 68, 129-142 (1994)). \n\n\nCRTH2 CAMP FUNCTIONAL ASSAY PROTOCOL \n\n\nThe assay is conducted in CHO-K1 -hCRTH2 cells. Intracellular cAMP is generated by stimulating the cells with 10 μΜ Forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator. PGD2 is added to activate the CRTH2 receptor which results in the attenuation of the forskolin-induced cAMP generation. Test compounds are tested for their ability to inhibit the PGD2-mediated attenuation of the Forskolin-induced cAMP generation in CHO-K1 -hCRTH2 cells. \n\n\nCHO-K1 -hCRTH2 cells are cultured in roller bottles in CHO SFMII medium supplemented with 400ug/ml G418. The cells are harvested by centrifugation at 300 g for 10 min at room temperature. The cell pellet is washed and suspended in PBS. The cells are adjusted to a final concentration of 4x10E6 cells/ ml. \n\n\n Test compounds are diluted in dimethylsulfoxid and tested at several compound \n\n\nconcentrations over a dose range from 0.1 to 3 000 nM. \n\n\n The cAMP levels are determined by an AlphaScreen cAMP assay (Perkin Elmer CatNo. 6760625M) in 384 well optiplates (PerkinElmer, CatNo. 6007290) with a total assay volume of 50 μΙ. 10 μΙ of cells (40.000 cells per well) are incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μΙ of a stimulation mix containing a final concentration of 10μΜ Forskolin, 30 nM PGD2, 0.5 mM IBMX, 5 mM HEPES, I xHBSS buffer, 0.1 % BSA, adjusted to pH 7.4, and the test compound at various concentrations. Thereafter, 30 μΙ of a lysis and detection mix is added containing SA donor beads, biotinylated cAMP, anti-cAMP acceptor beads, 0.3% Tweeen-20, 5 mM HEPES, 0.1 % BSA, adjusted to pH 7.4. After 2 h incubation time the AlphaScreen signal is read on an AlphaQuest-HTS instrument. The IC\n50\n values are calculated by using the Prism software. \n\n\nOTHER CRTH2 FUNCTIONAL ASSAY PROTOCOLS \n\n\nThe ability of the tested compounds to antagonise the functional effects of PGD2 at the CRTH2 receptor may also be demonstrated by methodology known in the art, such as by a whole cell binding assay, a GTPgS assay, a BRET assay, an inositol phosphate \n\n accumulation assay, an CRTH2 cell surface expression assay, a Ca\n2+\n influx assay, an ERK phosphorylation assay, an cell migration assay, an eosinophil shape change assay, a Th2 cell degranulation assay, or a basophil activation assay as described by Mathiesen et al., Mol Pharmacol. 2005, 68:393-402; Mimura et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 2005, 314:244-51 ; Sandham et al., Bioorg Med Chem Lett, 2007,17:4347-50; Sandham Bioorg Med Chem Lett, 2009,19:4794-8; Crosignani et al., J Med Chem, 2008, 51 :2227-43; Royer et al., Eur J Clin Invest, 2008, 38:663-71 ; Boehme et al., Int Immunol, 2009, 21 :621 -32; Sugimoto et al., Pharmacol Exp Ther, 2003, 305:347-52; Monneret et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 2005, 312:627-34; Xue et al., J Immunol, 2005,175:6531 -6. \n\n\nCell lines for expressing the CRTH2 receptor include those naturally expressing the CRTH2 receptor, such as AML14.3D10 and NCI-H292 cells (Sawyer et al., Br J Pharmacol, 2002, 137:1 163-72; Chiba et al., Int Arch Allergy Immunol, 2007,143 Suppl 1 :23-7), those induced to express the CRTH2 receptor by the addition of chemicals, such as HL-60 or AML14.3D10 cells treated with, for example, butyric acid (Sawyer et al., Br J Pharmacol, 2002, 137:1 163- 72) or a cell line engineered to express a recombinant CRTH2 receptor, such as L1.2, CHO, HEK-293, K562 or CEM cells (Liu et al., Bioorg Med Chem Lett, 2009,19:6840-4; Sugimoto et al., Pharmacol Exp Ther, 2003, 305:347-52; Hata et al., Mol Pharmacol, 2005, 67:640-7; Nagata et al., FEBS Lett, 1999, 459:195-9). \n\n\nFinally, blood or tissue cells, for example human peripheral blood eosinophils, isolated using methods as described by Hansel et al., J Immunol Methods, 1991 , 145,105-1 10, or human Th2 cells isolated and treated as described by Xue et al., J Immunol, 2005,175:6531 -6, or human basophils isolated and characterized as described by Monneret et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 2005, 312:627-34 can be utilized in such assays. \n\n\nIn particular, the compounds of the present invention have activity in binding to the CRTH2 receptor in the aforementioned assays and inhibit the activation of CRTH2 by CRTH2 ligands. As used herein, \"activity\" is intended to mean a compound demonstrating an inhibition of 50% at 1 μΜ or higher in inhibition, or a K, value < 1 μΜ, when measured in the aforementioned assays.
