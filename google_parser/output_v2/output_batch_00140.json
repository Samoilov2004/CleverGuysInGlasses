Through this mechanism, they induce an extended wakefullness, an improvement in cognitive processes, a reduction in food intake and a normalization of vestibular reflexes (Schwartz et al., Physiol. Rev., 1991, 71: 1-51).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhence these agents are potentially useful in several central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer disease, mood and attention alterations, cognitive deficits in psychiatric pathologies, obesity, vertigo and motion sickness. Histamine H\n3\n-receptor agonists are known to inhibit the release of several neurotransmitters including histamine, monoamines and neuropeptides and thereby exert sedative and sleep-promoting effects in brain. In peripheral tissues, H3-receptor agonists exert namely anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, gastro-intestinal, antisecretory smooth muscle decontracting activities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll the H\n3 \nreceptor antagonist or agonist compounds known so far resemble histamine in possessing an imidazole ring generally monosubstituted in 4 (5)-position (Ganellin et al., Ars Pharmaceutica, 1995, 36: 3,455-468; Stark et al., Drug of the Future, 1996, 21 (5), 507-520).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous patents and patent applications are directed to antagonist and/or agonist compounds having such structure, in particular EP 197 840, EP 494 010, WO 93/14070, WO 96/29315, WO 92/15 567, WO 93/20061, WO 93/20062, WO 95/11894, U.S. Pat.

Takigawa et al., JP 06 345 642 (20 Dec. 1994)) were suggested to display H\n3\n-receptor antagonism but all these compounds have only very low potency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese compounds were previously known as therapeutic agent before the discovery and characterization of the histamine H\n3\n-receptor, in particular as neuro-active agents for example as neuroleptic (clozapine) or psychotomimetic (Phencyclidine) agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen tested at the H\n3\n-receptor, these compounds were shown to display much lower potency than the imidazole-containing compounds described in patent applications quoted above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAttempts at replacing the imidazole ring was generally not successful and no potent H\n3\n-receptor ligands not containing such ring was reported in the literature up to now.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese investigations showed the importance of the 4(5)-imidazole moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe objective of the invention is to provide new potent H\n3\n-receptor ligands which may reduce the above-mentioned drawbacks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides new compounds, the structure of which does not contain an imidazole moiety, which are useful as histamine H\n3\n-receptor ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention have the following general formula (A):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nin which:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nW is a residue which imparts antagonistic and/or agonistic activity at histamine H\n3\n-receptors when attached to an imidazole ring in 4(5)-position;\n \nR\n1 \nand R\n2 \nmay be identical or different and represent each independently\n        \n \na lower alkyl or cycloalkyl,\n\n\nor taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached,\n\n \na saturated nitrogen-containing ring\n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwith m ranging from 2 to 8, or\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na non-aromatic unsaturated nitrogen-containing ring\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwith p and q being from 0 to 3 independently and r being from 0 to 4, provided that p and q are not simulteously 0 and 2≦p+q+r≦8,\n\n\nR\na-d \nbeing independently a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, or carboalkoxy group, or\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na morpholino group, or\n \na N-substituted piperazino group:\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwith R being a lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, carboalkoxy, aryl, arylalkyl, an alkanoyl or aroyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventors have found, surprisingly, that antagonist and/or agonist compounds can be obtained by substituting a di(alkyl) or (cycloalkyl)amine, or a non-aromatic nitrogen-containing ring —NR\n1\nR\n2 \nas above-defined for the imidazole ring, in known antagonist and/or agonist imidazole derivatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also believed that antagonist and/or agonist activity can be foreseen, by equivalence, for compounds according to formula (A) having a W residue of imidazole derivatives which were suggested in the prior art as H\n3 \nantagonists or agonists, and further for those W residues which would belong to future imidazole derivatives having substantial H\n3 \nantagonist and/or agonist activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, the inventors have observed that such non-imidazole analogues can provide potent antagonist and/or agonist activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this regards, they have prepared novel non-imidazole alkylamines analogues of formula (A) corresponding to known imidazole derivatives in particular from the above-mentioned prior art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to the addition salts which the compounds form with pharmaceutically acceptable acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts comprise the nontoxic salt of inorganic or organic acids. Examples of these salts include the hydrochloride, the hydrobromide or the hydrogen maleate or hydrogen oxalate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also encompasses the hydrates of the compounds, the hydrated salts of these compounds and the polymorphic crystalline structures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compounds can exist in one or a number of isomeric forms according to the number of asymmetric centres in the molecule, the invention relates both to all the optical isomers and to their racemic modifications and the corresponding diastereoisomers. The separation of the diastereoisomers and/or of the optical isomers can be carried out according to methods known per se.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also encompasses all the possible tautomeric forms of the compounds, whether these tautomers occur in isolated form or in the form of mixtures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, lower alkyl or cycloalkyl is intended to mean a linear or branched alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a saturated carbocycle containing 3 to 6 carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically examples of lower alkyl are methyl, ethyl,

one substituent, 5 this latter is preferably in beta position with respect to the nitrogen-atom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor nitrogen-containing ring bearing two substituents, beta-beta substitution is preferred, especially when these two substituents are in trans-relation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, piperidyl or pyrrolidinyl moiety substituted in beta or beta-beta position,

anti-inflammatory actions (gastric and duodenal ulcers, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel, faecal incontinence, and the like), conditions of the urogenital system (cystitis, metritis, premenstrual syndrome, prostatic inflammations, urinary incontinence, genital disorders) and conditions of the cutaneous system (urticaria, itching). The anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect may usefully be turned to good account in the treatment of arthritis and other rheumatic conditions, conjunctivitis and other ocular inflammations, and sialorrhoea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds which are histamine H\n3 \nreceptor agonists or partial agonists are advantageously used as active principle of medicinal products, in particular having mild sedative, antisecretory, anti-inflammatory, steep-regulating and anticonvulsant effects, regulatory effects on hypothalamohypophyseal secretion, anti-depressant effects, modulatory effects on cerebral circulation, modulatory effects on the immune system, and anti-allergic and antimigraine effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHence the present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions which contain as active principle a therapeutically effective amount of one of the agonist or partial agonist compounds of formule (A).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to medicaments having the above-mentioned effects comprising as active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (A).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates more particularly to such medicaments containing a compound of formula (I) to (XVIII).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing as active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound (A) together with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is directed to such pharmaceutical compositions containing as active-ingredient, a compound of formula (I) to (XVIII).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe medicaments or pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be administered via oral, parenteral or topical routes, the active ingredient being combined with a therapeutically suitable excipient or vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, oral administration is advantageously used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother subject of the present invention is the use of the compounds of formula (A) for the preparation of H\n3\n-antagonist and/or agonist medicaments according to the above-mentioned forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further relates to the use of the compounds of formula (A) for preparing medicaments having the pre-cited effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also concerns the use of a compound of formula (I) to (XVIII).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill another subject of the invention is a method for the treatment of precited ailments comprising administering a therapeutically effective dose of a compound (I), optionally in combination with a therapeutically acceptable vehicle or excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is also directed to such a method comprising administering a therapeutically effective dose of a compound of formula (I) to (XVIII).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor each of the above-indications, the amount of the active ingredient will depend upon the condition of the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, a suitable effective dose will be in general in the range of from 10 to 500 mg per day and of from 1 to 10 mg/day for particularly active compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese doses are given on the basis of the compound and should be adapted for the salts, hydrates or hydrated salts thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is now illustrated by the following examples.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe structure of the synthesized compounds and their method of preparation as well as their melting point, recrystalisation solvant and elemental analysis are summarized in the following Table I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFORMULA\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSTRUCTURE\n\n\nmp\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nNAME\n\n\n(recryst. solv)\n\n\nanalysis (calc.)\n\n\nmethod\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n143-145° C.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1992, 263:304-310). The H\n3 \npotency of agonists is measured by the inhibition of tritiated histamine release and that of antagonists by the progressive reversal of release inhibition by the selective H\n3 \nagonist (R)α-methylhistamine (Arrang et al., Nature, 1987, 327: 117-123).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInteraction of compounds with the H\n3 \nreceptor are evidenced in vitro on guinea-pig ileum by the procedure described by Ligneau et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 271, 452-459 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, longitudinal muscle strips from guinea-pig small intestine were dissected out and incubated in a gassed O\n2\n/CO\n2 \n(95%/5%) modified Krebs-Ringer's bicarbonate medium at +37° C. in presence of 1 μM mepyramine to block the H\n1 \nreceptor. After equilibration, contractile activity under stimulation (rectangular pulses of 15 V, 0.5 msec, 0.1 Hz) was recorded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConcentration-response curves of the effect of (R)α-Methylhistamine alone or together with the antagonist were established.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effects of agonists and antagonists were estimated in vivo by the measurement of the tele-methylhistamine level variations in the brain of mice (Garbarg et al., J. Neurochem., 1989, 53: 1724-1730). At various time after p.o. administration of the compounds, the effect of agonists and antagonists are evidenced by the decrease and increase respectively in telemethylhistamine level induced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe changes are compared to those induced by reference compounds given in high dosage and this allows the calculation of the ED\n50 \nvalue for each compound which correspond to the dose responsible for an half maximal effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are listed here-below or reported in the following tables II and III:\n\n \n \n \nexample 59: 1-[3-(4-cyanophenoxy)propyl]piperidine, ED\n50\n=0.02 mg/kg\n \nexample 74: 1-[3-(4-buyrylphenoxy)propyl]piperidine, ED\n50\n=0.21 mg/kg\n \nexample 76: 1-[3-(4-cyclopropanecarbonylphenoxy)propyl]piperidine, ED\n50\n=0.18 mg/kg\n \nexample 88: 1-[3-(4-propionylphenoxy)propyl]-3-methylpiperidine, ED\n50\n=0.14 mg/kg\n \nexample 101: 1-[3-(4-cyclopropane carbonyl phenoxy)propyl]-trans-3,5 dimethylpiperidine, ED\n50\n=0.17 mg/kg\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEx\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nR\n3\n \n\n\n \n\n\nED\n50\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nX\n\n\nn\n\n\nR\n1\nR\n2\n \n\n\n(n\n3 \n= 1)\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n(mg/kg/p.o.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nO\n\n\n5\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n4\n—\n\n\np-NO\n2\n \n\n\n39 ± 11\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\nEt, Et\n\n\np-CN\n\n\n95 ± 28\n\n\n0.50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\nEt, Et\n\n\np-CH\n3\nCO\n\n\n20 ± 7 \n\n\n0.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\nO\n\n\n5\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n4\n—\n\n\np-CH\n3\nCH(OH)\n\n\n28 ± 7 \n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56\n\n\nO\n\n\n4\n\n\nEt, Et\n\n\np-CN\n\n\n62 ± 15\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n5\n—\n\n\np-CN\n\n\n11 ± 2 \n\n\n0.20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n6\n—\n\n\np-CN\n\n\n8.7 ± 2.1\n\n\n0.64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\nEt, Et\n\n\np-CH\n3\nCH(OH)\n\n\n60 ± 18\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n64\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\nEt, Et\n\n\np-CH\n3\nC═N(OH)\n\n\n2.7 ± 0.9\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n66\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\n—(3-Me)—(CH\n2\n)\n5\n—\n\n\np-CH\n3\nCO\n\n\n3.7 ± 0.5\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\n—(4-Me)—(CH\n2\n)\n5\n—\n\n\np-CH\n3\nCO\n\n\n4.6 ± 2.0\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n5\n—\n\n\np-C\n2\nH\n5\nCO\n\n\n4.7 ± 0.8\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE III\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\nH\n3\n-receptor antagonist activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNo.\n\n\npA\n2 \n(guinea-pig ileum)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n120\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n124\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n130\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n131\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n136\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll the above compounds were find to be H\n3\n-antagonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComparative data concerning the activity of imidazole derivatives to and of the non-imidazole analogues according to the invention, are reported below in Table IV:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE IV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNon-imidazole analogue according to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImidazole derivative\n\n\nthe invention"
