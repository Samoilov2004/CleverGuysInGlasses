Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a pharmaceutical, more particularly, to a multi-cyclic cinnamide derivative effective for treatment of a neurodegenerative disease caused by amyloid-β (hereinafter referred to as Aβ) such as Alzheimer's disease or Down's syndrome and a medicine, in particular, a medicine for prevention or treatment of a disease caused by Aβ comprising the derivative as an active ingredient.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nAlzheimer's disease is a disease characterized by degeneration and loss of neurons as well as formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary degeneration. Currently, Alzheimer's disease is treated only with symptomatic treatment using a symptom improving agent typified by an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and a fundamental remedy to inhibit progression of the disease has not yet been developed. It is necessary to develop a method for controlling the cause of the onset of pathology in order to create a fundamental remedy for Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is assumed that Aβ-proteins as metabolites of amyloid precursor proteins (hereinafter referred to as APP) are highly involved in degeneration and loss of neurons and onset of symptoms of dementia (see Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2, for example). Main molecular species of Aβ-protein are Aβ40 consisting of 40 amino acids and Aβ42 with two amino acids added at the C-terminal. The Aβ40 and Aβ42 are known to have high aggregability (see Non-Patent Document 3, for example) and to be main components of senile plaques (see Non-Patent Documents 3, 4 and 5, for example). Further, it is known that the Aβ40 and Aβ42 are increased by mutation in APP and presenilin genes which is observed in familial Alzheimer's disease (see Non-Patent Documents 6, 7 and 8, for example). Accordingly, a compound that reduces production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 is expected as a progression inhibitor or prophylactic agent for Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAβ is produced by cleaving APP by β-secretase and subsequently by γ-secretase. For this reason, attempts have been made to create γ-secretase and β-secretase inhibitors in order to reduce Aβ production. Many of these secretase inhibitors already known are, for example, peptides and peptide mimetics such as L-685,458 (see Non-Patent Document 9, for example), LY-411,575 (see Non-Patent Documents 10, 11 and 12, for example) and LY-450,139 (see Non-Patent Documents 13, 14 and 15). Nonpeptidic compounds are, for example, MRK-560 (see Non-Patent Documents 16 and 17) and compounds having a plurality of aromatic rings as disclosed in Patent Document 1. However, the compound represented by the formula (VI) as disclosed in page 17 of the specification differs from the compound of the present invention in that the compound is limited to a compound having a 2-aminothiazolyl group as a main structure.\n\n \n \n \n[Non-Patent Document 1] Klein W L, and seven others, Alzheimer's disease-affected brain: Presence of oligomeric Aβ ligands (ADDLs) suggests a molecular basis for reversible memory loss, Proceeding of the National Academy of Science USA, 2003, Sep., 2;

Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #21103-049, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) supplemented with 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #17504-044, Carlsbad, Calif., USA), 25 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME, WAKO Cat #139-06861, Osaka, Japan), 0.5 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #25030-081, Carlsbad, Calif., USA), and Antibiotics-Antimycotics (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #15240-062, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) was used as the medium (Neurobasal/B27/2-ME). However, the above Neurobasal medium not supplemented with 2-ME (Neurobasal/B27) was used for the assay. The cells were redispersed by mild pipetting of the cell mass to which the medium was added. The cell dispersion was filtered through a 40-μm nylon mesh (Cell Strainer, Cat #35-2340, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, N.J., USA) to remove the remaining cell mass, and thus a neuronal cell suspension was obtained. The neuronal cell suspension was diluted with the medium and then plated in a volume of 100 μl/well at an initial cell density of 5×10\n5 \ncells/cm\n2 \nin a 96-well polystyrene culture plate pre-coated with poly-L or D-lysine (Falcon Cat #35-3075, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, N.J., USA coated with poly-L-lysine using the method shown below, or BIOCOAT™ cell environments Poly-D-lysine cell ware 96-well plate, Cat #35-6461, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, N.J., USA). Poly-L-lysine coating was carried out as follows. 100 μg/ml of a poly-L-lysine (SIGMA P2636, St. Louis, Mo., USA) solution was aseptically prepared with a 0.15 M borate buffer (pH 8.5). 100 μl/well of the solution was added to the 96-well polystyrene culture plate and incubated at room temperature for one or more hours or at 4° C. overnight or longer. The coated 96-well polystyrene culture plate was washed with sterile water four or more times, and then dried or rinsed with, for example, sterile PBS or medium, and used for cell plating. The plated cells were cultured in the culture plate at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2\n-95% air for one day. Then, the total amount of the medium was replaced with a fresh Neurobasal™/B27/2-ME medium, and then the cells were cultured for further three days.\n\n\n \nAddition of Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nThe drug was added to the culture plate on Day 4 of culture as follows. The total amount of the medium was removed from the wells, and 180 μl/well of Neurobasal medium not containing 2-ME and containing 2% B-27 (Neurobasal/B27) was added thereto. A solution of the test compound in dimethyl sulfoxide (hereinafter abbreviated as DMSO) was diluted with Neurobasal/B27 at 10-fold of the final concentration. 20 μl/well of the dilution was added to and sufficiently mixed with the medium. The final DMSO concentration was 1% or less. Only DMSO was added to the control group.\n\n\n \nSampling\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cells were cultured for three days after addition of the compound, and the total amount of the medium was collected. The resulting medium was used as an ELISA sample. The sample was not diluted for ELISA measurement of Aβx-42 and diluted to 5-fold with a diluent supplied with an ELISA kit for ELISA measurement of Aβx-40.\n\n\n \nEvaluation of Cell Survival\n\n\n \n \n \nCell survival was evaluated by an MTT assay according to the following procedure. After collecting the medium, 100 μl/well of a pre-warmed medium was added to the wells. Further, 8 μl/well of a solution of 8 mg/ml of MTT (SIGMA M2128, St. Louis, Mo., USA) in D-PBS(−) (Dulbecco's phosphate buffered Saline, SIGMA D8537, St. Louis, Mo., USA) was added to the wells. The 96-well polystyrene culture plate was incubated in an incubator at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2\n-95% air for 20 minutes. 100 μl/well of an MTT lysis buffer was added thereto, and MTT formazan crystals were sufficiently dissolved in the buffer in the incubator at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2\n-95% air. Then, the absorbance at 550 nm in each well was measured. The MTT lysis buffer was prepared as follows. 100 g of SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate (sodium lauryl sulfate), WAKO 191-07145, Osaka, Japan) was dissolved in a mixed solution of 250 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (WAKO 045-02916, Osaka, Japan) with 250 mL of distilled water. 350 μl each of concentrated hydrochloric acid and concentrated acetic acid were further added to the solution to allow the solution to have a final pH of about 4.7.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon measurement, wells having no cells plated and containing only the medium and MTT solution were set as background (bkg). The measured values were respectively applied to the following formula including subtracting bkg values from them. Thus, the proportion against the control group (group not treated with the drug, CTRL) (% of CTRL) was calculated to compare and evaluate cell survival activities.\n\n\n \n \n \n% of CTRL=((\nA\n550_sample−\nA\n550\n—\n \nbkg\n)/(\nA\n550_CTRL−\nbkg\n))×100\n\n\n\n \n \n(A550_sample: absorbance at 550 nm of sample well,\n\n\nA550_bkg: absorbance at 550 nm of background well,\n\n\nA550_CTRL: absorbance at 550 nm of control group well)\n\n\n\n \nAβ ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nFor Aβ ELISA, Human/Rat 3 Amyloid (42) ELISA Kit Wako (#290-62601) from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. or Human Amyloid beta (1-42) Assay Kit (#27711) from IBL Co., Ltd. was used. Aβ ELISA was carried out according to the protocols recommended by the manufacturers (methods described in the attached documents). However, the Aβ calibration curve was created using beta-amyloid peptide 1-42, rat (Calbiochem, #171596 [Aβ\n42\n]). The results are shown in Table 1 as percentage to the Aβ concentration in the medium of the control group (% of CTRL).\n\n\n \n \n(2) The measurement results are shown in Tables 9, 10, 11 and 12 as
