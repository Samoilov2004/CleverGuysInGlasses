Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to the treatment of depressive disorders and mania.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStressors that cause symptoms of depression increase the activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the nucleus accumbens. CREB activation results in the activation of the prodynorphin gene, which encodes the opioid peptide dynorphin. Dynorphin is an agonist of the kappa opioid receptors in the brain, and enhances symptoms of depression. It has been shown that kappa receptor antagonists can act as antidepressants by mediating a disinhibition of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. See Pliakas et al., \nJ. Neurosci. \n21:7397 (2001); and Mague et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n305:323 (2003). It has been shown that antimanic/antipsychotic drugs increase the activity of dynorphinergic neurons, which have their effects through kappa receptors (Ma et al., \nNeuroscience \n121:991 (2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diterpene salvinorin A, derived from \nSalvia divinorum\n, has recently been shown to be a high affinity and selective kappa opioid receptor agonist. See Roth et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n99: 11934 (2002); and Butelman et al., \nPsychopharmacology \n172:220 (2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNew compounds which are highly selective for kappa opioid receptors over mu and delta opioid receptors and which have kappa inverse agonist, kappa biased agonist, kappa antagonist, kappa partial agonist, or kappa agonist activity are needed to provide improved methods for the treatment of affective disorders and other conditions for which kappa opioid receptor signaling plays a role in the pathogenesis of disease.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention is based on the discovery of compounds that are selective for kappa opioid receptors. The modulation of activity at kappa opioid receptors can be useful for the treatment of mood disorders. For example, the compounds exhibiting antagonist activity, biased agonist, or inverse agonist activity at kappa receptors are useful for the treatment of depressive disorders, among other conditions. The compounds exhibiting partial agonist or biased agonist activity at kappa receptors are useful for the treatment of bipolar disorder, e.g., as mood stabilizers, among other conditions. The compounds exhibiting full agonist or biased agonist activity at kappa receptors are useful for the treatment of the manic phase of bipolar disorder, among other conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a first aspect, the invention features a compound of formula I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Desirably, the fatty acid acyl is 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 docosahexanoyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause the compounds of the invention are highly selective for the kappa opioid receptor, they can be used in the methods of the invention to treat conditions for which kappa opioid receptor signaling plays a role in the pathogenesis of disease without directly influencing signaling at other receptors and producing unwanted side-effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following Detailed Description, the drawings, and the claims.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n is a graph showing the dose-response curves of compound 6 (12-epi-Salvinorin A) and U50,488 in the [\n35\nS]GTPγS functional assay. \nCompound\n 6 exhibits partial agonist properties in the [\n35\nS]GTPγS assay.

The compounds are described by formulas I-XII. These compounds can be prepared as described in the Examples.\n\n\n \nAssays\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine their affinity for specific opioid receptors, the compounds described herein can be characterized in radioligand receptor binding assays, using ligands that are specific for the mu, delta and kappa receptors. For example, the binding assays may utilize guinea pig brain membranes or stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells expressing each of the three opioid receptors, as described in Example 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine their efficacy (e.g., agonist, partial agonist, antagonist) at a specific opioid receptor, compounds can be characterized by [\n35\nS]GTPγS binding assay, as described in Example 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA symptom of clinical depression that can be modeled in rats is despair, a feeling of hopelessness. Symptoms of despair can be induced in rats using the forced swim test (FST), as described in Example 12, a highly validated model used to study antidepressant treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMania-like symptoms can be induced in rodents by the administration of psychomotor stimulant drugs such as cocaine or amphetamine. Psychostimulants produce a range of behaviors in animals that appear similar to mania, including hyperactivity, heightened sensory awareness and alertness, and changes in sleep patterns. Psychostimulant-induced hyperactivity is mediated by increased dopaminergic transmission in striatal regions. Based on this information, psychostimulant-induced hyperactivity in rodents has become a standard model for the screening of antimanic drugs. The mania-like effects of these psychomotor stimulants can be studied in behavioral assays that quantify locomotor activity (“open field activity”) or the function of brain reward systems (“place conditioning” or “intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS)) (see Example 13). The Antimanic-like effects of salvinorin derivatives can be identified by the ability of these agents to reduce, attenuate, or block the stimulant or rewarding effects of cocaine or amphetamine in these assays. For further details see, for example, Einat and Belmaker Animal models of bipolar disorder: From a single episode to progressive cycling models; In: “Contemporary Issues in Modeling Psychopathology” Myslobodsky M, Weiner I (Eds.), 2000; London: Kluver Academic, New York, pp 165-179.\n\n\n \nTherapy\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein can be used for the treatment of mania, depressive disorders. Compounds of the invention can be particularly useful for treating major depression, dysthymia, bipolar disorder (manic depression), and post traumatic stress disorder; however, any psychologic or psychiatric disorder having symptoms that include abnormalities of mood or emotion are amenable to treatment according to the present methods. For example, the compounds can be used to treat disorders of mood, including, without limitation, Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Schizoaffective Disorder, Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, Anxiety Disorders, Panic Disorder, Traumatic Stress Disorders, Phobic Disorders, and Personality Disorders with abnormal mood, such as Borderline Personality Disorder, Schizoid and Schizotypal Disorders. For example, compounds having antagonist activity, biased agonist, or inverse agonist activity at kappa opioid receptors are useful for the treatment of depression; compounds having partial agonist or biased agonist activity at kappa opioid receptors are useful as mood stabilizers for the treatment of, for example, bipolar disorder; and compounds having agonist or biased agonist activity at kappa opioid receptors are useful for the treatment of mania.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention features a method of treating depressive disorders or mania by administering a compound having any of formulas I-XII. The compounds of the invention may be administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, or excipient, in unit dosage form. Administration may be transdermal, parenteral, intravenous, intra-arterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intracranial, intraorbital, ophthalmic, intraventricular, intracapsular, intraspinal, intracisternal, intraperitoneal, intracerebroventricular, intrathecal, intranasal, aerosol, by suppositories, or oral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic formulations may be in the form of liquid solutions or suspensions; for oral administration, formulations may be in the form of tablets or capsules; and for intranasal formulations, in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods well known in the art for making formulations are found, for example, in “Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy” (20th ed., ed. A. R. Gennaro, 2000, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins). Formulations for parenteral administration may, for example, contain excipients, sterile water, or saline, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, or hydrogenated napthalenes. Biocompatible, biodegradable lactide polymer, lactide/glycolide copolymer, or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers may be used to control the release of the compounds. Nanoparticulate formulations (e.g., biodegradable nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, liposomes) may be used to control the biodistribution of the compounds. Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposomes. Formulations for inhalation may contain excipients, for example, lactose, or may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycolate and deoxycholate, or may be oily solutions for administration in the form of nasal drops, or as a gel. The concentration of the compound in the formulation will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the dosage of the drug to be administered, and the route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound may be optionally administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, such as a non-toxic acid addition salts or metal complexes that are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. Examples of acid addition salts include organic acids such as acetic, lactic, pamoic, maleic, citric, malic, ascorbic, succinic, benzoic, palmitic, suberic, salicylic, tartaric, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, or trifluoroacetic acids or the like; polymeric acids such as tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose, or the like; and inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid phosphoric acid, or the like. Metal complexes include calcium, zinc, iron, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of compounds in controlled release formulations is useful where the compound of formula I has (i) a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., the difference between the plasma concentration leading to harmful side effects or toxic reactions and the plasma concentration leading to a therapeutic effect is small; generally, the therapeutic index, TI, is defined as the ratio of median lethal dose (LD50) to median effective dose (ED50)); (ii) a narrow absorption window in the gastro-intestinal tract; or (iii) a short biological half-life, so that frequent dosing during a day is required in order to sustain the plasma level at a therapeutic level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany strategies can be pursued to obtain controlled release in which the rate of release outweighs the rate of metabolism of the therapeutic compound. For example, controlled release can be obtained by the appropriate selection of formulation parameters and ingredients, including, e.g., appropriate controlled release compositions and coatings. Examples include single or multiple unit tablet or capsule compositions, oil solutions, suspensions, emulsions, microcapsules, microspheres, nanoparticles, patches, and liposomes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for oral use include tablets containing the active ingredient(s) in a mixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents or fillers (e.g., sucrose and sorbitol), lubricating agents, glidants, and antiadhesives (e.g., magnesium stearate, zinc stearate, stearic acid, silicas, hydrogenated vegetable oils, or talc).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for oral use may also be provided as chewable tablets, or as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations of compounds of formulas I-XII can include isomers such as diastereomers and enantiomers, mixtures of isomers, including racemic mixtures, salts, solvates, and polymorphs thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations can be administered to patients in therapeutically effective amounts. For example, an amount is administered which prevents, reduces, or eliminates the depression, mania, mood fluctuations, or reduces CREB activation, respectively. Typical dose ranges are from about 0.001 μg/kg to about 2 mg/kg of body weight per day. Desirably, a dose of between 0.001 μg/kg and 1 mg/kg of body weight, or 0.005 μg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg of body weight, is administered. The exemplary dosage of drug to be administered is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of the condition, the overall health status of the particular patient, the formulation of the compound, and its route of administration. Standard clinical trials may be used to optimize the dose and dosing frequency for any particular compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how the methods and compounds claimed herein are performed, made, and evaluated, and are intended to be purely exemplary of the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the specification refers to a position of the salvinorin ring system, the position is identified according to the numbering system provided below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis of compounds of the invention may require selective protection and deprotection of alcohols, amines, and carboxylic acid functional groups in the salvinorin starting material. For example, commonly used protecting groups for amines include carbamates, such as tert-butyl, benzyl, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl, 2-trimethylsilylethyl, 9-fluorenylmethyl, allyl, and m-nitrophenyl. Other commonly used protecting groups for amines include amides, such as formamides, acetamides, trifluoroacetamides, sulfonamides, trifluoromethanesulfonyl amides, trimethylsilylethanesulfonamides, and tert-butylsulfonyl amides. Examples of commonly used protecting groups for carboxylic acids include esters, such as methyl, ethyl, tert-butyl, 9-fluorenylmethyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy methyl, benzyl, diphenylmethyl, O-nitrobenzyl, ortho-esters, and halo-esters. Examples of commonly used protecting groups for alcohols include ethers, such as methyl, methoxymethyl, methoxyethoxymethyl, methylthiomethyl, benzyloxymethyl, tetrahydropyranyl, ethoxyethyl, benzyl, 2-napthylmethyl, O-nitrobenzyl, P-nitrobenzyl, P-methoxybenzyl, 9-phenylxanthyl, trityl (including methoxy-trityls), and silyl ethers. Protecting groups can be chosen such that selective conditions (e.g., acidic conditions, basic conditions, catalysis by a nucleophile, catalysis by a lewis acid, or hydrogenation) are required to remove each, exclusive of other protecting groups in a molecule. The conditions required for the addition of protecting groups to amine, alcohol, and carboxylic acid functionalities and the conditions required for their removal are provided in detail in “T. W. Green and P. G. M. Wuts: Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis” (2nd ed., 1991, John Wiley & Sons) and “P. J. Kocienski: Protecting Groups” (1994 Georg Thieme Verlag); each of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeneral methods.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n312:220 (2005). The rMOPR and the mDOPR have very high sequence homology to the respective human orthologs and share similar binding and functional properties. The potencies and efficacies of compounds 1-3 and 6-34 on hKOPR were determined by their abilities to regulate [\n35\nS]GTP′S binding to membranes of CHO-hKOPR cells using the approach described by Zhu et al., \nJ.

Receptor binding and functional assay data were analyzed using Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, Calif.).

For example, the stereochemistry at C2 can be inverted using a Mitsunobu reaction (PPh\n3\n+DIAD+NuH, where NuH is, for example, an arylalcohol, cyclic imide, or carboxylic acid, among others) (see Scheme 9A). Alternatively; the hydroxy group at C2 can be acylated using an acyl halide or a carboxylic acid and an activating agent (see Scheme 9B); can be alkylated using an alkyl halide (see Scheme 9C); can be converted to a carbamate (see Scheme 9D); or can be converted to an amine (see Scheme 9E). The amine of Scheme 9E can be converted to an amide (see Scheme 9F). These methods can also be used to make analogous modifications at C1, C12, C17, and C4, when these positions are substituted by hydroxyl groups.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeneral Protocol: To a CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nsolution of 12-episalvinorin B (1 equivalent), triphenylphosphine (3 equivalents), and the nucleophile (3 equivalents) is added diisopropylazodicarboxylate (3 equivalents) (DEAD may also be used) dropwise and the reaction is stirred at room temperature (3.5 hours).

Using H\n2\n/Pt/C the furan ring is hydrogenated without disruption of the lactone ring. When more stringent conditions, H\n2\n/Pd/C, are employed, the reduction of the furan ring is accompanied by cleavage of the lactone ring and reduction of the C12 position. See Valdes et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n49:4716 (1984); and Koreeda et al., \nChem. Lett. \n2015 (1990).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nSynthesis of C(4) Derivatives\n\n\n \n \n \nC4 modified salvinorin derivatives can be prepared, for example, from 12-episalvinorin A using the general procedures shown in \nScheme\n 11, among others. First, the methoxy group is removed using LiI/pyridine. The resulting carboxylic acid group can be converted to an amide using an amine and an activating reagent, or converted to an ester using an alcohol and an activating reagent. The carboxylic acid can be activated, for example, by formation of an active ester, such as nitrophenylesters, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters, or others as described in \nChem. Soc. Rev. \n12:129, 1983 and \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. \n17:569, 1978. The activated acid can then be reacted with a preselected amine or alcohol to produce the desired amide or ester, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nForced Swim Test (FST)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe FST is a two day procedure in which rats swim under conditions in which escape is not possible. On the first day, the rats are forced to swim for 15 minutes. The rats initially search for an escape from the water, but eventually adopt a posture of immobility in which they make only the movements necessary to keep their heads above water. Upon re-testing one day later, latencies to become immobile (an indicator of how rapidly the rats “give up” in response to a familiar stressor) are decreased, which is inferred as despair. Standard antidepressants such as desipramine (DMI) and fluoxetine (FLX) extend latencies to become immobile. Drug efficacy in this animal model is predictive of antidepressant efficacy in humans. The FST has been described by Mague et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n305:323 (2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSalvinorin A produces depressive-like effects in the forced swim test in rats without affecting locomotor activity (see \nFIGS. 3A and 3B\n).\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nIntracranial Self-Stimulation (ICSS)\n\n\n \n \n \nIntracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) is highly sensitive to the function of brain reward systems. In this assay, rodents respond to self-administer rewarding electrical stimulation through electrodes implanted within the limbic system. Changes in the rewarding efficacy of the stimulation shift the rate-frequency functions: leftward shifts (reflecting decreases in ICSS thresholds) imply that the stimulation is more rewarding as a result of a treatment, whereas rightward shifts (reflecting increases in thresholds) imply that it is less rewarding. The effects of many types of treatments on ICSS have been described. Most drugs of abuse decrease the amount of stimulation required to sustain responding: this is indicated by leftward shifts in rate-frequency functions and decreased ICSS thresholds. Conversely, agents that block drug reward (dopamine or kappa-opioid receptor agonists) increase the amount of stimulation required to sustain responding: this is indicated by rightward shifts in rate-frequency functions, and increased ICSS thresholds. Thus ICSS is sensitive to manipulations that increase or decrease reward.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsidering that mania is typically associated with increases in reward-driven behavior, the ICSS test may be a reasonable model of mania. Thus drugs that reduce the rewarding effects of the electrical stimulation may have some efficacy in the treatment of mania or related states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe have found that intraperitoneal administration of 1.0 mg/kg of salvinorin A (a dose with depressive-like effects as demonstrated in the forced swim test (FST) in rats) significantly elevates ICSS thresholds (see \nFIG. 4\n). In 1-hour test sessions, injections (1 ml/kg) of 0.9% saline or 70% DMSO (the vehicle for salvinorin A) had no effects on ICSS thresholds, whereas salvinorin A (1.0 mg/kg, IP) significantly elevated ICSS thresholds. Elevations of ICSS thresholds indicate that the lateral hypothalamic brain stimulation is less rewarding as the result of treatment. These findings indicate that salvinorin A in rats causes anhedonia, a hallmark symptom of depressive disorders in humans. Accordingly, kappa agonists may be useful in the treatment of mania and related states in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n25\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\nSynthesis of 12-epi-salvinorin B (35)\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n12-epi-Salvinorin A (52 mg, 0.12 mmol) was dissolved in THF (3 mL) and H\n2\nO (3 mL).
