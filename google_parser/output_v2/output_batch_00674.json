Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/316,540, filed Mar. 23, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compounds which are inhibitors of sodium dependent glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2), methods of making them, and uses thereof.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2009, more than 220 million people worldwide have diabetes. In 2005, an estimated at least 1.1 million people died from diabetes. The WHO projects that diabetes deaths will double between 2005 and 2030.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the beta-cells in pancreas do not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. Hyperglycaemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels. Type II diabetes (formerly called non-insulin-dependent or adult-onset) results from the body's ineffective use of insulin. Type II diabetes comprises 90% of people with diabetes around the world, and is often the result of excess body weight and physical inactivity. Effective control of blood glucose levels in diabetes patients will prevent or delay the development of diabetes complications such as cardiovascular diseases, stroke, nephropathy, retinopathy, renal failure, amputation of the extremities, and beta cell failure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucose molecules pass from the bloodstream into glomerulus in the kidney, but the glucose is subsequently reabsorbed via active transport mechanisms in the proximal convoluted tubule back to the blood circulation rather than being lost with the urine. Two sodium-dependent glucose co-transporters have been identified that cause the glucose to be reabsorbed: SGLT-1 and SGLT-2. SGLT-2, which is found only in the earlier section (S1 segment) of the proximal convoluted tubule of the glomerulus, accounts for approximately 90% of the reabsorption of glucose. The other, SGLT-1, which exists in the later section (S3 segment) of the proximal tubule and is also found in the gut and other tissues, accounts for only about 10% of glucose reabsorption. In people with normal blood glucose levels, glucose is not excreted into the urine, due to the function of SGLTs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelective inhibitors of SGLT-2 have been demonstrated in both preclinical animal models and human clinical trials to effectively control glucose levels in the blood as well as lowering HbA1C (Han et al., \nDiabetes, \n57(6):1723 (2008); List et al., \nDiabetes Care, \n32(4):650 (2009); Komoroski et al., \nClin. Pharmacol. Ther., \n85(5):520 (2009); Komoroski et al., \nClin. Pharmacol. Ther., \n85(5):513 (2009)). In these studies, body weight reduction was often observed, indicating that SGLT-2 inhibitors could lower body weight. Humans with a mutation of the SGLT-2 gene have familial forms of renal glucosuria, providing further evidence of the primary role of SGLT-2 in renal glucose re-absorption. These patients have otherwise normal renal functions and generally have no other clinical abnormalities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn recent years, reducing HbA1C values to <7% has become the recommended standard for patients with type II diabetes. Although there are a variety of medical therapies for type II diabetes, many patients still cannot achieve the target HbA1C level. Since all of these oral agents, except for α-glucosidase inhibitors, directly or indirectly depend on insulin to regulate blood glucose levels, type II diabetes patients eventually will rely on insulin therapy because of an inevitable decline of beta-cell function. In addition, the existing agents do not promote weight loss and some even cause weight gain. Clearly, there is an imperative demand for novel agents for the effective treatment of type II diabetes which are independent of insulin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to overcoming these and other deficiencies in the art.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention relates to a compound of formula\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\n \nA is O or S;\n\n\nR\n1 \nis H;\n\n\n \n \n \nR\n2 \nis H, halogen, CN, OR\na\n, NR\nb\nR\nc\n, COR\nd\n, CONR\nb\nR\nc\n, SO\n2\nR\nd\n, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, 3 to 10-membered carbocycle, or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle, wherein each of lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, and lower alkynyl is optionally substituted from 1-3 times by R\ne \nand each 3 to 10-membered carbocycle or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle is optionally substituted 1-3 times by R\nf\n;\n\n\nR\n3 \nis H, halogen, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, CH\n2\nOH, CH\n2\nCH\n2\nOH, CF\n3\n, or CF\n2\nH;\n\n\n\n \nR\n4 \nis H;\n\n\n \n \n \nR\n5 \nis Cl, F, or methyl;\n\n\n \nR\n6\n, R\n7\n, and R\n8 \nare H;\n\n\nR\n9 \nis CH\n2\nOH or SMe;\n\n\n \n \n \nR\na \nis H, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, 3 to 10-membered carbocycle, or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle, wherein each of lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, and lower alkynyl is optionally substituted from 1-3 times by R\ne \nand each 3 to 10-membered carbocycle or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle is optionally substituted 1-3 times by R\nf\n;\n\n\nR\nb \nand R\nc \nare, independently, H, COR\nd\n, SO\n2\nR\nd\n, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, 3 to 10-membered carbocycle, or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle, wherein each of lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, and lower alkynyl is optionally substituted from 1-3 times by R\ne \nand each 3 to 10-membered carbocycle or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle is optionally substituted 1-3 times by R\nf\n;\n\n\nR\nb \nand R\nc \ncan be taken together with the nitrogen to which they are attached to form a ring which is selected from the group consisting of:\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein each of these rings is optionally substituted 1-3 times by R\nf \nand one or two of the ring CH\n2 \nunits or the sulphur can be optionally substituted by an oxo or thio group;\n\n\nR\nd \nis NR\nb\nR\nc\n, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, 3 to 10-membered carbocycle, or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle, wherein each of lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, and lower alkynyl is optionally substituted from 1-3 times by R\ne \nand each 3 to 10-membered carbocycle or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle is optionally substituted 1-3 times by R\nf\n;\n\n\nR\ne \nis halogen, CF\n3\n, CF\n2\nH, OCF\n3\n, OCF\n2\nH, CN, OR\ng\n, NR\ng\nR\nh\n, COR\ng\n, CONR\ng\nR\nh\n, NR\ng\nCOR\nh\n, SO\n2\nR\ng\n, 3 to 10-membered carbocycle, or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle, wherein the each of the 3 to 10-membered carbocycle or 3-10-membered heterocycle is optionally substituted 1-3 times with halogen, CF\n3\n, CF\n2\nH, OCF\n3\n, OCF\n2\nH, CN, OR\ng\n, NR\ng\nR\nh\n, COR\ng\n, CONR\ng\nR\nh\n, NR\ng\nCOR\nh\n, or SO\n2\nR\ng\n;\n\n\nR\nf \nis halogen, CF\n3\n, CF\n2\nH, OCF\n3\n, OCF\n2\nH, CN, OR\ng\n, NR\ng\nR\nh\n, COR\ng\n, CONR\ng\nR\nh\n, NCOR\ng\nR\nh\n, SO\n2\nR\ng\n, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, or lower alkynyl, wherein each lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, and lower alkynyl is optionally substituted 1-3 times by CF\n3\n, CF\n2\nH, OCF\n3\n, OCF\n2\nH, CN, OR\ng\n, NR\ng\nR\nh\n, COR\ng\n, CONR\ng\nR\nh\n, NR\ng\nCOR\nh\n, SO\n2\nR\ng\n, or CO\n2\nR\ng\n;

Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of a disease or condition which is susceptible to treatment with a SGLT inhibitor. In particular, the compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of diabetes and micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes such as retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and wound healing. In people with diabetes and elevated blood glucose levels, blocking the SGLT transporters can prevent the filtered glucose from returning to the blood, therefore lowering the blood glucose levels. As a result, the unabsorbed glucose can be excreted in the urine. Scientific evidence indicates that blocking SGLT-1 inhibitor could cause unwanted even fatal GI side effect (Turk et al., \nNature \n350:354 (1991), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety), therefore selective SGLT-2 inhibitors are desirable as treatment for diabetes. In summary, selective inhibition of SGLT-2 in diabetic patients normalizes plasma glucose by increasing the excretion of glucose in the urine, therefore improving insulin sensitivity and preventing or delaying the development of diabetic complications. The function of SGLT-2 inhibitors is independent of insulin levels which makes SGLT-2 inhibitors useful at any stage of the diabetic disease and for both type I and type II diabetes. If such an agent can also lower body weight, it would provide an additional benefit to the treatment of type II diabetes since a majority of the diabetic population is also overweight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the compounds of the present invention and/or a pharmaceutical composition employing these compounds are useful in the treatment of diabetes, such as type I and type II diabetes. These compounds and compositions are also useful in treating complications of diabetes, including retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and delayed wound healing, and related diseases such as insulin resistance (impaired glucose homeostasis), hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, elevated blood levels of fatty acids or glycerol, obesity, hyperlipidemia including hypertriglyceridemia, Syndrome X, atherosclerosis, and hypertension, and for increasing high density lipoprotein levels. These compounds and compositions are also useful for treating and preventing kidney stones, hyperuricemia, and gout. These compounds and compositions are also useful for treating hyponatremia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the SGLT inhibitors of the present invention can potentially be used to in combination with other therapeutic agents. A potential significant advantage of SGLT-2 inhibitors is that they could produce weight loss due to the mechanism of actions.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention relates to a compound of formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\n \nA is O or S;\n\n\nR\n1 \nis H;\n\n\n \n \n \nR\n2 \nis H, halogen, CN, OR\na\n, NR\nb\nR\nc\n, COR\nd\n, CONR\nb\nR\nc\n, SO\n2\nR\nd\n, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, 3 to 10-membered carbocycle, or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle, wherein each of lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, and lower alkynyl is optionally substituted from 1-3 times by R\ne \nand each 3 to 10-membered carbocycle or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle is optionally substituted 1-3 times by R\nf\n;\n\n\nR\n3 \nis H, halogen, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, CH\n2\nOH, CH\n2\nCH\n2\nOH, CF\n3 \nor CF\n2\nH;\n\n\n\n \nR\n4 \nis H;\n\n\n \n \n \nR\n5 \nis Cl, F or methyl;\n\n\n \nR\n6\n, R\n7\n, and R\n8 \nare H;\n\n\nR\n9 \nis CH\n2\nOH or SMe;\n\n\n \n \n \nR\na \nis H, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, 3 to 10-membered carbocycle, or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle, wherein each of lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, and lower alkynyl is optionally substituted from 1-3 times by R\ne \nand each 3 to 10-membered carbocycle or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle is optionally substituted 1-3 times by R\nf\n;\n\n\nR\nb \nand R\nc \nare, independently, H, COR\nd\n, SO\n2\nR\nd\n, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, 3 to 10-membered carbocycle, or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle, wherein each of lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, and lower alkynyl is optionally substituted from 1-3 times by R\ne \nand each 3 to 10-membered carbocycle or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle is optionally substituted 1-3 times by R\nf\n;\n\n\nR\nb \nand R\nc \ncan be taken together with the nitrogen to which they are attached to form a ring which is selected from the group consisting of:\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein each of these rings is optionally substituted 1-3 times by R′ and one or two of the ring CH\n2 \nunits or the sulphur can be optionally substituted by an oxo or thio group;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\nd \nis NR\nb\nR\nc\n, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, 3 to 10-membered carbocycle, or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle, wherein each of lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, and lower alkynyl is optionally substituted from 1-3 times by R\ne \nand each 3 to 10-membered carbocycle or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle is optionally substituted 1-3 times by R\nf\n;\n\n\n \n \nR\ne \nis halogen, CF\n3\n, CF\n2\nH, OCF\n3\n, OCF\n2\nH, CN, OR\ng\n, NR\ng\nR\nh\n, COR\ng\n, CONR\ng\nR\nh\n, NR\ng\nCOR\nh\n, SO\n2\nR\ng\n, 3 to 10-membered carbocycle, or 3 to 10-membered heterocycle, wherein the each of the 3 to 10-membered carbocycle or 3-10-membered heterocycle is optionally substituted 1-3 times with halogen, CF\n3\n, CF\n2\nH, OCF\n3\n, OCF\n2\nH, CN, OR\ng\n, NR\ng\nR\nh\n, COR\ng\n, CONR\ng\nR\nh\n, NR\ng\nCOR\n11\n, or SO\n2\nR\ng\n;\n\n\nR\nf \nis halogen, CF\n3\n, CF\n2\nH, OCF\n3\n, OCF\n2\nH, CN, OR\ng\n, NR\ng\nR\nh\n, COR\ng\n, CONR\ng\nR\nh\n, NCOR\ng\nR\nh\n, SO\n2\nR\ng\n, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, or lower alkynyl, wherein each lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, and lower alkynyl is optionally substituted 1-3 times by CF\n3\n, CF\n2\nH, OCF\n3\n, OCF\n2\nH, CN, OR\ng\n, NR\ng\nR\nh\n, COR\ng\n, CONR\ng\nR\nh\n, NR\ng\nCOR\nh\n, SO\n2\nR\ng\n, or CO\n2\nR\n9\n;

Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds; by “stable compound” or “stable structure” is meant a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “compounds of the invention”, and equivalent expressions, are meant to embrace compounds of general formulae (I), (II), and/or (III) as hereinbefore described, which expression includes the prodrugs, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and the solvates, e.g. hydrates, where the context so permits. Similarly, reference to intermediates, whether or not they themselves are claimed, is meant to embrace their salts, and solvates, where the context so permits. For the sake of clarity, particular instances when the context so permits are sometimes indicated in the text, but these instances are purely illustrative and it is not intended to exclude other instances when the context so permits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” means the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts, and base addition salts, of compounds of the present invention. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds. In particular, acid addition salts can be prepared by separately reacting the purified compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed. Representative acid addition salts include, but are not limited to, the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, nitrate, acetate, oxalate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, borate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, naphthylate, mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactiobionate, sulphamates, malonates, salicylates, propionates, methylene-bis-b-hydroxynaphthoates, gentisates, isethionates, di-p-toluoyltartrates, methane-sulphonates, ethanesulphonates, benzenesulphonates, p-toluenesulphonates, cyclohexylsulphamates, and quinateslaurylsulphonate salts. (See, for example, Berge et al., \nJ. Pharm. Sci. \n66:1-sup.19 (1977) and \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n17th ed, p. 1418, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1985), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety). Base addition salts can also be prepared by separately reacting the purified compound in its acid form with a suitable organic or inorganic base and isolating the salt thus formed. Base addition salts include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable metal and amine salts. Suitable metal salts include, but are not limited to, the sodium, potassium, calcium, barium, zinc, magnesium, and aluminum salts. The sodium and potassium salts are preferred. Suitable inorganic base addition salts are prepared from metal bases which include sodium hydride, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and zinc hydroxide. Suitable amine base addition salts are prepared from amines which have sufficient basicity to form a stable salt, and include, but are not limited to, the following amines which are frequently used in medicinal chemistry because of their low toxicity and acceptability for medical use: ammonia, ethylenediamine, N-methyl-glucamine, lysine, arginine, ornithine, choline, N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, diethanolamine, procaine, N-benzylphenethylamine, diethylamine, piperazine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, triethylamine, dibenzylamine, ephenamine, dehydroabietylamine, N-ethylpiperidine, benzylamine, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, ethylamine, basic amino acids, e.g., lysine and arginine, and dicyclohexylamine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs” as used herein means those prodrugs of the compounds useful according to the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals with undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. The term “prodrug” means compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formula, for example by hydrolysis in blood. Functional groups which may be rapidly transformed, by metabolic cleavage, in vivo form a class of groups reactive with the carboxyl group of the compounds of this invention. They include, but are not limited to, such groups as alkanoyl (such as acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, and the like), unsubstituted and substituted aroyl (such as benzoyl and substituted benzoyl), alkoxycarbonyl (such as ethoxycarbonyl), trialkylsilyl (such as trimethyl- and triethysilyl), monoesters formed with dicarboxylic acids (such as succinyl), and the like. Because of the ease with which the metabolically cleavable groups of the compounds useful according to this invention are cleaved in vivo, the compounds bearing such groups act as pro-drugs. The compounds bearing the metabolically cleavable groups have the advantage that they may exhibit improved bioavailability as a result of enhanced solubility and/or rate of absorption conferred upon the parent compound by virtue of the presence of the metabolically cleavable group.

Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate, and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups in the compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “therapeutically effective amount” is meant to describe an amount of compound of the present invention effective in inhibiting sodium dependent glucose co-transporters and thus producing the desired therapeutic effect. Such amounts generally vary according to a number of factors well within the purview of ordinarily skilled artisans given the description provided herein to determine and account for. These include, without limitation: the particular subject, as well as its age, weight, height, general physical condition and medical history, the particular compound used, as well as the carrier in which it is formulated and the route of administration selected for it; and, the nature and severity of the condition being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutical composition” means a composition comprising compounds of formulae (I), (II), and/or (III) and at least one component selected from pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants, excipients, and vehicles, such as preserving agents, fillers, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, lubricating agents, and dispensing agents, depending on the nature of the mode of administration and dosage forms. Examples of suspending agents include ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, or mixtures of these substances. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Examples of suitable carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols, suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Examples of excipients include lactose, milk sugar, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, and dicalcium phosphate. Examples of disintegrating agents include starch, alginic acids, and certain complex silicates. Examples of lubricants include magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulphate, talc, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means it is, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the cells of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms” means dosage forms of the compound of the invention, and includes, for example, tablets, dragees, powders, elixirs, syrups, liquid preparations, including suspensions, sprays, inhalants tablets, lozenges, emulsions, solutions, granules, capsules and suppositories, as well as liquid preparations for injections, including liposome preparations.

That is, preferred compounds provided herein have any of the preferred substituents at any of the positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention relates to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or non-salt forms, of any of the compounds of formula (I), (II), or (III) described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle enantiomers, any mixture of enantiomers, including racemic mixtures, or diastereomers (both separated and as any mixtures) of the compounds of the present invention are also included within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe scope of the present invention also encompasses active metabolites of the present compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes compounds of formula (I), (II), or (III), wherein one or more of the atoms, e.g., C or H, are replaced by the corresponding radioactive isotopes of that atom (e.g., C replaced by \n14\nC and H replaced by \n3\nH), or a stable isotope of that atom (e.g., C replaced by \n13\nC or H replaced by \n2\nH). Radioisotopes of hydrogen, carbon, phosphorous, fluorine, iodine and chlorine include \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, \n32\nP, \n33\nP, \n125\nI, and \n36\nCl, respectively. Compounds that contain those radioisotopes and/or other radioisotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Radiolabeled compounds described herein and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Conveniently, such radiolabeled compounds can be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples and Schemes by substituting a readily available radiolabeled reagent for a non-radiolabeled reagent. Such compounds have a variety of potential uses, e.g., as standards and reagents in determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical to inhibit SGLTs. In addition, in the case of stable isotopes, such compounds may have the potential to favorably modify the biological properties, e.g., pharmacological and/or pharmacokinetic properties, of compounds of formula (I), (II), or (III). The details concerning selection of suitable sites for incorporating radioactive isotopes into the compounds are known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention as described herein are useful as SGLT inhibitors. It may be found upon examination that compounds that are not presently excluded from the claims are not patentable to the inventors in this application. In that case, the exclusion of species and genera in applicants' claims are to be considered artifacts of patent prosecution and not reflective of the inventors' concept or description of their invention. The invention, in a compound aspect, is all compounds of formula (I), (II), and (III), except those that are in the public's possession.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile it may be possible for compounds of formula (I), (II), and (III) to be administered as the raw chemical, it will sometimes be preferable to present them as part of a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), (II), or (III), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Furthermore, when reference is made in an independent claim to a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, it will be understood that claims which depend from that independent claim which refer to such a compound also include pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound, even if explicit reference is not made to the salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention relates to a method of treating a disease or condition which is susceptible to treatment with a SGLT inhibitor. This method involves selecting a patient with a disease or condition which is susceptible to treatment with a SGLT inhibitor and administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), (II), or (III) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can be administered to mammals, preferably humans, for the treatment of a variety of diseases or conditions which are susceptible to treatment with a SGLT inhibitor in accordance with the present invention including, but not limited to, diabetes (including Type I and Type II, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and diabetic complications, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cataracts), hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperchlolesterolemia, elevated blood level of free fatty acids or glycerol, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, wound healing, tissue ischemia, atherosclerosis, and hypertension. The compounds of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical compositions employing these compounds may also be utilized to increase the blood levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL). These compounds and compositions are also useful for treating and preventing kidney stones, hyperuricemia, and gout. These compounds and compositions are also useful for treating hyponatremia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the condition, diseases, and maladies collectively referred to as “Syndrome X” or Metabolic Syndromeas detailed in Johannsson et al., \nJ.

Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe novel SGLT inhibitors of formulae (I), (II), and (III) of this invention can be prepared by the methods illustrated in the representative reaction schemes as, for example, described below, or by modifications thereof, using readily available starting materials, reagents, and conventional synthesis procedures. In these reactions, it is also possible to make use of variants that are known in the art but are not mentioned here. Although the syntheses depicted herein may result in the preparation of stereoisomers having a particular stereochemistry, included within the scope of the present invention are compounds of formula (I), (II), and (III) in any stereoisomeric form, and preparation of compounds of formula (I), (II), and (III) in stereoisomeric forms other than those depicted herein would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the chemical arts based on the procedures presented herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis of compounds of formulae (I) and (II) (where X is connected to the carbon designated * in formula (II) via a ring nitrogen atom on X) is exemplified in the following Scheme 1:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound 1 was prepared according to the teaching in US Published Patent Application No. 2005/0233988 to Nomuro et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. A Mitsunobu reaction gave compound 2 which was converted to compound 3 after removing the acetyl groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, compound 3 can be prepared as depicted in Scheme 2. In particular, compound 4 and [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyridin-3(2H)-one was treated with sodium hydride in DMF to give compound 5 which was then deprotected to yield compound 3.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nCompound 4 was prepared according to Scheme 3.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother alternative method to prepare compounds of formulae (I) and (II) when R\n7\n═OMe is exemplified in Scheme 4. Acetyl protected glucose and 4-methoxytoluene reacted under Lewis acid conditions gave compound 12 as the preferred anomer (Kuribayashi et al., “Bis C-Glycosylated Diphenylmethanes for Stable Glycoepitope Mimetics,” \nSynlett \n6:737-740 (1999), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Benzylic bromination afforded compound 13 which underwent alkylation with 6-chloro-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-c]pyridin-3(2H)-one. Compound 14 was obtained after a deprotection procedure using potassium carbonate.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe oxo-triazolopyridine VI can be prepared from substituted pyridine IV as depicted in Scheme 5 using well known methods. Many compounds of formula VI are also commercially available.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis of compounds of formula (II) (connecting through the atom of X) is exemplified by the synthesis of compound 1 as depicted in Scheme 6. In particular, compound 15 underwent a palladium-mediated cross-coupling with compound 18 to give compound 16 which was then deprotected to afford compound 17.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis of compounds of formula (III) is exemplified in Scheme 7 as the synthesis of compound 25. In particular, compound 15 underwent a palladium-mediated cross-coupling with compound 23 to give compound 24 which was then deprotected to afford compound 25.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that compounds according to the present invention contain asymmetric centers. These asymmetric centers may independently be in either the R or S configuration and such compounds are able to rotate a plane of polarized light in a polarimeter. If said plane of polarized light is caused by the compound to rotate in a counterclockwise direction, the compound is said to be the (−) stereoisomer of the compound. If said plane of polarized light is caused by the compound to rotate in a clockwise direction, the compound is said to be the (+) stereoisomer of the compound. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that certain compounds useful according to the invention may also exhibit geometrical isomerism. It is to be understood that the present invention includes individual geometrical isomers and stereoisomers and mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, of compounds of formulae (I), (II), and/or (III) herein above. Such isomers can be separated from their mixtures, by the application or adaptation of known methods, for example chromatographic techniques and recrystallization techniques, or they are separately prepared from the appropriate isomers of their intermediates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadiolabeled compounds of the invention are synthesized by a number of techniques well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art, e.g., by using starting materials incorporating therein one or more radioisotopes. Compounds of the present invention where a stable radioisotope, such as carbon-14, tritium, iodine-121, or another radioisotope, has been introduced synthetically are useful diagnostic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides compositions containing the compounds described herein, including, in particular, pharmaceutical compositions comprising therapeutically effective amounts of the compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide kits having a plurality of active ingredients (with or without carrier) which, together, may be effectively utilized for carrying out the novel combination therapies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is another object of the invention to provide a novel pharmaceutical composition which is effective, in and of itself, for utilization in a beneficial combination therapy because it includes a plurality of active ingredients which may be utilized in accordance with the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides kits or single packages combining two or more active ingredients useful in treating the disease. A kit may provide (alone or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier) the compounds of formulae (I), (II), and/or (III), and an additional active ingredient (alone or in combination with diluent or carrier), such as biguandies, sulfonyl ureas, PPAR γ agonists, glucosidase inhibitors, DPP IV inhibitors, GLR-1 agonists, amylin, and insulin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations of compounds of formula (I), (II), or (III) include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, and intraarticular), rectal, colonic, and topical (including dermal, buccal, nasal, sublingual, and intraocular) administration. The most suitable route may depend upon the condition and disorder of the recipient. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association a compound of formula (I), (II), or (III), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof (“active ingredient”) with the carrier, which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds according to the present invention may be presented in forms permitting administration by the most suitable route and the invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound according to the invention which are suitable for use in human or veterinary medicine. These compositions may be prepared according to the customary methods, using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants or excipients. The adjuvants comprise, inter alia, diluents, sterile aqueous media, and the various non-toxic organic solvents. The compositions may be presented in the form of tablets, pills, granules, powders, aqueous solutions or suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs or syrups, and can contain one or more agents chosen from the group comprising sweeteners, flavorings, colorings, or stabilizers in order to obtain pharmaceutically acceptable preparations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe choice of vehicle and the content of active substance in the vehicle are generally determined in accordance with the solubility and chemical properties of the product, the particular mode of administration and the provisions to be observed in pharmaceutical practice. For example, excipients such as lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and disintegrating agents such as starch, alginic acids and certain complex silicates combined with lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, and talc may be used for preparing tablets. To prepare a capsule, it is advantageous to use lactose and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions are used they can contain emulsifying agents or agents which facilitate suspension. Diluents such as sucrose, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, and chloroform or mixtures thereof may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary, or paste.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active, or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide sustained, delayed, or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. The pharmaceutical compositions may include a “pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier”, and this expression is intended to include one or more inert excipients, which include starches, polyols, granulating agents, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents, and the like. If desired, tablet dosages of the disclosed compositions may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques, “Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” also encompasses controlled release means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions may also optionally include other therapeutic ingredients, anti-caking agents, preservatives, sweetening agents, colorants, flavors, desiccants, plasticizers, dyes, and the like. Any such optional ingredient must be compatible with the compound of formula (I), (II), or (III) to insure the stability of the formulation. The composition may contain other additives as needed, including for example lactose, glucose, fructose, galactose, trehalose, sucrose, maltose, raffinose, maltitol, melezitose, stachyose, lactitol, palatinite, starch, xylitol, mannitol, myoinositol, and the like, and hydrates thereof, and amino acids, for example alanine, glycine and betaine, and peptides and proteins, for example albumen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of excipients for use as the pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and the pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers and the aforementioned additional ingredients include, but are not limited to binders, fillers, disintegrants, lubricants, anti-microbial agents, and coating agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose range for adult humans is generally from 0.001 mg to 10 g/day orally. Tablets or other forms of presentation provided in discrete units may conveniently contain an amount of compound of formula (I), (II), or (III) which is effective at such dosage or as a multiple of the same, for instance, units containing 5 mg to 500 mg, usually around 10 mg to 200 mg. The precise amount of compound administered to a patient will be the responsibility of the attendant physician. However, the dose employed will depend on a number of factors, including the age and sex of the patient, the precise disorder being treated, and its severity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor additional information about pharmaceutical compositions and their formulation, see, for example, \nRemington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n20\nth \nEdition (2000), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I), (II), or (III) can be administered, e.g., by intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, subcutaneous injection, intraperitoneal injection, topical, sublingual, intraarticular (in the joints), intradermal, buccal, ophthalmic (including intraocular), intranasally (including using a cannula), or by other routes. The compounds of formula (I), (II), or (III) can be administered orally, e.g., as a tablet or cachet containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, gel, pellet, paste, syrup, bolus, electuary, slurry, capsule, powder, granules, as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid, as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion, via a micellar formulation (see, e.g. PCT Publication No. WO 97/11682, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) via a liposomal formulation (see, e.g., European Patent EP 736299 and PCT Publication Nos. WO 99/59550 and WO 97/13500, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety), via formulations described in PCT Publication No. WO 03/094886, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, or in some other form. The compounds of formula (I), (II), or (III) can also be administered transdermally (i.e. via reservoir-type or matrix-type patches, microneedles, thermal poration, hypodermic needles, iontophoresis, electroporation, ultrasound or other forms of sonophoresis, jet injection, or a combination of any of the preceding methods (Prausnitz et al., \nNature Reviews Drug Discovery \n3:115 (2004), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable compositions containing the compounds of the present invention may be prepared by conventional means. For example, compounds of the present invention may be dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier for use in a nebulizer or a suspension or solution aerosol, or may be absorbed or adsorbed onto a suitable solid carrier for use in a dry powder inhaler.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid compositions for rectal administration include suppositories formulated in accordance with known methods and containing at least one compound of formula (I), (II), or (III).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe percentage of active ingredient in the compositions of the present invention may be varied, it being necessary that it should constitute a proportion such that a suitable dosage shall be obtained. Obviously, several unit dosage forms may be administered at about the same time. The dose employed will be determined by the physician, and depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, the route of administration and the duration of the treatment, and the condition of the patient. In the adult, the doses are generally from about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg body weight per day by inhalation, from about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably 0.1 to 70 mg/kg body weight, more especially 0.5 to 10 mg/kg body weight per day by oral administration, and from about 0.01 to about 50 mg/kg body weight, preferably 0.01 to 10 mg/kg body weight per day by intravenous administration. In each particular case, the doses will be determined in accordance with the factors distinctive to the subject to be treated, such as age, weight, general state of health, and other characteristics which can influence the efficacy of the medicinal product. A dosage unit (e.g. an oral dosage unit) can include from, for example, 0.01 to 0.1 mg, 1 to 30 mg, 1 to 40 mg, 1 to 100 mg, 1 to 300 mg, 1 to 500 mg, 2 to 500 mg, 3 to 100 mg, 5 to 20 mg, 5 to 100 mg (e.g. 0.01 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, 4 mg, 5 mg, 6 mg, 7 mg, 8 mg, 9 mg, 10 mg, 11 mg, 12 mg, 13 mg, 14 mg, 15 mg, 16 mg, 17 mg, 18 mg, 19 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 30 mg, 35 mg, 40 mg, 45 mg, 50 mg, 55 mg, 60 mg, 65 mg, 70 mg, 75 mg, 80 mg, 85 mg, 90 mg, 95 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg, 300 mg, 350 mg, 400 mg, 450 mg, 500 mg) of a compound described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (I), (II), or (III) can be incorporated into a liposome to improve half-life. Compounds of formula (I), (II), or (III) can also be conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains. Methods for pegylation and additional formulations containing PEG-conjugates (i.e. PEG-based hydrogels, PEG modified liposomes) can be found in Harris et al., \nNature Reviews Drug Discovery, \n2:214-221 (2003) and the references therein, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Compounds of formula (I), (II), or (III) can also be administered via a nanocochleate or cochleate delivery vehicle (BioDelivery Sciences International, Raleigh, N.C.). Compounds of formula (I), (II), or (III) can also be delivered using nanoemulsion formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds according to the present invention may be administered as frequently as necessary in order to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Some patients may respond rapidly to a higher or lower dose and may find much weaker maintenance doses adequate. For other patients, it may be necessary to have long-term treatments at the rate of 1 to 4 doses per day, in accordance with the physiological requirements of each particular patient. Generally, the active compound may be administered orally 1 to 4 times per day. It goes without saying that, for other patients, it will be necessary to prescribe not more than one or two doses per day.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Examples set forth below are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit, in any way, the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise noted, reagents and solvents were used as received from commercial suppliers. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained on Bruker spectrometers at 300, 400, or 500 MHz. Spectra are given in ppm (δ) and coupling constants, J, are reported in Hertz. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as an internal standard. Mass spectra were collected using either a Finnigan LCQ Duo LCMS ion trap electrospray ionization (ESI) or a mass Varian 1200L single quadrapole mass spectrometer (ESI).

The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 15 hours and then it was quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride solution, extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic extract was washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo. The crude material was partially purified by flash column chromatography (eluent: hexanes/ethyl acetate 95:5 to 25:75) to give (3R,4R,5R,6S)-2-(acetoxymethyl)-6-(4-chloro-3-((3-oxo-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyridin-2(3H)-yl)methyl)phenyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3,4,5-triyltriacetate (0.36 g, partial pure), which was used in the next step without further purification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep B: To a solution of the product from step A above (0.36 g, crude) in methanol (25 mL) was added potassium carbonate (0.17 g, 1.2 mmol).

The cDNAs for the human genes of SGLT-1 (SLC5A1—solute carrier family 5 sodium/glucose cotransporter member 1; Accession #NM\n—\n000343.1) or SGLT-2 (SLC5A2—member 2; Accession #NM\n—\n003041.2) were synthesized (OriGene Technologies, Inc.) and sub-cloned into the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif.) using standard molecular biology techniques. CHO-K1 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif.) containing either the full-length hSGLT-1 or hSGLT-2 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif.) were selected for stable incorporation of the construct by resistance to the selective pressure of Geneticin (450 μg/ml; Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif.). Monoclonal cell lines isolated by minimal dilution were screened for uptake activity of radiolabled methyl α-D-glucopyranoside ([\n14\nC]AMG), a non-metabolizable glucose analogue, and a single clone for each transporter was selected for maximal transporter activity to be used for evaluating the inhibitory activity of the compounds of this invention. In brief, 35,000 cells (CHO-K1/hSGLT-1 or CHO-K1/hSGLT-2) were plated per well of a black tissue culture treated 96-well plate in Ham's F12 media supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS and allowed to attached overnight at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. Compounds were serially diluted 3-fold in DMSO generating a nine (9) data point dose response curve for each compound. Two replicates were performed per determination. The compounds were then diluted into Uptake Buffer (10 mM Hepes, 5 mM Tris, 137 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 2.8 mM CaCl\n2\n, and 1.2 mM MgSO\n4\n, pH 7.4) with a final DMSO concentration of 0.9% (v/v). After the overnight incubation and prior to compound treatment, the cells were washed twice with Sodium Free Buffer in which the sodium chloride was replaced with 137 mM Choline Chloride, and then incubated with 4 μM [\n14\nC]AMG in Uptake Buffer in the presence or absence of diluted compound. Following a 3-hr incubation at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n, the uptake reaction was stopped by washing the cells three (3) times with ice-cold D-PBS and then lysing the cells with 50 μl of Microscint-20. After 15-min, the amount of radioactivity that was incorporated into the cells was quantified using a Microbeta reader.

Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \n1. Field of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure generally relates to the production and/or therapeutic use of \nrecombinant type\n 1 ribosome inhibiting proteins for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Description of the Relevant Art\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRibosome Inactivating Proteins (RIPs), found widely among plants, have been used for their medicinal properties since ancient times. Cucurmosin is an example of a \nType\n 1 RIP. \nType\n 1 RIPs are monomers of about 30 kilodalton (kDa) whereas \nType\n 2 RIPs are heterodimers. \nType\n 1 RIPs tend to have less toxicity than the \nType\n 2 RIPs for normal cells. Cucurmosin is isolated from \nCucurbita moschata \n(pumpkin) seeds—something that is naturally consumed by humans, suggesting a low innate toxicity. Cucurmosin has selective toxicity for tumor cells compared to non-cancer cells in culture via the induction of apoptosis. RIPs such as cucurmosin have therapeutic potential for diseases in addition to cancers including use as an antiviral agent and an antifungal agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRIPs are a large family of proteins, generally present in one or more tissues of individual plants. They can be divided into three families based on the number and organization of protein subunits. Type I RIPs (>60 members) contain a single chain of 26-31 kDa. Type II RIPs (˜15 cloned members), which include the relatively well-known ricin compound, possess two disulfide-linked chains—an enzymatic A chain and a lectinic B chain enabling the protein to effectively interact with a broad range of cell types. Type III RIPs are an alternative, non-classical group that are much less characterized than type I or II versions and contain either internal repressive peptides or additional protein chains of unknown function. RIP expression in its natural host is generally stimulated by a variety of environmental stresses upon the plant, including viral infection. Expression is often observed during cell senescence. These observations suggest that RIPs are part of an innate defense mechanism of plants to ensure appropriate cell growth, a hypothesis that emphasizes their potential as possible anti-tumor and anti-infectious disease drugs in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRIPs inhibit protein synthesis. Through interactions with a variety of ribosomal proteins, RIPs target the ribosome where they specifically act as an N-glycosidase and remove adenosine 4324 from the conserved ‘sarcin/ricin’ loop in 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). In addition to this rRNA cleavage activity, several other enzymatic activities have been associated with RIPs. RIPs can specifically remove adenine from the ADP-ribose chain of the Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) protein, a factor involved in DNA repair. Two RIPs have also been implicated in DNA damage, suggesting caspase activation leading to apoptosis. Some RIPs have been associated with glycosidase-independent nuclease activities as well as superoxide dismutase/antioxidant activity. Interaction with the 5′ cap of mRNAs has been reported which is of importance since the eukaryotic cap binding protein eIF4E may transform cells, and translational defects associated with such transformations are often associated with certain cancers (e.g., breast cancers). In summary, although their rRNA modification activity is best characterized, RIPs appear to have additional activities in cells contributing to their biological effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRIPs may protect plants from a variety of infectious diseases (e.g., viruses). Introducing the RIP genes into commercially relevant crops may provide protection against some of these diseases.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a method for preparing substantially purified \nrecombinant type\n 1 ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) may include obtaining a protein sequence. The protein sequence may include at least a portion of a \nrecombinant type\n 1 RIP.

The method may include substantially purifying the expressed recombinant cucurmosin.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \nOther objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon reading the following detailed description and upon reference to the accompanying drawings in which:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n depicts a graph of the results of treating HMEL tumors in mice with recombinant cucurmosin by tail vein injection.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \nWhile the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the drawing and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is to be understood the present invention is not limited to particular devices or biological systems, which may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” include singular and plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a linker” includes one or more linkers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a method of preparing at least partially purified \nrecombinant type\n 1 RIP, and/or a functional derivative thereof is provided. The method may include obtaining an expression vector containing at least a portion of the \ntype\n 1 RIP open reading frame (ORF) having an optimized gene sequence and introducing the expression vector in an appropriate host cell. The method may include isolating the recombinant protein expressed by the host cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a method of preparing at least partially purified, recombinant cucurmosin is provided. The method may include obtaining an expression vector containing at least a portion of the cucurmosin ORF sequence and introducing the expression vector in an appropriate host cell. The method may further include isolating the recombinant protein expressed by the host cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“\nType\n 1 Ribosome Inactivating Proteins” (RIPs), as used herein, generally are a family of proteins from the plant kingdom that are cytotoxic enzymes. RIPs may be polynucleotide adenosines glycosidases that cleave at the conserved sequence GAGA at the glycosidic bond of eukaryotic ribosomes in the α-sarcin/ricin (S/R) loop. In general, \ntype\n 1 RIPs may depurinate both eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the presence or absence of the ribosomal proteins. However, not all \ntype\n 1 RIPs depurinate all prokaryotic rRNA. Those \ntype\n 1 RIP that are active against \nE. coli \nrRNA, may cleave a bond between A-2660 and the ribose of the 23S rRNA. The depurination of the rRNA inactivates the ribosome and inhibits protein synthesis in the cell. \nType\n 1 RIPs also may depurinate DNA, poly (A), viral RNA and mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nType\n 1 RIPs isolated from their natural plant sources may include single chain polypeptides with a molecular weight of about 30 kilodalton (kDa). \nType\n 1 RIPs may be expressed in a prepro-form, having an N-terminal signal sequence (pre-) and a C-terminal sequence (pro-). These sequences may be cleaved to generate the mature protein. \nType\n 1 RIPs may include, but are not limited to, cucurmosin, moschatin, ME1 tricosanthin, dianthin, bouganin, bryodin, gelonin, pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP), saporin, sechiumin, momorcharin, luffin, CAP30, trichoanguin, beetin, karasurin-A, clavin, and lychnin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a \ntype\n 1 RIP may be a derivative of the \ntype\n 1 RIP. In an embodiment, it may be a prepro-RIP. In an embodiment, it may be a pre-RIP. In an embodiment, it may be a pro-RIP. Any of these derivatives may be expressed with an affinity handle (i.e., a tag) to simplify purification. In one embodiment, the \ntype\n 1 RIP may comprise a poly histidine sequence at the amino- or carboxy-termini. Other tags that may be used to purify the \ntype\n 1 RIP include glutathione S-transferase (GST), biotin, etc. In an embodiment, the \ntype\n 1 RIP may comprise a maltose binding protein at the amino- or carboxy-termini. One skilled in the art realizes there are many other affinity handles that may be useful. After attachment of the affinity handle, the resulting tagged \ntype\n 1 RIP may be passed through an affinity column and purified. The tag may be cleaved off the type-1 Rip after purification using known methods for decoupling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a \ntype\n 1 RIP may include the non-glycosylated form of the RIP protein (e.g., the protein (cucurmosin), a type I RIP from the Sarcocarp of \nCucurbita Moschata\n, see SEQUENCE ID NO:5 herein below). Post-translational modifications in the structure of the type-1 RIP may be made. For example, sugar moieties (e.g., N-acetyl-D-glucosamine; beta-D-mannose; alpha-D-mannose, and xylopyranose) may be linked together in a chain and attached to the side chain of Asparagine 225 (in the middle of the VQITNVTSNV sequence).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, there may be one or more amino acid substitutions in the \ntype\n 1 RIP sequence compared to the protein isolated from its natural source or compared to the protein sequence translated from the cDNA. In an embodiment, there may be amino acid deletions or additions to the \ntype\n 1 RIP compared to the protein isolated from its natural source or compared to the protein sequence translated from the cDNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the \ntype\n 1 RIP may be a mutant that is non-lethal to \nE. coli \nbut is cytotoxic to mammalian cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Host cell”, as used herein, generally refers to the cell in which the recombinant protein is expressed. The host cell may be of prokaryotic origin, yeast, a plant, insect cells and/or mammalian cells. In one embodiment, the host cell may be \nEscherichia coli \n(\nE. coli\n). In an embodiment, the host cell may be \nE. coli \nBL21 (DE3) pLys S. In one embodiment, the yeast may be of the genus \nPichia\n. In an embodiment, the insect cells may include Sf9 cells. In an embodiment, the host cell may include a tobacco plant. In an embodiment, the host cell may be \nNicotiana tabacum. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the host cell may be an \nE. coli \nstrain comprising mutant ribosomes that are not inactivated by the \ntype\n 1 RIP. In an embodiment, \ntype\n 1 RIP which are usually toxic to \nE. coli \nmay be expressed in these \nE. coli. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Gene optimization”, as used herein, generally refers to the process of generating a gene sequence that will yield optimal quantities of the gene product in the host cell. One skilled in the art realizes that there are many algorithms available to perform the optimization. The Optimum Gene™ algorithm is provided by GenScript Corp. (Piscataway, N.J.). The algorithms consider factors including, but not limited to, codon usage bias, mRNA structure, GC content, promoter sequences and termination sequences for the intended host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Ligands”, as used herein, generally refers to molecules that bind specifically to a cell surface. Usually, the ligand binds specifically to cell receptors. Ligands include, but are not limited to proteins, glycoproteins, carbohydrates, aptamers or lipids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the ligand may include a monoclonal antibody (MAB). A MAB may be isolated from ascites fluid from an animal (e.g., mouse or rat). A MAB may be isolated from the supernatant of cells grown in culture. The MAB used as a ligand may be of the IgG subclass but may also be an IgM, IgE or IgA. Usually, an IgG MAB is affinity purified using protein A or G sepharose. In other instances, the MAB may be isolated by salt fractionation. MABs are commercially available from a variety of vendors. In some embodiments, the MAB is selected based on its ability to recognize the native structure of the cell receptor. In many instances, a MAB recognizes only a denatured form of the cell receptor and is useful for applications such as immunoblotting or fixed immunofluorescence assays (IFA). In some embodiments, a MAB will most likely be functional if it functions in immunoprecipitations or non-fixed IFA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the ligand is a derivative of a MAB containing the complementary-determining region (CDR) or antigen binding site. In some aspects, the MAB fragment may be a recombinant protein. One skilled in the art will appreciate that there are several methods to generate and modify a MAB. In some embodiments, the MAB fragment is recombinantly expressed and purified as a single chain fragment variable (scFv). In some embodiments, the recombinant MAB may be genetically manipulated to be more amenable to carrier conjugation. In some embodiments, a MAB may be digested with proteases to generate fragments of the MAB (Fab) that may bind to the antigen. In an embodiment, the carbohydrate residues of the MAB may be treated chemically or enzymatically to be more amenable to carrier conjugation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, the ligand may be a polyclonal antibody. The IgG fraction may be isolated from serum. In these instances, the Fc portion of the IgG may be recognized by the Fc receptors on cells like macrophages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, the ligand is the natural ligand of the cell receptor. Natural ligands may include peptide hormones (e.g., insulin), growth factors (e.g., epidermal growth factor), small molecules (e.g., folate), proteins and/or glycoproteins (eg. orosomucoid). The ligand may be a derivative of the natural ligand (e.g., a fragment of the ligand which binds to the cell receptor). In an embodiment, the ligand may include a recombinant protein of the natural ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, the natural ligand may be modified. For example, orosomucoid, a glycoprotein recognized by liver cell, has its terminal sialic acid residues removed by mild acid hydrolysis to form asialoorosomucoid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Immunoconjugate”, as used herein, generally refer to a \ntype\n 1 RIP associated with a ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the association may be through a chemical reaction using cross-linking reagents. In one embodiment, the cross-linking agents may be hetero-bifunctional having functional groups including but not limited to, aryl azides, carbodiimide, hydrazine, imidoester, isocynate, maleimide, N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-ester and sulfo-NHS-ester. The bonds they produce may include, but are not limited to, amide, disulfide, hydrazone and ester bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of cross-linking agents include, but are not limited to, succinimidyl 4-formylbenzoate (SFB), succinimidyl 4-hydrazinonicotinate acetone hydrazone (SANH), 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide (EDC), N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionate (SPDP), 2-Iminothiolane (Traut's Reagent), SATA, and 3-[2-pyridyldithio]propionyl hydrazide (PDPH).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, SFB is reacted with free primary amine groups of the \ntype\n 1 RIP while introducing reactive aldehyde groups. SANH is reacted with free primary amines of the ligand while introducing reactive hydrazine groups. The SFB activated-\ntype\n 1 RIP is mixed with the SANH activated-ligand. The reactive aldehyde groups react with the hydrazine groups to generate hydrazone bonds, thus producing the immunoconjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the association of the ligand and the \ntype\n 1 RIP may be through genetic manipulation to generate a fusion protein. The ligand may be fused to the ligand at the amino- or carboxy-termini. In one embodiment, the gene sequence of the fusion protein is optimized for expression in its host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, a method of treating of cancer or infectious diseases may include administering to an individual who would benefit from such treatment an effective amount of a composition comprising \nrecombinant type\n 1 RIP or cucurmosin, and/or functional derivatives thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, a method of protecting plants from infectious diseases may include introducing a \ntype\n 1 RIP or cucurmosin gene or a portion thereof with optimized codon sequences, to plants of interest wherein the gene product is expressed in the plants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition suitable for use in the treatment of cancer may include an effective amount of \nrecombinant type\n 1 RIP or cucurmosin, or functional derivatives thereof in combination with an appropriate pharmaceutical carrier medium.

The nucleic acid sequence may include codons optimized for the host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid sequence may encode a derivative of cucurmosin, a truncated cucurmosin polypeptide, and/or a cucurmosin polypeptide including at least one mutation in the polypeptide sequence thereof. In an embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence may include codons optimized for the host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, a method of killing cancer cells may include contacting cancer cells with an at least partially purified preparation of recombinant cucurmosin, and/or a functional derivative thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, a method may include introducing a nucleic acid sequence encoding a derivative of cucurmosin into cells which are introduced into individuals, such that the cells carrying the cucurmosin nucleic acid produce an effective amount of cucurmosin polypeptide to the benefit of the individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is contemplated that the RIPs disclosed herein and produced by the methods disclosed herein may be used in the following applications without limitation: as an antiparasitic; as an abortifacient, for removal of cells from culture; as an anti-inflammatory; as an anti-spasm; as an analgesic; in ophthalmology treatments, for agricultural applications, and for veterinary applications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, it is contemplated that antibodies may be produced that are specific to type I RIP. Such antibodies may be used for the detection of the RIP for which it was generated. Additionally, the produced antibodies may be used for the purification of the RIP using, for example, affinity matrix after binding to the RIP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, engineered organisms may be produced that include a tagged \ntype\n 1 RIP disclosed herein and produced by the methods disclosed herein, and its derivatives. Such engineered organisms may be used, for example, to overexpress the type I RIP to treat cancer or other diseases.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nHaving now described the invention, the same will be more readily understood through reference to the following example(s), which are provided by way of illustration, and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein may be used in the application or testing of the present embodiments, suitable methods and materials are described below.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nCloning and Sequencing of Cucurmosin cDNA\n\n\n \n \n \nTotal RNA was isolated from \nCucurbita \nmoschata leaves. The leaves were frozen and then ground. The powdered leaves were added to 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen) and disrupted using a glass homogenizer. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble phase was mixed with chloroform, incubated at 21° C. for 2 minutes and then centrifuged for 15 minutes at 12,000 rpm. The upper aqueous phase was removed, mixed with isopropanol and centrifuged. The RNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol and then solubilized in 75 μl of Elution Solution (Ambion, RNAqueous Kit #AM1912).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing previously published protein and DNA sequences for cucurmosin, oligonucleotide primers were designed to synthesize cucurmosin cDNA from the \nC. moschata \ntotal RNA. According to the manufacturer's instructions, the FirstChoice® RLM-Race kit (Ambion, #AM1700) was used to generate PCR products of the extreme 5′ and 3′ termini of the cucurmosin mRNA. The PCR products were sequenced and the full-length cDNA sequence established (Seq. ID 1) and the protein sequenced translated (Seq. ID 2). Based on N-terminal sequencing data and X-ray crystal structures of the mature protein, cucurmosin is deduced as a 245 amino acid protein, consistent with the data of \nother type\n 1 RIPs (Seq ID 5). On the other hand, our protein (Seq. ID 2) has a 23 amino acid signal sequence (pre-sequence) at the N-terminus and a 44 amino acid extrapeptide (pro-sequence) at the C-terminus. This cloning approach enabled us to identify the additional 44 amino acids on the seat C terminus and 23 amino acids on the N terminus of cucurmosin which may be critical for its activity.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nExpressing Cucurmosin in \nE. Coli \nUsing the pUC57 Vector\n\n\n \n \n \nTo potentially produce the highest level of cucurmosin expression in \nE. coli\n, the protein sequence to be expressed was given to GenScript Corp. (Piscataway, N.J.) to synthesize a cucurmosin gene optimized for expression in \nE. coli\n. GenScript Corp. has an OptimumGene™ algorithm that takes into consideration a variety of critical factors involved in different stages of protein expression such as codon adaptability, GC content and mRNA structure. In this example, the pro-cucurmosin was synthesized with a 5′ T7 promoter and a C-terminal histidine tag (Seq. ID 3) and cloned into the EcoRV site of the pUC 57 vector (GenScript, #SD1176). The gene sequence translated to a protein of 297 amino acids (SEQ ID 4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recombinant plasmid, pUC57-RIP, was transformed into \nE. coli \nBL21 (DE3) pLysS. DE3 is a prophage carrying T7 RNA polymerase and lacI\nq\n. Transformed plasmids with T7 promoters are repressed until isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) is added to the culture. The pLysS produces T7 lysozyme, is a muramidase that cleaves (hydrolyzes) proteoglycan. Using this system, leaky recombinant protein expression is minimized until IPTG is added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pUC57-RIP clones were grown in Rich Induction Medium (20 g/L Tryptone, 10 g/L Yeast extract, 5 g/L NaCl, 1.2 mL/L of 5N NaOH, 1% glucose, 100 μg/mL Ampicillin, and Chloramphenicol). The cells were grown with shaking at 37° C. until they reached an A600 of 0.56. An aliquot of the uninduced cells was taken, centrifuged and the cell pellet frozen for later analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHalf of the remaining culture was grown at 25° C. and the other half at 37° C. with shaking. IPTG was added to 0.8 mM to both cultures and grown for 3 hours and ˜18 hours. At these times, cells were harvested and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation and frozen at −20° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll pelleted cells were lysed in 1/20 the volume of the original culture volume in lysis buffer (40 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme, 0.01 M NaCl). The pellets were vortexed until the lysate was to viscous to pipet. At that point, benzonase (2-4 μl per liter of culture) was added and incubated on ice until the sample became freely flowing (i.e., less viscous). The samples were superfuged in a Sorvall superfuge at 10° C. for 40 min. The supernatants were moved to fresh tubes and the pellets were resuspended with an equal volume of buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. The samples were transferred from the SDS-PAGE gel to PVDF paper and then probed with an anti-his tag antibody. The pro-cucurmosin was detected primarily in the cells grown at 25° C. having an apparent molecular weight of 38 kDa. The apparent molecular weight of the recombinant RIP is larger than that of the native plant protein; this is probably due to its longer C-terminal amino acid sequence discovered through our cloning process described in Example 1. In addition, the cells grown for ˜18 hours had more pro-cucurmosin than the culture induced for 3 hours.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nExpression and Isolation of Pro-Cucurmosin in \nE. Coli \nUsing the Pet24b Vector\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pro-cucurmosin gene was sub-cloned from pUC57-RIP into pET24b. pUC57-RIP was digested with Nde I and Xho Ito excise the pro-cucurmosin gene. This DNA fragment was cloned into the Nde I and Xho I site of pET24b to encode a 297 amino acid pro-cucurmosin product with a C-terminal tag of 6 histidines to mediate purification. The pET24b-RIP vector was transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. The transformed cells were grown in one liter of Rich Induction Medium at 37° C. to an A600 of 1.0. IPTG was added to 0.8 mM and the culture was incubated at 25° C. with shaking for ˜18 hours. The cells in the culture were pelleted and disrupted in 50 ml lysis buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lysate was brought to 300 mM NaCl and syringe filtered using a 0.45 μm filter. The his-tagged pro-cucurmosin was isolated using the Talon Metal Affinity Resin (ClonTech). A 1 ml Talon resin bed was washed with 5 column volumes of 100 mM NaCl: 20 mM MES pH 5.0. The column was equilibrated with 4 column volumes of wash buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate (monobasic) pH 8.0). The filtered lysate was passed through the column and the flow-thru saved. The column was then washed with 2 column volumes of wash buffer and 6 column volumes of wash buffer pH 7.0 (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaPO4 pH 7.0). Sample was eluted with 2 column volumes of 150 mM imidazole. The eluate contained a protein having the same mobility (slightly larger than the 37 kDa marker) as observed in Example 2. About 4-10 mg of protein was isolated per liter of culture.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nCytotoxicity of Pro-Cucurmosin in Cancer Cells In Vitro\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman breast cancer cells, MDA 231 and BT 474, were grown in tissue culture to assay for the concentration at which 50% of the cells are inhibited from growing (IC50). The cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5000 cells per well and grown overnight in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 15 μg/ml insulin. The culture medium was replaced. The recombinant cucurmosin, natural cucurmosin and vinblastine were added to the cells at various concentrations. Likewise, the non-cancer cells, LO2 and lymphocytes were treated with these drugs at different concentrations. The cells were grown for an additional 72 hours and then 20 μl of TOX8 was added to each well. The cells were incubated another 8 hours at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nto allow time for the cells to metabolize the TOX8 indicator. Absorbance readings at 600 nm were taken of each well. Viability was indicated by a drop in absorbance at 600 nm readings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IC50 of recombinant cucurmosin for both cancer cell lines was just above 20 nM (TABLE 1) which was very similar to those of the natural cucurmosin and the often used cancer drug, Vinblastine. However, in contrast to Vinblastine, both the recombinant and natural cucurmosin had much higher IC50 for the non-cancer cells. These data indicate that recombinant cucurmosin may be very useful as a cancer drug since it is much more toxic to the cancer cells than the normal cells, unlike the Vinblastine.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 of recombinant cucurmosin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRecombinant\n\n\nNatural\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCells\n\n\nCucurmosin\n\n\nCucurmosin\n\n\nVinblastine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTB474\n\n\n22\n\n\n27\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMDA231\n\n\n23\n\n\n24\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLO2\n\n\n1200\n\n\n1100\n\n\n68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLymphocytes\n\n\n2500\n\n\n2400\n\n\n73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nUse of Pro-Cucurmosin to Reduce Tumors in Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman lung cancer cells, HMEL or A549, were used to induce tumor formation in backs of NOD/SCID mice (JAX, #001303). The cells were maintained in culture. In each experiment, 5 million cells were injected into the back of the mice. Tumors formed in 2 to 3 weeks. Tumor sizes were measured using a digital caliper and then areas calculated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one experiment, either 5 or 50 μg recombinant cucurmosin was injected into the HMEL tumors in 100 μl of saline solution on the days that the tumors were measured. \nMouse\n 2 had tumors in both sides of its back which were each treated separately. Over the 18 day period, the mouse injected with no cucurmosin saw its tumor increase 267% (TABLE 2). Meanwhile, tumors smaller than 40 mm\n2 \nwere completely abrogated using either 5 or 50 μg of cucurmosin. \nMouse\n 3 started with the largest tumor of the group but the 5 μg treatment was able slow the tumor growth compared to the negative control. It is also important to note that the mice did not suffer any noticeable side-effects by the cucurmosin. \n \nMouse\n \n 1 and 3 with HMEL tumors after 18 days intratumoral treatment (Table 2), were continually administered recombinant cucurmosin by tail vein injection using 50 μg of recombinant cucurmosin in 100 μl saline solution at day 0 (the same day as day 18 of intratumoral treatment) and \nday\n 5. Seven days after initial tail vein injection with recombinant cucurmosin, the tumor size in \nMouse\n 3 only increased 7% while the \ncontrol Mouse\n 1 increased 43%. The cucurmosin tail vein injection resulted in no obvious toxic effects on the mice. The results of these tests are depicted in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreating HMEL tumors in mice with recombinant\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncucurmosin, intratumorally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCucur-\n\n\nTumor Size (mm\n2\n)\n\n\nTumor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmosin\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\ngrowth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse\n\n\n(μg)\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n8\n\n\n15\n\n\n18\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n92.3\n\n\n106.7\n\n\n137.3\n\n\n205.1\n\n\n251.6\n\n\n339\n\n\n267\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 left\n\n\n5\n\n\n39.4\n\n\n33\n\n\n23\n\n\n19.7\n\n\n12.5\n\n\n0\n\n\n−100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 right\n\n\n5\n\n\n27.8\n\n\n24.8\n\n\n18.5\n\n\n12.2\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n−100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n162.2\n\n\n158\n\n\n151.8\n\n\n186.7\n\n\n206.7\n\n\n231.2\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n50\n\n\n23.9\n\n\n12.2\n\n\n9.4\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n−100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another group of mice, carrying tumors derived from A549 cells, 5 or 50 μg treatments of directly injected recombinant cucurmosin into the tumors was able to reduce tumors by 15 and 33%, respectively while the negative control saw the tumor grow 150% (TABLE 3).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreating A549 tumors in mice with recombinant\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncucurmosin, intratumorally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCucur-\n\n\nTumor Size (mm\n2\n)\n\n\nTumor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmosin\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\ngrowth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse\n\n\n(μg)\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n7\n\n\n9\n\n\n11\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n47.9\n\n\n60.6\n\n\n70.4\n\n\n81.9\n\n\n98.6\n\n\n120.2\n\n\n150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n5\n\n\n34.7\n\n\n38.8\n\n\n42.4\n\n\n40.8\n\n\n39.5\n\n\n29.5\n\n\n−15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n50\n\n\n100.6\n\n\n104.1\n\n\n108.6\n\n\n113.1\n\n\n78.8\n\n\n67.3\n\n\n−33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nCucurmosin as an Immunotoxin\n\n\n \n \n \nThe previous examples demonstrate that cucurmosin exhibits strong selectivity for tumor-derived cells in mice. However, cucurmosin or any \nother type\n 1 RIP may be made more specific by combining it with a targeting ligand, either chemically or through molecular manipulations. This may be important for some very refractory cancer cells that require high doses of drug for a beneficial effect to the patient. The more cell-specific the drug, the less toxicity it will induce.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOver-expression of CD44, a hyaluronan receptor, is observed in breast cancer cells and the presence of certain CD44 isoforms is emerging as an important marker of metastatic potential. Recombinant cucurmosin, may be conjugated with hyaluronan, a ligand for CD44 through chemical cross-linkers. Alternatively, it could be chemically conjugated to a monoclonal antibody (MAB) ligand or a derivative of a MAB that binds specifically to CD44. On the other hand, a protein fusion could be constructed of cucurmosin (or any \nother type\n 1 RIP) and fragment of the MAB that specifically recognizes the CD44, usually the single chain Fragment variable (scFv) region. This protein fusion may be expressed using the optimized system taught in this patent to generate high yields of immunotoxin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above are just a few examples of the types of immunotoxins that could be created using \ntype\n 1 RIP. One skilled in the art will recognize that there are many other peptides and proteins that could be molecularly fused to cucurmosin or \nother type\n 1 RIP and expressed at high levels using codons optimized for the host in which the immunotoxin are translated. Ligands that recognize CD38, CD20, alpha-acetylcholine receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), CD30, CD25, CD40, CD7 may be fused with cucurmosin. Many others may be contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther modifications and alternative embodiments of various aspects of the invention may be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of this description.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a method for obtaining oligonucleotide.\n\n\n \n\n\nRelated Art\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAlthough it has believed that oligonucleotides such as DNA and RNA mainly have a function, as molecules concerning the synthesis of proteins, it has numerously found that molecules perform the expression of function thereof by means of the interaction with gene, e.g. ribozyme and RNai. Attention is currently focused on the application for therapeutical field. Especially, the aptamer has been paid attention as a nucleic acid which binds to macromolecule such as proteins capable of altering the function of the macromolecule. In order to apply it to medicines, new aptamers have been obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer such as RNA aptamer has been generally obtained in accordance with SELEX method (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment) (see Patent Document 1). In case of obtaining RNA aptamer with SELEX method, a target substance such as protein is associated with DNA library comprising randomized sequence to form a complex of RNA/target substance. Next, the complex of RNA/target substance is attached on a protein-adsorptive filter such as nitrocellulose filter. Free RNA which is not involved to form the complex is included on the filter, in addition to the complex or RNA/target substance. The free RNA is physically washed from the filter by using a buffer. The filter is treated with a buffer containing any agent including urea to obtain a desired RNA from the complex of RNA/target substance which is included on the filter. The obtained RNA is amplified with PCR methods to obtain a gene product, and the above-mentioned steps of the formation of complex, and the wishing and treatment through the filter are repeated. The SELEX method is a method for obtaining gene products which can specifically bind to target substance by means of repeating such steps.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the method for obtaining the oligonucleotide such as RNA aptamer in accordance with the SELEX method, it is necessary to attach a mixture containing the complex of oligonucleotide/target substance which is obtained to associate an oligonucleotide library such as DNA library with the target substance, to the protein-adsorptive filter such as nitrocellulose filter. This will result in binding the complex of oligonucleotide/target substance on the filter. In addition, the oligonucleotide which cannot be bound to the target substance, that is, the oligonucleotide not to be subjected to obtain with this method will be also attached on the filter by means of nonspecific adsorption it with the filter. Accordingly, in order to only obtain the desired oligonucleotide from the complex of oligortucleotide/target substance, it is necessary to further perform steps of washing the filter so as not to remain an undesired oligonucleotide on the filter and to remain the complex of oligonucleotide/target substance on the filter and of extracting the desired oligonucleotide from the filter. Therefore, it is difficult to efficiently obtain the desired oligonucleotide by means of the above-mentioned washing step and extracting step due not only to the interaction of the undesired oligonucleotide with the filter but also to the interaction of the undesired oligonucleotide with the complex of oligonucleotide/target substance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, it is necessary to repeat each step as mentioned above with several to ten or more times in the SELEX method in order to obtain the oligonucleotide having high binding capacity to the target substance. So, it has a disadvantage in view of cost and operating efficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n Further, it is necessary to use an apparatus including the filter manifold for the above-mentioned washing/extracting step. The method is unsuitable for obtaining the oligonucleotide with large scale.\n\n\n \n \nPatent Document\n 1\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nJP 2763958B\n \n \n\nThe document by \nCONRAD R.C. ET AL.: \"\nIN VITRO SELECTION OF NUCLEIC ACID APTAMERS THAT BIND PROTEINS\n\", METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY, Vol. 267, 1 January 1996 (1996-01-01), pages 336-367\n, discloses a method for obtaining a RNA molecule with a high binding capacity to a protein, whereby a combination of modified cellulose filters and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is used to separate the RNA/ protein complex from unbound RNA molecules.

Hereinafter, the \"step of performing an electrophoresis of a nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex comprising a nucleic acid molecule, and a target substance\" is referred to as an electrophoresis step, the \"step of recovering said nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex\" is referred to as a recovery step, the \"step of extracting the nucleic acid molecule from said nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex\" is referred to as an extraction step and the \"step of gene amplifying said nucleic acid molecule.\" is referred to as an amplification step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method for obtaining oligonucleotide according to the present invention is a method for obtaining the oligonucleotide which can be bound to the target substance, from the nucleic acid molecule wherein it performs the steps of the electrophoresis step, the recovery step, the extraction step and the amplification step to obtain the gene product such as DNA and RNA, and if necessary, the obtained gene product is subjected to perform the steps including the electrophoresis step and the following steps.\n\n\n \n(The electrophoresis step)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe electrophoresis step in the method for obtaining oligonucleotide according to the present invention is performed such that the mixture containing nucleic acid molecule such as single strand RNA and nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex comprising the target substance such as proteins is introduced into an appropriate substrate such as agarose gel and a voltage is applied to the substrate. This will result in separating the nucleic acid molecule and the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex contained in the mixture due to the difference in mobility in the substrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the method for obtaining oligonucleotide according to the present invention, the electrophoresis step is performed with at least 1 to 3 times, specially, preferably with once in the agarose gel in view of efficiently obtaining the oligonucleotide. In addition, in the method for obtaining oligonucleotide according to the present invention, the agarose gel is preferably used for the first time of the electrophoresis step. This will enable to efficiently remove the nucleic acid molecule such as DNA molecule which non-specifically binds. Further, in the method for obtaining oligonucleotide according to the present invention, the method preferably comprises the electrophoresis step using the agarose gel and the electrophoresis step using the polyacrylamide gel. This will enable to fractionate and obtain candidates to be subjected such as aptamer with easy-to-handle and in a short time. Such a candidate can be specifically fractionated and obtained in the polyacrylamide gel method.\n\n\n \n[The nucleic acid molecule]\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the present invention, the nucleic acid molecule generically refers to as a so-called nucleic acid including adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine and uracil, and/or so-called gene-related substances of nucleoside comprising nucleic acid analog substance in which the sugar portion of the nucleoside is ester-linked with the phosphate residue thereof. For example, example of the nucleic acid molecule includes single strand DNA, single strand DNA, double strand DNA and double strand RNA. Hereinafter, it will be described with regard to the single strand RNA (RNA aptamer) to be subjected to obtain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this case, the nucleic acid molecule may comprise: a region containing randomized sequence consisting of A, G, C and U (hereinafter, referred also to as a random region); and a fixed sequence containing a known sequence at 5'-end and 3'-end of the random region (hereinafter, referred also to as a 5'-end fixed sequence and a 3'-send fixed sequence, respectively). These fixed sequences correspond to a primer region necessary for PCR methods for performing the amplification step as mentioned below in the method for obtaining oligonucleotide according to the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch a nucleic acid molecule can be easily obtained as the following method. That is, a gene product comprising a complementary DNA to the above-mentioned single strand RNA ; (5'-end fixed sequence-random region-3' -end fixed sequence) may be preliminary prepared, and the object nucleic acid molecule may be prepared from such a gene product with DNA-dependent RNA polymerase such as T7 RNA polymerase in accordance with in vitro transcription method. In this case, a sequence capable of activating the promoter activity of the DNA dependent RNA polymerase as used may be linked to the upstream of the complementary sequence to the 5'-end fixed sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 5'-end fixed sequence and 3'-send fixed sequence of the nucleic acid molecule is not limited so far as it has less effect for binding the nucleic acid molecule and target substance and it provides a primer region necessary for PCR methods in the amplification step. In case of using single strand RNA as the nucleic acid molecule, the 3'-end fixed sequence will offer the primer region for RNA dependent DNA polymerase and DNA dependent DNA polymerase in the amplification steep, and the 5'-end fixed sequence will offer the primer region for DNA dependent DNA polymerase in the amplification step. Accordingly, the 5'-end fixed sequence and 3'- end fixed sequence may be appropriately selected based on the expression profile of the activity of these polymerases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe random region of the nucleic acid molecule is a gene comprising A, G, C and U (in the sequence listing, correctively referred to as \"n\") having a predetermined base length. The base length may be appropriately altered based on the oligonucleotide to be subjected to obtain and on the property of the target substance, and may be, for example, 15 to 60 bases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for manufacture of the random region is not limited, including artificial synthesis, semi-artificial synthesis. For example, example of such a method includes a synthesis method using nucleic acid synthesis apparatuses such at 3400 DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems), an extraction method according to the well known method such as the phenol extraction of natural origin gene products, and a preparation method of cleaving such a gene product with gene cleavage enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be noted that the present invention is not limited to use the single strand RNA, although the above-mentioned description is for the single strand RNA as one of examples of the nucleic acid molecule used in the method for obtaining oligonucleotide according to the present invention. With regard to the other molecular species, the nucleic acid molecule can be prepared by appropriately selecting the sequence, primer and enzymes and the others based on the molecular species.\n\n\n \n[The target substance]\n\n\n \n \n \nThe target substance means a counterpart substance to be obtained in the present invention. Example of the target substance includes molecules, compounds and substances which can form a complex with nucleic acid molecule by means of the intermolecular associations such as hydrogen bonding and ion binding with the oligonucleotide. For example, example of the target substance includes peptides, proteins, glycoproteins, hormones, growth factors, receptors, antigens, antibodies, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, carbohydrates and synthetic compounds.\n\n\n \n[The nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex]\n\n\n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex comprising the nucleic acid molecule and the target substance is prepared by incubating the nucleic acid molecule and the target substance in buffers such as Tris-based or in an appropriate solvent for a predetermined period. In this case, for the purpose of efficiency of the electrophoresis step, high density solution such a glycerol is preferably added. Example of such an additive includes glycerol and saccharose solution. The amount of the additive is not limited so far as the formation of the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex is not inhibited. According to the invention, the amount is in the range of 10 to 30 w/v% (10 to 30 v/v% with regard to the volume of the reaction mixture). In addition, for the purpose of facilitating the formation of the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex, monovalent or divalent cationic ion may be added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for preparing the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex, but not limited to, may be such that the nucleic acid molecule and the target substance is added to and in contact with the above-mentioned appropriate solvent. Such a contact is performed at which the substrate is introduced, in case of performing the electrophoresis step. In addition, it may be performed in an appropriate container.\n\n\n \n[The substrate]\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the present invention, the substrate used in the electrophoresis step is not limited to so far as the nucleic acid molecule and the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex contained in the mixture can be electrically separated. Example of the substrate includes agarose gel, polyacrylamide gel and watersoluble cellulose gel. The concentration of the substrate is not limited to so far as the nucleic acid molecule and the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex can be separated in the substrate. For example, in case of using agarose as the substrate, the concentration of the substrate may be in the range of 0.5% to 2.0%, preferably 0.7% to 1.5%. In addition, in case of using polyacrylamide gel as the substrate, the concentration of the substrate may be in the range of 5 to 20%, preferably 7 to 12%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the electrophoresis step, the substrate may be prepared to solve in buffers capable of electrically charging the nucleic acid molecule, the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex and the others. A well-known buffer which can be used for the electrophoresis may be used, including Tris-based and HEPES-based buffer. Among them, in case of performing the electrophoresis step using agarose gel, example of the buffer includes TBE buffer (Tris-borate-EDTA buffer) and TAE buffer (Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe electrophoresis in the electrophoresis step may be performed such that the binding condition of the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex is maintained in the substrate and an appropriate voltage is applied for the mixture introduced in the substrate so as to be capable of transferring the nucleic acid molecule and the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex in the substrate with different mobility. The range of the voltage and the applied time may be appropriately selected in view of the mobility of the mixture in the substrate. For example, in case of performing the electrophoresis step using the agarose gel, the electrophoresis can be performed for 5 to 30 minutes at the voltage of 50 to 150V. In case of performing the electrophoresis step using the polyacrylamide gel, the electrophoresis can be performed for 1 to 4 hours at the voltage of 100 to 200 V. The applied time may be that the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex and the nucleic acid molecule or the target substance which is not involved in the formation of the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex can be electrophoretically separated. In addition, the temperature of the electrophoresis step is not limited so far as the mobile phase is not solidified, and may be the range of 2°C to room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mobile phase performing the electrophoresis step may be used so far as the binding condition of the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex is at least maintained, including a solvent containing a well-known buffer such as Tris. If necessary, electrolytes such as cationic ion and anionic ion may be added in the mobile phase. The mobile phase may contain monovalent or divalent cationic ion in view of maintaining the binding condition of the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSo separated nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex from the nucleic acid molecule in the substrate is provided in the following recovery step.\n\n\n \n(The recovery step)\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the method for obtaining oligonucleotide according to the present invention, the recovery step is a step of recovering the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex from the substrate as obtained in the electrophoresis step. The recovery step may be appropriately selected in accordance with the existence form of the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex in the substrate. For example, example of means for carrying out the recovery step includes a method of directly inserting an appropriate dispensing apparatus or instrument such as pipette into the well of the substrate to collect the subject, or a method of cutting the substrate containing nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex with cutter to recover the subject as a piece of the substrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex contained in the substrate after the electrophoresis step may be located in and near the well in which the mixture is introduced in the substrate, or may form the band shape in the substrate, depending on the condition of the electrophoresis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn case of locating the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex in the well, using the appropriate dispensing means such as pipette, the means may be inserted in the well to directly collect the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex. This technique may be applied in case of locating the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex near the well. In this case, the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex will be recovered in the solution state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEven in case of locating the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex near the well, when the above-mentioned technique is difficult to use, the substrate near the well may be cut into the piece of the substrate having an appropriate size to collect the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex along with the substrate. This technique can be applied in case that the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex forms the band shape in the substrate. That is, in case of locating the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex in the substrate, a part of the substrate containing the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex may be cut with cutter to recover the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex along with the substrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the recovery step, one of the above-mentioned techniques or an appropriate combination thereof may be selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the recovery step, depending on the property of the nucleic acid molecule and/or target substance to be subjected, an appropriate method capable of observing these molecules and/or substances may be appropriately used as a method for confirming the existence of the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex in the substrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, example of the method of confirming the existence of the nucleic acid molecule in the substrate includes a method of visualizing the molecule using a well-known detecting agent for the gene product such as ethidium bromide and cybergreen. In addition, it may be that the nucleic acid molecule is preliminary labeled with radioactive compounds such as \n32\nP-ATP or with fluorescence agent such as fluorescein and Cy5, and these labels are detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, in case of using protein as the target substance, example of the method of confirming the existence of the target substance in the substrate includes a method for visualizing the protein such as silver staining, coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) straining.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSo recovered nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex will be provided in the following extraction step.\n\n\n \n(The extraction step)\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the method for obtaining oligonucleotide according to the present invention, the extraction step is a step of extracting the nucleic acid molecule from the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex recovered in the recovery step. The extraction step may be appropriately performed in accordance with the existence form (e.g. the solution state, and a state along with the substrate) of the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex obtained in the recovery step. Example of the recovery step includes a well-known method of recovering gene products such as phenol extraction, ethanol precipitation and spin column method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn case that the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex has been recovered in the solultion state, the nucleic acid molecule may be extracted from the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex using the phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and the others. In case that the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex has been recovered along with the substrate, the nucleic acid molecule may be extracted from the nucleic acid molecule/target substance complex using the spin column having an appropriate cut off value based on the molecular weight and other property of the target substance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSo extracted nucleic acid molecule will be provided in the following amplification step.\n\n\n \n(The amplification step)\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the method for obtaining oligonucleotide according to the present invention, the amplification step is a step of amplifying the nucleic acid molecule obtained in the extraction step and the other steps. The amplification step is a step of the gene amplification using PCR methods such as RT-PCR, PCR and in vitro transcription. The amplification step may be performed, by utilizing the fixed sequence contained in the 5'-end and 3'-end of the nucleic acid molecule, with the primer which complementary binding to these fixed sequences. As an example, the amplification step using the single strand RNA will be explained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFirst, the single strand DNA obtained in the extraction step, RNA dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) such as reverse transcriptase originated from avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV Reverse Transcriptase), and the primer complementary to the fixed sequence at 3'-end of the single strand RNA are incubated to amplify the complementary DNA to this single strand RNA. So amplified complementary DNA are further amplified into a double strand DNA by using primers complementary to the 5'-end fixed sequence and the 3'-end fixed sequence contained in the complementary DNA and a well-known DNA dependent RNA polymerase such as Taq DNA polymerase. Then, the double strand DNA is transcribed into the single strand RNA with a well-known DNA dependent. RNA polymerase such as T7 RNA polymerase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this way, the subject nucleic acid molecule capable of binding to the target substance are specifically amplified through the steps of the electrophoresis step, the recovery step, the extraction step and the amplification step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the single strand DNA is exemplified as the nucleic acid molecule, the amplification step may be appropriatly performed by selecting polymerases and primers in accordance with the subject nucleic acid molecule to be amplified, in case of using the other nucleic acid such as single strand DNA, double strand RNA and double strand RNA as the nucleic acid molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSo transcribed nucleic acid molecule may be as the oligonucleotide obtained in the method for obtaining oligonucleotide according to the present invention. In addition, the nucleic acid molecule may be subjected to repeating the above-mentioned steps, if necessary.\n\n\n \n(The other steps)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe method for obtaining oligonucleotide according to the present invention may comprise a step of using the filter in accordance with the above-mentioned method in addition to the electrophoresis step. The step of using the filter in accordance with SELEX method is the same in the prior art.\n\n\n \nEmbodiment\n\n\n(Reference Example 1)\n\n\n \n \n \n200 nM of oligonucleotide (sequence number 1), and 0, 200 nM, 2 µM and 4 µM of ΔNS3 protein (sequence number 2) originated from NS3 protease of hepatitis virus C wherein the His-Tag having 6 histidine residues is liked to the N terminal of the protein (hereinafter, referred simply to as ΔNS3 protein) were incubated in a binding buffer solution (20 µL of reaction volume) at 20% final concentration of glycerol (50 mM of Tris-HCl (pH7.8), 5 mM of MgCl\n2\n and 5 mM of CaCl\n2\n) for 20 minutes at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSo obtained mixture was introduced in 1% of agarose gel containing 0.00005% of ethidium bromide, and an electrophoresis was performed in TBE buffer (44.5 mM Tris, 44.5 mM of boric acid and EDTA (1 mM, pH 8.0)) for 7 minutes at 100V.
