The entire teachings of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nFusion proteins are a recognized class of potentially effective therapeutic and diagnostic agents. One benefit provided by fusion protein technology is the possibility of designing a fusion protein that has desired function, enhanced desirable properties and/or decreased undesirable properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion proteins contain component polypeptides which are derived from different parental proteins, and bonded or fused to each other through a peptide bond. Each component polypeptide in a fusion protein contributes to the properties of the fusion protein, and it is desirable for the component polypeptide to be fused at positions that do not result in a reduction in the activity of the component polypeptides. Thus, conventional fusion proteins generally are fused at positions that correspond to domain boundaries, or the loops between domains, in the native parental proteins. For example, a conventional chimeric antibody light chain is a fusion protein that contains a non-human antibody light chain variable domain that is fused to a human light chain constant domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of conventional fusion proteins that can limit commercial applications is that the amino acid sequence and structure surrounding the fusion site does not match the corresponding amino acid sequence of either of the parental proteins. As a result, the fusion protein contains a \"non-self' amino acid sequence that includes the amino acids adjacent to the fusion site. Even when a fusion protein contains polypeptides derived from proteins from the same species (\ne.g.\n, two human polypeptides are fused), the amino acid sequence at the fusion site will commonly comprise a non-self sequence generated by the juxtaposition of amino acid residues from different parental proteins. These non-self sequences can function as antibody and/or T-cell epitopes and render the fusion protein immunogenic, and can limit \nin vivo\n uses of the fusion protein, or render the fusion protein unsuitable for \nin vivo\n applications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe juxtaposition of amino acid residues at the fusion site in conventional fusion proteins can also have other undesirable effects. For example, the juxtaposed amino acids can result in disruption of structural features important for expression, activity and/or stability. Consequently, conventional fusion proteins frequently form aggregates or oligomers, have low solubility and/or are more susceptible to proteolysis than are the parental proteins. In addition, conventional fusion proteins frequently can only be produced in lower yields than the parental proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is a need for improved fusion proteins and improved methods for designing and making fusion proteins.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to recombinant fusion proteins that contain natural junctions.

To enable the invention to be described clearly and concisely, this specification contains formulae that represent partial structures of the disclosed fusion proteins. These formulae depict portions of the fusion protein that are located amino terminally to carboxy terminally (from left to right in the formulae) as is conventional in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithin this specification, the term \"about\" is preferably interpreted to mean optionally plus or minus 50%, more preferably optionally plus or minus 20%, even more preferably optionally plus or minus 10%, even more preferably optionally plus or minus 5%, even more preferably optionally plus or minus 2%, even more preferably optionally plus or minus 1%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Fusion protein\" is a term of art that refers to a continuous polypeptide chain that contains parts or portions that are derived from different parental amino acid sequences (\ne.g.\n, proteins). The portions of a fusion protein can be directly bonded to each other or indirectly bonded through, for example, a peptide linker. A fusion protein can contain two or more portions that are derived from two or more different polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein \"junction\" refers to the site at which two amino acid sequences that are derived from two different polypeptides are joined in a fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a \"natural junction\" refers to a junction in a fusion protein that has an amino acid sequence that is the same as the amino acid sequence found at the corresponding position of one or both of the parental polypeptides. For example, as illustrated herein in \nScheme\n 1 using hypothetical parental proteins X and Y, a fusion protein can be prepared that contains the conceptual amino acid sequence XXXXXX11111111111YYYYY, in which XXXXXX are amino acids derived from parental protein X, YYYYYY are amino acids derived from parental protein Y, and 11111111111 is a conserved amino acid motif present in both parental proteins. The fusion protein contains a natural junction because the amino acid sequence XXXXX11111111111 is the same as the amino acid sequence at the corresponding location in parental protein X. In this example, the fusion protein contains two natural junctions because the amino acid sequence 11111111111YYYYYY is also the same as the amino acid sequence at the corresponding location in parental protein Y.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"immunoglobulin variable domain\" refers to antibody variable domains and TCR variable domains. An immunoglobulin variable domain can be derived from an antibody or TCR of desired origin (e.g., of human origin) or from a library prepared using antibody variable region genes or TCR variable region genes, such as human antibody variable region genes or human TCR variable region genes. See, \ne.g.,\n \nKabat, E.A. et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Government Printing Office (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"immunoglobulin constant domain\" refers to antibody constant domains (\ne.g\n., CH1, hinge, CH2, CH3) and TCR constant domains. An immunoglobulin constant domain can be derived from an antibody or TCR of desired origin (\ne.g.\n, of human origin) or by any suitable method using readily available antibody constant domain sequence information. See, \ne.g\n., \nKabat, E.A. et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. GovernmentPrinting Office (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"human\" refers to \nHomo sapiens\n and to polypeptides, and portions of polypeptides, of human origin. Such polypeptides or portions thereof are substantially non-immunogenic in humans. Human polypeptides and portions of human polypeptides include polypeptides or portions that contain the same amino acid sequence as a polypeptide or portion thereof that occurs naturally in a human. Human polypeptides or portions thereof can be produced using any suitable method, and include polypeptides or portions thereof that are isolated from a human (\ne.g.\n, of sample obtained from a human), and those that are produced recombinantly or synthetically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"human immunoglobulin variable domain,\" \"human antibody variable domain\" (\ne.g.,\n human V\nH\n, human V\nL\n, human V\nκ\n, human V\nλ\n, and the like), \"human TCR variable domain\" refer to variable domains in which one or more framework regions are encoded by a human germline immunoglobulin gene segment, or that have up to 5 amino acid differences relative to the amino acid sequence encoded by a human germline immunoglobulin gene segment. Immunoglobulin variable domains contain hypervariable regions (\ne.g\n., CDR1, CDR2, CDR3) which by their nature contain diverse amino acid sequences. In accordance with accepted standards in the immunoglobulin arts, the presence of amino acids in hypervariable regions that are not encoded by the human germline does not render an immunoglobulin variable domain non-human. Human immunoglobulin variable domains can contain one or more CDRs that are not encoded by the human germline, and can additionally contain up to 10 additional amino acids that are not in the CDRs and are not encoded by the human germline. Preferably, the amino acid sequences of FW1, FW2, FW3 and FW4 are each encoded by a human germline immunoglobulin gene segment, or collectively contain up to 10 amino acid differences relative to the amino acid sequences of the corresponding framework regions encoded by the human germline immunoglobulin gene segment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein \"hybrid domain\" refers to a recombinant domain that comprises a portion from a first domain of the same type and a portion from a second domain of the same type. For example, a hybrid antibody variable domain can comprise FR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3 and a portion of FR4 from a Vκ, and a portion of FR4 from an antibody heavy chain variable domain. Domains of the same type include immunoglobulin variable domains (\ne.g.\n, antibody light and heavy chain variable domains, and TCR variable domains) and immunoglobulin constant domains (e.g., antibody light and heavy chain constant domains, TCR constant domains).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein \"conserved amino acid motif\" refers to a region containing one to about 50 contiguous amino acids with conserved amino acid sequence that is present in one or more polypeptides, and in certain fusion proteins of the invention that contain portions derived from such polypeptides. The amino acid sequences of the conserved amino acid motif may or may not be identical in individual polypeptides that contain the conserved amino acid motif. As is known in the art, amino acid sequence motifs may differ in amino acid sequence to some degree, but the overall sequence diversity of an amino acid motif is limited by the presence of invariant amino acid residues, and of positions with limited variation, such as conservative amino acid substitutions. Conserved amino acid motifs, such as the GlyXaaGlyThr (SEQ ID NO:386) motif present in framework 4 of immunoglobulin variable domains from many species, can be identified in the conventional manner by alignment of amino acid sequences. Preferably, the amino acid sequences of the conserved amino acid motifs present in two or more polypeptides have at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% amino acid sequence similarity or identity to each other over the length of the motif.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a first amino acid, amino acid sequence or motif is \"adjacent\" to a second amino acid, amino acid sequence or motif when the first amino acid sequence or motif is peptide bonded directly to the second amino acid sequence or motif to create a continuous polypeptide chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid and nucleotide sequence alignments and homology, similarity or identity, as defined herein are preferably prepared and determined using the algorithm BLAST 2 Sequences, using default parameters (\nTatusova, T. A. et al.., FEMS Microbiol Lett, 174:187-188 (1999\n)). Alternatively, the BLAST algorithm (version 2.0) is employed for sequence alignment, with parameters set to default values. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is the heuristic search algorithm employed by the programs blastp, blastn, blastx, tblastn, and tblastx; these programs ascribe significance to their findings using the statistical methods of \nKarlin and Altschul, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87(6):2264-8 (1990\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention relates to recombinant fusion proteins that contain natural junctions. The fusion proteins of the invention generally comprises a conserved amino acid sequence motif that is present in two polypeptides that are to be fused. The amino acid sequence that is adjacent to the amino-terminus of the conserved motif is the same as the amino sequence that is adjacent to the amino-terminus of the conserved motif in one of the original polypeptides, and the amino acid sequence that is adjacent to the carboxy-terminus of the conserved motif is the same as the amino acid sequence that is adjacent to the carboxy-terminus of the conserved motif in the other original polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fusion proteins of the invention provide several advantages over conventional fusion proteins. For example, domain interactions in proteins make important contributions to the stability (\ne.g\n., aggregation resistance, protease resistance) of proteins. However, domain interaction in fusion proteins are frequently altered because the components of conventional fusion proteins are typically fused at domain boundaries. The resulting juxtaposition of domains from different parental proteins can result in low stability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne feature of fusion proteins that contain natural junctions is that they generally are designed to preserve domain interactions, thereby improving stability and reducing immunogenicity of the fusion protein. Preferably, in some embodiments, the potential for domain repulsion is reduced in the fusion proteins of the invention, which also reduces susceptibility to proteolysis. A related common problem with conventional fusion proteins is that during production, a fraction of the recombinant protein usually forms soluble or insoluble aggregates, lowering the yield of desired soluble monomeric fusion proteins. The improved stability of the fusion proteins of the invention can also or alternatively result in less aggregation, improved expression and/or improved production yields. Fusion proteins that contain natural junctions also provide advantages for use as \nin vivo\n therapeutic or diagnostic agents, because they have reduced potential for immunogenicity when the parental polypeptides are from the same species as the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConventional fusion proteins contain non-self sequences due to the juxtaposition of amino acid sequences from different parental proteins. These sequences do not occur naturally and can be immunogenic (\ne.g.\n, form B cell epitopes, form T cell epitopes). Consequently, conventional fusion proteins can induce an immune response in patients. Immunogenicity is an important aspect that can limit or prevent \nin vivo\n use of fusion proteins. Immunogenicity occurs, for example, when epitopes on a recombinant fusion protein stimulate cellular (T cell) immune responses. T cell epitopes consist of linear peptides that are usually 8 to 11 amino acids in length. Thus, as described herein, recombinant fusion proteins can be designed and produced that have desired biological functions, but a reduced number of or no T epitopes in comparison to fusion proteins prepared using conventional methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to function as T cell epitopes, peptides derived from recombinant proteins must fulfill several requirements. They must survive intracellular proteolytic processing and must be able to bind to a host's major histocompatability molecules (e.g., human HLA molecules). Another factor that influences whether a peptide is recognized as a T cell epitope is the extent of self. Importantly, T cells directed at epitopes belonging to self proteins are tolerized or eliminated during thymic development (See, \ne.g.\n, Rosmalen et al., 2002). However, some auto-specific T cells persist in the periphery, where they are suppressed by CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells (See, e.g., Papiernik, 2001, and Shevach et al., 2001). When fusion proteins that contain T cell epitopes are administered tolerance can be breeched. In this situation, foreign and even self-peptides derived from a fusion protein can induce an immune response. It is therefore desirable to reduce the number of T cell epitopes in fusion proteins. As described herein, this can be accomplished by maximizing the extent of \"self' within any given continuous peptide sequence found within a recombinant fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant fusion proteins made up of two or more portions (\ne.g\n., domains) that do not occur next to one another in naturally occuring proteins, comprise junctions that connect the portions. Since the portions are not connected in their native context, such junctions commonly comprise a non-self amino acid sequence motif at the junction (the site where the switch occurs from one native peptide sequence to another). This type of junction includes two amino acids that are not normally adjacent within their native context. Therefore, a peptide spanning such a junction is a non-self peptide and has the potential to act as an epitope for T cells. Using the approach described herein, the junction is designed to reduce or eliminate the potential to act as an epitope for T cells. The approach described herein is illustrated conceptually in the following schemes in which a fusion protein is produced that contains a portion derived from hypothetical protein X and a portion derived from hypothetical protein Y.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein X has the following sequence:\n\n \n \n \n...XXXXXX11111111111XXXXXXX2XXXXXXXXX - XXXXXXXX333X3XXXXXXXX...\n \n\n\n \n \n \nProtein Y has the following sequence:\n\n \n \n \n...YYYYYY11111111111YYYYYYY2YYYYYYYYY - YYYYYYYY333Y3YYYYYYYY...\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn each of the conceptual protein sequences, \"-\" denotes the boundary between N-terminal and C-terminal domains within protein X an protein Y. A conventional fusion protein in which the amino terminal domain of protein X is fused to the carboxy-terminal domain of protein Y at the native domain boundary is illustrated in \nScheme\n 1. This type of junction includes two amino acids that are not normally adjacent within their native contex (x - y)t. Therefore, a peptide spanning such a junction is a non-self peptide and has the potential to act as an epitope for T cells.\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in the Schemes 2-4, one application of the invention involves fusion proteins in which a domain from a first polypeptide is to be fused to a domain from a second polypeptide. To prevent the creation of potential new T-cell epitopes, the junction is moved away from the native domain boundary by one or more amino acids (either N-terminally or C-terminally) to an amino acid sequence motif that is conserved in both domains that are to be fused. Since the conserved amino acid motif representing the new fusion site is found in both parental domains, peptides that could be produced \nin vivo\n that span the new junction have fewer or no amino acids that are not normally adjacent in the parental proteins, and consequently have reduced potential to function as T cell epitopes.\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, as illustrated in Scheme 2, a fusion protein comprising a domain from protein X and a domain from protein Y can be prepared. In this example, proteins X and Y each contain a conserved amino acid sequence motif (underlined). This shared motif is the fusion site, any peptide spanning the new domain fusion site that might potentially be a T cell epitope would be entirely self, with regard to the N-terminal domain and/or with regard to the C-terminal domain, thereby eliminating the possibility of being recognized as non-self by T cells.\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the conserved amino acid motif representing the new domain fusion site could be 1 amino acid in length, so that any peptide spanning the boundaries of the two domains in the fusion protein that might potentially be a T cell epitope would not contain any amino acids that are not found adjacent in the native context of domain boundary in parental protein Y (Scheme 3).\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Scheme 4, in some examples, the conserved amino acid motif is 2-10 amino acids in length and the amino acid sequence of the conserved amino acid motif is not identical in the two parental polypeptides.\n\n\n \nAPPLICATION TO FUSION OF A Vκ DOMAIN TO A CH1 DOMAIN\n\n\n \n \n \nAdditionally, domain interactions are important for the integrity and function of many proteins, including proteins and fusion proteins that contain an immunoglobulin fold. For example, the interactions between immunoglobulin variable and constant domains play an important role in the structure of IgGs (See, e.g., Rothlisberger et al., 2005). To produce fusion proteins that contain immunoglobulin domains, or portions of immunoglobulin domains, it is important to take into consideration the protein-protein interactions that these domains participate in within their native context. For example, the interactions between Vκ and Cκ differ from those between VH and CH1 in immunoglobulins, suggesting that it is potentially problematic to generate Vκ-CH1 or VH-Cκ fusion proteins. However, for some applications it is desirable to generate IgG-like molecules comprising 4 Vκ variable domains, Fab' fragments comprising 2 Vκ variable domains, or \"inside-out\" molecules similar to those described by Morrison et al. (1998) and Chan et al. (2004). Such work would require generating fusion proteins of Vκ and CH1 domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure of a typical human Fab' fragment is shown in \nFIG. 1A\n, which represents the structure 1VGE, published by Chacko et al. (1996). Lesk and Chothia reported (1988) that the interactions between domains VH and CH1 are determined significantly by 3 highly conserved residues in VH (H11 [Leu or Val], H110 [Thr] and H112 [Ser]) and 2 highly conserved residues in CH1 (H148 [Phe] and H149 [Pro]). This cluster of 5 residues, illustrated in \nFIG. 1B\n, provides a degree of controlled flexibility (termed elbow motion) that changes the orientation of Vκ or V\nH\n domains relative to Cκ or CH1 domains in immunoglobulins, respectively. This domain boundary can contribute to the functionality of some antibodies (Landolfi et al. 2001). In addition, the hydrophobic side chain of the conserved residue H108 (Leu) is located at the VH-CH1 interface and may participate in hydrophobic interactions between VH and CH1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a Vκ-CH1 fusion were prepared simply by joining an entire Vκ domain (up to residue L108 or L109) to a CH1 domain (from residue H114 [Ala]), 3 of the above 4 conserved residues that CH1 naturally interacts with would not be present in the new variable domain. Residue H11 (Leu / Val) is conserved between many VH and Vκ domains, but residues H108 (Leu), H110 (Thr) and H112 (Ser) are not. This would result in the loss of the conserved VH-CH1 domain interface at the variable domain constant domain boundary, in particular, the loss of hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, this could result in the loss of a hydrogen bond that may exist between the side chain of residue H112 (Ser) and the backbone nitrogen of residue H114 (Ala), as it does in the example of the Fab structure 1VGE (\nFIG. 1A\n). In addition to the loss of residues that stabilize the VH-CH1 interface, new residues would be introduced that would potentially destabilize the fusion protein. Charged residues would be present in the C-terminal portion of the new variable domain, for example L103 (Lys), L107 (Lys) or L108 (Arg). These charged Vκ residues might cause repulsion between Vκ and CH1 at the variable domain-constant domain interface and prevent good domain packing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing Swiss-PdbViewer (version 3.7) and the GROMOS96 43B1 parameter set (van Gunsteren et al. 1996), it was determined that the C-terminal VH residues H108 to H113 (sequence LeuValThrValSerSer) in the human Fab structure 1VGE contribute -100.953 KJ/mol of to the total energy of the molecule. If these residues are replaced by the sequence LysValGluIleLysArg (a sequence commonly representing the C-terminal Vκ residues L103 to L108), the contribution to the total energy of the molecule would be +57.4 kJ/mol. This indicates that a Fab fragment could be significantly destabilized by replacing an entire VH domain with an entire Vκ domain which results in replacement of the C-terminal VH residues H108 to H113. Furthermore, any introduced charged Vκ residues would be prone to proteolysis in a context in which they are not accommodated by interactions with Cκ that they naturally participate in when found in their native context of a Vκ-Cκ junction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the invention, a Vκ-CH1 fusion protein can be generated by joining the N-terminal portion of a Vκ domain to the C-terminal portion of a VH domain in such a manner that the fusion site becomes the GlyXaaGlyThr (SEQ ID NO:386) motif that is conserved between Vκ (residues L99 - L102) and VH (residues H104 - H107). In this way, all 4 of the 4 conserved residues that CH1 naturally interacts with can be present in the new variable domain. Residue H11 (Leu / Val) is already conserved between many VH and Vκ domains, and residues H108 (Leu), H110 (Thr) and H112 (Ser) would also be present as the fusion site has been moved toward the N-terminus of Vκ, and residues H104 to H113 would be VH residues. This natural junction would preserve the VH-CH1 domain interface, including preservation of the elbow joint, and preservation of hydrophobic interactions and of hydrogen bonding, to a greater extent than if an entire Vκ domain (up to residue L108 / L109) were simply joined to a CH1 domain (from residue H114). In addition, the natural junction would avoid the repulsion and susceptibility to proteolysis potentially caused by the presence of charged Vκ residues in the region L103 - L108).\n\n\n \nAPPLICATION TO FUSION OF A VH DOMAIN TO A Cκ DOMAIN\n\n\n \n \n \nTypical interactions found between Vκ and Cκ domains and also seen in 1VGE are highlighted in \nFIG. 1C\n. In particular, the Vκ-Cκ interface is stabilised by hydrogen bonding between the side chain of Vκ residue L103 (Lys) and Cκ residue L165 (Glu) and by hydrogen bonding between the side chain of Vκ residue L108 (Arg, in humans partially encoded by the Jκ exon and partially encoded by the Cκ exon) and Cκ residues L109 (Thr) and L170 (Asp). In addition, residue L106 (Ile) also participates, via its backbone nitrogen and oxygen, in hydrogen bonding with the side chain of Cκ residue L166 (Gln).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a Vκ-CH1 fusion were prepared by simply joining an entire VH domain (up to residue H113 (Ser) to a Cκ domain (from residue L108 [Arg] or residue L 109 [Thr]), the above interactions would be lost (or could be modified, in the case of backbone interactions). Using Swiss-PdbViewer (version 3.7) and the GROMOS96 43B1 parameter set (van Gunsteren et al. 1996), it was determined that the C-terminal Vκ residues L103 to L108 (sequence LysValGluIleLysArg (SEQ ID NO:541)) in the human Fab structure 1VGE contributed -309.32 KJ/mol to the total energy of the molecule. If these residues are replaced by the sequence LeuValThrValSerSer (SEQ ID NO:421) (a sequence commonly representing the C-terminal V\nH\n residues H108 to H113), the contribution to the total energy of the molecule would be -5.202 kJ/mol. This indicates that a Fab fragment could be significantly destabilised by replacing an entire Vκ domain with an entire VH domain, which would result in replacement of C-terminal Vκ residues L103 to L108.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the invention, a VH-Cκ fusion protein can be generated by joining the N-terminal portion of the VH domain to the C- terminal portion of the Vκ domain in such a manner that the fusion site becomes the GlyXaaGlyThr (SEQ ID NO:386) motif that is conserved between Vκ (residues L99 - L102) and VH (residues H104 - H107). In this way, the residues that Cκ naturally interacts with can be present in the new variable domain. This natural domain junction should result in a fusion protein with significantly better properties than the fusion protein with an unnatural domain junction.\n\n\n \nFUSION PROTIENS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe fusion proteins of the invention comprise at least two portions derived from two different polypeptides, and at least one natural junction between the two portions. If desired, the fusion protein can contain three or more portions, and some of the junctions between portions can be non-natural. In one aspect, the recombinant fusion protein comprises a hybrid domain. The hybrid domain comprises a first portion (amino acid sequence) that is derived from a first polypeptide, a second portion (amino acid sequence) that is derived from a second polypeptide, and a conserved amino acid motif that is present in the first polypeptide and the second polypeptide. The first polypeptide will comprise a domain that has the formula (X1-Y-X2), and the second polypeptide will comprise a domain that has the formula (Z1-Y-Z2), and the fusion protein will comprise a hybrid domain that has the formula (X1-Y-Z2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above formulae,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nY is a conserved amino acid motif;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nX1 and Z1 are the amino acid motifs that are located adjacent to the amino-terminus of Y in the first polypeptide and the second polypeptide, respectively;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nX2 and Z2 are the amino acid motifs that are located adjacent to the carboxy-terminus of Y in the first polypeptide and the second polypeptide, respectively;\n\nwith the proviso that when the amino acid sequences of X1 and Z1 are the same, the amino acid sequences of X2 and Z2 are not the same; and when the amino acid sequences of X2 and Z2 are the same, the amino acid sequences of X1 and Z1 are not the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe number of amino acids represented by X1, X2, Z1 and Z2 is dependent on the size of the hybrid domain, and the size of the domains in the parental polypeptides. Generally, X1, X2, Z1 and Z2 each, independently, consist of about 1 to about 400, about 1 to about 200, about 1 to about 100, about 1 to about 50, about 1 to about 40, about 1 to about 30, about 1 to about 20, about 1 to about 15, about 1 to about 10, about 1 to about 6, about 15, about 14, about 13, about 12, about 11, about 10, about 9, about 8, about 7, about 6, about 5, about 4, about 3, about 2 or 1 amino acid. Similarly, the size of the hybrid domain can vary, and is depend on the size of the domains that contain Y in the parental proteins. The overall size of the hybrid domain can be about 75 to about 400, about 75 to about 350, about 75 to about 300, about 75 to about 250, about 75 to about 150, about 75 to about 125, about 75 to about 100 or about 75 amino acids. In particular embodiments, the hybrid domain is about the size of an immunoglobulin variable domain or immunoglobulin constant domain. In some embodiments, the hybrid domain is about 1 kDa to about 25 kDa, about 5 kDa to about 25 kDa, about 5 kDa to about 20 kDa, about 5 kDa to about 15 kDa, about 6 kDa, about 7 kDa, about 8 kDa, about 9 kDa, about 10 kDa, about 11 kDa, about 12 kDa, about 13 kDa or about 14 kDa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conserved amino acid motif Y can consist of one to about 50 amino acid residues. In certain embodiments, Y consists of about 3 to about 50 amino acids, about 3 to about 40 amino acids, about 3 to about 30 amino acids, about 3 to about 20 amino acids, about 3 to about 15 amino acids, about 3 to about 14 amino acids, about 3 to about 13 amino acids, about 3 to about 12 amino acids, about 3 to about 11 amino acids, about 3 to about 10 amino acids, about 3 to about 9 amino acids, about 3 to about 8 amino acids, about 3 to about 7 amino acids, about 3 to about 6 amino acids, about 3 to about 5 amino acids, at least about 8 amino acids, up to about 11 amino acids, or about 8 to about 11 amino acids. In other embodiments, Y consists of about 1 to about 11 amino acids, about 15 amino acids, about 14 amino acids, about 13 amino acids, about 12 amino acids, about 11 amino acids, about 10 amino acids, about 9 amino acids, about 8 amino acids, about 7 amino acids, about 6 amino acids, about 5 amino acids, about 4 amino acids, about 3 amino acids, about 2 amino acids, or about 1 amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conserved amino acid motif Y is found in two or more parental polypeptides, of which at least a portion is incorporated into a fusion protein of the invention. The fusion protein of the invention, and the hybrid domain in the fusion protein, can contain portions from any desired parental polypeptides provided that each parental protein contains a conserved amino acid motif.

Suitable non-human antibody constant domains include those from mouse, chicken, pig, torafugu, frog, cow (\ne.g., Bos taurus\n), rat, shark (\ne.g\n., bull shark, sandbar shark, nurse shark, homed shark, spotted wobbegong shark), skate (\ne.g\n., clearnose skate, little skate), fish (\ne.g.,\n atlantic salmon, channel catfish, lady fish, spotted ratfish, atlantic cod, chinese perch, rainbow trout, spotted wolf fish, zebrafish), possum, sheep, \nCamelid\n (\ne.g.,\n llama, guanaco, alpaca, vicunas, dromedary camel, bactrian camel), rabbit, non-human primate (\ne.g\n., new world monkey, old world monkey, cynomolgus monkey (\nMacaca fascicularis\n), \nCallithricidae\n (\ne.g.,\n marmosets)), or any other desired non-human species. Preferably, the amino terminus of a hybrid antibody constant domain is directly fused to the carboxy-terminus of an antibody variable domain that is from the same species as the amino terminal C\n1\n of the hybrid antibody constant domain. Preferably, the carboxy-terminal C\n2\n of the hybrid antibody constant domain is derived from a human antibody constant domain. For example, the fusion protein can comprise a partial structure having the formula: non-human V domain-(C\n1\n-Y- C\n2\n), wherein C\n1\n is derived from a non-human constant domain (\ne.g\n., Cκ,Cλ, CH1) from the same species as the non-human V domain, Y is a conserved amino acid motif, and C\n2\n is derived from a human antibody constant domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the hybrid antibody constant domain comprises a portion from a first antibody constant domain and a portion from a second antibody constant domain that are from antibodies of different isotypes. For example, in this type of the hybrid antibody constant domain, C\n1\n is a portion from an IgA, IgD, IgM, IgE, or IgG (\ne.g\n., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), and C\n2\n is a portion from an antibody constant domain of a different isotype than C\n1\n.

Preferably, the immunoglobulin variable domain is located amino-terminally to the hybrid antibody constant domain such that the fusion protein comprises a partial structure having the formula: antibody variable domain-(C\n1\n-Y-C\n2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, Y is (Ser/Ala/Gly)Pro(Lys/Asp/Ser)Val (SEQ ID NO:391), (Ser/Ala/Gly)Pro(Lys/Asp/Ser)ValPhe (SEQ ID NO:392), LysValAspLys(Ser/Arg/Thr) (SEQ ID NO:393), or ValThrVal (SEQ ID NO:394).

The method generally comprises identifying a conserved amino acid sequence motif that is present in two polypeptides or portions thereof that are to be fused. A fusion protein is then prepared that contains the conserved amino acid motif, and in which the amino acid sequence that is adj acent to the amino-terminus of the conserved motif is the same as the amino sequence that is adj acent to the amino-terminus of the conserved motif in one of the original polypeptides, and the amino acid sequence that is adjacent to the carboxy-terminus of the conserved motif is the same as the amino acid sequence that is adjacent to the carboxy-terminus of the conserved motif in the other original polypeptide. Generally, the amino acid sequences of two polypeptides or portions of polypeptides are analyzed to identify a conserved amino acid sequence motif that is present in both of the polypeptides of portions. The analysis can be performed using any suitable method. In one example, the amino acid sequences of a first polypeptide and of a second polypeptide are provided (\ne.g\n., from a database) and a conserved amino acid sequence motif present in each polypeptide is identified (\ne.g\n., manually or using a suitable sequence analysis software package).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides a method for producing a fusion protein that comprises at least two portions derived from two different polypeptides, and at least one natural junction between the two portions. If desired, the fusion protein can contain three or more portions, and some of the junctions between portions can be non-natural.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a general aspect, the invention provides a method of producing a fusion protein comprising a first portion and a second portion that are fused at a natural junction, wherein said first portion is derived from a first polypeptide and said second portion is derived from a second polypeptide. The method comprise analyzing the amino acid sequence of a first polypeptide or a portion thereof and the amino acid sequence of a second polypeptide or a portion thereof to identify a conserved amino acid motif present in the analyzed sequences (the first polypeptide or portion thereof and the second polypeptide or portion thereof); and preparing a fusion protein which has the formula \n \n \nA\n \n-\n \nY\n \n-\n \nB\n \n;\n \n \n \n \n\nwherein, A is said first portion; Y is said conserved amino acid motif; B is said second portion; and wherein said first polypeptide comprises A-Y, and said second polypeptide comprises Y-B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to an improved method for making a fusion protein, such as a fusion protein described herein. For example, in some embodiments, the invention relates to an improved method of producing a fusion protein comprising a first portion and a second portion that linked by at least one natural junction, wherein said first portion is derived from a first polypeptide and said second portion is derived from a second polypeptide, the improvement comprising, analyzing the amino acid sequence of said first polypeptide or a portion thereof and the amino acid sequence of said second polypeptide or a portion thereof to identify a conserved amino acid motif present in both of the analyzed sequences; and preparing a fusion protein which has the formula \n \n \nA\n \n-\n \nY\n \n-\n \nB\n \n;\n \n \n \n \n\nwherein, A is said first portion, Y is said conserved amino acid motif; B is said second portion; and wherein said first polypeptide comprises A-Y, and said second polypeptide comprises Y-B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conserved amino acid motif Y can consist of one to about 50 amino acid residues.

The fusion protein of the invention, and the hybrid domain in the fusion protein, can contain portions from any desired parental polypeptides provided that each parental protein contains a conserved amino acid motif. For example, the first and second polypeptides (parental polypeptides) can be unrelated (e.g., from different protein superfamilies) or related (e.g., from the same protein superfamily). In certain embodiments, the fusion protein and hybrid domain contains portions derived from first and second polypeptides (parental polypeptides) from the same protein superfamily, such as the immunoglobulin superfamily, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily or the TNF receptor superfamily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe first and second polypeptides (parental polypeptides) can be from the same species or from different species. For example, the first and second polypeptides can independently be from a human (\nHomo sapiens\n), or from a non-human species such as mouse, chicken, pig, torafugu, frog, cow (\ne.g., Bos taurus\n), rat, shark (\ne.g.,\n bull shark, sandbar shark, nurse shark, homed shark, spotted wobbegong shark), skate (\ne.g\n., clearnose skate, little skate), fish (\ne.g.,\n atlantic salmon, channel catfish, lady fish, spotted ratfish, atlantic cod, chinese perch, rainbow trout, spotted wolf fish, zebrafish), possum, sheep, \nCamelid\n (\ne.g.,\n llama, guanaco, alpaca, vicunas, dromedary camel, bactrian camel), rabbit, non-human primate (\ne.g\n., new world monkey, old world monkey, cynomolgus monkey (\nMacaca fascicularis\n), \nCallithricidae\n (\ne.g.,\n marmosets)), or any other desired non-human species. In particular embodiments, the first and second polypeptides are both human, or one is human and the other is from a non-human species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe first and second polypeptides (parental polypeptides) can be any desired polypeptides. Suitable examples of first and second polypeptides include a cytokine, a cytokine receptor (\ne.g\n., an interleukin receptor, such as IL-1R, IL1R Type, a tumor necrosis factor receptor, such as TNF1, TNFR2), a growth factor (e.g., VEGF, EGF, CSF-1), a growth factor receptor (\ne.g\n.,VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, EGFR, CSF-1R), a hormone (e.g., insulin), a hormone receptor (e.g., insulin receptor), an adhesion molecule, a haemostatic factor, a T cell receptor, a T cell receptor chain, a T cell receptor variable domain, an enzyme, a polypeptide comprising or consisting of an antibody variable domain, or a functional portion of any one of the foregoing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConserved amino acid motifs can be readily identified using any suitable method, such as by aligning two or more amino acid sequences and identifying regions of conserved amino acid sequence. This can be accomplished manually or by using any other suitable method, such as using a suitable sequence analysis algorithm or software package (e.g., CLUSTAL (\nThompson et al..

For example, expression of a nucleic acid that encodes the fusion protein or by chemical synthesis. For expression, a nucleic acid encoding the fusion protein can be expressed using any suitable method, (\ne.g\n., \nin vitro\n expression, \nin vivo\n expression). For example, a nucleic acid that encodes a fusion protein of the invention can be inserted into a suitable expression vector. The resulting construct is then introduced into a suitable host cell for expression. Upon expression, fusion protein can be isolated or purified from a cell lysate or preferably from the culture media or periplasm using any suitable method. (See \ne.g\n., \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel, F.M. et al., eds., Vol. 2, Suppl. 26, pp. 16.4.1-16.7.8 (1991\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable expression vectors can contain a number of components, for example, an origin of replication, a selectable marker gene, one or more expression control elements, such as a transcription control element (\ne.g\n., promoter, enhancer, terminator) and/or one or more translation signals, a signal sequence or leader sequence, and the like. Suitable expression vectors include, for example, pTT (National Research Council Canada), pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), pIRES (Clontech), pEAK8 (EdgeBioSystems), pCEP4 (Invitrogen). Expression control elements and a signal sequence, if present, can be provided by the vector or other source. For example, the transcriptional and/or translational control sequences of a cloned nucleic acid encoding an antibody chain can be used to direct expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA promoter can be provided for expression in a desired host cell. Promoters can be constitutive or inducible. For example, a promoter can be operably linked to a nucleic acid encoding a fusion protein of the invention, such that it directs transcription of the nucleic acid. A variety of suitable promoters for prokaryotic (\ne.g\n., lac, tac, T3, T7 promoters for \nE. coli\n) and eukaryotic (\ne.g\n., simian virus 40 early or late promoter, Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter, cytomegalovirus promoter, adenovirus late promoter) hosts are available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, expression vectors typically comprise a selectable marker for selection of host cells carrying the vector, and, in the case of a replicable expression vector, an origin or replication. Genes encoding products which confer antibiotic or drug resistance are common selectable markers and may be used in prokaryotic (\ne.g\n., lactamase gene (ampicillin resistance), Tet gene for tetracycline resistance) and eukaryotic cells (\ne.g\n., neomycin (G418 or geneticin), gpt (mycophenolic acid), ampicillin, or hygromycin resistance genes). Dihydrofolate reductase marker genes permit selection with methotrexate in a variety of hosts. Genes encoding the gene product of auxotrophic markers of the host (\ne.g\n., LEU2, URA3, HIS3) are often used as selectable markers in yeast. Use of viral (\ne.g\n., baculovirus) or phage vectors, and vectors which are capable of integrating into the genome of the host cell, such as retroviral vectors, are also contemplated. Suitable expression vectors for expression in mammalian cells and prokaryotic cells (\nE. coli\n), insect cells (\nDrosophila\n Schnieder S2 cells, Sf9) and yeast (\nP\n. \nmethanolica\n, \nP\n. \npastoris\n, \nS\n. \ncerevisiae\n) are well-known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant host cells that express a fusion protein of the invention and a method of preparing a fusion protein as described herein are provided. The recombinant host cell comprises a recombinant nucleic acid encoding a recombinant fusion protein. Recombinant fusion proteins can be produced by the expression of a recombinant nucleic acid encoding the protein in a suitable host cell, or using other suitable methods. For example, the expression constructs described herein can be introduced into a suitable host cell, and the resulting cell can be maintained (\ne.g\n., in culture, in an animal) under conditions suitable for expression of the constructs. Suitable host cells can be prokaryotic, including bacterial cells such as \nE\n. \ncoli\n, \nB. subtilis\n and or other suitable bacteria, eukaryotic, such as fungal or yeast cells (\ne.g\n., \nPichia pastoris\n, \nAspergillus\n species, \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Neurospora crassa\n), or other lower eukaryotic cells, and cells of higher eukaryotes such as those from insects (\ne.g\n., Sf9 insect cells (\n \nWO 94/26087 (O'Connor\n \n)) or mammals (\ne.g\n., COS cells, such as COS-1 (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1650) and COS-7 (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1651), CHO (e.g., ATCC Accession No. CRL-9096), 293 (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1573), HeLa (ATCC Accession No. CCL-2), CV1 (ATCC Accession No. CCL-70), WOP (\nDailey et al., J. Virol. 54:739-749 (1985\n)), 3T3, 293T (\nPear et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 90:8392-8396 (1993\n)), 293-6E cells (National Research Council Canada), NSO cells, SP2/0, \nHuT\n 78 cells, and the like (see, e.g., \nAusubel, F.M. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and John Wiley & Sons Inc., (1993\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also includes a method of producing a recombinant fusion protein, comprising maintaining a recombinant host cell of the invention under conditions appropriate for expression of a recombinant fusion protein. The method can further comprise the step of isolating or recovering the recombinant fusion protein, if desired. In another embodiment, the components of the recombinant fusion protein are chemically assembled to create a continuous polypeptide chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides an isolated recombinant nucleic acid encoding the novel fusion proteins described herein, and a recombinant vector (e.g., expression vector) that contain a recombinant nucleic acid encoding the novel fusion proteins described herein. The invention also relates to an isolated host cell (e.g., non-human host cell) that contains such a nucleic acid or recombinant vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to a method for producing a recombinant fusion protein of the invention comprising maintaining host cell (e.g., non-human host cell) that contains a recombinant nucleic acid encoding the novel fusion proteins described herein, or a recombinant vector (e.g., expression vector) that contain a recombinant nucleic acid encoding the novel fusion proteins described herein, under conditions suitable for expression, whereby a recombinant fusion protein is produced. In some embodiments, the method further comprises isolating the recombinant fusion protein (e.g., from the host cell, or the culture medium in which the host cell is maintained.)\n\n\n \nCOMPOSITIONS AND THERAPEUTIC AND DIAGNOSTIC METHODS\n\n\n \n \n \nCompositions comprising fusion proteins of the invention including pharmaceutical or physiological compositions (e.g., for human and/or veterinary administration) are provided. Pharmaceutical or physiological compositions comprise one or more fusion protein and a pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carrier. Typically, these carriers include aqueous or alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and/or buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride and lactated Ringer's. Suitable physiologically-acceptable adjuvants, if necessary to keep a polypeptide complex in suspension, may be chosen from thickeners such as carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin and alginates. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers and electrolyte replenishers, such as those based on Ringer's dextrose. Preservatives and other additives, such as antimicrobials, antioxidants, chelating agents and inert gases, may also be present (\nMack (1982) Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th Editi\non).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions can comprise a desired amount of fusion protein. For example the compositions can comprise about 5% to about 99% fusion protein by weight. In particular embodiments, the composition can comprise about 10% to about 99%, or about 20% to about 99%, or about 30% to about 99% or about 40% to about 99%, or about 50% to about 99%, or about 60% to about 99%, or about 70% to about 99%, or about 80% to about 99%, or about 90% to about 99%, or about 95% to about 99% fusion protein, by weight. In one example, the composition is freeze dried (lyophilized).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe drug compositions described herein will typically find use in preventing, suppressing or treating disease states, such as inflammatory states, cancer, pain, and the like. The drug compositions (\ne.g\n., drug conjugates, noncovalent drug conjugates, drug fusions), described herein can also be administered for diagnostic purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the instant application, the term \"prevention\" involves administration of the protective composition prior to the induction of the disease. \"Suppression\" refers to administration of the composition after an inductive event, but prior to the clinical appearance of the disease. \"Treatment\" involves administration of the protective composition after disease symptoms become manifest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimal model systems which can be used to screen the effectiveness of drug compositions in protecting against or treating the disease are available. Methods for the testing of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in susceptible mice are known in the art (\nKnight et al. (1978) J. Exp. Med., 147: 1653\n; \nReinersten et al. (1978) New Eng. J. Med., 299: 515\n). Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is tested in SJL/J female mice by inducing the disease with soluble AchR protein from another species (\nLindstrom et al. (1988) Adv. Immunol., 42: 233\n). Arthritis is induced in a susceptible strain of mice by injection of Type II collagen (\nStuart et al. (1984) Ann. Rev. Immunol., 42: 233\n). A model by which adjuvant arthritis is induced in susceptible rats by injection of mycobacterial heat shock protein has been described (\nVan Eden et al. (1988) Nature, 331: 171\n). Effectiveness for treating osteoarthritis can be assessed in a murine model in which arthritis is induced by intra-articular injection of collagenase (\nBlom, A.B. et al., Osteoarthritis Cartilage 12:627-635 (2004\n). Thyroiditis is induced in mice by administration of thyroglobulin as described (\nMaron et al. (1980) J. Exp. Med., 152: 1115\n). Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) occurs naturally or can be induced in certain strains of mice such as those described by \nKanasawa et al. (1984) Diabetologia, 27: 113\n. EAE in mouse and rat serves as a model for MS in human. In this model, the demyelinating disease is induced by administration of myelin basic protein (see\n Paterson (1986) Textbook of Immunopathology, Mischer et al., eds., Grune and Stratton, New York, pp. 179-213\n; \nMcFarlin et al. (1973) Science, 179: 478\n: and \nSatoh et al. (1987) J. Immunol., 138: 179\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe drug compositions of the present invention may be used as separately administered compositions or in conjunction with other agents. Pharmaceutical compositions can include \"cocktails\" of various cytotoxic or other agents in conjunction with the drug composition of the present invention, or combinations of drug compositions (\ne.g\n., fusion proteins) according to the present invention comprising different drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe drug compositions can be administered to any individual or subject in accordance with any suitable techniques. A variety of routes of administration are possible including, for example, oral, dietary, topical, transdermal, rectal, parenteral (\ne.g\n., intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraarticular injection), and inhalation (\ne.g\n., intrabronchial, intranasal or oral inhalation, intranasal drops) routes of administration, depending on the drug composition and disease or condition to be treated. Administration can be local or systemic as indicated. The preferred mode of administration can vary depending upon the fusion protein chosen, and the condition (\ne.g\n., disease) being treated. The dosage and frequency of administration will depend on the age, sex and condition of the patient, concurrent administration of other drugs, counter-indications and other parameters to be taken into account by the clinician. A therapeutically effective amount of a drug composition (\ne.g\n., fusion protein) is administered. A therapeutically effective amount is an amount sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect, under the conditions of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"subject\" or \"individual\" is defined herein to include animals such as mammals, including, but not limited to, primates (\ne.g\n., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, mice or other bovine, ovine, equine, canine, feline, rodent or murine species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe drug composition (\ne.g\n., fusion protein) can be administered as a neutral compound or as a salt. Salts of compounds (\ne.g\n., fusion proteins) containing an amine or other basic group can be obtained, for example, by reacting with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, acetic acid, perchloric acid and the like. Compounds with a quaternary ammonium group also contain a counteranion such as chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, perchlorate and the like. Salts of compounds containing a carboxylic acid or other acidic functional group can be prepared by reacting with a suitable base, for example, a hydroxide base. Salts of acidic functional groups contain a countercation such as sodium, potassium and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a kit for use in administering a drug composition (\ne.g\n., fusion protein) to a subject (\ne.g\n., patient), comprising a drug composition (\ne.g\n., fusion protein), a drug delivery device and, optionally, instructions for use. The drug composition (\ne.g\n., fusion protein) can be provided as a formulation, such as a freeze dried formulation. In certain embodiments, the drug delivery device is selected from the group consisting of a syringe, an inhaler, an intranasal or ocular administration device (\ne.g\n., a mister, eye or nose dropper), and a needleless injection device.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe drug composition (\ne.g\n., fusion protein) of this invention can be lyophilized for storage and reconstituted in a suitable carrier prior to use. Any suitable lyophilization method (\ne.g\n., spray drying, cake drying) and/or reconstitution techniques can be employed. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that lyophilisation and reconstitution can lead to varying degrees of antibody activity loss (\ne.g\n., with conventional immunoglobulins, IgM antibodies tend to have greater activity loss than IgG antibodies) and that use levels may have to be adjusted to compensate. In a particular embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising a lyophilized (freeze dried) drug composition (\ne.g\n., fusion protein) as described herein. Preferably, the lyophilized (freeze dried) drug composition (\ne.g\n., fusion protein) loses no more than about 20%, or no more than about 25%, or no more than about 30%, or no more than about 35%, or no more than about 40%, or no more than about 45%, or no more than about 50% of its activity when rehydrated. Activity is the amount of drug composition (\ne.g\n., fusion protein) required to produce the effect of the drug composition before it was lyophilized. For example, the amount of fusion protein needed to achieve and maintain a desired serum concentration for a desired period of time. The activity of the drug composition (\ne.g\n., fusion protein) can be determined using any suitable method before lyophilization, and the activity can be determined using the same method after rehydration to determine amount of lost activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions containing the drug composition (\ne.g\n., fusion protein) or a cocktail thereof can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In certain therapeutic applications, an amount sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, under the conditions of administration, such as at least partial inhibition, suppression, modulation, killing, or some other measurable parameter, of a population of selected cells is defined as a \"therapeutically-effective amount or dose.\" Amounts needed to achieve this dosage will depend upon the severity of the disease and the general state of the patient's own immune system and general health, but generally range from about 0.005 to 10.0 mg of fusion protein per kilogram of body weight, with doses of 0.05 to 2.0 mg/kg/dose being more commonly used. For prophylactic applications, compositions containing the drug composition (\ne.g\n., fusion protein) or cocktails thereof may also be administered in similar or slightly lower dosages. A composition containing a drug composition (\ne.g\n., fusion protein) according to the present invention may be utilized in prophylactic and therapeutic settings to aid in the alteration, inactivation, killing or removal of a select target cell population in a mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to a drug delivery device comprising the composition (\ne.g\n., pharmaceutical composition) or fusion protein of the invention. In some embodiments, the drug delivery device is selected from the group consisting of parenteral delivery device, intravenous delivery device, intramuscular delivery device, intraperitoneal delivery device, transdermal delivery device, pulmonary delivery device, intraarterial delivery device, intrathecal delivery device, intraarticular delivery device, subcutaneous delivery device, intranasal delivery device, vaginal delivery device, rectal delivery device, syringe, a transdermal delivery device, a capsule, a tablet, a nebulizer, an inhaler, an atomizer, an aerosolizer, a mister, a dry powder inhaler, a metered dose inhaler, a metered dose sprayer, a metered dose mister, a metered dose atomizer, and a catheter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is expected that the conservation of structural features and avoidance of exposure of charged residues, that could be achieved by natural junctions in some circumstances, could be demonstrated in a proteolysis assay. The assay can be carried out as follows. A solution of the recombinant protein (1mg/mL in phosphate buffered saline) is supplemented with 0.04 mg/mL of sequencing grade trypsin (available from Promega) and incubated at 30°C. At intervals, aliquots of the protein solution are withdrawn, mixed with a stop solution (containing SDS loading buffer and protease inhibitors) and snap frozen. Aliquots are withdrawn after times ranging from, for example, 5 minutes to 24 hours. After completion of the time course, the extent of proteolysis is assessed, for example by separation of samples on SDFS-PAGE gels and visualization with a protein stain such as Coomassie Blue. It is expected that fusion proteins with natural junctions would be more resistant to fragmentation that corresponding fusion proteins that contain non-natural junctions.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1: GENERAL METHODS\n\n\nConstruction of expression vectors\n\n\n \n \n \nIgGs were expressed using a vector based on the Invitrogen pBudCE4.1 backbone. The backbone was modified by deleting a unique NheI restriction site, which was achieved by NheI restriction digestion, fill-in using Klenow enzyme, and self-ligation, using standard protocols. IgG heavy and light chain expression cassettes comprising a Kozak sequence, murine V-J2-C signal peptide cDNA and constant region cDNA were prepared. The heavy chain expression cassette encoding a human IgG heavy chain constant domain was digested using HindIII and BglII restriction enzymes and sub-cloned into the modified vector backbone that was digested using HindIII and BamHI restriction enzymes, thereby deleting an internal BamHI restriction site in the vector backbone. Light chain expression cassettes encoding human kappa or lambda constant region genes were sub-cloned into the vector backbone using NotI and MluI restriction enzymes.\n\n\n \nSub-cloning of variable domain genes\n\n\n \n \n \nIgG variable domain genes were sub-cloned into the expression vectors described above using standard molecular biology protocols. IgG variable domain genes used for expression as part of the heavy chain were sub-cloned using a BamHI restriction site in the heavy chain signal peptide cDNA and a XhoI restriction site or NheI restriction site in the cDNA encoding the mature heavy chain protein. IgG variable domain genes used for expression as part of the light chain were subcloned in one of two ways. The IgG variable domain genes were either joined to light chain cDNA using PCR overlap extension, and subsequently sub-cloned using a SalI restriction site in the light chain signal peptide cDNA and the MluI restriction site located downstream of the light chain expression cassette, or they were sub-cloned directly using a SalI restriction site in the cDNA encoding the light chain signal peptide and a BsiWI restriction site in cDNA encoding the mature light chain peptide.\n\n\n \nExpression, purification and quantification of IgGs\n\n\n \n \n \nFollowing DNA sequence verification, vector DNAs were produced using the Qiagen EndoFree Plasmid Mega kit, according to manufacturer's instructions. The vector DNAs were then used to transfect HEK293T cells (ATCC\n®\n). For each construct, cells were typically cultured in 5 or 10 cell culture flasks with a 175cm\n2\n surface area (T175, Nunc) until they reached approximately 70%-80% confluency. Cells were then transfected using 34 microgram of DNA per flask, using \nFuGENE\n \n \n \n®\n 6 Transfection Reagent (lipid-based transfection reagent, Roche), according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were grown in DMEM with glutamine and high glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% non-essential amino acids and 4% foetal bovine serum (FBS). The FBS was prepared from Invitrogen ultra-low IgG FBS by removing residual bovine IgG, using PROSEP\n®\n-G resin (recombinant protein G resin, Millipore), followed by sterile filtration. Culture supernatants were harvested by centrifugation after 4 or 5 days of expression. Secreted IgG was affinity purified using protein A resin (Streamline A, GE Healthcare) in the case of IgG molecules comprising 2 VH and 2 Vκ domains or 4 Vκ domains, or using protein G resin engineered without Fab binding sites (protein G agarose, Sigma Aldrich) in the case of IgG molecules comprising 4 VH domains. Resins were typically washed using 20-50 bed volumes of 2xPBS followed by 10-20 bed volumes of 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4. IgGs were typically eluted using either 100 mM glycine pH 2.0 and neutralized to pH 8.0 using Tris, or they were eluted using 10 mM citrate, 50% ethylene glycol, pH 3.5. Eluted proteins were quantified by absorbance reading at 280 nm, using a spectrophotometer.\n\n\n \nSize exclusion chromatography\n\n\n \n \n \nIgGs were analyzed by HPLC size exclusion chromatography, using CHROMELEON\n®\n software (chromatography management software, Dionex Corporation). Analysis parameters most typically included using a Tosoh G3000 SWXL column, with 1xPBS supplemented with 10% ethanol as running buffer at a 1 mL/min flow rate, and an acquisition period of 20 minutes following injection. Absorbance was recorded at 225, 280 and 300 nm wavelengths.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 2: PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND FORMATION OF SOLUBLE OLIGOMERS AND AGGREGATES\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo Vκ variable domains, designated DOM9-155-25 and DOM10-176-535 were paired into IgGs containing a total of 4 Vκ variable domains per molecule. The Vκ domain DOM10-176-535 was expressed as part of a native light chain while the Vκ domain DOM9-155-25 was fused to CH1 on the heavy chain, using three different junctions.\n\n \n \n \n \nKabat number:\n \n97\n \n114\n \n \n \nUnnatural junction 1:\n \nTFGQGTKVEIK__ ASTKGPS\n \n \n \nUnnatural junction 2:\n \nTFGQGTKVEIKR_ ASTKGPS\n \n \n \nNatural junction:\n \nTF\nGQGT\nLVTVSS ASTKGPS\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor each junction the fusion is underlined\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnnatural junction 1 (SEQ ID NO:522) represents the direct fusion of a Vκ domain comprising Kabat residues 1-112 with CH1, while unnatural junction 2 (SEQ ID NO:523) represents the direct fusion of a Vκ domain also comprising Kabat residue 113 (partially encoded by the Jκ exon and partially by the Cκ exon in humans) with CH1. In IgGs with the natural junction (SEQ ID NO:524) the conserved GlyXaaGlyThr motif (SEQ ID NO:386) (residues H104-H107 in VH domains and L99-L102 in Vκ domains) was used as the fusion site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression yields were compared using absorbance reading at 280 nm wavelength and confirmed by size exclusion HPLC and SDS-PAGE. The yields are summarized in Table 1. The expression yield was significantly higher with the natural junction (SEQ ID NO:524) than with either unnatural junction 1 (SEQ ID NO:522) or unnatural junction 2 (SEQ ID NO:523).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of natural junctions reduced the proportion of soluble oligomers and aggregates compared to using unnatural junctions for some antibodies. For example, three IgGs were expressed which comprised the same Vκ domain, designated VκDUM-1, as part of a native light chain and fused to CH1 on the heavy chain using different junctions. The three IgGs were analyzed by size exclusion HPLC (Table 2). The fraction of oligomers and aggregates was 9% for the IgG with unnatural junction 1 (SEQ ID NO:522) and 10% for the IgG with unnatural junction 2 (SEQ ID NO:523), but only 7% for the IgG with the natural junction (SEQ ID NO:524), indicating that fewer oligomers and aggregates were expressed and purified when the natural junction was used. A reduction in oligomers and aggregates by a few percent provides advantages and reduces the costs and time required to produce the fusion proteins, especially for industrial scale production.\n\n \n \nTable 1\n \n \n \n \nVariable domain fused to Cκ\n \nVariable domain fused to CH1\n \nJunction\n \nExpression yield (mg/L)\n \n \n \n \nDOM10-176-535\n \nDOM9-155-25\n \nNatural junction\n \n1.4\n \n \n \nDOM10-176-535\n \nDOM9-155-25\n \n \nUnnatural junction\n 1\n \n1.0\n \n \n \nDOM10-176-535\n \nDOM9-155-25\n \nUnnatural junction 2\n \n0.4\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nTable 2\n \n \n \n \nVariable domain fused to Cκ\n \nVariable domain fused to CH1\n \nJunction\n \nPercentage of oligomers and aggregates purified on protein A\n \n \n \n \nVHDUM-1\n \nVκDUM-1\n \n \nNatural junction\n \n \n7\n \n \n \nVHDUM-1\n \nVκDUM-1\n \n \nUnnatural junction\n 1\n \n9\n \n \n \nVHDUM-1\n \nVκDUM-1\n \nUnnatural junction 2\n \n10\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 3: PROTEIN SOLUBILITY\n\n\n \n \n \nA VH variable domain, designated VHDUM-1, was expressed in IgG molecules containing 4 copies of this variable domain. The solubility of three molecules was compared, two of the molecules had an unnatural junction between VHDUM-1 and Cκ and one domain had a natural junction between VHDUM-1 and Cκ.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nKabat number:\n \n \n100\n \n109\n \n \n \nUnnatural junction 1:\n \nFDYWGQGTLVTVSS__TVAAPS\n \n \n \nUnnatural junction 2:\n \nFDYWGQGTLVTVSS_RTVAAPS\n \n \n \nNatural junction:\n \nFDYW\nGQGT\nKVEIK R TVAAPS\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor each junction the fusion site is underlined\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing elution from protein G resin and neutralization, strong precipitation was observed for the IgG with unnatural junction 1 (SEQ ID NO:525), while only traces of precipitation were observed for the IgG with unnatural junction 2 (SEQ ID NO:526) and for the IgG with the natural junction (SEQ ID NO:527). The concentration of soluble protein remaining in solution after neutralization (100 mM glycine, 130 mM Tris pH8) was 0.16 mg/mL for the IgG with \nunnatural junction\n 1, 1.37 mg/mL for the IgG with unnatural junction 2, and 1.20 mg/mL for the IgG with the natural junction. The data demonstrated that the IgG with \nunnatural junction\n 1 had significantly lower solubility in 100 mM glycine, 130 \nmM Tris pH\n 8 than the other IgGs. This result suggested that residue L108 (Arg) that is part of the natural junction between Vκ and Cκ domains played an important role in the structure and solubility of the tested IgGs. This residue is partially encoded by the Jκ exon and partially by the Cκ exon in humans and was absent in the poorly soluble IgG with \nunnatural junction\n 1. The observed differences in solubility demonstrated the benefit of moving the domain fusion site to the GlyXaaGlyThr (SEQ ID NO:386) motif that is conserved between Vκ (residues L99 - L102) and VH (residues H104 - H107), thus preserving the remaining structurally important Vκ residues encoded by the Jκ exon downstream of the conserved motif.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 4: CLONING, EXPRESSION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF DOM15/16 INLINE FUSIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nDomain antibodies that bind VEGF or EGFR were incorporated into fusion polypeptides that contained an anti-VEGFR dAb and an anti-EGFR dAb in a single polypeptide chain. Some of the fusion polypeptides also included an antibody Fc region (-CH2-CH3 of human IgG1). Specific examples of the fusion polypeptides that were cloned and expressed include TAR15-10 fused to DOM16-39-206 and to Fc; DOM16-39-206 fused to TAR15-10 and to Fc; DOM16-39-206 fused to TAR15-26-501 and to Fc; TAR15-26-501 fused to DOM16-39-206 and to Fc; TAR15-10 fused to DOM16-39-206; DOM16-39-206 fused to TAR15-10; DOM16-39-206 fused to TAR15-26-501; and TAR15-26-501 fused to DOM16-39-206. The positions of the foregoing fusions are listed as they appear in the fusion proteins from amino terminus to carboxy terminus. Polypeptides that are referred to using the prefix TAR or DOM are antibody variable domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding dAbs was PCR amplified and cloned into expression vectors using standard methods. Inline fusion polypeptides were produced by expressing the expression vectors in \nPichia\n (fusion that did not contain an Fc region) or in HEK 293T cells (Fc region containing fusions). Inline fusions were batch bound and affinity purified on streamline protein A and streamline protein L resins for HEK 293T cells (Fc-tagged) and \nPichia\n expressed constructs respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe portions of several fusions that contain Fc are listed in Table 3 as they appear in the fusion proteins, from amino terminus to carboxy terminus. Accordingly, the structure of the fusion proteins can be appreciated by reading the table from left to right. The first fusion protein presented in Table 3 has the structure, from amino terminus to carboxy terminus, DOM15-10-Linker 1-DOM16-39-206-Linker 2- Fc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeneral robustness and resistance to degradation were tested by subj ecting the inline fusions to proteolysis with trypsin. A solution of dual specific ligand and trypsin (1/25 (w/w) trypsin to ligand) was prepared and incubated at 30°C. Samples were taken at 0 minutes (\ni.e\n., before addition of trypsin), 60 minutes, 180 minutes, and 24 hours. At the given time points, the reaction was stopped by the addition of complete protease inhibitor cocktail at 2X final concentration (Roche code: 11 836 145 001) with PAGE loading dye, followed by flash freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were visualized to reveal a time course for the protease degradation of the fusions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese experiments showed that inline fusions having a \"natural\" linker\n\n(KVEIKRTVAAPS (SEQ ID NO:528), which contains the carboxy-terminal amino acids of Vκ and amino-terminal amino acids of Cκ, were susceptible proteolysis, with degradation evident at the 10 minute time point. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that degradation occurred at the linkers between dAbs and at the linkers between dAb and Fc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNew linkers were designed that contain fewer Lys and Arg residues, which are cleavage points for trypsin and are abundant in the natural linker. Fusions that contained the engineered linkers (LVTVSSAST (SEQ ID NO:529)) or (LVTVSSGGGGSGGGS (SEQ ID NO:530)) showed much improved resistance to trypsin proteolysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional binding assays were performed to assess the potency of the inline fusions that contained the engineered linkers. The results revealed engineered linkers did not have any substantial adverse effect on potency.\n\n \nTable 3: Fusion polypeptides that contain \nFc\n \n \n \ndAb1\n \nLinker\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1\n \ndAb2\n \nLinker 2\n \nAssay dAb1 (nM)\n \nAssay dAb2 (nM)\n \n \n \n \nDOM15-10 (Vκ)\n \nKVEIKRTVAAPS\n \nDOM16-39-206 (Vκ)\n \nKVEIKRTVAAPS\n \n0.45\n \n23.8\n \n \n \nDOM16-39-206 (Vκ)\n \nKVEIKRTVAAPS\n \nDOM15-10 (Vκ)\n \nKVEIKRTVAAPS\n \n3.7\n \n0.88\n \n \n \nDOM16-39-206 (Vκ)\n \nKVEIKRTVAAPS\n \nDOM15-26-501 (V\nH\n)\n \nLVTVSSASTKGPS\n \n20.7\n \n21.3\n \n \n \nDOM15-26-501 (V\nH\n)\n \nLVTVSSASTKGPS\n \nDOM16-39-206 (Vκ)\n \nKVEIKRTVAAPS\n \n5.7\n \n7.7\n \n \n \nDOM16-39-601 (Vκ)\n \nLVTVSSAST\n \nDOM15-10 (Vκ)\n \nLVTVSSAST\n \n0.68\n \n10.8\n \n \n \nDOM16-39-601 (Vκ)\n \nKVEIKRTVAAPS\n \nDOM15-10 (Vκ)\n \nKVEIKRTVAAPS\n \n0.77\n \n2.9\n \n \n \nDOM15-10 (VK)\n \nLVTVSSAST\n \nDOM16-39-601 (Vκ)\n \nLVTVSSAST\n \n1.2\n \n4.2\n \n \n \nDOM16-39-601 (Vκ)\n \nLVTVSSGGGGSGGGS\n \nDOM15-10 (Vκ)\n \nLVTVSSGGGGSGGGS\n \n5.7\n \n0.2\n \n \n \nDOM15-10 (Vκ)\n \nLVTVSSGGGGSGGGS\n \nDOM16-39-601 (Vκ)\n \nLVTVSSGGGGSGGGS\n \n0.8\n \n3.1\n \n \n \nDOM15-10 (Vκ)\n \nKVEIKRTVAAPS\n \nDOM16-39-601 (Vκ)\n \nKVEIKRTVAAPS\n \n0.2\n \n2.9\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 5. ADDITIONAL ENGINEERED LINKERS\n\n\n \n \n \nSeveral designed mutations were introduced to the C-terminal region of Vκ dAbs expressed on the light chain of IgG-like formats to reduce protease sensitivity. The \"natural linker\" was GQGTKVEIKRTVAAPS (SEQ ID NO:531) which contains the carboxy-terminal amino acids of Vκ and amino-terminal amino acids of Ck). Variant linkers 1-3 were designed with amino acid replacements that replaced some or all of the positively charged residues in the natural linker with the most conservative substitutions that are not positively charged at physiological pH. It is likely that the arginine residue in the natural linker is less amenable to alteration due to ionic interactions it forms within the CL domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVariant linker 1 (GQGTNVEINRTVAAPS (SEQ ID NO:532)) substitutes both lysines in the natural linker with asparagines. \nVariant linker\n 1, and variant linker 2 (GQGTNVEINQTVAAPS (SEQ ID NO:533)), which additionally changes the arginine in the natural linker to glutamine, introduce an N-glycosylation site (NxT) into the linker. SDS-PAGE analysis of IgG-like formats containing \nvariant linker\n 1 or variant linker 2 showed that the light chain had a higher molecular weight, consistent with an N-glycosylation event. Variant linker 3 (GQGTNVEIQRTVAAPS (SEQ ID NO:534) removes the N-glycosylation site while leaving the arginine in the natural linker in place. Variant linker 4 (GQGTLVTVSSTVAAPS (SEQ ID NO:535)) replaces the six C-terminal amino acids of the Vκ domain with the corresponding residues from a VH domain, and is devoid of positive charges.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtease resistance (trypsin resistance assessed as described in Example 4) of IgG-like formats that contain variant linkers 1-4 revealed that IgG-like formats that contained engineered variant linkers were more protease resistant than an IgG-like format that contained the natural linker.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 6: CLONING, EXPRESSION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF DOM9/10 INLINE FUSIONS\n\n\nA. Fusion Proteins\n\n\nCloning and production of anti-IL-4 and anti-IL-13 dual specificity dimer\n\n\n \n \n \nNucleic acids encoding the anti-IL-4 dAb DOM9-112 and anti-IL-13 dAb DOM10-53-343 were cloned into a construct that encoded an in-line fusion protein with a C-terminal cysteine. The amino acid sequence AST was present between the two dAbs, this sequence is the natural CH sequence present in natural antibodies. The construct was cloned in the \nPichia pastoris\n vector pPICZα (Invitrogen). Electrocompetent cells (X-33 or KM71H) were transformed with the construct and transformants were selected on 100 µg/ml Zeocin. 500ml cultures were grown on BMGY media at 30° C, 250 rpm for 24 hrs until the OD\n600\n had reached ~15-20. The cells were then spun down and resuspended in BMMY media (containing 0.5% (v/v) methanol) to induce protein expression. The cultures were maintained at 30°C with shaking at 250 rpm. At 24 hour intervals the cultures were fed with the following incremental increase in the methanol concentration; 1%, 1.5% and 2% (v/v) using a 50% methanol solution. The cultures were then harvested by centrifugation and the supernatant containing the expressed protein stored at 4°C until required. The protein was purified from the supernatant using PrA streamline using the standard purification protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PrA purified protein was found to contain both dimer and monomer species. Therefore chromatofocusing was used to separate the two proteins. A \nMono P\n 5/20 column was used (GE Healthcare) for the separation, using a pH gradient of 6 to 4. The poly-buffers used were as described by the manufacturer to make the 6 to 4 pH range. The sample was applied at pH6 and the pH gradient generated by using 100% buffer B over 35 column volumes run at 1ml/min. Dimer containing fractions were identified using SDS-PAGE and pooled for PEGylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protein was then PEGylated using 40K PEG2-MAL using the method outlined above. This material was purified using anion exchange chromatography up to a purity >95%. The potency of the resulting dual specific ligand (PEGylated DOM9-112 (AST) DOM10-53-344) was determined in an IL-4 RBA and an IL-13 RBA. The potency of the anti-IL-4 arm of the dual specific ligand (13 nM) was slightly reduced compared with the potency of the dAb DOM9-112 monomer (3.5 nM), whereas the potency of the anti-IL-13 arm was maintained (310 pM for the dual specific ligand vs 230pM for the dAb monomer).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-4 and anti-IL-13 dAbs DOM9-112 and DOM10-53-344 were also cloned as an in-line fusion with the amino acid sequence ASTKGPS (SEQ ID NO:535) present between the two dAbs, this sequence is the start of the CH sequence present in natural antibodies. The potency of the resulting purified dual specific ligand (DOM9-112 (ASTKGPS) DOM10-53-344) was determined in an IL-4 RBA and an IL-13 sandwich ELISA. The potency of the anti-IL-4 arm was maintained (~1 nM) whereas the potency of the anti-IL-13 arm was only slightly reduced compared with the dAb monomer (40pM for the dAb monomer vs 120 pM for the dual specific ligand).\n\n\n \nAdditional dual targeting in-line fusions for IL-4 and IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \nTo further understand the behaviour of dual targeting in-line fusions of IL4 and IL13 binding dAbs, a series of new in-line fusions and in-line fusion libraries were constructed. The DOM10-53 lineage was affinity matured using phage display using libraries diversifying triplet residues of FR1, CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3. The libraries were cloned in a phage vector and displayed as fusion protein to the gene3 protein as an (\ndAb\n 1 linker dAb2) in-line fusion with dAb1 being DOM9-112-210, the linker being amino acid residues ASTKGPS (SEQ ID NO:535) and dAb2 being the DOM10-53 library. The selection method, subcloning and expression in E coli and screening method were essentially performed as described above, except that in-line fusion constructs were used instead of single dAbs. Outputs were cloned into vector pDOM5 and expression supernatants were screened for improved expression by binding to a protein A coated Biacore chip.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn-line fusions with improved expression levels were expressed, purified and tested in a IL-13 sandwich ELISA and cell assay. A number of variants were selected (including DOM9-112-210 - ASTKGPS - DOM10-53-566). The most potent clones were DOM10-53-531 and DOM10-53-546 (see Table 4). Different protein preparations were made from these clones and these were tested in the IL-4 RBA and IL-13 sandwich assay as described above.\n\n \nTable 4\n \n \n \nClone name\n \nExpression level (mg/l)\n \nIL-13 Sanwich ELISA (EC50 nM)\n \nIL-4 RBA (IC50 nM)\n \n \n \n \nDOM9-112-210-\n\nDOM10-53-531\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPrep\n 1\n \n9.3\n \n1.1/1.9\n \n3.5/4.8\n \n \n \nPrep 2\n \n11.5\n \n4.9\n \nn.d.\n \n \n \n \nPrep\n 3\n \n4.5\n \n2/2.8\n \n13.9\n \n \n \nPrep 4\n \n10\n \n1\n \n5.4\n \n \n \nDOM9-112-210-\n\nDOM10-53-546\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPrep\n 1\n \n2.2\n \n0.62/0.77\n \n4.3\n \n \n \nPrep 2\n \n7.7\n \n1\n \n6\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther in-line fusions were constructed by SOE PCR of the DNA fragments encoding a dAb linker which is either ASTKGPS (SEQ ID NO:535), if the first dAb was a Vh, or TVAAPS (SEQ ID NO:536) if the first dAb was a Vκ. This PCR product was digested with SalI/NotI and ligated in the \nE. coli\n expression vector pDOM5.
