The process by which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response is referred to as signal transduction. Over the past decades, cascades of signal transduction events have been elucidated and found to play a central role in a variety of biological responses. Defects in various components of signal transduction pathways have been found to account for a vast number of diseases, including numerous forms of cancer, inflammatory disorders, metabolic disorders, vascular and neuronal diseases (Gaestel et al. \nCurrent Medicinal Chemistry \n(2007) 14:2214-2234).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinases represent a class of important signaling molecules. Kinases can generally be classified into protein kinases and lipid kinases, and certain kinases exhibit dual specificities. Protein kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins and/or themselves (i.e., autophosphorylation). Protein kinases can be generally classified into three major groups based upon their substrate utilization: tyrosine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine residues (e.g., erb2, PDGF receptor, EGF receptor, VEGF receptor, src, abl), serine/threonine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on serine and/or threonine residues (e.g., mTor C1, mTor C2, ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Akt), and dual-specificity kinases which phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine, serine and/or threonine residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLipid kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids. These enzymes, and the resulting phosphorylated lipids and lipid-derived biologically active organic molecules, play a role in many different physiological processes, including cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and differentiation. Certain lipid kinases are membrane associated and they catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids contained in or associated with cell membranes. Examples of such enzymes include phosphoinositide(s) kinases (such as PI3-kinases, PI4-Kinases), diacylglycerol kinases, and sphingosine kinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) signaling pathway is one of the most highly mutated systems in human cancers. PI3K signaling is also a key factor in many other diseases in humans. PI3K signaling is involved in many disease states including allergic contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, disorders related to diabetic complications, and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPI3Ks are members of a unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3′-OH group on phosphatidylinositols or phosphoinositides. The PI3K family comprises 15 kinases with distinct substrate specificities, expression patterns, and modes of regulation (Katso et al., 2001). The class I PI3Ks (p110α, p110β, p110δ, and p110γ) are typically activated by tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors to generate PIP3, which engages downstream effectors such as those in the Akt/PDK1 pathway, mTOR, the Tec family kinases, and the Rho family GTPases. The class II and III PI3-Ks play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI(3)P and P1(3,4)P2. The PIKKs are protein kinases that control cell growth (mTORC1) or monitor genomic integrity (ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, and hSmg-1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe delta (δ) isoform of class I PI3K has been implicated, in particular, in a number of diseases and biological processes. PI3K δ is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells including leukocytes such as T-cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, mast cells, B-cells, and macrophages. PI3K δ is integrally involved in mammalian immune system functions such as T-cell function, B-cell activation, mast cell activation, dendritic cell function, and neutrophil activity. Due to its integral role in immune system function, PI3K δ is also involved in a number of diseases related to undesirable immune response such as allergic reactions, inflammatory diseases, inflammation mediated angiogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis, auto-immune diseases such as lupus, asthma, emphysema and other respiratory diseases. Other class I PI3K involved in immune system function includes PI3K γ, which plays a role in leukocyte signaling and has been implicated in inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune diseases such as lupus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDownstream mediators of the PI3K signal transduction pathway include Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Akt possesses a plckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds PIP3, leading to Akt kinase activation. Akt phosphorylates many substrates and is a central downstream effector of PI3K for diverse cellular responses. One important function of Akt is to augment the activity of mTOR, through phosphorylation of TSC2 and other mechanisms. mTOR is a serine-threonine kinase related to the lipid kinases of the PI3K family. mTOR has been implicated in a wide range of biological processes including cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility and survival. Disregulation of the mTOR pathway has been reported in various types of cancer. mTOR is a multifunctional kinase that integrates growth factor and nutrient signals to regulate protein translation, nutrient uptake, autophagy, and mitochondrial function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs such, kinases, particularly PI3Ks are prime targets for drug development. There remains a need for PI3K inhibitors suitable for drug development. The present invention addresses this need and provides related advantages as well by providing new classes of kinase inhibitors.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a first aspect of the invention, compounds are provided which are of Formula I, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nW\na\n \n1 \nis CR\n3 \nor N; W\na\n \n2 \nis CR\n5 \nor N; W\na\n \n3 \nis CR\n6 \nor N; W\na\n \n4 \nis N or CR\n7\n; W\nb\n \n5 \nis CR\na\n, CHR\n8\n, or N, wherein no more than two adjacent ring atoms selected from W\na\n \n1\n, W\na\n \n2\n, W\na\n \n3\n, W\na\n \n4\n, and W\nb\n \n5 \nare heteroatoms.

Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention. It is intended that the appended claims define the scope of the invention and that methods and structures within the scope of these claims and their equivalents be covered thereby.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All patents and publications referred to herein are incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used in the specification and claims, the singular form “a”, “an” and “the” includes plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “agent” or “biologically active agent” refers to a biological, pharmaceutical, or chemical compound or other moiety. Non-limiting examples include simple or complex organic or inorganic molecule, a peptide, a protein, an oligonucleotide, an antibody, an antibody derivative, antibody fragment, a vitamin derivative, a carbohydrate, a toxin, or a chemotherapeutic compound. Various compounds can be synthesized, for example, small molecules and oligomers (e.g., oligopeptides and oligonucleotides), and synthetic organic compounds based on various core structures. In addition, various natural sources can provide compounds for screening, such as plant or animal extracts, and the like. A skilled artisan can readily recognize that there is no limit as to the structural nature of the agents of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “agonist” as used herein refers to a compound having the ability to initiate or enhance a biological function of a target protein, whether by inhibiting the activity or expression of the target protein. Accordingly, the term “agonist” is defined in the context of the biological role of the target polypeptide. While preferred agonists herein specifically interact with (e.g. bind to) the target, compounds that initiate or enhance a biological activity of the target polypeptide by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target polypeptide is a member are also specifically included within this definition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “antagonist” and “inhibitor” are used interchangeably, and they refer to a compound having the ability to inhibit a biological function of a target protein, whether by inhibiting the activity or expression of the target protein. Accordingly, the terms “antagonist” and “inhibitors” are defined in the context of the biological role of the target protein. While preferred antagonists herein specifically interact with (e.g. bind to) the target, compounds that inhibit a biological activity of the target protein by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target protein is a member are also specifically included within this definition. A preferred biological activity inhibited by an antagonist is associated with the development, growth, or spread of a tumor, or an undesired immune response as manifested in autoimmune disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “anti-cancer agent”, “anti-tumor agent” or “chemotherapeutic agent” refers to any agent useful in the treatment of a neoplastic condition. One class of anti-cancer agents comprises chemotherapeutic agents. “Chemotherapy” means the administration of one or more chemotherapeutic drugs and/or other agents to a cancer patient by various methods, including intravenous, oral, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravesical, subcutaneous, transdermal, buccal, or inhalation or in the form of a suppository.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cell proliferation” refers to a phenomenon by which the cell number has changed as a result of division. This term also encompasses cell growth by which the cell morphology has changed (e.g., increased in size) consistent with a proliferative signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “co-administration,” “administered in combination with,” and their grammatical equivalents, as used herein, encompasses administration of two or more agents to an animal so that both agents and/or their metabolites are present in the animal at the same time. Co-administration includes simultaneous administration in separate compositions, administration at different times in separate compositions, or administration in a composition in which both agents are present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” refers to that amount of a compound described herein that is sufficient to effect the intended application including but not limited to disease treatment, as defined below. The therapeutically effective amount may vary depending upon the intended application (in vitro or in vivo), or the subject and disease condition being treated, e.g., the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the disease condition, the manner of administration and the like, which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The term also applies to a dose that will induce a particular response in target cells, e.g. reduction of platelet adhesion and/or cell migration. The specific dose will vary depending on the particular compounds chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, whether it is administered in combination with other compounds, timing of administration, the tissue to which it is administered, and the physical delivery system in which it is carried.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “treatment” or “treating,” or “palliating” or “ameliorating” are used interchangeably herein. These terms refers to an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including but not limited to therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated. Also, a therapeutic benefit is achieved with the eradication or amelioration of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that an improvement is observed in the patient, notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For prophylactic benefit, the compositions may be administered to a patient at risk of developing a particular disease, or to a patient reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though a diagnosis of this disease may not have been made.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “therapeutic effect,” as that term is used herein, encompasses a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit as described above. A prophylactic effect includes delaying or eliminating the appearance of a disease or condition, delaying or eliminating the onset of symptoms of a disease or condition, slowing, halting, or reversing the progression of a disease or condition, or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to salts derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids and organic acids. Inorganic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Organic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be formed with inorganic and organic bases. Inorganic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum, and the like. Organic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, basic ion exchange resins, and the like, specifically such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, and ethanolamine. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt is chosen from ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” or “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions of the invention is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Signal transduction” is a process during which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response. A modulator of a signal transduction pathway refers to a compound which modulates the activity of one or more cellular proteins mapped to the same specific signal transduction pathway. A modulator may augment (agonist) or suppress (antagonist) the activity of a signaling molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “selective inhibition” or “selectively inhibit” as applied to a biologically active agent refers to the agent's ability to selectively reduce the target signaling activity as compared to off-target signaling activity, via direct or interact interaction with the target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “B-ALL” as used herein refers to B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Subject” refers to an animal, such as a mammal, for example a human. The methods described herein can be useful in both human therapeutics and veterinary applications. In some embodiments, the patient is a mammal, and in some embodiments, the patient is human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Radiation therapy” means exposing a patient, using routine methods and compositions known to the practitioner, to radiation emitters such as alpha-particle emitting radionuclides (e.g., actinium and thorium radionuclides), low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation emitters (i.e. beta emitters), conversion electron emitters (e.g. strontium-89 and samarium-153-EDTMP, or high-energy radiation, including without limitation x-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Prodrug” is meant to indicate a compound that may be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to a biologically active compound described herein. Thus, the term “prodrug” refers to a precursor of a biologically active compound that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, e.g., Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs (1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam). A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al., “Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,” A.C.S. Symposium Series, Vol. 14, and in Bioreversibte Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated in full by reference herein. The term “prodrug” is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of an active compound, as described herein, may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent active compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol or acetamide, formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “in vivo” refers to an event that takes place in a subject's body.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “in vitro” refers to an event that takes places outside of a subject's body. For example, an in vitro assay encompasses any assay run outside of a subject assay. In vitro assays encompass cell-based assays in which cells alive or dead are employed. In vitro assays also encompass a cell-free assay in which no intact cells are employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of a hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by \n13\nC— or \n14\nC-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (\n3\nH), iodine-125 (\n125\nI) or carbon-14 (\n14\nC). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen ranges are used herein for physical properties, such as molecular weight, or chemical properties, such as chemical formulae, all combinations and subcombinations of ranges and specific embodiments therein are intended to be included. The term “about” when referring to a number or a numerical range means that the number or numerical range referred to is an approximation within experimental variability (or within statistical experimental error), and thus the number or numerical range may vary from, for example, between 1% and 15% of the stated number or numerical range. The term “comprising” (and related terms such as “comprise” or “comprises” or “having” or “including”) includes those embodiments, for example, an embodiment of any composition of matter, composition, method, or process, or the like, that “consist of” or “consist essentially of” the described features.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following abbreviations and terms have the indicated meanings throughout PI3-K=Phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PI=phosphatidylinositol; PDK=Phosphoinositide Dependent Kinase; DNA-PK=Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid Dependent Protein Kinase; PTEN=Phosphatase and Tensin homolog deleted on chromosome Ten; PIKK=Phosphoinositide Kinase Like Kinase; AIDS=Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome; HIV=Human Immunodeficiency Virus; MeI=Methyl Iodide; POCl\n3\n=Phosphorous Oxychloride; KCNS=Potassium IsoThiocyanate; TLC=Thin Layer Chromatography; MeOH=Methanol; and CHCl\n3\n=Chloroform.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbbreviations used herein have their conventional meaning within the chemical and biological arts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Alkyl” refers to a straight or branched hydrocarbon chain radical consisting solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms, containing no unsaturation, having from one to ten carbon atoms (e.g., C\n1\n-C\n10 \nalkyl).

Whenever it appears herein, a numerical range such as “3 to 18” refers to each integer in the given range; e.g., “3 to 18 ring atoms” means that the heterocycloalkyl group may consist of 3 ring atoms, 4 ring atoms, etc., up to and including 18 ring atoms. In some embodiments, it is a C\n5\n-C\n10 \nheterocycloalkyl. In some embodiments, it is a C\n4\n-C\n10 \nheterocycloalkyl. In some embodiments, it is a C\n3\n-C\n10 \nheterocycloalkyl. Unless stated otherwise specifically in the specification, the heterocycloalkyl radical is a monocyclic, bicyclic, tricyclic or tetracyclic ring system, which may include fused or bridged ring systems. The heteroatoms in the heterocycloalkyl radical may be optionally oxidized. One or more nitrogen atoms, if present, are optionally quaternized. The heterocycloalkyl radical is partially or fully saturated. The heterocycloalkyl may be attached to the rest of the molecule through any atom of the ring(s). Examples of such heterocycloalkyl radicals include, but are not limited to, dioxolanyl, thienyl[1,3]dithianyl, decahydroisoquinolyl, imidazolinyl, imidazolidinyl, isothiazolidinyl, isoxazolidinyl, morpholinyl, octahydroindolyl, octahydroisoindolyl, 2-oxopiperazinyl, 2-oxopiperidinyl, 2-oxopyrrolidinyl, oxazolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, 4-piperidonyl, pyrrolidinyl, pyrazolidinyl, quinuclidinyl, thiazolidinyl, tetrahydrofuryl, trithianyl, tetrahydropyranyl, thiomorpholinyl, thiamorpholinyl, 1-oxo-thiomorpholinyl, and 1,1-dioxo-thiomorpholinyl.

A 1:1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers is a “racemic” mixture. The term “(.±.)” is used to designate a racemic mixture where appropriate. “Diastereoisomers” are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms, but which are not mirror-images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog R—S system. When a compound is a pure enantiomer the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon can be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated (+) or (−) depending on the direction (dextro- or levorotatory) which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that can be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)— or (S)—. The present chemical entities, pharmaceutical compositions and methods are meant to include all such possible isomers, including racemic mixtures, optically pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active (R)— and (S)— isomers can be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Moiety” refers to a specific segment or functional group of a molecule. Chemical moieties are often recognized chemical entities embedded in or appended to a molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Nitro” refers to the —NO\n2 \nradical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Oxa” refers to the —O— radical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Oxo” refers to the ═O radical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Tautomers” are structurally distinct isomers that interconvert by tautomerization. “Tautomerization” is a form of isomerization and includes prototropic or proton-shift tautomerization, which is considered a subset of acid-base chemistry. “Prototropic tautomerization” or “proton-shift tautomerization” involves the migration of a proton accompanied by changes in bond order, often the interchange of a single bond with an adjacent double bond. Where tautomerization is possible (e.g. in solution), a chemical equilibrium of tautomers can be reached. An example of tautomerization is keto-enol tautomerization. A specific example of keto-enol tautomerization is the interconversion of pentane-2,4-dione and 4-hydroxypent-3-en-2-one tautomers. Another example of tautomerization is phenol-keto tautomerization. A specific example of phenol-keto tautomerization is the interconversion of pyridin-4-ol and pyridin-4(1H)-one tautomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (\n3\nH), iodine-125 (\n125\nI) or carbon-14 (\n14\nC). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “leaving group or atom” is any group or atom that will, under the reaction conditions, cleave from the starting material, thus promoting reaction at a specified site. Suitable examples of such groups unless otherwise specified are halogen atoms, mesyloxy, p-nitrobenzensulphonyloxy and tosyloxy groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Protecting group” has the meaning conventionally associated with it in organic synthesis, i.e. a group that selectively blocks one or more reactive sites in a multifunctional compound such that a chemical reaction can be carried out selectively on another unprotected reactive site and such that the group can readily be removed after the selective reaction is complete. A variety of protecting groups are disclosed, for example, in T. H. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1999). For example, a hydroxy protected form is where at least one of the hydroxy groups present in a compound is protected with a hydroxy protecting group. Likewise, amines and other reactive groups may similarly be protected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Solvate” refers to a compound (e.g., a compound selected from Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) in physical association with one or more molecules of a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent. It will be understood that “a compound of Formula I” encompass the compound of Formula I and solvates of the compound, as well as mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Substituted” means that the referenced group may be substituted with one or more additional group(s) individually and independently selected from acyl, alkyl, alkylaryl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, carbohydrate, carbonate, heteroaryl, heterocycloalkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, aryloxy, mercapto, alkylthio, arylthio, cyano, halo, carbonyl, ester, thiocarbonyl, isocyanato, thiocyanato, isothiocyanato, nitro, oxo, perhaloalkyl, perfluoroalkyl, phosphate, silyl, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, sulfonamidyl, sulfoxyl, sulfonate, urea, and amino, including mono- and di-substituted amino groups, and the protected derivatives thereof. Di-substituted amino groups encompass those which form a ring together with the nitrogen of the amino group, such as for instance, morpholino. The substituents themselves may be substituted, for example, a cycloalkyl substituent may have a halide substituted at one or more ring carbons, and the like. The protecting groups that may form the protective derivatives of the above substituents are known to those of skill in the art and may be found in references such as Greene and Wuts, above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Sulfanyl” refers to the groups: —S-(optionally substituted alkyl), —S-(optionally substituted aryl), —S-(optionally substituted heteroaryl), and —S-(optionally substituted heterocycloalkyl).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Sulfinyl” refers to the groups: —S(O)—H, —S(O)-(optionally substituted alkyl), —S(O)-(optionally substituted amino), —S(O)-(optionally substituted aryl), —S(O)-(optionally substituted heteroaryl), and —S(O)-(optionally substituted heterocycloalkyl).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Sulfonyl” refers to the groups: —S(O\n2\n)—H, —S(O\n2\n)-(optionally substituted alkyl), —S(O\n2\n)-(optionally substituted amino), —S(O\n2\n)-(optionally substituted aryl), —S(O\n2\n)-(optionally substituted heteroaryl), and —S(O\n2\n)-(optionally substituted heterocycloalkyl).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Sulfonamidyl” or “sulfonamido” refers to a —S(═O)\n2\n—NRR radical, where each R is selected independently from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl (bonded through a ring carbon) and heteroalicyclic (bonded through a ring carbon). The R groups in —NRR of the —S(═O)\n2\n—NRR radical may be taken together with the nitrogen to which it is attached to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. In some embodiments, it is a C\n1\n-C\n10 \nsulfonamido, wherein each R in sulfonamido contains 1 carbon, 2 carbons, 3 carbons, or 4 carbons total. A sulfonamido group is optionally substituted by one or more of the substituents described for alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl respectively\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Sulfoxyl” refers to a —S(═O)\n2\nOH radical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Sulfonate” refers to a —S(═O)\n2\n—OR radical, where R is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl (bonded through a ring carbon) and heteroalicyclic (bonded through a ring carbon). A sulfonate group is optionally substituted on R by one or more of the substituents described for alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae, written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that would result from writing the structure from right to left, e.g., —CH\n2\nO— is equivalent to —OCH\n2\n—.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention also include crystalline and amorphous forms of those compounds, including, for example, polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs, solvates, hydrates, unsolvated polymorphs (including anhydrates), conformational polymorphs, and amorphous forms of the compounds, as well as mixtures thereof. “Crystalline form,” “polymorph,” and “novel form” may be used interchangeably herein, and are meant to include all crystalline and amorphous forms of the compound, including, for example, polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs, solvates, hydrates, unsolvated polymorphs (including anhydrates), conformational polymorphs, and amorphous forms, as well as mixtures thereof, unless a particular crystalline or amorphous form is referred to.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemical entities include, but are not limited to, compounds of Formula I, IV, V. VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, and XIV and all pharmaceutically acceptable forms thereof. Pharmaceutically acceptable forms of the compounds recited herein include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, chelates, non-covalent complexes, prodrugs, and mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, the compounds described herein are in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Hence, the terms “chemical entity” and “chemical entities” also encompass pharmaceutically acceptable salts, chelates, non-covalent complexes, prodrugs, and mixtures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, if the compound of Formula I, IV, V. VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, or XIV is obtained as an acid addition salt, the free base can be obtained by basifying a solution of the acid salt. Conversely, if the product is a free base, an addition salt, particularly a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt, may be produced by dissolving the free base in a suitable organic solvent and treating the solution with an acid, in accordance with conventional procedures for preparing acid addition salts from base compounds. Those skilled in the art will recognize various synthetic methodologies that may be used to prepare non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein W\na\n \n1 \nis CR\n3 \nor N; W\na\n \n2 \nis CR\n5 \nor N; W\na\n \n3 \nis CR\n6 \nor N; W\na\n \n4 \nis N or CR\n7\n; W\nb\n \n5 \nis CR\n8\n, CHR\n8\n, or N,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein no more than two adjacent ring atoms selected from W\na\n \n1\n, W\na\n \n2\n, W\na\n \n3\n, W\na\n \n4\n, and W\nb\n \n5 \nare heteroatoms;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nW\nd \nis heterocycloalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB is alkyl, amino, heteroalkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, or a moiety of Formula II;\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein W\nc \nis aryl, heteroaryl, heterocycloalkyl, or cycloalkyl, and q is an integer of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nX is absent or is —(CH(R\n9\n))z and each instance of z independently is an integer of 1, 2, 3, or 4;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nY is absent, —O—, —S—, —S(═O)—, —S(═O)\n2\n—, —N(R\n9\n)—, —C(═O)—(CHR\n9\n)\nz\n—, —C(═O)—, —N(R\n9\n)—C(═O)—, or —N(R\n9\n)—C(═O)NH—, —N(R\n9\n)C(R\n9\n)\n2\n—, or —C(═O)—(CHR\n9\n)\nz\n—;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1 \nis hydrogen, alkyl, heteroalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, alkoxy, amido, amino, acyl, acyloxy, alkoxycarbonyl, sulfonamido, halo, cyano, hydroxy, nitro, phosphate, urea, or carbonate;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n2 \nis alkyl, heteroalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, alkoxy, amido, amino, acyl, acyloxy, alkoxycarbonyl, sulfonamido, halo, cyano, hydroxy, nitro, phosphate, urea, or carbonate;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n3 \nis hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, alkoxy, amido, amino, acyl, acyloxy, alkoxycarbonyl, sulfonamido, halo, cyano, hydroxy, nitro, aryl, or heteroaryl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, and R\n8 \nare independently hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heteroalkyl, alkoxy, amido, amino, acyl, acyloxy, sulfonamido, halo, cyano, hydroxy or nitro; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \neach instance of R\n9 \nis independently hydrogen, C\n1\n-C\n10\nalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n7\ncycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, or C\n2\n-C\n10\nheteroalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, W\na\n \n1 \nis CR\n3\n.

For example, in the treatment of adult humans, dosages from 0.01 to 1000 mg, from 0.5 to 100 mg, from 1 to 50 mg per day, and from 5 to 40 mg per day are examples of dosages that may be used. An exemplary dosage is 10 to 30 mg per day. The exact dosage will depend upon the route of administration, the form in which the compound is administered, the subject to be treated, the body weight of the subject to be treated, and the preference and experience of the attending physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDescribed below are non-limiting exemplary pharmaceutical compositions and methods for preparing the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration In some embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration containing a compound of the present invention, and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the invention provides a solid pharmaceutical composition for oral administration containing: (i) an effective amount of a compound of the present invention; optionally (ii) an effective amount of a second agent; and (iii) a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments, the composition further contains: (iv) an effective amount of a third agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may be a liquid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral consumption. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules, a solution, or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier, which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient such as, but not limited to, a binder, a lubricant, an inert diluent, and/or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, water may be added (e.g., 5%) in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and/or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition may be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions may be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the compositions for an oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations (such as suspensions, solutions, and elixirs) or aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations, in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example, suitable carriers include powders, capsules, and tablets, with the solid oral preparations. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisintegrants may be used in the compositions of the invention to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant may produce tablets which may disintegrate in the bottle. Too little may be insufficient for disintegration to occur and may thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient(s) from the dosage form. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient(s) may be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used may vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration, and may be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant, may be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums or mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethylaureate, agar, or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel, a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica, or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added, in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the essential active ingredient therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, hydrophilic surfactants, lipophilic surfactants, and mixtures thereof. That is, a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants may be employed, a mixture of lipophilic surfactants may be employed, or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable hydrophilic surfactant may generally have an HLB value of at least 10, while suitable lipophilic surfactants may generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non-ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (“HLB” value). Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic, and have greater solubility in oils, while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic, and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10, as well as anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly, lipophilic (i.e., hydrophobic) surfactants are compounds having an HLB value equal to or less than about 10. However, HLB value of a surfactant is merely a rough guide generally used to enable formulation of industrial, pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHydrophilic surfactants may be either ionic or non-ionic.

The polyol may be glycerol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, sorbitol, propylene glycol, pentaerythritol, or a saccharide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther hydrophilic-non-ionic surfactants include, without limitation, PEG-10 laurate, PEG-12 laurate, PEG-20 laurate, PEG-32 laurate, PEG-32 dilaurate, PEG-12 oleate, PEG-15 oleate, PEG-20 oleate, PEG-20 dioleate, PEG-32 oleate, PEG-200 oleate, PEG-400 oleate, PEG-15 stearate, PEG-32 distearate, PEG-40 stearate, PEG-100 stearate, PEG-20 dilaurate, PEG-25 glyceryl trioleate, PEG-32 dioleate, PEG-20 glyceryl laurate, PEG-30 glyceryl laurate, PEG-20 glyceryl stearate, PEG-20 glyceryl oleate, PEG-30 glyceryl oleate, PEG-30 glyceryl laurate, PEG-40 glyceryl laurate, PEG-40 palm kernel oil, PEG-50 hydrogenated castor oil, PEG-40 castor oil, PEG-35 castor oil, PEG-60 castor oil, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil, PEG-60 corn oil, PEG-6 caprate/caprylate glycerides, PEG-8 caprate/caprylate glycerides, polyglyceryl-10 laurate, PEG-30 cholesterol, PEG-25 phyto sterol, PEG-30 soya sterol, PEG-20 trioleate, PEG-40 sorbitan oleate, PEG-80 sorbitan laurate, polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80, POE-9 lauryl ether, POE-23 lauryl ether, POE-10 oleyl ether, POE-20 oleyl ether, POE-20 stearyl ether, tocopheryl PEG-100 succinate, PEG-24 cholesterol, polyglyceryl-10oleate, Tween 40, Tween 60, sucrose monostearate, sucrose monolaurate, sucrose monopalmitate, PEG 10-100 nonyl phenol series, PEG 15-100 octyl phenol series, and poloxamers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable lipophilic surfactants include, by way of example only: fatty alcohols; glycerol fatty acid esters; acetylated glycerol fatty acid esters; lower alcohol fatty acids esters; propylene glycol fatty acid esters; sorbitan fatty acid esters; polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters; sterols and sterol derivatives; polyoxyethylated sterols and sterol derivatives; polyethylene glycol alkyl ethers; sugar esters; sugar ethers; lactic acid derivatives of mono- and di-glycerides; hydrophobic transesterification products of a polyol with at least one member of the group consisting of glycerides, vegetable oils, hydrogenated vegetable oils, fatty acids and sterols; oil-soluble vitamins/vitamin derivatives; and mixtures thereof. Within this group, preferred lipophilic surfactants include glycerol fatty acid esters, propylene glycol fatty acid esters, and mixtures thereof, or are hydrophobic transesterification products of a polyol with at least one member of the group consisting of vegetable oils, hydrogenated vegetable oils, and triglycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the composition may include a solubilizer to ensure good solubilization and/or dissolution of the compound of the present invention and to minimize precipitation of the compound of the present invention. This can be especially important for compositions for non-oral use, e.g., compositions for injection. A solubilizer may also be added to increase the solubility of the hydrophilic drug and/or other components, such as surfactants, or to maintain the composition as a stable or homogeneous solution or dispersion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable solubilizers include, but are not limited to, the following: alcohols and polyols, such as ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, benzyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butanediols and isomers thereof, glycerol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, transcutol, dimethyl isosorbide, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyvinylalcohol, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and other cellulose derivatives, cyclodextrins and cyclodextrin derivatives; ethers of polyethylene glycols having an average molecular weight of about 200 to about 6000, such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol PEG ether (glycofurol) or methoxy PEG; amides and other nitrogen-containing compounds such as 2-pyrrolidone, 2-piperidone, .epsilon.-caprolactam, N-alkylpyrrolidone, N-hydroxyalkylpyrrolidone, N-alkylpiperidone, N-alkylcaprolactam, dimethylacetamide and polyvinylpyrrolidone; esters such as ethyl propionate, tributylcitrate, acetyl triethylcitrate, acetyl tributyl citrate, triethylcitrate, ethyl oleate, ethyl caprylate, ethyl butyrate, triacetin, propylene glycol monoacetate, propylene glycol diacetate, ε-caprolactone and isomers thereof, δ-valerolactone and isomers thereof, β-butyrolactone and isomers thereof; and other solubilizers known in the art, such as dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl isosorbide, N-methylpyrrolidones, monooctanoin, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMixtures of solubilizers may also be used.

The amount of a given solubilizer may be limited to a bioacceptable amount, which may be readily determined by one of skill in the art. In some circumstances, it may be advantageous to include amounts of solubilizers far in excess of bioacceptable amounts, for example to maximize the concentration of the drug, with excess solubilizer removed prior to providing the composition to a patient using conventional techniques, such as distillation or evaporation. Thus, if present, the solubilizer can be in a weight ratio of 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%, or up to about 200% by weight, based on the combined weight of the drug, and other excipients. If desired, very small amounts of solubilizer may also be used, such as 5%, 2%, 1% or even less. Typically, the solubilizer may be present in an amount of about 1% to about 100%, more typically about 5% to about 25% by weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe composition can further include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable additives and excipients. Such additives and excipients include, without limitation, detackifiers, anti-foaming agents, buffering agents, polymers, antioxidants, preservatives, chelating agents, viscomodulators, tonicifiers, flavorants, colorants, odorants, opacifiers, suspending agents, binders, fillers, plasticizers, lubricants, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, an acid or a base may be incorporated into the composition to facilitate processing, to enhance stability, or for other reasons. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable bases include amino acids, amino acid esters, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium aluminum silicate, synthetic aluminum silicate, synthetic hydrocalcite, magnesium aluminum hydroxide, diisopropylethylamine, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, triethanolamine, triethylamine, triisopropanolamine, trimethylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) and the like. Also suitable are bases that are salts of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, such as acetic acid, acrylic acid, adipic acid, alginic acid, alkanesulfonic acid, amino acids, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, boric acid, butyric acid, carbonic acid, citric acid, fatty acids, formic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, hydroquinosulfonic acid, isoascorbic acid, lactic acid, maleic acid, oxalic acid, para-bromophenylsulfonic acid, propionic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, succinic acid, tannic acid, tartaric acid, thioglycolic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, uric acid, and the like. Salts of polyprotic acids, such as sodium phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, and sodium dihydrogen phosphate can also be used. When the base is a salt, the cation can be any convenient and pharmaceutically acceptable cation, such as ammonium, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and the like. Example may include, but not limited to, sodium, potassium, lithium, magnesium, calcium and ammonium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable acids are pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic acids. Examples of suitable inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Examples of suitable organic acids include acetic acid, acrylic acid, adipic acid, alginic acid, alkanesulfonic acids, amino acids, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, boric acid, butyric acid, carbonic acid, citric acid, fatty acids, formic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, hydroquinosulfonic acid, isoascorbic acid, lactic acid, maleic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, para-bromophenylsulfonic acid, propionic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, succinic acid, tannic acid, tartaric acid, thioglycolic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, uric acid and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for injection. In some embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for injection containing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for injection. Components and amounts of agents in the compositions are as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration by injection include aqueous or oil suspensions, or emulsions, with sesame oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs, mannitol, dextrose, or a sterile aqueous solution, and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous solutions in saline are also conventionally used for injection. Ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like (and suitable mixtures thereof), cyclodextrin derivatives, and vegetable oils may also be employed. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, for the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the compound of the present invention in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients as enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, certain desirable methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for topical (e.g., transdermal) delivery. In some embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for transdermal delivery containing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for transdermal delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions of the present invention can be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, or liquid forms suitable for local or topical administration, such as gels, water soluble jellies, creams, lotions, suspensions, foams, powders, slurries, ointments, solutions, oils, pastes, suppositories, sprays, emulsions, saline solutions, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-based solutions. In general, carriers with higher densities are capable of providing an area with a prolonged exposure to the active ingredients. In contrast, a solution formulation may provide more immediate exposure of the active ingredient to the chosen area.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients, which are compounds that allow increased penetration of, or assist in the delivery of, therapeutic molecules across the stratum corneum permeability barrier of the skin. There are many of these penetration-enhancing molecules known to those trained in the art of topical formulation. Examples of such carriers and excipients include, but are not limited to, humectants (e.g., urea), glycols (e.g., propylene glycol), alcohols (e.g., ethanol), fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid), surfactants (e.g., isopropyl myristate and sodium lauryl sulfate), pyrrolidones, glycerol monolaurate, sulfoxides, terpenes (e.g., menthol), amines, amides, alkanes, alkanols, water, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother exemplary formulation for use in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices (“patches”). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of a compound of the present invention in controlled amounts, either with or without another agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,023,252, 4,992,445 and 5,001,139. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for inhalation. Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a face mask tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices that deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther pharmaceutical compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions may also be prepared from compositions described herein and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients suitable for sublingual, buccal, rectal, intraosseous, intraocular, intranasal, epidural, or intraspinal administration. Preparations for such pharmaceutical compositions are well-known in the art. See, e.g., See, e.g., Anderson, Philip O.; Knoben, James E.; Troutman, William G, eds., Handbook of Clinical Drug Data, Tenth Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2002; Pratt and Taylor, eds., \nPrinciples of Drug Action\n, Third Edition, Churchill Livingston, New York, 1990; Katzung, ed., \nBasic and Clinical Pharmacology\n, Ninth Edition, McGraw Hill, 20037ybg; Goodman and Gilman, eds., \nThe Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics\n, Tenth Edition, McGraw Hill, 2001\n; Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n20th Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins., 2000; Martindale, \nThe Extra Pharmacopoeia\n, Thirty-Second Edition (The Pharmaceutical Press, London, 1999); all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the compounds or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular, intraperitoneal or infusion), topical (e.g. transdermal application), rectal administration, via local delivery by catheter or stent or through inhalation. Compounds can also abe administered intraadiposally or intrathecally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the compound administered will be dependent on the mammal being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to 7 g/day, preferably about 0.05 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, e.g. by dividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in a single dose. Typically, such administration will be by injection, e.g., intravenous injection, in order to introduce the agent quickly. However, other routes may be used as appropriate. A single dose of a compound of the invention may also be used for treatment of an acute condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in multiple doses. Dosing may be about once, twice, three times, four times, five times, six times, or more than six times per day. Dosing may be about once a month, once every two weeks, once a week, or once every other day. In another embodiment a compound of the invention and another agent are administered together about once per day to about 6 times per day. In another embodiment the administration of a compound of the invention and an agent continues for less than about 7 days. In yet another embodiment the administration continues for more than about 6, 10, 14, 28 days, two months, six months, or one year. In some cases, continuous dosing is achieved and maintained as long as necessary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the agents of the invention may continue as long as necessary. In some embodiments, an agent of the invention is administered for more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, or 28 days. In some embodiments, an agent of the invention is administered for less than 28, 14, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 day. In some embodiments, an agent of the invention is administered chronically on an ongoing basis, e.g., for the treatment of chronic effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn effective amount of a compound of the invention may be administered in either single or multiple doses by any of the accepted modes of administration of agents having similar utilities, including rectal, buccal, intranasal and transdermal routes, by intra-arterial injection, intravenously, intraperitoneally, parenterally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, orally, topically, or as an inhalant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the invention may also be delivered via an impregnated or coated device such as a stent, for example, or an artery-inserted cylindrical polymer. Such a method of administration may, for example, aid in the prevention or amelioration of restenosis following procedures such as balloon angioplasty. Without being bound by theory, compounds of the invention may slow or inhibit the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall which contribute to restenosis. A compound of the invention may be administered, for example, by local delivery from the struts of a stent, from a stent graft, from grafts, or from the cover or sheath of a stent. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is admixed with a matrix. Such a matrix may be a polymeric matrix, and may serve to bond the compound to the stent. Polymeric matrices suitable for such use, include, for eample, lactone-based polyesters or copolyesters such as polylactide, polycaprolactonglycolide, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides, polyaminoacids, polysaccharides, polyphosphazenes, poly (ether-ester) copolymers (e.g. PEO-PLLA); polydimethylsiloxane, poly(ethylene-vinylacetate), acrylate-based polymers or copolymers (e.g. polyhydroxyethyl methylmethacrylate, polyvinyl pyrrolidinone), fluorinated polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene and cellulose esters. Suitable matrices may be nondegrading or may degrade with time, releasing the compound or compounds. Compounds of the invention may be applied to the surface of the stent by various methods such as dip/spin coating, spray coating, dip-coating, and/or brush-coating. The compounds may be applied in a solvent and the solvent may be allowed to evaporate, thus forming a layer of compound onto the stent. Alternatively, the compound may be located in the body of the stent or graft, for example in microchannels or micropores. When implanted, the compound diffuses out of the body of the stent to contact the arterial wall. Such stents may be prepared by dipping a stent manufactured to contain such micropores or microchannels into a solution of the compound of the invention in a suitable solvent, followed by evaporation of the solvent. Excess drug on the surface of the stent may be removed via an additional brief solvent wash. In yet other embodiments, compounds of the invention may be covalently linked to a stent or graft. A covalent linker may be used which degrades in vivo, leading to the release of the compound of the invention. Any bio-labile linkage may be used for such a purpose, such as ester, amide or anhydride linkages. Compounds of the invention may additionally be administered intravascularly from a balloon used during angioplasty. Extravascular administration of the compounds via the pericard or via advential application of formulations of the invention may also be performed to decrease restenosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of stent devices which may be used as described are disclosed, for example, in the following references, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference: U.S. Pat.

The activity of the kinase is assessed by measuring the incorporation of γ-\n33\nP-phosphate from γ-\n33\nP-ATP onto N-terminal His tagged substrate, which is expressed in \nE. coli \nand is purified by conventional methods, in the presence of the kinase. The assay is carried out in 96-well polypropylene plate. The incubation mixture (100, μL) comprises of 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 5 mM β-glycerolphosphate, 100 μM Na-orthovanadate, 5 mM DTT, 5 nM kinase, and 1 μM substrate. Inhibitors are suspended in DMSO, and all reactions, including controls are performed at a final concentration of 1% DMSO. Reactions are initiated by the addition of 10 μM ATP (with 0.5 μCi γ-\n33\nP-ATP/well) and incubated at ambient temperature for 45 minutes. Equal volume of 25% TCA is added to stop the reaction and precipitate the proteins. Precipitated proteins are trapped onto glass fiber B filterplates, and excess labeled ATP washed off using a Tomtec MACH III harvestor. Plates are allowed to air-dry prior to adding 30 μL/well of Packard Microscint 20, and plates are counted using a Packard TopCount.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides kits.

Assays of p110α/p85α, p110β/p85α, p110δ/p85α, and p110γ\n\n\n \n \n \nClass I PI3-Ks can be either purchased (p110α/p85α, p110β/p85α, p110δ/p85α from Upstate, and p110γ from Sigma) or expressed as previously described (Knight et al., 2004). IC50 values are measured using either a standard TLC assay for lipid kinase activity (described below) or a high-throughput membrane capture assay. Kinase reactions are performed by preparing a reaction mixture containing kinase, inhibitor (2% DMSO final concentration), buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2), and freshly sonicated phosphatidylinositol (100 μg/ml). Reactions are initiated by the addition of ATP containing 10 μCi of γ-32P-ATP to a \nfinal concentration\n 10 or 100 μM and allowed to proceed for 5 minutes at room temperature. For TLC analysis, reactions are then terminated by the addition of 105 μl 1N HCl followed by 160 μl CHCl3:MeOH (1:1). The biphasic mixture is vortexed, briefly centrifuged, and the organic phase is transferred to a new tube using a gel loading pipette tip precoated with CHCl\n3\n. This extract is spotted on TLC plates and developed for 3-4 hours in a 65:35 solution of n-propanol:1M acetic acid. The TLC plates are then dried, exposed to a phosphorimager screen (Storm, Amersham), and quantitated. For each compound, kinase activity is measured at 10-12 inhibitor concentrations representing two-fold dilutions from the highest concentration tested (typically, 200 μM). For compounds showing significant activity, IC50 determinations are repeated two to four times, and the reported value is the average of these independent measurements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther commercial kits or systems for assaying PI3-K activities are available. The commercially available kits or systems can be used to screen for inhibitors and/or agonists of PI3-Ks including but not limited to PI 3-Kinase α, β, δ, and γ. An exemplary system is PI3-Kinase (human) HTRF™ Assay from Upstate. The assay can be carried out according to the procedures suggested by the manufacturer. Briefly, the assay is a time resolved FRET assay that indirectly measures PIP3 product formed by the activity of a PI3-K. The kinase reaction is performed in a microtiter plate (e.g., a 384 well microtiter plate). The total reaction volume is approximately 20 ul per well. In the first step, each well receives 2 ul of test compound in 20% dimethylsulphoxide resulting in a 2% DMSO final concentration. Next, approximately 14.5 ul of a kinase/PIP2 mixture (diluted in 1× reaction buffer) is added per well for a final concentration of 0.25-0.3 ug/ml kinase and 10 uM PIP2. The plate is sealed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. To start the reaction, 3.5 ul of ATP (diluted in 1× reaction buffer) is added per well for a final concentration of 10 uM ATP. The plate is sealed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction is stopped by adding 5 ul of Stop Solution per well and then 5 ul of Detection Mix is added per well. The plate is sealed, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, and then read on an appropriate plate reader.

A subject compound is added from a 100 μM stock solution to an aliquot of PBS (in duplicate) to give a final assay volume of 400 μL, containing 5 μM test compound and 1% DMSO (for half-life determination a total sample volume of 700 μL is prepared). Reactions are incubated, with shaking, for 0 minutes and 24 hours at 37° C.; for half-life determination samples are incubated for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours. Reactions are stopped by adding immediately 100 μL of the incubation mixture to 100 μL of acetonitrile and vortexing for 5 minutes. The samples are then stored at −20° C. until analysis by HPLC-MS/MS. Where desired, a control compound or a reference compound such as chlorambucil (5 μM) is tested simultaneously with a subject compound of interest, as this compound is largely hydrolyzed over the course of 24 hours. Samples are analyzed via (RP)HPLC-MS/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The HPLC conditions consist of a binary LC pump with autosampler, a mixed-mode, C12, 2×20 mm column, and a gradient program. Peak areas corresponding to the analytes are recorded by HPLC-MS/MS. The ratio of the parent compound remaining after 24 hours relative to the amount remaining at time zero, expressed as percent, is reported as chemical stability. In case of half-life determination, the half-life is estimated from the slope of the initial linear range of the logarithmic curve of compound remaining (%) vs. time, assuming first order kinetics.\n\n\n \nExample 37\n\n\nAkt Kinase Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nCells comprising components of the Akt/mTOR pathway, including but not limited to L6 myoblasts, B-ALL cells, B-cells, T-cells, leukemia cells, bone marrow cells, p190 transduced cells, philladelphia chromosome positive cells (Ph+), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, are typically grown in cell growth media such as DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum and/or antibiotics, and grown to confluency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to compare the effect of one or more compounds disclosed herein on Akt activation, said cells are serum starved overnight and incubated with one or more compounds disclosed herein or about 0.1% DMSO for approximately 1 minute to about 1 hour prior to stimulation with insulin (e.g. 100 nM) for about 1 minutes to about 1 hour. Cells are lysed by scraping into ice cold lysis buffer containing detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and protease inhibitors (e.g., PMSF). After contacting cells with lysis buffer, the solution is briefly sonicated, cleared by centrifugation, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF and immunoblotted using antibodies to phospho-Akt S473, phospho-Akt T308, Akt, and β-actin (Cell Signaling Technologies).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results demonstrate that one or more compounds of the present disclosure inhibit insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at S473. Alternatively, some compounds disclosed herein additionally inhibit insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at T308. Such class of compounds can inhibit Akt more effectively than rapamycin and may be indicative of mTORC2 inhibitors or inhibitors of upstream kinases such as PI3K or Akt.\n\n\n \nExample 38\n\n\nKinase Signaling in Blood\n\n\n \n \n \nPI3K/Akt/mTor signaling is measured in blood cells using the phosflow method (Methods Enzymol. 2007; 434:131-54). The advantage of this method is that it is by nature a single cell assay so that cellular heterogeneity can be detected rather than population averages. This allows concurrent distinction of signaling states in different populations defined by other markers. Phosflow is also highly quantitative. To test the effects of one or more compounds disclosed herein, unfractionated splenocytes, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated with anti-CD3 to initiate T-cell receptor signaling. The cells are then fixed and stained for surface markers and intracellular phosphoproteins. It is expected that inhibitors disclosed herein inhibit anti-CD3 mediated phosphorylation of Akt-S473 and S6, whereas rapamycin inhibits S6 phosphorylation and enhances Akt phosphorylation under the conditions tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, aliquots of whole blood are incubated for 15 minutes with vehicle (e.g. 0.1% DMSO) or kinase inhibitors at various concentrations, before addition of stimuli to crosslink the T cell receptor (TCR) (anti-CD3 with secondary antibody) or the B cell receptor (BCR) using anti-kappa light chain antibody (Fab′2 fragments). After approximately 5 and 15 minutes, samples are fixed (e.g. with cold 4% paraformaldehyde) and used for phosflow. Surface staining is used to distinguish T and B cells using antibodies directed to cell surface markers that are known to the art. The level of phosphorylation of kinase substrates such as Akt and S6 are then measured by incubating the fixed cells with labeled antibodies specific to the phosphorylated isoforms of these proteins. The population of cells are then analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\n\n \nExample 39\n\n\nColony Formation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nMurine bone marrow cells freshly transformed with a p190 BCR-Abl retrovirus (herein referred to as p190 transduced cells) are plated in the presence of various drug combinations in M3630 methylcellulose media for about 7 days with recombinant human IL-7 in about 30% serum, and the number of colonies formed is counted by visual examination under a microscope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are obtained from Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) and negative (Ph−) patients upon initial diagnosis or relapse. Live cells are isolated and enriched for CD19+CD34+ B cell progenitors. After overnight liquid culture, cells are plated in methocult GF+H4435, Stem Cell Tehcnologies) supplemented with cytokines (IL-3, IL-6, IL-7, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CF, Flt3 ligand, and erythropoietin) and various concentrations of known chemotherapeutic agents in combination with either compounds of the present disclosure. Colonies are counted by microscopy 12-14 days later. This method can be used to test for evidence of additive or synergistic activity.\n\n\n \nExample 40\n\n\nIn Vivo Effect of Kinase Inhibitors on Leukemic Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nFemale recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a γ source in two doses about 4 hr apart, with approximately 5Gy each. About 1 hr after the second radiation dose, mice are injected i.v. with about 1×10\n6 \nleukemic cells (e.g. Ph+human or murine cells, or p190 transduced bone marrow cells). These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of about 5×10\n6 \nnormal bone marrow cells from 3-5 week old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs are harvested for analysis. Kinase inhibitor treatment begins about 10 days after leukemic cell injection and continues daily until the mice become sick or a maximum of approximately 35 days post-transplant. Inhibitors are given by oral lavage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeripheral blood cells are collected approximately on day 10 (pre-treatment) and upon euthanization (post treatment), contacted with labeled anti-hCD4 antibodies and counted by flow cytometry. This method can be used to demonstrate that the synergistic effect of one or more compounds disclosed herein in combination with known chemotherapeutic agents significantly reduce leukemic blood cell counts as compared to treatment with known chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. Gleevec) alone under the conditions tested.\n\n\n \nExample 41\n\n\nTreatment of Lupus Disease Model Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nMice lacking the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb that opposes PI3K signaling in B cells develop lupus with high penetrance. FcγRIIb knockout mice (R2KO, Jackson Labs) are considered a valid model of the human disease as some lupus patients show decreased expression or function of FcγRIIb (S. Bolland and J. V. Ravtech 2000\n. Immunity \n12:277-285).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe R2KO mice develop lupus-like disease with anti-nuclear antibodies, glomerulonephritis and proteinurea within about 4-6 months of age. For these experiments, the rapamycin analogue RAD001 (available from LC Laboratories) is used as a benchmark compound, and administered orally. This compound has been shown to ameliorate lupus symptoms in the B6.Slelz.Sle3z model (T. Wu et al. \nJ. Clin Invest. \n117:2186-2196).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLupus disease model mice such as R2KO, BXSB or MLR/lpr are treated at about 2 months old, approximately for about two months. Mice are given doses of: vehicle, RAD001 at about 10 mg/kg, or compounds disclosed herein at approximately 1 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg. Blood and urine samples are obtained at approximately throughout the testing period, and tested for antinuclear antibodies (in dilutions of serum) or protein concentration (in urine). Serum is also tested for anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA antibodies by ELISA. Animals are euthanized at \nday\n 60 and tissues harvested for measuring spleen weight and kidney disease. Glomerulonephritis is assessed in kidney sections stained with H&E. Other animals are studied for about two months after cessation of treatment, using the same endpoints.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis model established in the art can be employed to demonstrate that the kinase inhibitors disclosed herein can suppress or delay the onset of lupus symptoms in lupus disease model mice.\n\n\n \nExample 42\n\n\nMurine Bone Marrow Transplant Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nFemale recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a y ray source. About 1 hr after the radiation dose, mice are injected with about 1×106 leukemic cells from early passage p190 transduced cultures (e.g. as described in \nCancer Genet Cytogenet. \n2005 August; 161(1):51-6). These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of approximately 5×106 normal bone marrow cells from 3-5 wk old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs harvested for flow cytometry and/or magnetic enrichment. Treatment begins on approximately \nday\n 10 and continues daily until mice become sick, or after a maximum of about 35 days post-transplant. Drugs are given by oral gavage (p.o.). In a pilot experiment a dose of chemotherapeutic that is not curative but delays leukemia onset by about one week or less is identified; controls are vehicle-treated or treated with chemotherapeutic agent, previously shown to delay but not cure leukemogenesis in this model (e.g. imatinib at about 70 mg/kg twice daily). For the first phase p190 cells that express eGFP are used, and postmortem analysis is limited to enumeration of the percentage of leukemic cells in bone marrow, spleen and lymph node (LN) by flow cytometry. In the second phase, p190 cells that express a tailless form of human CD4 are used and the postmortem analysis includes magnetic sorting of hCD4+ cells from spleen followed by immunoblot analysis of key signaling endpoints: p Akt-T308 and S473; pS6 and p4EBP-1. As controls for immunoblot detection, sorted cells are incubated in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitors of the present disclosure inhibitors before lysis. Optionally, “phosflow” is used to detect p Akt-S473 and pS6-S235/236 in hCD4-gated cells without prior sorting. These signaling studies are particularly useful if, for example, drug-treated mice have not developed clinical leukemia at the 35 day time point. Kaplan-Meier plots of survival are generated and statistical analysis done according to methods known in the art. Results from p190 cells are analyzed separated as well as cumulatively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples of peripheral blood (100-200 μl) are obtained weekly from all mice, starting on \nday\n 10 immediately prior to commencing treatment. Plasma is used for measuring drug concentrations, and cells are analyzed for leukemia markers (eGFP or hCD4) and signaling biomarkers as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis general assay known in the art may be used to demonstrate that effective therapeutic doses of the compounds disclosed herein can be used for inhibiting the proliferation of leukemic cells.\n\n\n \nExample 43\n\n\nCell Culture of Epithelial Cells of Ocular Origin\n\n\n \n \n \nOcular epithelial cells are obtained within 5 days postmortem post-mortem from corneas preserved under cold storage conditions in Optisol (Bausch and Lomb, Irvine, Calif.) or from corneal biopsy from living donors. The tissue is washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in Dispase II (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) at 37° C. for 30 minutes, and the epithelial surface is gently scraped to separate the epithelium from the underlying stroma. The separated epithelium is then incubated and pipetted in trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid to obtain a single cell suspension. The trypsin is then neutralized with corneal epithelium culture medium. Corneal epithelium culture medium is composed of Dulbecco modified Eagle medium:F12 basal media in a 2:1 ratio containing 10% irradiated fetal bovine serum, hydrocortisone 0.4 μg/mL, cholera toxin 0.1 nmol, recombinant \nhuman insulin\n 5 μg/mL, and \nepidermal growth factor\n 10 ng/mL, and the antimicrobials penicillin (100 IU/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL), and amphotericin B (0.25 μg/mL). Cells are maintained by sub-culturing at a 1:4 ratio after reaching 80% confluency. Ocular epithelial cells are screened for inhibition of proliferation or toxicity by contacting a test compound with the cells and assaying for viability using the commercially available MTF assay (Promega).\n\n\n \nExample 44\n\n\nCell Culture of Endothelial Cells of Ocular Origin\n\n\n \n \n \nAll tissues are maintained at 4° C. in storage medium (Optisol; Chiron Vision, Irvine, Calif.) for less than 10 days before study. The tissue is rinsed three times with DMEM containing 50 mg/mL gentamicin and 1.25 mg/mL amphotericin B. The central cornea is removed by a trephine of 8-mm diameter. Afterward, the Descemet's membrane and corneal endothelial cells are stripped from the posterior surface of the peripheral corneoscleral tissue under a dissecting microscope and digested at 37° C. for 1.5 to 16 hours with 2 mg/mL collagenase A in supplemented hormonal epithelial medium (SHEM), which is made of an equal volume of HEPES-buffered DMEM and Ham's F12 supplemented with 5% FBS, 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide, 2 ng/mL mouse EGF, 5 μg/mL insulin, 5 μg/mL transferrin, 5 ng/mL selenium, 0.5 μg/mL hydrocortisone, 1 nM cholera toxin, 50 μg/mL gentamicin, and 1.25 μg/mL amphotericin B. After digestion, HCECs formed aggregates, which are collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 3 minutes to remove the digestion solution. As a control, Descemet's membrane strips are also digested in 10 mg/mL Dispase II in SHEM and trypsin/EDTA for up to 3 hours.\n\n\n \nPreservation of Isolated HCEC Aggregates\n\n\n \n \n \nThe resultant aggregates of HCECs are preserved in KSFM with complete supplement (storage medium 1), DMEM/F12 with KSFM supplements (storage medium 2), or DMEM/F12 with SHEM supplements without FBS (storage medium 3). All these media are serum free, one of the major differences among them is the calcium concentration, which is 0.09 mM in \nstorage medium\n 1, but is 1.05 mM in \n \nstorage media\n \n 2 and 3. HCEC aggregates are stored in a tissue culture incubator at 37° C. for up to 3 weeks. Cell viability is determined (Live and Dead assay; Invitrogen) and also evaluated by subculturing them in SHEM.\n\n\n \nExpansion of Isolated HCEC Aggregates\n\n\n \n \n \nThe resultant HCEC aggregates, either immediately after digestion or after a period of preservation in a storage medium, are then cultured in SHEM with or without additional growth factors such as 40 ng/mL bFGF, 0.1 mg/mL BPE, and 20 ng/mL NGF on a plastic dish under 37° C. and 5% CO2. The media are changed every 2 to 3 days. Some HCEC aggregates are pretreated with trypsin/EDTA at 37° C. for 10 minutes to dissociate endothelial cells before the aforementioned cultivation.\n\n\n \nImmunostaining\n\n\n \n \n \nHCEC aggregates are embedded in OCT and subjected to frozen sectioning. Cryosections of 4 μm are air-dried at room temperature (RT) for 30 minutes, and fixed in cold acetone for 10 minutes at −20° C. Sections used for immunostaining are rehydrated in PBS, and incubated in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes. After three rinses with PBS for 5 minutes each and preincubation with 2% BSA to block nonspecific staining, the sections are incubated with anti-laminin 5, type IV collagen, perlecan, ZO-1, and connexin 43 (all at 1:100) antibodies for 1 hour. After three washes with PBS for 15 minutes, the sections are incubated with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG at 1:100) for 45 minutes. After three additional PBS washes, each for 10 minutes, they are counterstained with propidium iodide (1:1000) or Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/mL), then mounted with an antifade solution and analyzed with a fluorescence microscope. HCECs cultured in 24-well plates or chamber slides are fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at RT and stained with anti-ZO-1 and connexin 43 antibodies as just described. For immunohistochemical staining of Ki67, endogenous peroxidase activity is blocked by 0.6% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. Nonspecific staining is blocked by 1% normal goat serum for 30 minutes. Cells are then incubated with anti-Ki67 antibody (1:100) for 1 hour. After three washes with PBS for 15 minutes, cells are incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:100) for 30 minutes, followed by incubation with ABC reagent for 30 minutes. The reaction product is developed with DAB for 5 minutes and examined by light microscope.\n\n\n \nCell-Viability and TUNEL Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nCell-viability and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated FITC-linked dUTP nick-end DNA labeling (TUNEL) assays are used to determine living and apoptotic cells, respectively. HCEC aggregates are incubated with cell-viability assay reagents for 15 minutes at RT. Live cells are distinguished by green fluorescence staining of the cell cytoplasm, and dead cells are stained with red fluorescence in the nuclei. The TUNEL assay is performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cross-sections of HCEC aggregates are fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at RT and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100. Samples are then incubated for 60 minutes at 37° C. with exogenous TdT and fluorescein-conjugated dUTP, for repair of nicked 3′-hydroxyl DNA ends. Cells are treated with DNase I as the positive control, whereas negative control cells are incubated with a buffer lacking the rTdT enzyme. The apoptotic nuclei are labeled with green fluorescence.\n\n\n \nExample 45\n\n\nCell Culture of Retinal Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nEyes are cut in half along their equator and the neural retina is dissected from the anterior part of the eye in buffered saline solution, according to standard methods known in the art. Briefly, the retina, ciliary body, and vitreous are dissected away from the anterior half of the eye in one piece, and the retina is gently detached from the clear vitreous. Each retina is dissociated with papain (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, N.J.), followed by inactivation with fetal bovine serum (FBS) and addition of 134 Kunitz units/ml of DNaseI. The enzymatically dissociated cells are triturated and collected by centrifugation, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 medium (Gibco BRL, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.) containing 25 μg/ml of insulin, 100 μg/ml of transferrin, 60 μM putrescine, 30 nM selenium, 20 nM progesterone, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, 0.05 M Hepes, and 10% FBS. Dissociated primary retina I cells are plated onto Poly-D-lysine- and Matrigel-(BD, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) coated glass coverslips that are placed in 24-well tissue culture plates (Falcon Tissue Culture Plates, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa.). Cells are maintained in culture for 5 days to one month in 0.5 ml of media (as above, except with only 1% FBS) at 37° C. and 5% CO2.\n\n\n \nImmunocytochemistry Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe retinal neuronal cells are cultured for 1, 3, 6, and 8 weeks in the presence and absence of test compounds of the present invention, and the cells are analyzed by immunohistochemistry at each time point. Immunocytochemistry analysis is performed according to standard techniques known in the art. Rod photoreceptors are identified by labeling with a rhodopsin-specific antibody (mouse monoclonal, diluted 1:500; Chemicon, Temecula, Calif.). An antibody to mid-weight neurofilament (NFM rabbit polyclonal, diluted 1:10,000, Chemicon) is used to identify ganglion cells; an antibody to β3-tubulin (G7121 mouse monoclonal, diluted 1:1000, Promega, Madison, Wis.) is used to generally identify interneurons and ganglion cells, and antibodies to calbindin (AB1778 rabbit polyclonal, diluted 1:250, Chemicon) and calretinin (AB5054 rabbit polyclonal, diluted 1:5000, Chemicon) are used to identify subpopulations of calbindin- and calretinin-expressing interneurons in the inner nuclear layer. Briefly, the retinal cell cultures are fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Polysciences, Inc, Warrington, Pa.) and/or ethanol, rinsed in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS), and incubated with primary antibody for 1 hour at 37° C. The cells are then rinsed with DPBS, incubated with a secondary antibody (Alexa 488- or Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.)), and rinsed with DPBS. Nuclei are stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAN, Molecular Probes), and the cultures are rinsed with DPBS before removing the glass coverslips and mounting them with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, Ala.) on glass slides for viewing and analysis.\n\n\n \nExample 46\n\n\nMatrigel Plug Angiogenesis Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nMatrigel containing test compounds are injected subcutaneously or intraocularly, where it solidifies to form a plug. The plug is recovered after 7-21 days in the animal and examined histologically to determine the extent to which blood vessels have entered it. Angiogenesis is measured by quantification of the vessels in histologic sections. Alternatively, fluorescence measurement of plasma volume is performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran 150. The results are expected to indicate one or more compounds disclosed herein that inhibit angiogenesis and are thus expected to be useful in treating ocular disorders related to aberrant angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability.\n\n\n \nExample 47\n\n\nThe Corneal Angiogenesis Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nA pocket is made in the cornea, and a plug containing an angiogenesis inducing formulation (e.g. VEGF, FGF, or tumor cells), when introduced into this pocket, elicits the ingrowth of new vessels from the peripheral limbal vasculature. Slow-release materials such as ELVAX (ethylene vinyl copolymer) or Hydron are used to introduce angiogenesis inducing substances into the corneal pocket. Alternatively, a sponge material is used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of putative inhibitors on the locally induced (e.g., sponge implant) angiogenic reaction in the cornea (e.g., by FGF, VEGF, or tumor cells). The test compound is administered orally, systemically, or directly to the eye. Systemic administration is by bolus injection or, more effectively, by use of a sustained-release method such as implantation of osmotic pumps loaded with the test inhibitor. Administration to the eye is by any of the methods described herein including but not limited to eye drops, topical administration of a cream, emulsion, or gel, intravitreal injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe vascular response is monitored by direct observation throughout the course of the experiment using a stereomicroscope in mice. Definitive visualization of the corneal vasculature is achieved by administration of fluorochrome-labeled high-molecular weight dextran. Quantification is performed by measuring the area of vessel penetration, the progress of vessels toward the angiogenic stimulus over time, or in the case of fluorescence, histogram analysis or pixel counts above a specific (background) threshold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are expected to indicate one or more compounds disclosed herein that inhibit angiogenesis and are thus expected to be useful in treating ocular disorders related to aberrant angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability.\n\n\n \nExample 48\n\n\nMicrotiter-Plate Angiogenesis Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe assay plate is prepared by placing a collagen plug in the bottom of each well with 5-10 cell spheroids per collagen plug each spheroid containing 400-500 cells. Each collagen plug is covered with 1100 μl of storage medium per well and stored for future use (1-3 days at 37° C., 5% CO2). The plate is sealed with sealing. Test compounds are dissolved in 200 μl assay medium with at least one well including a VEGF positive control and at least one well without VEGF or test compound as a negative control. The assay plate is removed from the incubator and storage medium is carefully pipeted away. Assay medium containing the test compounds are pipeted onto the collagen plug. The plug is placed in a humidified incubator for (37° C., 5% CO2) 24-48 hours. Angiogenesis is quantified by counting the number of sprouts, measuring average sprout length, or determining cumulative sprout length. The assay can be preserved for later analysis by removing the assay medium, adding 1 ml of 10% paraformaldehyde in Hanks BSS per well, and storing at 4° C. The results are expected to identify compounds that inhibit angiogenesis in various cell types tested, including cells of ocular origin.\n\n\n \nExample 49\n\n\nTNP-Ficoll T-Cell Independent B-Cell Activation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nTo test the effects of the compounds of the present invention in suppressing T cell independent antibody production, the TNP-Ficoll B-cell activation assay was used as described herein. Compounds of the present invention were dissolved in an appropriate vehicle (e.g. 5% 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, 85\n% polyethylene glycol\n 400, 10% solutor). Compounds were administered orally approximately 1 hr before TNP-Ficoll treatment to 4-10 week old mice.

The following day, serum was collected by decanting and centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The collected serum was then frozen at −80° C. for future analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum samples were analyzed for anti-TNP antibody titers by ELISA as described herein. TNP-BSA was coated onto a Nunc Maxisorb microtiter plate with 10 μl/well at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The Maxisorb plate was incubated for 1.5 hours at room temperature and the solution was removed. 200 μl/well of blocking buffer (e.g. 1% BSA in PBS) was added to each well and incubated 1 hr at room temperature. The plate was washed once with 200 μl/well of PBS 0.05% Tween-20 (wash buffer). A 1:2 dilution of serum from each mouse in blocking buffer was added to each well in the first column (1) of the microtiter plate. The serum in each well of \ncolumn\n 1 was then diluted 3-fold in blocking buffer and added to \ncolumn\n 2. The serum in each well of \ncolumn\n 2 was diluted 3-fold in blocking buffer and added to \ncolumn\n 3. The procedure was repeated across the twelve columns of the microtiter plate. The microtiter plate was incubated 1 hr at room temperature. Serum was removed from the plate and the plate was washed three times with wash buffer. 100 μl/well of goat anti-mouse IgG3-HRP diluted 1:250 in blocking buffer was added to each well and incubated 1 hr at room temperature. The anti-mouse IgG3-HRP was removed from the microtiter plate and the plate was washed six times with wash buffer. HRP substrate (200 μl ABTS solution+30% H2O2+10 ml citrate buffer) was added to each well at 100 μl/well, incubated 2-20 minutes in the dark and the amount of anti-TNP IgG3 was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. Similarly, anti-TNP IgM and total anti-TNP Ab were determined using anti-mouse IgM-HRP and anti-mouse Ig-HRP respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results as shown in \nFIG. 2\n further show that under the conditions tested \ncompounds #\n7 and #53 exhibit 3.4 and 6.5-fold reductions respectively in IgG3 levels relative to vehicle control mice at a 30 mg/kg dose level. \nFIG. 2\n further shows that \ncompound #\n53 exhibits 29.9-fold reduction in IgG3 levels relative to vehicle control mice at a 60 mg/kg dose level under the conditions tested,\n\n\n \nExample 50\n\n\nRat Developing Type II Collagen Induced Arthritis Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to study the effects of the compounds of the present invention on the autoimmune disease arthritis, a collagen induced developing arthritis model was used. Female Lewis rats were given collagen injections at \nday\n 0. Bovine type II collagen was prepared as a 4 mg/ml solution in 0.01N acetic acid. Equal volumes of collagen and Freund's incomplete adjuvant were emulsified by hand mixing until a bead of the emulsified material held its form in water. Each rodent received a 300 μl injection of the mixture at each injection time spread over three subcutaneous sites on the back.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOral compound administration began on \nday\n 0 and continued through \nday\n 16 with vehicle (5% NMP, 85\n% PEG\n 400, 10% Solutol) or compounds of the present invention in vehicle or control (e.g. methotrexate) at 12 hour intervals daily. Rats were weighed on \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 0, 3, 6, 9-17 and caliper measurements of ankles taken on days 9-17. Final body weights were taken, and then the animals were euthanized on day 17. After euthanization, blood was drawn and hind paws and knees were removed. Blood was further processed for pharmacokinetics experiments as well as an anti-type II collagen antibody ELISA assay. Hind paws were weighed and then with the knees preserved in 10% formalin. The paws and knees were subsequently processed for microcopy. Livers, spleen and thymus were also weighed. Sciatic nerves were prepared for histopathology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKnee and ankle joints were fixed for 1-2 days and decalcified for 4-5 days. Ankle joints were cut in half longitudinally, knees were cut in half along the frontal plane. Joints were then processed, embedded, sectioned and stained with toluidine blue.

Percent inhibition of paw weight and AUC was calculated using the following formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n% Inhibition=A−B/A×100\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA=Mean Disease Control−Mean Normal\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB=Mean Treated−Mean Normal\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results as shown in \nFIG. 3\n demonstrate the effect of \ncompound #\n53 at 10, 30, and 60 mg/kg dosages at 12 hour intervals on mean ankle diameter over time in a rat developing type II collagen induced arthritis model under the conditions tested. Relative to the vehicle alone control or to the methotrexate control, the compounds of the present invention exhibited a significant reduction in arthritis induced ankle diameter increase over time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results as shown in \nFIG. 4\n demonstrate the effect of \ncompounds #\n7 and #53 on ankle histopathology in the categories of inflammation, pannus, cartilage damage, and bone resporption as previously described under the conditions tested. The results show a significant reduction in one or more categories by one of the compounds of the present invention (i.e. compound #53) under the conditions tested. \nFIG. 4\n further shows that at 60 mg/kg, there is a statistically significant reduction in all categories of ankle histopathology for one of the compounds of the present invention (i.e. compound #53) under the conditions tested. This suggests that one or more compounds of the present invention may be useful for the treatment and reduction of arthritis disease symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results as shown in \nFIG. 5\n demonstrate the effect of \ncompounds #\n7 and #53 on knee histopathology under the conditions tested. The results demonstrate a dose dependent reduction in knee histopathology. This suggests that one or more compounds of the present invention may be useful for the treatment and reduction of arthritis disease symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results as shown in \nFIG. 6\n demonstrate the effect of the \ncompounds #\n7 and #53 on serum anti-type H collagen levels under the conditions tested. The results further show a significant reduction at 10, 20, and 60 mg/kg dosage levels of serum anti-type II collagen levels for \ncompound #\n53, suggesting that one or more compounds of the present invention may not only be useful for the treatment and reduction of arthritis disease symptoms, but may also be useful for the inhibition of the autoimmune reaction itself.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results as shown in \nFIG. 7\n demonstrate the effect of \ncompound #\n7 at 10, 30, and 60 mg/kg dosages at 12 hour intervals on mean ankle diameter over time under the conditions tested. Relative to the vehicle alone control or to the methotrexate control, the compound exhibited a reduction in arthritis induced ankle diameter increase over time under the conditions tested.\n\n\n \nExample 51\n\n\nRat Established Type II Collagen Induced Arthritis Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to examine the dose responsive efficacy of the compounds of the present invention in inhibiting the inflammation, cartilage destruction and bone resporption of 7 day established type II collagen induced arthritis in rats, compounds were administered orally daily or twice daily for 6 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFemale Lewis rats were anesthetized and given collagen injections prepared and administered as described previously on \nday\n 0. On \nday\n 6, animals were anesthetized and given a second collagen injection. Caliper measurements of normal (pre-disease) right and left ankle joints were performed on day 9. On days 10-11, arthritis typically occurred and rats were randomized into treatment groups. Randomization was performed after ankle joint swelling was obviously established and there was good evidence of bilateral disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter an animal was selected for enrollment in the study, treatment was initiated by the oral route. Animals were given vehicle, control (Enbrel) or compound doses, twice daily or once daily(BID or QD respectively). Dosing was administered on days 1-6 using a volume of 2.5 ml/kg (BID) or 5 ml/kg (QD) for oral solutions. Rats were weighed on days 1-7 following establishment of arthritis and caliper measurements of ankles taken every day. Final body weights were taken on \nday\n 7 and animals were euthanized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results as shown in \nFIG. 8\n shows a significant reduction in mean ankle diameter increase over time for \ncompound #\n53 with a once daily dosage under the conditions tested. The results in \nFIG. 9\n further demonstrate a significant reduction in mean ankle diameter increase over time for \ncompound #\n53 with a twice daily dosage under the conditions tested. This suggests that the compounds of the present invention may be useful for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as arthritis.\n\n\n \nExample 52\n\n\nAdjuvant Induced Arthritis Assay\n\n\nIntrathecal Catheterization of Rats\n\n\n \n \n \nIsoflurane-anesthetized Lewis rats (200-250 g) were implanted with an intrathecal (IT) catheter. After a 6 d recovery period, all animals except those that appeared to have sensory or motor abnormalities (fewer than 5% of the total number) were used for experiments. For IT administration, 10 μl of drug or saline followed by 10 μl of isotonic saline was injected through the catheter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdjuvant Arthritis and Drug Treatment\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLewis rats were immunized at the base of the tail with 0.1 ml of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) on \nday\n 0 several days after catheter implantation (n=6/group). Drug (e.g. one or more compounds of the present invention or or vehicle) treatment was generally started on \nday\n 8 and continued daily until day 20. Clinical signs of arthritis generally begin on \nday\n 10, and paw swelling was determined every second day by water displacement plethysmometry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results as depicted in \nFIG. 10\n by the average change in paw volume under the dosage regimes indicated show that under the conditions tested, \ncompound #\n53 shows a dose dependent reduction in the average paw volume increase as measured in this adjuvant induced arthritis model system. These results suggest that one or more of the compounds of the present invention may be useful for the treatment of one or more of the diseases or conditions described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results as depicted in \nFIG. 11\n show that \ncompound #\n53 does not exhibit toxicity or other adverse reaction under the conditions tested as measured by a lack of weight loss.\n\n\n \nExample 53\n\n\nRodent Pharmacokinetic Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to study the pharmacokinetics of the compounds of the present invention a set of 4-10 week old mice are grouped according to the following table:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCompound Administration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMice/\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nfrom day-1 to day-7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup#\n\n\ngroup\n\n\ntreated\n\n\n(mg/kg)\n\n\n \nRoute\n \n \nRegimen\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\nPo\n\n\nBID for 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n \ndays\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention are dissolved in an appropriate vehicle (e.g. 5% 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, 85\n% polyethylene glycol\n 400, 10% Solutor) and administered orally at 12 hour intervals daily. All animals are euthanized in \nCO2\n 2 hours after the final compound is administered. Blood is collected immediately and kept on ice for plasma isolation. Plasma is isolated by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes. Harvested plasma is frozen for pharmacokinetic detection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are expected to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic parameters such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity for the compounds of the present invention.\n\n\n \nExample 54\n\n\nBasotest Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe baseotest assay is performed using Orpegen Pharma Basotest reagent kit. Heparinized whole blood is pre-incubated with test compound or solvent at 37 C for 20 min. Blood is then incubated with assay kit stimulation buffer (to prime cells for response) followed by allergen (dust mite extract or grass extract) for 20 min. The degranulation process is stopped by incubating the blood samples on ice. The cells are then labeled with anti-IgE-PE to detect basophilic granulocytes, and anti-gp53-FITC to detect gp53 (a glycoprotein expressed on activated basophils). After staining red blood cells are lysed by addition of Lysing Solution. Cells are washed, and analyzed by flow cytometry. \n \nCompounds\n \n 7 and 53 when tested in this assay inhibit allergen induced activation of basophilic granulocytes at sub micromolar range.\n\n\n \nExample 55\n\n\nCombination use of PI3Kε Inhibitors and Agents that Inhibit IgE Production or Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may present synergistic or additive efficacy when administered in combination with agents that inhibit IgE production or activity. Agents that inhibit IgE production include, for example, one or more of TEI-9874, 2-(4-(6-cyclohexyloxy-2-naphtyloxy)phenylacetamide)benzoic acid, rapamycin, rapamycin analogs (i.e. rapalogs), TORC1 inhibitors, TORC2 inhibitors, and any other compounds that inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2. Agents that inhibit IgE activity include, for example, anti-IgE antibodies such as Omalizumab and TNX-901.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more of the subject compounds capable of inhibiting PI3Kδ are efficacious in treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders (AIID) for example rheumatoid arthritis. If any of the compounds causes an undesired level of IgE production, one may choose to administer it in combination with an agent that inhibits IgE production or IgE activity. Additionally, the administration of PI3Kδ or PI3Kδ/γ inhibitors of the present invention in combination with inhibitors of mTOR may also exhibit synergy through enhanced inhibition of the PI3K pathway. Various in vivo and in vitro models may be used to establish the effect of such combination treatment on AIID including but not limited to (a) in vitro B-cell antibody production assay, (b) in vivo TNP assay, and (c) rodent collagen induced arthritis model.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) B-Cell Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice are euthanized, and the spleens are removed and dispersed through a nylon mesh to generate a single-cell suspension. The splenocytes are washed (following removal of erythrocytes by osmotic shock) and incubated with anti-CD43 and anti-Mac-1 antibody-conjugated microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). The bead-bound cells are separated from unbound cells using a magnetic cell sorter. The magnetized column retains the unwanted cells and the resting B cells are collected in the flow-through. Purified B-cells are stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or an anti-CD40 antibody and \ninterleukin\n 4. Stimulated B-cells are treated with vehicle alone or with PI3Kδ inhibitors of the present invention such as \ncompound\n 53 with and without mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin, rapalogs, or mTORC1/C2 inhibitors. The results are expected to show that in the presence of mTOR inhibitors (e.g., rapamycin) alone, there is little to no substantial effect on IgG and IgE response. However, in the presence of PI3Kδ and mTOR inhibitors, the B-cells are expected to exhibit a decreased IgG response as compared to the B-cells treated with vehicle alone, and the B-cells are expected to exhibit a decreased IgE response as compared to the response from B-cells treated with PI3Kδ inhibitors alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) TNP Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice are immunized with TNP-Ficoll or TNP-KHL and treated with: vehicle, a PI3Kδ inhibitor, for example, \ncompound\n 53 of the present invention, an mTOR inhibitor, for example rapamycin, or a PI3Kδ inhibitor in combination with an mTOR inhibitor such as rapamycin. Antigen-specific serum IgE is measured by ELISA using TNP-BSA coated plates and isotype specific labeled antibodies. It is expected that mice treated with an mTOR inhibitor alone exhibit little or no substantial effect on antigen specific IgG3 response and no statistically significant elevation in IgE response as compared to the vehicle control. It is also expected that mice treated with both PI3Kδ inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor exhibit a reduction in antigen specific IgG3 response as compared to the mice treated with vehicle alone. Additionally, the mice treated with both PI3Kδ inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor exhibit a decrease in IgE response as compared to the mice treated with PI3Kδ inhibitor alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) Rat Collagen Induced Arthritis Model\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFemale Lewis rats are anesthetized and given collagen injections prepared and administered as described previously on \nday\n 0. On \nday\n 6, animals are anesthetized and given a second collagen injection. Caliper measurements of normal (pre-disease) right and left ankle joints are performed on day 9. On days 10-11, arthritis typically occurs and rats are randomized into treatment groups. Randomization is performed after ankle joint swelling is obviously established and there is good evidence of bilateral disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter an animal is selected for enrollment in the study, treatment is initiated. Animals are given vehicle, PI3Kδ inhibitor, or PI3Kδ inhibitor in combination with rapamycin. Dosing is administered on days 1-6. Rats are weighed on days 1-7 following establishment of arthritis and caliper measurements of ankles taken every day. Final body weights are taken on \nday\n 7 and animals are euthanized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is expected that the combination treatment using PI3Kδ inhibitor and rapamycin provides greater efficacy than treatment with PI3Kδ inhibitor alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention. It is intended that the following claims define the scope of the invention and that methods and structures within the scope of these claims and their equivalents be covered thereby."
