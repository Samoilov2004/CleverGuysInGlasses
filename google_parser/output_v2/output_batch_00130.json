Throughout the specification, groups and substituents thereof are chosen by one skilled in the field to provide stable moieties and compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulas, written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that would result from writing the structure from right to left. As a non-limiting example, —CH\n2\nO— is equivalent to —OCH\n2\n—.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise noted, the use of general chemical terms, such as though not limited to “alkyl,” “amine,” “aryl,” are equivalent to their optionally substituted forms. For example, “alkyl,” as used herein, includes optionally substituted alkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, he compounds presented herein possess one or more stereocenters. Ins some embodiments, each center exists in the R or S configuration, or combinations thereof. Likewise, in some embodiments, the compounds presented herein possess one or more double bonds. In some embodiments, each exists in the E (trans) or Z (cis) configuration, or combinations thereof. Presentation of one particular Stereoisomer, regioisomer, diastereomer, enantiomer or epimer should be understood to include all possible stereoisomers, regioisomers, diastereomers, enantiomers or epimers and mixtures thereof. Thus, the compounds presented herein include all separate configurational stereoisomeric, regioisomeric, diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms as well as the corresponding mixtures thereof. For techniques regarding inverting or leaving unchanged a particular stereocenter, and those for resolving mixtures of stereoisomers see, for example, Furniss et al. (eds.), VOGEL'S TEXTBOOK OF PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 5\nth \nEdition, Longman Scientific and Technical Ltd., Essex, 1991, 809-816.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “moiety”, “chemical moiety”, “group” and “chemical group”, as used herein refer to a specific segment or functional group of a molecule. Chemical moieties are often recognized chemical entities embedded in or appended to a molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “bond” or “single bond” refers to a chemical bond between two atoms, or two moieties when the atoms joined by the bond are considered to be part of larger substructure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “catalytic group” refers to a chemical functional group that assists catalysis by acting to lower the activation barrier to reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, “optionally substituted alkyl” means either “alkyl” or “substituted alkyl” as defined below. Further, in some embodiments, an optionally substituted group is un-substituted (e.g., —CH\n2\nCH\n3\n), fully substituted (e.g., —CF\n2\nCF\n3\n), mono-substituted (e.g., —CH\n2\nCH\n2\nF) or substituted at a level anywhere in-between fully substituted and mono-substituted (e.g., —CH\n2\nCHF\n2\n, —CH\n2\nCF\n3\n, —CF\n2\nCH\n3\n, —CFHCHF\n2\n, etc). It will be understood by those skilled in the art with respect to any group containing one or more substituents that such groups are not intended to introduce any substitution or substitution patterns (e.g., substituted alkyl includes optionally substituted cycloalkyl groups, which in turn are defined as including optionally substituted alkyl groups, potentially ad infinitum) that are sterically impractical and/or synthetically non-feasible. Thus, any substituents described should generally be understood as having a maximum molecular weight of about 1,000 daltons, and more typically; up to about 500 daltons (except in those instances where macromolecular substituents are clearly intended, e.g., polypeptides, polysaccharides, polyethylene glycols, DNA, RNA and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, C\n1\n-C\nx \nincludes C\n1\n-C\n2\n, C\n1\n-C\n3 \n. . .

Examples of non-mammals include, but are not limited to, birds, fish and the like. In some embodiments of the methods and compositions provided herein, the subject is a mammal. In preferred embodiments, the subject is a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “treat,” “treating” or “treatment,” and other grammatical equivalents as used herein, include alleviating, abating or ameliorating a disease or condition symptoms, preventing additional symptoms, ameliorating or preventing the underlying metabolic causes of symptoms, inhibiting the disease or condition, e.g., arresting the development of the disease or condition, relieving the disease or condition, causing regression of the disease or condition, relieving a condition caused by the disease or condition, or stopping the symptoms of the disease or condition, and are intended to include prophylaxis. The terms further include achieving a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated. Also, a therapeutic benefit is achieved with the eradication or amelioration of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that an improvement is observed in the patient, notwithstanding that the patient is still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For prophylactic benefit, the compositions are administered to a patient at risk of developing a particular disease, or to a patient reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though a diagnosis of this disease has not been made.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “administer,” “administering”, “administration,” and the like, as used herein, refer to the methods that are used to enable delivery of compounds or compositions to the desired site of biological action. These methods include, but are not limited to oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), topical and rectal administration. In preferred embodiments, the compounds and compositions described herein are administered orally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “effective amount”, “therapeutically effective amount” or “pharmaceutically effective amount” as used herein, refer to a sufficient amount of at least one agent or compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disease or condition being treated. In some embodiments, the result is reduction and/or alleviation of the signs, symptoms, or causes of a disease, or any other desired alteration of a biological system. For example, an “effective amount” for therapeutic uses is the amount of the composition comprising a compound as disclosed herein required to provide a clinically significant decrease in a disease. In some embodiments, an appropriate “effective” amount differs from one individual to another. An appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case is determined using any suitable technique, such as a dose escalation study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “acceptable” as used herein, with respect to a formulation, composition or ingredient, means having no persistent detrimental effect on the general health of the subject being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable” as used herein, refers to a material, such as a carrier or diluent, which does not abrogate the biological activity or properties of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), and is relatively nontoxic, i.e., the material is administered to an individual without causing undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the components of the composition in which it is contained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “prodrug” as used herein, refers to a drug precursor that, following administration to a subject and subsequent absorption, is converted to an active, or a more active species via some process, such as conversion by a metabolic pathway. Thus, the term encompasses any derivative of a compound, which, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) or a pharmaceutically active metabolite or residue thereof. Some prodrugs have a chemical group present on the prodrug that renders it less active and/or confers solubility or some other property to the drug. Once the chemical group has been cleaved and/or modified from the prodrug the active drug is generated. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they are easier to administer than the parent drug. In some embodiments, they are, for instance, bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. Particularly favored-derivatives or prodrugs are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (TV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) when such compounds are administered to a patient (e.g. by allowing an orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a biological compartment (e.g. the brain or lymphatic system).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” as used herein, refers to salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free acids and bases of the specified compound and that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. In some embodiments, compounds described herein possess acidic or basic groups and therefore react with any of a number of inorganic or organic bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. These salts are prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), or by separately reacting a purified compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutical composition,” as used herein, refers to a biologically active compound, optionally mixed with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable chemical component, such as, though not limited to carriers, stabilizers, diluents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, excipients and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “carrier” as used herein, refers to relatively nontoxic chemical compounds or agents that facilitate the incorporation of a compound into cells or tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “pharmaceutical combination”, “administering an additional therapy”, “administering an additional therapeutic agent” and the like, as used herein, refer to a pharmaceutical therapy resulting from the mixing or combining of more than one active ingredient and includes both fixed and non-fixed combinations of the active ingredients. The term “fixed combination” means that at least one of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), and at least one co-agent, are both administered to a patient simultaneously in the form of a single entity or dosage. The term “non-fixed combination” means that at least one of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), and at least one co-agent, are administered to a patient as separate entities either simultaneously, concurrently or sequentially with variable intervening time limits, wherein such administration provides effective levels of the two or more compounds in the body of the patient. These also apply to cocktail therapies, e.g. the administration, of three or more active ingredients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “co-administration”, “administered in combination with” and their grammatical equivalents or the like, as used herein, are meant to encompass administration of the selected therapeutic agents to a single patient, and are intended to include treatment regimens in which the agents are administered by the same or different route of administration or at the same or different times. In some embodiments a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) will be co-administered with other agents. These terms encompass administration of two or more agents to an animal so that both agents and/or their metabolites are present in the animal at the same time. They include simultaneous administration in separate compositions, administration at different times in separate compositions, and/or administration in a composition in which both agents are present. Thus, in some embodiments, the compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) and the other agent(s) are administered in a single composition. In some embodiments, compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) and the other agent(s) are admixed in the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “metabolite,” as used herein, refers to a derivative of a compound which is formed when the compound is metabolized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “active metabolite,” as used herein, refers to a biologically active derivative of a compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “metabolized,” as used herein, refers to the sum of the processes (including, but not limited to, hydrolysis reactions and reactions catalyzed by enzymes) by which a particular substance is changed by an organism. Thus, in certain instances, enzymes produce specific structural alterations to a compound. For example, cytochrome P450 catalyzes a variety of oxidative and reductive reactions while uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferases catalyze the transfer, of an activated glucuronic-acid molecule to aromatic alcohols, aliphatic alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines and free sulphydryl groups.

Protecting groups are used to block some or all reactive moieties and prevent such groups from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed. It is preferred that each protective group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal. Protective groups are removed by acid, base, and hydrogenolysis. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and t-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and are used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties are blocked with base labile groups such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as t-butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties are blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids are blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties are protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as exemplified herein, or they are blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups are blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAllyl blocking groups are useful in then presence of acid- and base-protecting groups since the former are stable and are subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid are deprotected with a Pd-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate is attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtecting or blocking groups are selected from:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther protecting groups, plus a detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal are described in Greene and Wuts, P\nROTECTIVE \nG\nROUPS IN \nO\nRGANIC \nS\nYNTHESIS, \n3\nrd \nEdition (John Wiley and Sons, 1999), and Kocienski, P\nROTECTIVE \nG\nROUPS \n(Thieme Verlag, 1994), which are incorporated herein by reference for such subject matter.\n\n\n \nPreparing Compounds of Formula (I) or (II); Formula (III) or (IV); or Formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c)\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are processes for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), which are synthesized according to the reaction schemes below.\n\n\n \nI.

In some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) possesses one or more double bonds. Compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) include all cis, trans, syn, anti, entgegen (E), and zusammen (Z) isomers as well as the corresponding mixtures thereof. In some situations, compounds exist as tautomers. Compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) include all possible tautomers within the formulas described herein. In some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) possesses one or more chiral centers and each center exists in the R or S configuration. Compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) include all diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms as well as the corresponding mixtures thereof. In additional embodiments of the compounds and methods provided herein, mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereoisomers, resulting from a single preparative step, combination, or interconversion are useful for the applications described herein. Compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) are prepared as their individual stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. While resolution of enantiomers is carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), dissociable complexes, are preferred (e.g., crystalline diastereomeric salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and are readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities. In some embodiments, the diastereomers are separated by chiral chromatography, or preferably, by separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer is then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in racemization. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from their racemic mixture is found in Jacques et al, “E\nNANTIOMERS\n, R\nACEMATES AND \nR\nESOLUTIONS\n” (John Wiley And Sons, 1981), herein incorporated by reference for such subject matter.\n\n\n \nLabeled Compounds of Formula (I) or (II); Formula (III) or (IV); or Formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c)\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, compounds Of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) exist in their isotopically-labeled forms.

Further disclosed herein are methods of treating diseases by administering such isotopically-labeled compounds as pharmaceutical compositions. Thus, compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) also include isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature.

Certain isotopically-labeled compounds, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as \n3\nH and \n14\nC are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., \n3\nH and carbon-14, i.e., \n14\nC) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavy isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., \n2\nH, affords certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, are preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug, solvate, hydrate or derivative thereof are generally prepared by carrying out procedures described herein, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is labeled by other means, including, but not limited to, the use of chromophores or fluorescent moieties, bioluminescent labels, or chemiluminescent labels.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutically Acceptable Salts of Compounds of Formula (I) or (II); Formula (III) or (IV); or Formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c)\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) exists as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.

Disclosed herein, in certain instances, are methods of treating diseases by administering such prodrugs. Further disclosed herein, in certain instances, are methods of treating diseases by administering such prodrugs as pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrugs are generally drug precursors that, following administration to a subject and subsequent absorption, are converted to an active, or a more active species via some process, such as conversion by a metabolic pathway. Some prodrugs have a chemical group present on the prodrug that renders it less active and/or confers solubility or some other property to the drug. Once the chemical group has been cleaved and/or modified from the prodrug the active drug is generated. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they are easier to administer than the parent drug. For example, prodrugs are bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. In some embodiments, the prodrug has improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound as described herein which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyamino acid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art. (See for example Bundgaard, “Design and Application of Prodrugs” in \nA textbook of Drug Design and Development\n, Krosgaard-Larsen and Bundgaard, Ed., 1991, Chapter 5, 113-191, which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, prodrugs are designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. The design of prodrugs to date has been to increase the effective water solubility of the therapeutic compound for targeting to regions where water is the principal solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, in some embodiments, prodrug derivatives of compounds described herein are prepared by any suitable method (for further details see Saulnier et al., \nBioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, \n1994, 4, 1985). By way of example only, appropriate prodrugs are prepared by reacting a non-derivatized compound with a suitable carbamylating agent, such as, but not limited to, 1,1-acyloxyalkylcarbanochloridate, para-nitrophenyl carbonate, or the like. Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a derivative as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. Indeed, some of the herein-described compounds are a prodrug for another derivative or active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c). The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids and also includes 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvaline, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, cirtulline, homocysteine, homoserine, ornithine and methionine sulfone. In other embodiments, prodrugs include compounds wherein a nucleic acid residue, or an oligonucleotide of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) nucleic acid residues is covalently joined to a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) also include, but are not limited to, esters, carbonates, thiocarbonates, N-acyl derivatives, N-acyloxyalkyl derivatives, quaternary derivatives of tertiary amines, N-Mannich bases, Schiff bases, amino acid conjugates, phosphate esters, metal salts and sulfonate esters. In some embodiments, compounds having free amino, amino, hydroxy or carboxylic groups are converted into prodrugs. For instance, free carboxyl groups are derivatized as amides or alkyl esters. In some embodiments, a prodrug moiety incorporates groups including but not limited to ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHydroxy prodrugs include esters, such as though not limited to, acyloxyalkyl (e.g. acyloxymethyl, acyloxyethyl) esters, alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl esters, alkyl esters, aryl esters, phosphate esters, sulfonate esters, sulfate esters and disulfide containing esters; ethers, amides, carbamates, hemisuccinates, dimethylaminoacetates and phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyls, as outlined in \nAdvanced Drug Delivery Reviews \n1996, 19, 115.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmine derived prodrugs include, but are not limited to the following groups and combinations of groups:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nas well as sulfonamides and phosphonamides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, sites on any aromatic ring portions are susceptible to various metabolic reactions. In some embodiments, incorporation of an appropriate substituent on the aromatic ring structures reduce, minimize or eliminate this metabolic pathway.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are pharmaceutical compositions.

In some embodiments, the integrase is a mutated integrase.\n\n\n \nCompound Metabolism, Degradation and Stability\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the metabolic profile of a compound influences the ability of the compound to serve as a useful and convenient medication. In human metabolism, the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of enzymes is the most important contributor to oxidative metabolism. Hepatic CYP enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many drug substances, and in particular, CYP3A4 is noteworthy for its wide range of substrates and high expression in the liver. Facile CYP3A4 metabolism often results is low serum levels of drug substance. In some embodiments, compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) are not significantly degraded or metabolized by CYP3A4, and are thus of particular interest as therapeutics. The term “significantly degraded” as used in this context, should be understood to refer to a compound that upon administration to a subject would not require the aid of a CYP inhibitor to boost serum concentrations. In some embodiments, the degree of CYP3A4 degradation is determined by any suitable method. One such assay is described herein and thus the degree of degradation is measured by exposing a compound to pooled human liver microsomes (protein: 1 mg/mL with CYP3A4 activity at about 4000 pmol/min/mg) at 37° C. for 60 minutes at pH 7.4 at a compound concentration of 1 μM in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM) containing magnesium chloride (5 mM), EDTA (100 μM) and NADPH (1 mM). The activity of the CYP3A4 enzyme is usually determined separately, in a standard assay, prior to performing the degradation assay. (Indeed it is often provided as part of the spec sheet by the enzyme supplier. It should be noted that in this assay an average CYP3A4 activity is given). Alternatively, in some embodiments, an isolated enzyme assay is performed and thus the degree of degradation is measured by exposing a compound to 10 pmol CYP3A4 enzyme at 37° C. for 60 minutes at pH 7.4 in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM) containing magnesium chloride (5 mM), EDTA (100 μM) and NADPH (1 mM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in some embodiments, compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) are less than about 30% degraded after exposure to pooled human liver microsomes (protein: 1 mg/mL with CYP3A4 activity at about 7800 pmol/min/mg) at 37° C. for 60 minutes at pH 7.4 at a compound concentration of 1 μM in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM) containing magnesium chloride (5 mM), EDTA (100 μM) and NADPH (1 mM). In further or additional embodiments, compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) are less than about 30% degraded after exposure to 10 pmol CYP3A4 enzyme at 37° C. for 60 minutes at pH 7.4 in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM) containing magnesium chloride (5 mM), EDTA (100 μM) and NADPH (1 mM).\n\n\n \nDiseases\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are methods of treating a disease in an individual suffering from said disease comprising administering to said individual an effective amount of a composition comprising a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method of treating or preventing HIV infection, treating AIDS-related complex (ARC), prophylaxis of ARC, delaying the onset of ARC, treating AIDS, prophylaxis of AIDS or delaying the onset of AIDS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso described herein are methods of preventing or delaying onset of a disease in an individual at risk for developing said disease comprising administering to said individual an effective amount to prevent or delay onset of said disease, of a composition comprising a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods disclosed herein also encompass the prophylaxis or treatment of any disease or disorder in which HIV integrase plays a role including, without limitation, HIV integrase in a human or other mammal.

Encephalitis and West Nile virus.\n\n\n \nViral Infections\n\n\n \n \n \nDisclosed herein, in certain instances, are methods for treating viral infections, and/or preventing or delaying the onset of conditions related to viral infections. In some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is used to treat infections or conditions associated with viruses, including, for example, human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) including drug resistant strains, human T-cell leukemia viruses 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human papilloma virus (HPV), adenovirus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8, also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus) and flaviviruses, including Yellow Fever virus, Dengue virus, Japanese Encephalitis and West Nile viruses. Preferably, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof is used to treat HIV infections. In addition, the present compounds are used to prevent and/or reduce the likelihood of a viral infection such as an HIV infection or a condition which that occurs secondary to a viral infection, such as AIDS, EBV-related lymphoma or HHV-8 associated cancer (sarcoma) will actually occur.\n\n\n \nHIV and AIDS\n\n\n \n \n \nOver 40 million individuals worldwide are currently infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with over 14,000 new infections daily and 3 million deaths annually from HIV-related causes. While advances in HIV and AIDS therapy have resulted in fewer AIDS related deaths, the number of HIV-infected individuals continues to rise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), particularly type-1 (HIV-1) and type-2 (HIV-2) strains, is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Individuals infected with HIV are initially asymptomatic but eventually undergo the gradual destruction of the immune system, (particularly CD4\n+\n T-cells), with a resultant debilitating and ultimately fatal susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Prior to the onset of AIDS, infected individuals MAY experience a precursor AIDS-related complex (ARC), a syndrome characterized by symptoms such as persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, fever and weight loss.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReplication of HIV in a host cell requires integration of the HIV genome into the host cell's DNA. Upon completion of this integration event, integrated proviral DNA is then translated using host cell machinery into viral proteins. Viral protein precursors are then processed by the viral protease to produce the protease, reverse transcriptase, endonuclease/integrase and mature structural proteins of the virus core.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntegration of the HIV genome into the host cell's DNA is performed by the HIV integrase enzyme. HIV integrase has two known enzymatic functions. The enzyme performs 3′-end processing in which two deoxynucleotides are removed from the 3′ ends of the viral DNA. In addition, HIV integrase performs the strand transfer reaction in which the processed 3′ ends of the viral DNA are covalently ligated to the host chromosomal DNA. Clearly, compounds that inhibit HIV integration will inhibit HIV replication in infected cells and would thus be useful in the treatment of HIV infection. In addition, compounds that inhibit HIV integration will prevent HIV infection in uninfected, normal cells and would thus be useful in the prophylaxis of HIV infection.\n\n\n \nCombination Therapy\n\n\n \n \n \nThe development of resistance to a single HIV therapy occurs. In certain instances, the administration of a combination of anti-HIV medications is utilized to suppress HIV replication. In certain instances, an individual receives a nucleoside-type reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor, typically in combination. HIV treatment now includes combination therapies (drug cocktails) that involve the dual administration of NRTIs with protease inhibitors or NNRTIs with protease inhibitors and triple combinations of NRTIs, NNRTIs and protease inhibitors. In some embodiments, an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered in combination with other HIV inhibitors selected from NRTIs, NNRTIs or protease inhibitors.\n\n\n \nMetabolism and Pharmacokinetic Profile\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the metabolic profile of a compound influence the ability of the compound to serve as a useful and convenient medication. In human metabolism, the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of enzymes is the most important contributor to oxidative metabolism. Hepatic CYP enzymes are involved in the metabolism of thousands of substrates, including toxic compounds and drug substances. In particular, CYP3A4 is noteworthy for its wide range of substrates and high expression in the liver. As a result, CYP3A4 metabolism is commonly encountered in the development of small molecule drugs. Facile CYP3A4 metabolism often results is low serum levels of drug substance. To achieve efficacy, a readily metabolized drug substance must then be given at higher doses and at shorter intervals. This results in a greater likelihood of drug toxicity and reduced patient compliance. One potential solution to this problem is the co-administration of a CYP3A4 inhibitor to boost the serum levels of the drug substance. However, this potential solution introduces the complexity of a second pharmacological agent and the attendant issues of toxicity, undesired pharmacology, drug-drug interactions and increased burden on the patient. For disease indications requiring combination therapy, the metabolic fate of the other components of the combination therapy must also be considered. In some embodiments, an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered without the aid of a CYP inhibitor to boost serum concentrations. In some embodiments, an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered in combination with other HIV inhibitors selected from NRTIs, NNRTIs or protease inhibitors, without the aid of a CYP inhibitor to boost serum concentrations.\n\n\n \nModes of Administration and Dosage Forms\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the compounds and compositions described herein are administered either alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents, in a pharmaceutical composition, according to standard pharmaceutical practice.

Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that are employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In some embodiments, the sterile injectable preparation is also a sterile injectable oil-in-water microemulsion where the active ingredient is dissolved in the oily phase. For example, the active ingredient is first dissolved in a mixture of soybean oil and lecithin. The oil solution then introduced into a water and glycerol mixture and processed to form a microemulsion. In some embodiments, the injectable solutions or microemulsions are introduced into a patient's blood-stream by local bolus injection. Alternatively, it is advantageous to administer the solution or microemulsion in such a way as to maintain a constant circulating concentration of the instant compound. In some embodiments, a continuous intravenous delivery device is utilized. An example of such a device is the Deltec CADD-PLUS™ model 5400 intravenous pump. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension for intramuscular and subcutaneous administration. Suspensions are formulated using any suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. In some embodiments, a sterile injectable preparation is a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent; for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. In some embodiments, sterile, fixed oils are employed as a solvent or suspending medium. Any bland fixed oil is employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions are also administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. In some embodiments, these compositions are prepared by mixing the active ingredient with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered are used. As used herein, topical application includes mouth washes and gargles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions are administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles and delivery devices, or via transdermal routes, using for example transdermal skin patches. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the formulations are presented in unit dosage form and are prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug or solvate thereof (“active ingredient”) with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a specific amount of active compound are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the compounds and compositions described herein may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question.\n\n\n \nDoses\n\n\n \n \n \nThe amount of pharmaceutical composition administered depends on a variety of factors. The amount will firstly be dependent on the mammal being treated. In the instances where pharmaceutical compositions are administered to a human subject, the daily dosage will normally be determined by the prescribing physician with the dosage generally varying according to the age, sex, diet, weight, general health and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, the precise indication or condition being treated, the severity of the indication or condition being treated, time of administration, route of administration, the disposition of the composition, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the discretion of the prescribing physician. In some embodiments, the route of administration varies depending on the condition and its severity. Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small amounts until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. In some embodiments, the total daily dosage is divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. The amount and frequency of administration of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), and if applicable other therapeutic agents and/or therapies, is regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician (physician) considering such factors as described above. In some embodiments, administration occurs in an amount of between about 0.001 mg/kg of body weight to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day (administered in single or divided doses), more preferably at least about 0.1 mg/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, a therapeutic dosage is, e.g., from about 0.01 mg to about 7000 mg of compound, and preferably includes, e.g., from about 0.05 mg to about 2500 mg. In some embodiments, the quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation is varied or adjusted from about 0.1 mg to 1000 mg, preferably from about 1 mg to 300 mg, more preferably 10 mg to 200 mg, according to the particular application. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range are used, while in other cases larger doses are employed without causing any harmful side effect, e.g. by dividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day. The amount administered will vary depending on the particular IC\n50 \nvalue of the compound used. In combinational applications in which the compound is not the sole therapy, in some embodiments, it is possible to administer lesser amounts of compound and still have therapeutic or prophylactic effect.\n\n\n \nCombination Therapies\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof is administered as a sole therapy. In some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof is administered in combination with another therapy or therapies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant may only have minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient is increased by administering one of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) with a second therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. By way of example only, in a treatment for viral infection involving administration of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), increased therapeutic benefit results by providing the patient with another therapeutic agent for viral infection. Or, by way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of a compound of formula (f) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is nausea, then it is appropriate to administer an anti-nausea agent in combination with the compound. Additional therapy or therapies include, but are not limited to physiotherapy, psychotherapy, radiation therapy, application of compresses to a diseased area, rest, altered diet, and the like. Regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient is additive of the two therapies or therapeutic agents, or the patient experiences a synergistic benefit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the instances where a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered with other therapeutic agents, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) need not be administered in the same, pharmaceutical composition as other therapeutic agents. In some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered by a different route. For example, the compounds/compositions are administered orally to generate and maintain good blood levels thereof, while the other therapeutic agent are administered intravenously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol), sequentially or dosed separately to other therapeutic agents. In some embodiments, the administration of a compound of formula (I) or formula (II), or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof and the second therapeutic agent is sequential. In some embodiments, the sequential administration is a cycling therapy. In some embodiments, the compound of formula (I) or formula (II), is administered before the second therapeutic agent. In some embodiments, the compound of formula (I) or formula (II), is administered after the second therapeutic agent. In some embodiments, the administration of a compound of formula (I) or formula (II), or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof and the second therapeutic agent is simultaneous.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe determination of the timing and mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is within the knowledge of the skilled clinician. In some embodiments, the initial administration is made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration is modified by the skilled clinician. The particular choice of compound and other therapeutic agent will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, he compounds described herein or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof are administered in combination with an anti HIV or AIDS drug. In some embodiments, he compounds described herein or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof are administered in combination with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, a viral protease inhibitor, a fusion inhibitor, a cytokine, a cytokine inhibitor; a glycosylation inhibitor, a viral mRNA processing inhibitor, an entry inhibitor, an integrase inhibitor or a maturation inhibitor or a combination thereof.

For example, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(a), either alone or in combination with other compounds, is used as tools in differential and/or combinatorial analyses to elucidate expression patterns of genes expressed within cells and tissues. As one non-limiting example, expression patterns within cells or tissues treated with one or more compounds are compared to control cells or tissues not treated with compounds and the patterns produced are analyzed for differential levels of gene expression as they pertain, for example, to disease association, signaling pathway, cellular localization, expression level, size, structure or function of the genes examined. In some embodiments, these analyses are performed on stimulated or unstimulated cells and in the presence or absence of other compounds which affect expression patterns.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBesides being useful for human treatment, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a); (V)(b) or (V)(c) and formulations thereof is also useful for veterinary treatment of companion animals, exotic animals and farm animals, including mammals, rodents, and the like.

Experimental procedures were essentially as previously published (see Connor et al., \nJournal of Virology, \n1996, 70, 5306-5311: Characterization of the functional properties of env genes from long-term survivors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection, and Popik et al., \nJournal of Virology, \n2002, 76, 4709-4722: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 uses lipid raft-co-localized CD4 and chemokine receptors for productive entry into CD4+ T cells). Virus stocks were generated by co-transfection of plasmid DNA encoding VSV-G with vector pNL4-3Env(−)Luc(+) into 293T cells. Sixty-four hours after transfection, virus-containing medium was collected by centrifugation and stored frozen at −80° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeLa cells were infected with the VSV-G pseudotyped virus in the presence of screening compounds in a 384-well or 96-well microtiter plate format. Forty-eight hours after initial infection, Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) was added to the cells and luciferase activity was determined using a LJLAnalyst luminometer. As the luciferase gene is carried in the virus genome, its expression level reflects the virus replication level in the presence of a compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo evaluate the activity of the compounds against wild type HIV-1, the HeLa-JC53 cell line that expresses high levels of CD4 and CCR5 (see for example, Platt et al., \nJournal of Virology \n1998, 72, 2855-2864: Effect of CCR5 and CD4 cell surface concentrations on infection by macrophagetropic isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1) was modified by isolation of a stable cell line that expresses luciferase under the control of the HIV-1 promoter (long terminal repeat, i.e., LTR). HIV-1 infection of this cell line stimulates the transcription of luciferase from the HIV-1 promoter and the luciferase gene expression level is proportional to the level of virus replication (Harrington et al., \nJournal of Virology Methods, \n2000, 88, 111-115: Direct detection of infection of HIV-1 in blood using a centrifugation-indicator cell assay; and Roos et al., \nVirology, \n2000, 273, 307-315: LuSIV cells: a reporter cell line for the detection and quantitation of a single cycle of HIV and SIV replication). Procedures for virus infection, compound testing and luciferase activity determination were the same as for the VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo approaches have been used to evaluate cytotoxicity. The first employed another modified HeLa-JC53 cell line that constitutively expresses high levels of luciferase without virus infection. The level of luciferase expression in these cells serves as an indicator for cell replication in the presence of the compounds. Procedures for compound testing and luciferase activity determination are the same as for the virus infection tests. The other toxicity assay utilizes HeLe-JC53 cells and a commercially available cell viability assay kit (Promega) that measures the ATP levels in the cells.\n\n\n \nExample 32\n\n\nActivity Data for

33\n\n\nMicrosomal Incubation (Method 1)\n\n\n \n \n \nCompound (10 μM) was incubated with rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey, and human liver microsomes (1 mg protein/mL) in a final volume of 1 mL in 2-mL Eppendorf tubes. The mixture containing enzymes, potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4), and the compound was pre-incubated at 37° C. for 3 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NADPH (final concentration of 1 mM) and incubated for 60 minutes at 37° C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 mL of acetonitrile. After centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 3 minutes, the supernatant was subjected to 15 minutes of concentration (N2 flow, 32° C.). The resulting final extract was transferred to clean vials and analyzed by HPLC.\n\n\n \nExample 34\n\n\nHepatocytes Incubation (Method 1)\n\n\n \n \n \nCryopreserved hepatocytes were thawed in a water bath at 37° C. and transferred to a 50-mL tube containing 45 mL of pre-warned incubation medium (In VitroGRO HT medium). The tube was inverted 3 times to ensure resuspension of hepatocytes and centrifuged at 50 g at room temperature for 5 minutes. The supernatant was decanted without disturbing the pellet. The pellet of hepatocytes was resuspended in 1 mL of William's E medium and the viable cell counting was determined by the tryptan blue exclusion method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe William's E medium was added to the suspension of the hepatocytes pellet to make a final density of 2 million cells/mL. Stock solution of the compound was prepared at the concentration of 1 mM and diluted to 10 μM with William's E medium. The culture plate was incubated at 37° C. under 5% carbon dioxide and 95% air atmosphere for 2 hrs. The metabolic reaction was terminated by transferring the contents of the well into a centrifuge tube containing 1 mL of 0.1% TFAA acetonitrile solution and then vortexing. After centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to 15 minute of concentration (N2 flow, 32° C.). The resulted final extract was transferred to clean vials for HPLC analysis.\n\n\n \nExample 35\n\n\nStability Data for Select Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nSelect compounds prepared as described above and Raltegravir (a known HIV integrase inhibitor) as control, were assayed for stability according to the biological procedures described in examples 33 and 34, and the results are given in the table below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% Remaining\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEg\n\n\nStructure\n\n\nMatrix\n\n\nHuman\n\n\nDog\n\n\nMonkey\n\n\nRat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosome     Hepatocyte\n\n\n 101 (3800) * 96.1 (3800) * 83.5 (7800) * 89.6\n\n\n102       NA\n\n\n66.3     72.3\n\n\n 38.1      66.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaltegravir\n\n\n \n\n\nMicrosome\n\n\n99.1 (3800) *\n\n\n 91.8\n\n\n94.7\n\n\n105  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHepatocyte\n\n\n32.4\n\n\nNA\n\n\n20.0\n\n\n 43.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n30A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosome Hepatocyte\n\n\n40.5 (3800) * NA\n\n\n 83.8 NA\n\n\n 4.1 NA\n\n\n 6.7 NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n* CYP3A4 activity (pmol/mg protein)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 36\n\n\nHepatocyte Stability (Human and Rat)\n\n\nThawing the Cryovials and Suspending the Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nIncubation media was pre-warmed to 37° C. in a water bath. 3 vials of hepatocytes were removed from liquid nitrogen storage and placed on ice. The vials were immediately immersed in a 37° C. water bath and gently rocked back and forth until most of the ice was melted and the pellet was completely mixed, (note, care was taken to maintain temperature below 37° C. during this step as the cryo-preservative is cytotoxic at 37° C.) 1 vial of hepatocytes was added to each 25 mL tube of incubation media, and the cells resuspended by gently inverting the tube several times. The cell suspension was centrifuged (468 rpm, 5 mins, ˜25° C.), and the supernatant discarded using a 5 mL pipette, being careful not to disturb the pellet during aspiration. A moderate amount of media was left with the pellet, which was loosened by tipping and gently rolling the tube until the pellet was gone. Incubation media (2 mL, CO\n2 \nbubbled) was added to each tube and the hepatocytes re-suspended by rocking the tube. The total cell count was then determined (see Trypan Blue Exclusion Method described below). The cells were resuspended in the appropriate amount of incubation media to yield 1.25×10\n6 \nviable cells/mL. The final concentration of cells in the incubation was 1.0×10\n6 \nafter the addition of the compound stock solution.\n\n\n \nTrypan Blue Exclusion Method\n\n\n \n \n \n800 μL of incubation media, 100 μL of Trypan Blue solution and 100 μL of the cell suspension were mixed in a 2 mL, microcentrifuge tube. 10 μL of the suspension was applied to the hemacytometer using a wide bore pipette tip. Living (yellow) and dead (blue) cells were counted in 4 quadrants of the hemacytometer. The total number of cells/mL and cell viability (living cells/total cells) were calculated, as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \nTotal cells/mL=living cells×0.25×10×10\n4 [\n0.25=¼ quadrants counted;10=dilution factor]\n\n\n\n \nTime Course Incubation\n\n\n \n \n \nHepatocytes (40 uL) were added to each tube using wide orifice pipette tips to a final concentration of 1 million cells/mL. Test compound solution (10 μl of 5 μM) was aliquoted into the appropriate tubes, and the incubated (37° C., CO2 incubator uncapped) for 4 hours. Samples were then quenched with internal standard in acetonitrile (200 uL of 100 ng/mL), vortexed (1-2 mins) and centrifuged (10 minutes, 3000 rpm). The supernatant was removed for LC-MS/MS analysis (instrument—MDS-Analyst, API 4000, S/N:J3750206, Agilent 1100, Binary Pump G1312A, S/N DE14910504; HPLC Column—Atlantis dC18 3 um, 4.6×50 mm, P/N: 186001329).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHepatocytes (human and rat, X00801 and M00005 respectively), buffer (InVitro Gro Buffer, Z99074) and medium (Invitro Gro HT, Z99019) were obtained from Celsis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelect compounds prepared as described herein, were assayed for stability according to the biological procedures described above, and the results are given in the table below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% Remaining\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEg\n\n\nStructure\n\n\n(human)\n\n\n% Remaining (rat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n97\n\n\n82\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n20AA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n75\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n20NN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n30A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 37\n\n\nMetabolic Stability\n\n\n \n \n \nRecombinant enzymes: Microsomes from baculovirus-infected insect enzymes cells (Supersomes) expressing CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, 3A5, FMO3 and insect cell controls are obtained from BD Biosciences (Gentest Co).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound (1 μM) or a positive control (1 μM) are incubated with individual recombinant enzymes (10 pmol) in a final volume of 500 uL. The mixture of enzymes containing potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4), MgCl\n2 \n(5 mM), EDTA (100 μM), and compound or positive control are pre-incubated at 37° C. for 3 minutes. Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 8) is used for FMO3 incubation without pre-incubation. The reaction is then initiated by the addition of NADPH (final concentration: 1 mM) and incubated at 37° C. for 60 minutes.
