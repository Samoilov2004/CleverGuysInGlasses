It relates to novel buprenorphine analogs having activity as opioid receptor agonists. In certain embodiments compounds of the invention have dual activity as opioid agonists and ORL1 receptor antagonists.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nPain is the most common symptom for which patients seek medical advice and treatment. While acute pain is usually self-limited, chronic pain can persist for 3 months or longer and lead to significant changes in a patient's personality, lifestyle, functional ability and overall quality of life (K. M. Foley, Pain, in \nCecil Textbook of Medicine \n100-107, J. C. Bennett and F. Plum eds., 20th ed. 1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPain has traditionally been managed by administering either a non-opioid analgesic (such as acetylsalicylic acid, choline magnesium trisalicylate, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, fenoprofen, diflunisal or naproxen), or an opioid analgesic (such as morphine, hydromorphone, methadone, levorphanol, fentanyl, oxycodone or oxymorphone).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the term “narcotic” is often used to refer to opioids, the term is not specifically applicable to opioids. The term “narcotic”, derived from the Greek word for “stupor”, originally referred to any drug that induced sleep, only later being associated with opioids (Gutstein Howard B., Akil Huda, “Chapter 21. Opioid Analgesics” (Chapter 21), Brunton L L, Lazo J S, Parker K l: Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11\nth \nEdition: http://www.accessmedicine.com/contentaspx?aID=940653). In the legal context, the term “narcotic” refers to a variety of mechanistically unrelated substances with abuse or addictive potential (Gutstein Howard B., Akil Huda, “Chapter 21. Opioid Analgesics” (Chapter 21), Brunton L L, Lazo J S, Parker K l: Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11\nth \nEdition: http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?alD=940653). Thus, the term “narcotic” not only refers to opioids, but also refers to such drugs as cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, etc., which exert their pharmacological effects via different receptors than opioids. Furthermore, because the term “narcotic” refers to such a wide variety of unrelated drugs, many of which do not possess analgesic properties, it cannot be assumed that a drug that has “narcotic” properties is necessarily analgesic. For example, drugs such as ecstasy and methamphetamine are not analgesic, and are not used to treat pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUntil recently, there was evidence of three major classes of opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), with each class having subtype receptors. These receptor classes are known as μ, δ and κ. As opiates have a high affinity to these receptors while not being endogenous to the body, research followed in order to identify and isolate the endogenous ligands to these receptors. These ligands were identified as endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins, respectively. Additional experimentation has led to the identification of the opioid receptor-like (ORL-1) receptor, which has a high degree of homology to the known receptor classes. This newly discovered receptor was classified as an opioid receptor based only on structural grounds, as the receptor did not exhibit pharmacological homology. It was initially demonstrated that non-selective ligands having a high affinity for μ, δ and κ receptors had low affinity for the ORL-1 receptor. This characteristic, along with the fact that an endogenous ligand had not yet been discovered, led to the ORL-1 receptor being designated as an “orphan receptor”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubsequent research led to the isolation and structure of the endogenous ligand of the ORL-1 receptor. This ligand, nociceptin (also known as orphanin FQ (OFQ)), is a seventeen amino acid peptide structurally similar to members of the opioid peptide family. (C. Altier et al., “ORL1 receptor-mediated internalization of N-type calcium channels.” \nNature Neuroscience, \n2005, 9:31).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe discovery of the ORL-1 receptor, and its endogenous agonist, presents an opportunity for the discovery of novel compounds that can be administered for pain management or other syndromes influenced by this receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany publications in the ORL-1/nociceptin field provide evidence that activation of ORL-1 receptors in the brain can inhibit opioid-mediated analgesia (e.g., D. Barlocco et al., “The opioid-receptor-like 1 (ORL-1) as a potential target for new analgesics.” \nEur. J. Med. Chem., \n2000, 35:275; J. S. Mogil et al., “Orphanin FQ is a functional anti-opioid peptide.” \nNeurosci., \n1996, 75:333; K. Lutfy et al., “Tolerance develops to the inhibitory effect of orphanin FQ on morphine-induced antinociception in the rat.” \nNeuroReport, \n1999, 10:103; M. M. Morgan et al., “Antinociception mediated by the periaqueductal gray is attenuated by orphanin FQ.” \nNeuroReport, \n1997, 8:3431; and J. Tian et al., “Involvement of endogenous Orphanin FQ in electroacupuncture-induced analgesia.” \nNeuroReport, \n1997, 8:497).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA growing body of evidence supports a more generalized regulatory role for ORL-1 against the actions of the μ receptor, possibly contributing to the development of μ-agonist tolerance in patients being treated with classical opiates (e.g., J. Tian et al., “Functional studies using antibodies against orphanin FQ/nociceptin.” \nPeptides, \n2000, 21:1047; and H. Ueda et al., “Enhanced Spinal Nociceptin Receptor Expression Develops Morphine Tolerance and Dependence.” \nJ. Neurosci., \n2000, 20:7640). Moreover, ORL-1 activation appears to have an inhibitory effect on the rewarding properties of several drugs of abuse, including μ agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds have been described as at least partial agonists for ORL-1 (e.g., buprenorphine (IC\n50 \nof 8.4 nM), fentanyl (IC\n50 \nof about 10,000 nM), 7-benzylidenenaltrexone (IC\n50 \nabout 10,000 nM) (S. Wnendt et al., “Agonistic effect of buprenorphine in a nociceptin/OFQ receptor-triggered reporter gene assay.” \nMolec. Pharmacol., \n1999, 56:334-338), and etorphine (IC\n50 \nof about 2000 nM) (Hawkinson et al., “Opioid activity profiles indicate similarities between the nociceptin/orphanin FQ and opioid receptors.” \nEur. J. Pharmacol, \n2000, 389:107-114)). However, buprenorphine's μ potency is disclosed to be much greater than its ORL-1 potency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent data have shown that the analgesic efficacy of buprenorphine is enhanced by pre-treatment with an ORL-1 receptor antagonist. Using the tail-flick test in mice, Lutfy et al. demonstrated that buprenorphine's typical bell-shaped dose-response curve (wherein low and high doses induce little analgesia, and mid-range doses produce maximal analgesia) is eliminated by pre-treatment with the ORL-1 antagonist J-113397, and analgesic efficacy is improved at the higher range of doses (K. Lutfy et al., “Buprenorphine-induced antinociception is mediated by mu-opioid receptors and compromised by concomitant activation of opioid receptor-like receptors.” \nJ. Neurosci., \n2003, 23:10331-10337).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, a multidisciplinary group of experts in the fields of pharmacology, toxicology, pain management, and anesthesia have recommended buprenorphine as the best opioid for treating chronic severe pain in elderly patients (Pergolizzi, et al. (2008). Opioids and the Management of Chronic Severe Pain in the Elderly: Consensus Statement of an International Expert Panel with Focus on the Six Clinically Most Often Used World Health Organization step III Opioids (buprenorphine, Fentanyl, Hydromorphone, Methadone, Morphine, Oxycodone. \nPain Practice \n8(4): 287-313). It was found that of the opioids studied, buprenorphine provided the best analgesic- to-side effect profile. Buprenorphine was the most effective opioid for treating neuropathic pain. Buprenorphine was the only opioid for which metabolism was not affected by impaired renal function. Buprenorphine was the only opioid demonstrating a ceiling effect for respiratory depression, indicating that higher doses may be used. Also, buprenorphine was the least likely to induce immunosuppression. The panel of experts attributed the improved therapeutic efficacy of buprenorphine to its unique pharmacological profile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBuprenorphine has also been shown to have an improved side effect profile in animal models. A review of recent data in animal models of reward and addiction has shown that buprenorphine has a low addictive and dependence-inducing profile compared to other opioids (Tzschentike (2002). Behavioral pharmacology of buprenorphine, with a focus on preclinical models of reward and addiction. \nPsychopharmacology \n161: 1-16.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel buprenorphine analog compounds useful for treating a variety of conditions, including pain, in particular chronic pain.

and Shinkai et al., “4-aminoquinolines: Novel nociceptin antagonists with analgesic activity”, \nJ. Med. Chem., \n2000, 43:4667-4677) and J-113397 (described in WO 98/54168; and Kawamoto et al., “Discovery of the first potent and selective small molecule opioid receptor-like (ORL1) antagonist: 1-[(3R,4R)-1-cyclooctylmethyl-3-hydroxymethyl-4-piperidyl]-3-ethyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one (J-113397)”, \nJ. Med. Chem., \n1999, 42:5061-6063).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain Compounds of the Invention have agonist activity at the μ, δ and/or κ receptors which is greater than currently available compounds, e.g., morphine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain Compounds of the Invention have both: (i) antagonist activity at the ORL-1 receptor; and (ii) agonist activity at one or more of the μ, δ and/or κ receptors. Certain\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the Invention have both: (i) antagonist activity at the ORL-1 receptor; and (ii) agonist activity at the μ receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the Invention may be useful as analgesics; anti-inflammatories; diuretics; anesthetics; neuroprotective agents; anti-hypertensives; anxiolytics; agents for appetite control; hearing regulators; anti-tussives; anti-asthmatics; anti-epileptics; anti-convulsants; modulators of locomotor activity; modulators of learning and memory; regulators of neurotransmitter release; modulators of hormone release; kidney function modulators; anti-depressants; agents to treat memory loss due to Alzheimer's disease or other dementias; agents to treat withdrawal from alcohol and/or drugs of addiction; or agents to control water balance, sodium excretion, arterial blood pressure disorders, UI, ulcers, IBD, IBS, addictive disorders, Parkinson's disease, parkinsonism, anxiety, epilepsy, stroke, a seizure, pruritic conditions, psychosis, cognitive disorders, memory deficits, restricted brain function, Huntington's chorea, ALS, dementia, retinopathy, muscle spasms, migraines, vomiting, dyskinesia, and/or depression (each being a “Condition”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides methods for treating a Condition, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a Compound of the Invention. In certain embodiments, the Condition is chronic or acute pain. The Compounds of the Invention are particularly useful for treating chronic pain. In certain embodiments, the Compound of the Invention is an ORL-1 receptor antagonist. In other embodiments, the Compound of the Invention is an agonist at one or more of the μ, δ and/or κ receptor. In other embodiments, the Compound of the Invention is both an ORL-1 receptor antagonist and an agonist at one or more of the μ, δ and/or κ receptor. In other embodiments, the Compound of the Invention is both an ORL-1 receptor antagonist and an agonist at the μ receptor. In certain non-limiting embodiments, the Compound of the Invention produces fewer side effects and/or less severe side effects than currently available analgesic opioid compounds when administered at doses producing equivalent levels of analgesia and/or anti-hyperalgesia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain non-limiting embodiments, the Compound of the Invention exhibits a substantially linear dose response curve, such that the bell-shaped dose response curve observed for most opioid analgesics (i.e. low and high doses do not produce significant analgesia, whereas mid-range doses produce analgesia) is not observed for the Compound of the Invention. It is expected, therefore, that it will be easier to titrate to an effective dose of the Compound of the Invention in a patient than it is for conventional opioid analgesics. It is further expected that the Compound of the Invention will produce effective analgesia and/or anti-hyperalgesia in a patient who has become tolerant to conventional opioids, and for whom a conventional opioid is no longer an effective treatment. It is further expected that a Compound of the Invention will produce effective analgesia and/or anti-hyperalgesia at doses that do not induce side effects such as respiratory depression in patients for whom a dose of a conventional opioid that is high enough to be an effective treatment also induces significant side effects such as respiratory depression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides methods for preventing a Condition, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof a Condition-preventing effective amount of a Compound of the Invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a Compound of the Invention admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Such compositions are useful for treating or preventing a Condition in an animal. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be formulated as immediate release formulations, or as controlled release formulations. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be formulated for administration by any of a number of different routes known in the art, including but not limited to, oral, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, parenteral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, transmucosal, rectal, by inhalation, or topical (particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides methods for preparing a composition, comprising the step of admixing a Compound of the Invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient to form a pharmaceutical composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention still further relates to a kit comprising a container containing an effective amount of a Compound of the Invention.\n\n\n \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n shows oxygen tension in collected blood samples as a measure of respiration in rats prior to drug administration (baseline), and 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours following administration of either water, 30 mg/kg of morphine, or 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of \ncompound\n 11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n shows oxygen saturation in collected blood samples as a measure of respiration in rats prior to drug administration (baseline), and 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours following administration of either water, 30 mg/kg of morphine, or 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of \ncompound\n 11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n shows carbon dioxide tension in collected blood samples as a measure of respiration in rats prior to drug administration (baseline), and 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours following administration of either water, 30 mg/kg of morphine, or 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of \ncompound\n 11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n shows total carbon dioxide (including bicarbonate) in collected blood samples as a measure of respiration in rats prior to drug administration (baseline), and 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours following administration of either water, 30 mg/kg of morphine, or 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of \ncompound\n 11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n shows blood pH in collected blood samples as a measure of respiration in rats prior to drug administration (baseline), and 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours following administration of either water, 30 mg/kg of morphine, or 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of \ncompound\n 11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 6\n shows oxygen tension in collected blood samples as a measure of respiration in rats prior to drug administration (baseline), and 1, 3, and 5 hours following administration of either water, 30 mg/kg of morphine, or 3, 10 or 200 mg/kg of \ncompound\n 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 7\n shows oxygen saturation in collected blood samples as a measure of respiration in rats prior to drug administration (baseline), and 1, 3, and 5 hours following administration of either water, 30 mg/kg of morphine, or 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of \ncompound\n 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 8\n shows carbon dioxide tension in collected blood samples as a measure of respiration in rats prior to drug administration (baseline), and 1, 3, and 5 hours following administration of either water, 30 mg/kg of morphine, or 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of \ncompound\n 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 9\n shows total carbon dioxide (including bicarbonate) in collected blood samples as a measure of respiration in rats prior to drug administration (baseline), and 1, 3, and 5 hours following administration of either water, 30 mg/kg of morphine, or 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of \ncompound\n 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 10\n shows blood pH in collected blood samples as a measure of respiration in rats prior to drug administration (baseline), and 1, 3, and 5 hours following administration of either water, 30 mg/kg of morphine, or 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg of compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 11\n shows MPE (% reversal) of mechanical hyperalgesia, compared to pre-drug (pre-administration PWT), 1, 3 and 5 hours after administration of either 30 mg/kg indomethacin, or 1, 3 or 10 mg/\nkg compound\n 11, in rats given an intraplantar injection of FCA.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Compounds of the Invention are novel buprenorphine analogs. They are useful for treating one or more Conditions, such as pain. Compounds of the Invention may provide a reduced liability for developing analgesic tolerance and physical dependence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Compounds of the Invention are useful for modulating a pharmacodynamic response from ORL-1 receptors either centrally or peripherally, or both. The Compounds of the Invention may also be useful for modulating a pharmacodynamic response from one or more opioid receptors (μ, δ, κ) either centrally or peripherally, or both. The pharmacodynamic response may be attributed to the compound stimulating (agonizing) or inhibiting (antagonizing) the one or more receptors. Certain Compounds of the Invention may inhibit (or antagonize) the ORL-1 receptor, while also stimulating (or agonizing) one or more other receptors (e.g. as a μ, δ and/or κ agonist). Compounds of the Invention having agonist activity may be either full or partial agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, Compounds of the Invention can be used in combination with at least one other therapeutic agent.

(J. G. Hardman, L. E. Limbird and A. Goodman-Gilman eds., 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the Invention can be in the form of prodrugs of the compounds of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III. Prodrugs are covalently bonded carrier molecules that release an active compound of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III in vivo. Non-limiting examples of prodrugs will typically include esters of the Compounds of the Invention that can be metabolized to the active compound by the action of enzymes in the body. Such prodrugs may be prepared by reacting a compound of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III with an anhydride such as succinic anhydride.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the Invention can be isotopically-labeled (i.e., radio-labeled). Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the disclosed compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n11\nC, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF and \n36\nCl, respectively, and preferably \n3\nH, \n11\nC, and \n14\nC. Isotopically-labeled Compounds of the Invention can be prepared by methods known in the art in view of this disclosure. For example, tritiated Compounds of the Invention can be prepared by introducing tritium into the particular compound by catalytic dehalogenation with tritium. This method may include reacting a suitable halogen-substituted precursor of a Compound of the Invention with tritium gas in the presence of an appropriate catalyst such as Pd/C in the presence of a base. Other suitable methods for preparing tritiated compounds are generally described in Filer, Isotopes in the Physical and Biomedical Sciences, Vol. 1, Labeled Compounds (Part A), Chapter 6 (1987). \n14\nC-labeled compounds can be prepared by employing starting materials having a \n14\nC carbon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsotopically labeled Compounds of the Invention, as well as the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs and solvates thereof, can be used as radioligands to test for the binding of compounds to an opioid or ORL-1 receptor. For example, a radio-labeled Compound of the Invention can be used to characterize specific binding of a test or candidate compound to the receptor. Binding assays utilizing such radio-labeled compounds can provide an alternative to animal testing for the evaluation of chemical structure-activity relationships. In a non-limiting embodiment, the present invention provides a method for screening a candidate compound for the ability to bind to an opioid or ORL-1 receptor, comprising the steps of: a) introducing a fixed concentration of the radio-labeled compound to the receptor under conditions that permit binding of the radio-labeled compound to the receptor to form a complex; b) titrating the complex with a candidate compound; and c) determining the binding of the candidate compound to said receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the Invention disclosed herein may contain one or more asymmetric centers, thus giving rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms. The present invention encompasses all such possible forms, as well as their racemic and resolved forms and mixtures thereof, and the uses thereof. The individual enantiomers may be separated according to methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, they include both E and Z geometric isomers. All tautomers are intended to be encompassed by the present invention as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “stereoisomer” is a general term for all isomers of individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. It includes enantiomers and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral center that are not mirror images of one another (diastereoisomers).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “chiral center” refers to a carbon atom to which four different groups are attached.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “enantiomer” and “enantiomeric” refer to a molecule that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image and hence is optically active such that the enantiomer rotates the plane of polarized light in one direction and its mirror image compound rotates the plane of polarized light in the opposite direction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “racemic” refers to a mixture of equal parts of enantiomers and which mixture is optically inactive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “resolution” refers to the separation or concentration or depletion of one of the two enantiomeric forms of a molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “a” and “an” refer to one or more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the Invention encompass all salts of the disclosed compounds of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III. The present invention preferably includes any and all non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the disclosed compounds. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include inorganic and organic acid addition salts and basic salts. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, metal salts such as sodium salt, potassium salt, cesium salt, and the like; alkaline earth metals such as calcium salt, magnesium salt and the like; organic amine salts such as triethylamine salt, pyridine salt, picoline salt, ethanolamine salt, triethanolamine salt, dicylohexylamine salt, N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine salt and the like; inorganic acid salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, sulphate and the like; organic acid salts such as citrate, lactate, tartrate, maleate, fumarate, mandelate, acetate, dichloroacetate, trifluoroacetate, oxalate, formate and the like; sulfonates such as methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and the like; and amino acid salts such as arginate, glutamate and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcid addition salts can be formed by mixing a solution of the particular compound of the present invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acid such as hydrochloric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid, phosphoric acid, oxalic acid, dichloroacetic acid, and the like. Basic salts can be formed by mixing a solution of the particular compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, choline hydroxide, sodium carbonate and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the Invention also encompass solvates of the disclosed compounds of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III. The term “solvate” as used herein is a combination, physical association and/or solvation of a compound of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III with a solvent molecule such as, e.g. a disolvate, monosolvate or hemisolvate, where the ratio of solvent molecule to compound of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III is 2:1, 1:1 or 1:2, respectively. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances, the solvate can be isolated, such as when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated into the crystal lattice of a crystalline solid. Thus, “solvate” encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. A compound of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III or may be present as a solvated form with a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as water, methanol, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention include both solvated and unsolvated forms of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III compounds. One type of solvate is a hydrate. A “hydrate” relates to a particular subgroup of solvates where the solvent molecule is water. Solvates typically can function as pharmacological equivalents. Preparation of solvates is known in the art. See, for example, M. Caira et al, \nJ. Pharmaceut. Sci., \n93(3):601-611 (2004), which describes the preparation of solvates of fluconazole with ethyl acetate and with water. Similar preparation of solvates, hemisolvates, hydrates, and the like are described by E. C. van Tonder et al., \nAAPS Pharm. Sci. Tech., \n5(1):Article 12 (2004), and A. L. Bingham et al., \nChem. Commun., \n603-604 (2001). A typical, non-limiting, process of preparing a solvate would involve dissolving a compound of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III in a desired solvent (organic, water, or a mixture thereof) at temperatures above about 20° C. to about 25° C., then cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals, and isolating the crystals by known methods, e.g., filtration. Analytical techniques such as infrared spectroscopy can be used to confirm the presence of the solvent in a crystal of the solvate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides the use of a Compound of the Invention in the manufacture of a medicament for treating or preventing a Condition. In one embodiment, the Condition is pain, such as acute or chronic pain. In one embodiment, a Compound of the Invention has agonist activity at the μ, δ and/or κ receptors. In another embodiment a Compound of the Invention has agonist activity at the μ receptor. In another embodiment, a Compound of the Invention has antagonist activity at the ORL-1 receptor. In another embodiment, certain Compounds of the invention can stimulate one receptor (e.g., a μ, δ and/or κ agonist) and inhibit a different receptor (e.g., an ORL-1 antagonist). In another embodiment, the Compound of the Invention is an agonist at the μ receptor, and an antagonist at the ORL-1 receptor.\n\n\n \nSynthesis of Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III can be made using conventional organic synthesis in view of this disclosure, or by the illustrative methods shown in the scheme below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nThebaine, A, is N-demethylated by reaction with a suitable reagent such as diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile (ACN) at 50-100° C. to provide the secondary amine B.

(e.g. Rice, K. C., et al. \nJ. Org. Chem., \n1996, 61, 6774) to provide the phenol H (R═H). The phenolic group of H is protected with a suitable protecting group (P) to give H (R═P) (e.g. Greene, T.

Compound M (R═P) is prepared by reaction of compound L with an alkyl halide in a suitable solvent such as DMF in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride. Removal of the protecting group (P) in compound M (R═P) is achieved according to literature procedure (e.g. Greene, T. W. “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, J. Wiley & Sons, NY, 1981) to give compound M (R═H).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nCompound C is O-demethylated and the resulting phenolic group protected with a suitable protecting group (P) to give J according to the procedure shown in Scheme B (A→H).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nCompound N is prepared from compound L via a Mitsunobu reaction (Hughes, D.

In other embodiments, the Compounds of the Invention will have a Ki (nM) of about 300 or less; or of about 100 or less; or of about 50 or less; or of about 20 or less. In yet other embodiments, the Compounds of the Invention will have a Ki (nM) of about 10 or less; or of about 1 or less; or of about 0.1 or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nORL-1 Receptor Functional Assay Procedure: Membranes from recombinant HEK-293 cells expressing the human opioid receptor-like (ORL-1) (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.) were prepared by lysing cells in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (2.5 mM Mg Cl\n2\n, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) (10 ml/10 cm dish) followed by homogenization with a tissue grinder/Teflon pestle. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 30,000×g for 15 min at 4° C., and pellets resuspended in hypotonic buffer to a final concentration of 1-3 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumen as standard. Aliquots of the ORL-1 receptor membranes were stored at −80° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFunctional [\n35\nS]GTPγS binding assays were conducted as follows. ORL-1 membrane solution was prepared by sequentially adding final concentrations of 0.026 μg/μl ORL-1 membrane protein, 10 μg/ml saponin, 3 μM GDP and 0.20 nM [\n35\nS]GTPγS to binding buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) on ice. The prepared membrane solution (190 μl/well) was transferred to 96-shallow well polypropylene plates containing 10 μl of 20× concentrated stock solutions of agonist/nociceptin prepared in DMSO. Plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with shaking. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96-well Unifilter GF/B filter plates (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.) using a 96-well tissue harvester (Packard) and followed by three filtration washes with 200 μl ice-cold binding buffer (10 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 10 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, pH 7.4). Filter plates were subsequently dried at 50° C. for 2-3 hours. Fifty μl/well scintillation cocktail (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.) was added and plates were counted in a Packard Top-Count for 1 min/well. Data were analyzed using the sigmoidal dose-response curve fitting functions in GraphPad PRISM v. 3.0, or an in-house function for non-linear, sigmoidal dose-response curve-fitting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nORL-1 Receptor Functional Data: ORL-1 GTP EC\n50 \nis the concentration of a compound providing 50% of the maximal response for the compound at an ORL-1 receptor. In certain embodiments, the Compounds of the Invention that have a high binding affinity (i.e. low K\ni \nvalue) will have an ORL-1 GTP EC\n50 \n(nM) of greater than about 10,000 (i.e. will not stimulate at therapeutic concentrations) In certain embodiments Compounds of the Invention will have an ORL-1 GTP EC\n50 \n(nM) of about 20,000 or less. In one embodiment, the Compounds of the Invention will have an ORL-1 GTP EC\n50 \n(nM) of about 10,000 or less; or of about 5000 or less; or of about 1000 or less. In still other embodiments, the Compounds of the Invention will have an ORL-1 GTP EC\n50 \n(nM) of about 100 or less; or of about 10 or less; or of about 1 or less; or of about 0.1 or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nORL-1 GTP E\nmax\n% is the maximal effect elicited by a compound relative to the effect elicited by nociceptin, a standard ORL-1 agonist. In certain embodiments, Compounds of the Invention will have an ORL-1 GTP E\nmax \nof less than 10% (which, for the purposes of this invention, is interpreted as having antagonist activity at ORL-1 receptors). Certain Compounds of the Invention will have an ORL-1 GTP E\nmax \n(%) of greater than 1%; or of greater than 5%; or of greater than 10%. In other embodiments the Compounds of the Invention will have an ORL-1 GTP E\nmax \nof greater than 20%; or of greater than 50%; or of greater than 75%; or of greater than 88%; or of greater than 100%.\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Assays for Prevention or Treatment of Pain\n\n\n \n \n \nTest Animals: Each experiment uses rats weighing between 200-260 g at the start of the experiment. The rats are group-housed and have free access to food and water at all times, except prior to oral administration of a Compound of the Invention when food is removed for about 16 hours before dosing. A control group acts as a comparison to rats treated with a Compound of the Invention. The control group is administered the carrier for the Compound of the Invention. The volume of carrier administered to the control group is the same as the volume of carrier and Compound of the Invention administered to the test group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcute Pain: To assess the actions of a Compound of the Invention for the treatment or prevention of acute pain, the rat tail flick test can be used. Rats are gently restrained by hand and the tail exposed to a focused beam of radiant heat at a \npoint\n 5 cm from the tip using a tail flick unit (Model 7360, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy). Tail flick latencies are defined as the interval between the onset of the thermal stimulus and the flick of the tail. Animals not responding within 20 seconds are removed from the tail flick unit and assigned a withdrawal latency of 20 seconds. Tail flick latencies are measured immediately before (pre-treatment) and 1, 3, and 5 hours following administration of a Compound of the Invention. Data are expressed as tail flick latency(s) and the percentage of the maximal possible effect (% MPE), i.e., 20 seconds, is calculated as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMPE\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\npost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadministration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlatency\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\npre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadministration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlatency\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadministration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlatency\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rat tail flick test is described in F. E. D'Amour et al., “A Method for Determining Loss of Pain Sensation,” \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n72:74-79 (1941).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInflammatory Pain: To assess the actions of a Compound of the Invention for the treatment or prevention of inflammatory pain, the Freund's complete adjuvant (“FCA”) model of inflammatory pain was used. FCA-induced inflammation of the rat hind paw is associated with the development of persistent inflammatory mechanical hyperalgesia and provides reliable prediction of the anti-hyperalgesic action of clinically useful analgesic drugs (L. Bartho et al., “Involvement of Capsaicin-sensitive Neurones in Hyperalgesia and Enhanced Opioid Antinociception in Inflammation,” \nNaunyn\n-\nSchmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacol. \n342:666-670 (1990)). The left hind paw of each animal was administered a 50 pt intraplantar injection of 50% FCA. Prior to injection of FCA (baseline) and 24 hour post injection, the animal was assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining the PWT, as described below. Rats were then administered a single injection of 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg of either a Compound of the Invention; 30 mg/kg of a control drug selected from Celebrex, indomethacin or naproxen; or carrier. Responses to noxious mechanical stimuli were determined 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours post administration.

For example, \nCompound\n 11 had an ED\n50 \nof 3.6 mg/kg, and no side effects were observed at this dose (see \nFIG. 11\n). At the analgesic (i.e. more than anti-hyperalgesic) dose of 10 mg/kg rats showed slightly reduced activity, but remained alert and oriented to changes in their environment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeuropathic Pain: To assess the actions of a Compound of the Invention for the treatment or prevention of neuropathic pain, either the Seltzer model or the Chung model can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the Seltzer model, the partial sciatic nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain is used to produce neuropathic hyperalgesia in rats (Z. Seltzer et al., “A Novel Behavioral Model of Neuropathic Pain Disorders Produced in Rats by Partial Sciatic Nerve Injury,” \nPain \n43:205-218 (1990)). Partial ligation of the left sciatic nerve is performed under isoflurane/O\n2 \ninhalation anaesthesia. Following induction of anesthesia, the left thigh of the rat is shaved and the sciatic nerve exposed at high thigh level through a small incision and is carefully cleared of surrounding connective tissues at a site near the trocanther just distal to the point at which the posterior biceps semitendinosus nerve branches off of the common sciatic nerve. A 7-0 silk suture is inserted into the nerve with a ⅜ curved, reversed-cutting mini-needle and tightly ligated so that the dorsal ⅓ to ½ of the nerve thickness is held within the ligature. The wound is closed with a single muscle suture (4-0 nylon (Vicryl)) and vetbond tissue glue. Following surgery, the wound area is dusted with antibiotic powder. Sham-treated rats undergo an identical surgical procedure except that the sciatic nerve is not manipulated. Following surgery, animals are weighed and placed on a warm pad until they recover from anesthesia. Animals are then returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animal is assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, prior to surgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1, 3, and 5 hours after drug administration.

Surgery is performed under isoflurane/O\n2 \ninhalation anaesthesia. Following induction of anaesthesia, a 3 cm incision is made and the left paraspinal muscles are separated from the spinous process at the L\n4\n-S\n2 \nlevels. The L\n6 \ntransverse process is carefully removed with a pair of small rongeurs to identify visually the L\n4\n-L\n6 \nspinal nerves. The left L\n5 \n(or L\n5 \nand L\n6\n) spinal nerve(s) is isolated and tightly ligated with silk thread. A complete hemostasis is confirmed and the wound is sutured using non-absorbable sutures, such as nylon sutures or stainless steel staples. Sham-treated rats undergo an identical surgical procedure except that the spinal nerve(s) is not manipulated. Following surgery animals are weighed, administered a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of saline or ringers lactate, the wound area is dusted with antibiotic powder and they are kept on a warm pad until they recover from the anesthesia. Animals are then returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animals are assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, prior to surgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1, 3, and 5 hours after being administered a Compound of the Invention. The animal can also be assessed for response to noxious thermal stimuli or for tactile allodynia, as described below. The Chung model for neuropathic pain is described in S. H. Kim, “An Experimental Model for Peripheral Neuropathy Produced by Segmental Spinal Nerve Ligation in the Rat,” \nPain \n50(3):355-363 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResponse to Mechanical Stimuli as an Assessment of Mechanical Hyperalgesia: The paw pressure assay was used to assess mechanical hyperalgesia. For this assay, hind paw withdrawal thresholds (PWT) to a noxious mechanical stimulus were determined using an analgesymeter (Model 7200, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy) as described in C. Stein, “Unilateral Inflammation of the Hindpaw in Rats as a Model of Prolonged Noxious Stimulation: Alterations in Behavior and Nociceptive Thresholds,” \nPharmacol. Biochem. and Behavior \n31:451-455 (1988). The maximum weight that was applied to the hind paw was set at 250 g and the end point was taken as complete withdrawal of the paw. PWT was determined once for each rat at each time point and either only the affected (ipsilateral; same side as the injury) rear paw was tested, or both the ipsilateral and contralateral (non-injured; opposite to the injury) rear paw were tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResponse to Thermal Stimuli as an Assessment of Thermal Hyperalgesia: The plantar test can be used to assess thermal hyperalgesia. For this test, hind paw withdrawal latencies to a noxious thermal stimulus are determined using a plantar test apparatus (commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy) following the technique described by K. Hargreaves et al., “A New and Sensitive Method for Measuring Thermal Nociception in Cutaneous Hyperalgesia,” \nPain \n32(1):77-88 (1988). The maximum exposure time is set at 32 seconds to avoid tissue damage and any directed paw withdrawal from the heat source is taken as the end point. Three latencies are determined at each time point and averaged. Either only the affected (ipsilateral) paw is tested, or both the ipsilateral and contralateral (non-injured) paw are tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssessment of Tactile Allodynia: To assess tactile allodynia, rats are placed in clear, plexiglass compartments with a wire mesh floor and allowed to habituate for a period of at least 15 minutes. After habituation, a series of von Frey monofilaments are presented to the plantar surface of the affected (ipsilateral) foot of each rat. The series of von Frey monofilaments consists of six monofilaments of increasing diameter, with the smallest diameter fiber presented first. Five trials are conducted with each filament with each trial separated by approximately 2 minutes. Each presentation lasts for a period of 4-8 seconds or until a nociceptive withdrawal behavior is observed. Flinching, paw withdrawal or licking of the paw are considered nociceptive behavioral responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssessment of Respiratory Depression: To assess respiratory depression, rats were prepared by implanting a femoral artery cannula via which blood samples were taken. Blood samples were taken prior to drug administration, then 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours post-treatment. Blood samples were processed using an arterial blood gas analyzer (e.g., IDEXX VetStat with Respiratory/Blood Gas test cartridges). Comparable devices are a standard tool for blood gas analysis (e.g., D. Torbati et al., 2000 \nIntensive Care Med. \n(26) 585-591). For example, \ncompound\n 11 did not induce respiratory depression at the ED\n50 \ndose for anti-hyperalgesia, nor did it induce respiratory depression at a higher dose that was shown to be analgesic (10 mg/kg) in the FCA model of inflammatory pain (see \nFIGS. 1 to 5\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following tables show the statistical analysis of the blood gas measurements in drug-treated rats,

Gastric Motility: Animals were treated with vehicle, reference compound or test article by oral gavage at a volume of 10 mL/kg. At one hour post-dose, all animals were treated with charcoal meal solution (5% non-activated charcoal powder in a solution of 1% carboxymethylcellulose in water) at a volume of 10 mL/kg. At two hours post-dose (one hour post-charcoal), animals were sacrificed by carbon dioxide inhalation or isoflurane overdose and the transit of charcoal meal identified. The stomach and small intestine were removed carefully and each placed on a saline-soaked absorbent surface. The distance between the pylorus and the furthest progression of charcoal meal was measured and compared to the distance between the pylorus and the ileocecal junction. The charcoal meal transit was expressed as a percentage of small intestinal length traveled. For example, \ncompound\n 11 induced dose-dependent inhibition of gastric motility.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nDue to their activity, the Compounds of the Invention are advantageously useful in human and veterinary medicine. As described above, the Compounds of the Invention are useful for treating or preventing a Condition in an animal in need thereof. The Compounds of the Invention can be administered to any animal requiring modulation of the opioid and/or ORL-1 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen administered to an animal, a Compound of the Invention can be administered as a component of a composition that comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. A Compound of the Invention can be administered by any appropriate route, as determined by the medical practitioner. Methods of administration may include intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, parenteral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, transmucosal, rectal, by inhalation, or topical (particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin). Delivery can be either local or systemic. In certain embodiments, administration will result in the release of a Compound of the Invention into the bloodstream.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the invention can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets, pills, pellets, multi-particulates, capsules, capsules containing liquids, capsules containing powders, capsules containing multi-particulates, lozenges, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, aerosols, sprays, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the composition is in the form of a capsule (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical excipients are described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., 19th ed. 1995), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the invention preferably comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient so as to provide the form for proper administration to the animal. Such a pharmaceutical excipient can be a diluent, suspending agent, solubilizer, binder, disintegrant, preservative, coloring agent, lubricant, and the like. The pharmaceutical excipient can be a liquid, such as water or an oil, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. The pharmaceutical excipient can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating, and coloring agents can be used. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is sterile when administered to an animal. Water is a particularly useful excipient when a Compound of the Invention is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid excipients, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients also include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The invention compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. Specific examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients that can be used to formulate oral dosage forms are described in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, American Pharmaceutical Association (1986).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the Compounds of the Invention are formulated for oral administration. A Compound of the Invention to be orally delivered can be in the form of tablets, capsules, gelcaps, caplets, lozenges, aqueous or oily solutions, suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, for example. When a Compound of the Invention is incorporated into oral tablets, such tablets can be compressed, tablet triturates, enteric-coated, sugar-coated, film-coated, multiply compressed or multiply layered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn orally administered Compound of the Invention can contain one or more additional agents such as, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, and stabilizers, to provide stable, pharmaceutically palatable dosage forms. Techniques and compositions for making solid oral dosage forms are described in \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets \n(Lieberman, Lachman and Schwartz, eds., 2nd ed.) published by Marcel Dekker, Inc. Techniques and compositions for making tablets (compressed and molded), capsules (hard and soft gelatin) and pills are also described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n1553-1593 (Arthur Osol, ed., 16\nth \ned., Mack Publishing, Easton, Pa. 1980). Liquid oral dosage forms include aqueous and nonaqueous solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and solutions and/or suspensions reconstituted from non-effervescent granules, optionally containing one or more suitable solvents, preservatives, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, diluents, sweeteners, coloring agents, flavoring agents, and the like. Techniques and compositions for making liquid oral dosage forms are described in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems, (Lieberman, Rieger and Banker, eds.) published by Marcel Dekker, Inc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a Compound of the Invention is formulated for parenteral administration by injection (e.g., continuous infusion or bolus injection), the formulation can be in the form of a suspension, solution, or emulsion in an oily or aqueous vehicle, and such formulations can further comprise pharmaceutically necessary additives such as one or more stabilizing agents, suspending agents, dispersing agents, and the like. When a Compound of the Invention is to be injected parenterally, it can be, e.g., in the form of an isotonic sterile solution. A Compound of the Invention can also be in the form of a powder for reconstitution as an injectable formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a Compound of the Invention is formulated into a pharmaceutical composition for intravenous administration. Typically, such compositions comprise sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions can also include a solubilizing agent. A Compound of the Invention for intravenous administration can optionally include a local anesthetic such as benzocaine or prilocalne to lessen pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where a Compound of the Invention is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where a Compound of the Invention is administered by injection, an ampule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a Compound of the Invention is to be administered by inhalation, it can be formulated into a dry aerosol, or an aqueous or partially aqueous solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a Compound of the Invention can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, \nScience \n249:1527-1533 (1990); and Treat et al., \nLiposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer \n317-327 and 353-365 (1989)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a Compound of the Invention is administered locally. This can be achieved, for example, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository or enema, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a Compound of the Invention can be delivered in an immediate release form. In other embodiments, a Compound of the Invention can be delivered in a controlled-release system or sustained-release system. Controlled- or sustained-release pharmaceutical compositions can have a common goal of improving drug therapy over the results achieved by their non-controlled or non-sustained-release counterparts. In one embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release composition comprises a minimal amount of a Compound of the Invention to treat or prevent the Condition (or a symptom thereof) in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled- or sustained-release compositions include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased compliance. In addition, controlled- or sustained-release compositions can favorably affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the Compound of the Invention, and can thus reduce the occurrence of adverse side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControlled- or sustained-release compositions can initially release an amount of a Compound of the Invention that promptly produces the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, and gradually and continually release other amounts of the Compound of the Invention to maintain a level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. To maintain a constant level of the Compound of the Invention in the body, the Compound of the Invention can be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of Compound of the Invention being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled- or sustained-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions, including but not limited to, changes in pH, changes in temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or availability of water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControlled-release and sustained-release means for use according to the present invention may be selected from those known in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; and 5,733,566, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide controlled- or sustained-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, multiparticulates, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled- or sustained-release formulations known in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active ingredients of the invention in view of this disclosure. See also Goodson, “Dental Applications” (pp. 115-138) in \nMedical Applications of Controlled Release, Vol. \n2\n, Applications and Evaluation\n, R. S. Langer and D. L. Wise eds., CRC Press (1984). Other controlled- or sustained-release systems that are discussed in the review by Langer, \nScience \n249:1527-1533 (1990) can be selected for use according to the present invention. In one embodiment, a pump can be used (Langer, \nScience \n249:1527-1533 (1990); Sefton, \nCRC Crit. Ref Biomed. Eng. \n14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., \nSurgery \n88:507 (1980); and Saudek et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (\nsee Medical Applications of Controlled Release \n(Langer and Wise eds., 1974); \nControlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance \n(Smolen and Ball eds., 1984); Ranger and Peppas, \nJ. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. \n23:61 (1983); Levy et al., \nScience \n228:190 (1985); During et al., \nAnn. Neurol. \n25:351 (1989); and Howard et al., \nJ. Neurosurg. \n71:105 (1989)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release system can be placed in proximity of a target of a Compound of the Invention, e.g., the spinal column, brain, or gastrointestinal tract, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen in tablet or pill form, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In these latter platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time-delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate can also be used. Oral compositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate. In one embodiment, the excipients are of pharmaceutical grade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the invention include single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled- or sustained-release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the Compound of the Invention that is effective for the treatment or prevention of a condition can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro and/or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed will also depend on, e.g., the route of administration and the extent of the Condition to be treated, and can be decided according to the judgment of a practitioner and/or each animal's circumstances. Variations in dosing may occur depending upon typical factors such as the weight, age, gender and physical condition (e.g., hepatic and renal function) of the animal being treated, the affliction to be treated, the severity of the symptoms, the frequency of the dosage interval, the presence of any deleterious side-effects, and the particular compound utilized, among other things.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable effective dosage amounts can range from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 3000 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day, although they are typically from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 2500 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day or from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 1000 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day. In one embodiment, the effective dosage amount is about 100 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day or less. In another embodiment, the effective dosage amount ranges from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 100 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day of a Compound of the Invention, in another embodiment, about 0.02 mg/kg of body weight to about 50 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day, and in another embodiment, about 0.025 mg/kg of body weight to about 20 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration can be as a single dose or as a divided dose. In one embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 24 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 12 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 8 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 6 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 4 h until the Condition is abated. The effective dosage amounts described herein refer to total amounts administered; that is, if more than one Compound of the Invention is administered, the effective dosage amounts correspond to the total amount administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere a cell capable of expressing the ORL-1 receptor is contacted with a Compound of the Invention in vitro, the amount effective for inhibiting or activating the ORL-1 receptor function in a cell will typically range from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−4 \nmol/L, or from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about lemon, or from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−6 \nmol/L, or from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−9 \nmol/L of a solution or suspension of the compound in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In one embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension comprising the Compound of the Invention will be from about 0.01 μL to about 1 mL. In another embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension will be about 200 μL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere a cell capable of expressing the μ-opioid receptors is contacted with a Compound of the Invention in vitro, the amount effective for inhibiting or activating the μ-opioid receptors function in a cell will typically range from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−4 \nmol/L, or from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−5 \nmol/L, or from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−6 \nmol/L, or from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−9 \nmol/L of a solution or suspension of the Compound of the Invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In one embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension comprising the Compound of the Invention will be from about 0.01 μL to about 1 mL. In another embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension will be about 200 μL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere a cell capable of expressing the δ-opioid receptors is contacted with a Compound of the Invention in vitro, the amount effective for inhibiting or activating the δ-opioid receptors function in a cell will typically range from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−4 \nmol/L, or from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−5 \nmol/L, or from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−6 \nmol/L, or from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−9 \nmol/L of a solution or suspension of the Compound of the Invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In one embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension comprising the Compound of the Invention will be from about 0.01 μL to about 1 mL. In another embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension will be about 200 μL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere a cell capable of expressing the κ-opioid receptors is contacted with a Compound of the Invention in vitro, the amount effective for inhibiting or activating the κ-opioid receptors function in a cell will typically range from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−4 \nmol/L, or from about 10\n12 \nmol/L to about lemon, or from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−6 \nmol/L, or from about 10\n−12 \nmol/L to about 10\n−9 \nmol/L of a solution or suspension of the Compound of the Invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In one embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension comprising the Compound of the Invention will be from about 0.01 μL to about 1 mL. In another embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension will be about 200 μL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Compounds of the Invention can be assayed in vitro or in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity prior to use in humans. Animal model systems can be used to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Certain Compounds of the Invention will have an ED\n50 \nfor treating inflammatory pain ranging from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg. For example, \ncompound\n 11 was efficacious in an inflammatory pain model as described above, with an ED\n50 \nof about 3.6 mg/kg. Certain Compounds of the Invention will produce significant analgesia and/or anti-hyperalgesia at doses that do not induce respiratory depression. For example, at the anti-hyperalgesic ED\n50 \ndose, and at the higher analgesic dose of 10 mg/kg, the measures of blood gases (oxygen tension, oxygen saturation, carbon dioxide tension, total carbon dioxide and pH), at 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours following drug administration, were not different in rats given \ncompound\n 11 compared to rats given plain water. In contrast, oxygen tension, oxygen saturation and pH are significantly decreased, while carbon dioxide is significantly increased, in blood samples from rats given effective doses of conventional opioids, such as morphine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, methods for treating or preventing a Condition in an animal in need thereof can further comprise co-administering to the animal an effective amount of a second therapeutic agent in addition to a Compound of the Invention (i.e., a first therapeutic agent). An effective amount of the second therapeutic agent will be known or determinable by a medical practitioner in view of this disclosure and published clinical studies. In one embodiment of the invention, where a second therapeutic agent is administered to an animal for treatment of a Condition (e.g., pain), the minimal effective amount of the Compound of the Invention (i.e., the first therapeutic agent) will be less than its minimal effective amount would be in circumstances where the second therapeutic agent is not administered. In this embodiment, the Compound of the Invention and the second therapeutic agent can act either additively or synergistically to treat or prevent a Condition. Alternatively, the second therapeutic agent may be used to treat or prevent a disorder that is different from the Condition for which the first therapeutic agent is being administered, and which disorder may or may not be a Condition as defined hereinabove. In one embodiment, a Compound of the Invention is administered concurrently with a second therapeutic agent as a single composition comprising an effective amount of a Compound of the Invention and an effective amount of the second therapeutic agent. Alternatively, a composition comprising an effective amount of a Compound of the Invention and a second composition comprising an effective amount of the second therapeutic agent are concurrently administered. In another embodiment, an effective amount of a Compound of the Invention is administered prior or subsequent to administration of an effective amount of the second therapeutic agent. In this embodiment, the Compound of the Invention is administered while the second therapeutic agent exerts its therapeutic effect, or the second therapeutic agent is administered while the Compound of the Invention exerts its therapeutic effect for treating or preventing a Condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe second therapeutic agent can be, but is not limited to, an opioid agonist, a non-opioid analgesic, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, an antimigraine agent, a Cox-II inhibitor, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, an anti-emetic, a β-adrenergic blocker, an anticonvulsant, an antidepressant, a Ca\n2+\n-channel blocker, an anti-cancer agent, an agent for treating or preventing UI, an agent for treating or preventing anxiety, an agent for treating or preventing a memory disorder, an agent for treating or preventing obesity, an agent for treating or preventing constipation, an agent for treating or preventing cough, an agent for treating or preventing diarrhea, an agent for treating or preventing high blood pressure, an agent for treating or preventing epilepsy, an agent for treating or preventing anorexia/cachexia, an agent for treating or preventing drug abuse, an agent for treating or preventing an ulcer, an agent for treating or preventing IBD, an agent for treating or preventing IBS, an agent for treating or preventing addictive disorder, an agent for treating or preventing Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism, an agent for treating or preventing a stroke, an agent for treating or preventing a seizure, an agent for treating or preventing a pruritic condition, an agent for treating or preventing psychosis, an agent for treating or preventing Huntington's chorea, an agent for treating or preventing ALS, an agent for treating or preventing a cognitive disorder, an agent for treating or preventing a migraine, an agent for treating, preventing or inhibiting vomiting, an agent for treating or preventing dyskinesia, an agent for treating or preventing depression, or any mixture thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of useful opioid agonists include, but are not limited to, alfentanil, allylprodine, alphaprodine, anileridine, benzylmorphine, bezitramide, buprenorphine, butorphanol, clonitazene, codeine, desomorphine, dextromoramide, dezocine, diampromide, diamorphone, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, dimenoxadol, dimepheptanol, dimethylthiambutene, dioxaphetyl butyrate, dipipanone, eptazocine, ethoheptazine, ethylmethylthiambutene, ethylmorphine, etonitazene, fentanyl, heroin, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, hydroxypethidine, isomethadone, ketobemidone, levorphanol, levophenacylmorphan, lofentanil, meperidine, meptazinol, metazocine, methadone, metopon, morphine, myrophine, nalbuphine, narceine, nicomorphine, norlevorphanol, normethadone, nalorphine, normorphine, norpipanone, opium, oxycodone, oxymorphone, papavereturn, pentazocine, phenadoxone, phenomorphan, phenazocine, phenoperidine, piminodine, piritramide, proheptazine, promedol, properidine, propiram, propoxyphene, sufentanil, tilidine, tramadol, pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, or any mixture thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the opioid agonist is selected from codeine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, morphine, tramadol, oxymorphone, pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, or any mixture thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of useful non-opioid analgesics include, but are not limited to, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, benoxaprofen, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, flubufen, ketoprofen, indoprofen, piroprofen, carprofen, oxaprozin, pramoprofen, muroprofen, trioxaprofen, suprofen, aminoprofen, tiaprofenic acid, fluprofen, bucloxic acid, indomethacin, sulindac, tolmetin, zomepirac, tiopinac, zidometacin, acemetacin, fentiazac, clidanac, oxpinac, mefenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, flufenamic acid, niflumic acid, tolfenamic acid, diflurisal, flufenisal, piroxicam, sudoxicam, isoxicam, a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, or any mixture thereof.

Monitoring the reaction by TLC became difficult due to polymerization of crotonadehyde. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with 1N HCl solution (3×20 mL). Combined acidic aqueous layer was basified with 10% aqueous NaOH solution, extracted with chloroform, dried (Na\n2\nSO\n4\n), filtered and concentrated. The crude material was purified twice by flash chromatography (ISCO) eluting with gradient of 0-10% methanol in dichloromethane followed by several triturations with dichloromethane/hexanes gave mixture of two diastereomers (105 mg).
