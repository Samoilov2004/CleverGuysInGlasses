(\nKohler C, Hall H, Ogren SO and Gawell L, Specific in vitro and in vivo binding of 3H-raclopride. A potent substituted benzamide drug with high affinity for dopamine D-2 receptors in the rat brain. Biochem. Pharmacol., 1985; 34: 2251-2259\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWistar male rats were decapitated, the brain was retrieved immediately and corpus striatum was taken out. It was homogenized in 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4) of a volume 50 times of the weight of the tissue using a homogenizer with a high-speed rotating blade, and centrifuged at 4°C, 48,000 × g for 10 minutes. The obtained precipitate was suspended again in the above-described buffer of a volume 50 times of the weight of the tissue and after incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes, centrifuged in the above-described condition. The obtained precipitate was suspended in 50 mM (Tris)-hydrochloric acid buffer (containing 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, pH 7.4) of a volume 25 times of the weight of the tissue and preserved by freezing at -85°C till it was used for binding assay as a membrane specimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding assay was performed using 40 µl of the membrane specimen, 20 µl of [\n3\nH]-raclopride (final concentration 1 to 2 nM), 20 · µl of a test drug and 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (containing 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, pH 7.4) so that the total amount was 200 µl (final dimethylsulfoxide concentration 1%). The reaction was performed at room temperature for 1 hour and terminated by conducting suction filtration with a cell harvester on a glass fiber filter plate. The filter plate made of glass fiber was washed with 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.4), and after dried, a microplate liquid scintillation cocktail was added and the radioactivity was measured with a microplate scintillation counter.

Cells were seeded at 10\n4\n cells/well on a 96-well microtiter plate coated with poly-L-lysine and grown under the same condition for 2 days. Each well was washed with 100 µl of a culture medium (IMDM culture medium, 0.1 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 16 µM thymidine). The culture medium was replaced with 50 µl of culture medium (IMDM culture medium, 0.1% sodium ascorbate, 0.1 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 16 µM thymidine) having dissolved therein 3 µM of a test compound. After allowed to incubate at 37°C, 5% carbon dioxide condition for 20 minutes, the culture medium was replaced with 100 µl of forskolin stimulative culture medium (IMDM culture medium, 0.1% sodium ascorbate, 0.1 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 16 µM thymidine, 10 µM forskolin, 500 µM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) having 3 µM of the test compound dissolved therein and allowed to incubate at 37°C, 5% carbon dioxide condition for 10 minutes. After the culture medium was removed, 200 µl of Lysis 1B aqueous solution (Amersham Bioscience, reagent attached to cyclic AMP biotrack enzyme immunoassay system) was dispensed and shaken for 10 minutes. The aqueous solution of each well was used as a sample for measurement. Samples for measurement quadruply diluted were subjected to measurement of the quantity of cyclic AMP using the above-described enzyme immunoassay system. Inhibition ratio of the respective test compound was calculated assuming that the quantity of cyclic AMP of the well to which no test compound was added was 100%. In this empiric test system, dopamine which was used as a control drug suppressed the quantity of cyclic AMP to about 10% as the maximum activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was confirmed that test compounds had partial agonistic activity for dopamine D\n2\n receptor in the above-described test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the test compounds has partial agonistic activity for dopamine D\n2\n receptor, they can stabilize dopamine neurotransmission to a normal condition in a schizophrenia patient and as a result, exhibit, for example, positive and negative condition improving effect, cognitive impairment improving effect and the other symptom improving effects without causing side effects.\n\n\n \nPharmacological Test 3\n\n\nInhibitory effect on apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior in rats\n\n\n \n \n \nWistar rats (male, six-seven weeks old, Japan SLC, Inc.) were used as test animals. A test compound was suspended in 5% gum arabic/(physiological saline or water) using an agate mortar and was diluted with the same solvent if necessary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest animals were fasted overnight from the day before. Apomorphine (0.7 mg/kg) was subcutaneously administered (1 ml/kg) 1 hour after each test compound was orally administered (5 ml/kg). Stereotyped behavior was observed for 1 minute respectively 20, 30 and 40 minutes after apomorphine injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stereotyped behavior of each animal was quantified according to the following condition and score made at three points were summed up and the anti-apomorphine effect was evaluated. Six test animals were used for each group.\n\n0: The appearance of the animals is the same as saline treated rats;\n\n1: Discontinuous sniffing, constant exploratory activity;\n\n2: Continuous sniffing, periodic exploratory activity;\n\n3: Continuous sniffing, discontinuous biting, gnawing or licking. Very brief periods of locomotor activity;\n\n4: Continuous biting, gnawing or licking; no exploratory activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-clinical statistical analysis system was used for all statistical processing. When the significance probability value was lower than 0.05, it was judged that a significant difference existed. The difference of the score between the solvent administration group and each test compound administration group was analyzed using Wilcoxon ranksum test or Steel test. In addition, linear regression analysis was used for calculating 50% effective dose (95 % confidence interval).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the test compounds showed inhibitory effect for apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior, it was confirmed that the test compounds have D\n2\n receptor antagonistic effect.\n\n\n \nPharmacological Test 4\n\n\nInhibitory effect on (±)D-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) induced head twitch in rats\n\n\n \n \n \nWistar rats (male, six-seven weeks old, Japan SLC, Inc.) were used as test animals. A test compound was suspended in 5% gum arabic/(physiological saline or water) using an agate mortar and was diluted with the same solvent if necessary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest animals were fasted overnight from the day before. DOI (5.0 mg/kg) was subcutaneously administered (1 ml/kg) 1 hour after each test compound was orally administered (5 ml/kg). The number of head twitches was counted for 10 minutes immediately after DOI injection. Six test animals were used for each group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-clinical statistical analysis was used for all statistical processing. When the significance probability value was lower than 0.05, it was judged that a significant difference existed. The difference of the number of head twitches between the solvent administration group and each test compound administration group was analyzed using t-test or Dunnett's test. In addition, linear regression analysis was used for calculating 50% effective dose (95 % confidence interval).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the test compounds showed inhibitory effect for DOI-induced head twitch, it was confirmed that the test compounds have serotonin 5HT\n2A\n receptor antagonistic effect.\n\n\n \nPharmacological Test 5\n\n\nCatalepsy inducing effect in rats\n\n\n \n \n \nWistar rats (male, six-seven weeks old, Japan SLC, Inc.) were used as test animals. A test compound was suspended in 5% gum arabic/(physiological saline or water) using an agate mortar and was diluted with the same solvent if necessary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest animals were fasted overnight from the day before observation on catalepsy and ptosis was performed 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after each test compound was orally administered (5 ml/kg). Six test animals were used for each group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne forepaw of a rat was placed on an edge of a steel small box (width: 6.5 cm, depth: 4.0 cm, height: 7.2 cm) (an unnatural pose) and when the rat maintained the pose for more than 30 seconds, it was judged that the case was catalepsy positive. This observation was performed three times at each point, and if there was at least one positive case, it was judged that catalepsy occurred in the individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result, catalepsy induction effect of a test compound was dissociated from inhibitory effect on apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior, therefore it was suggested that apprehension for extrapyramidal side effect in clinic would be low.\n\n\n \nPharmacological Test 6\n\n\nMeasurement of serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibitory activity of a test compound by rat brain synaptosome\n\n\n \n \n \nWistar male rats were decapitated, the brain was retrieved and frontal cortex was dissected out, and it was homogenized in 0.32 M sucrose solution of a weight 20 times of the weight of the tissue using a Potter type homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4°C, 1,000 × g for 10 minutes, the obtained supernatant was further centrifuged at 4°C, 20,000 × g for 20 minutes, and the pellet was suspended in an incubation buffer (20 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mM glucose, 145 mM sodium chloride, 4.5 mM potassium chloride, 1.2 mM magnesium chloride, 1.5 mM calcium chloride), which was used as crude synaptosome fraction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5-HT uptake reaction was performed in a volume of 200 µl using a 96-well round bottom plate and pargyline (final concentration 10 µM) and sodium ascorbate (final concentration 0.2 mg/ml) were contained in the incubation buffer upon reaction and used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncubation buffer (total counting), non-labeled 5-HT(final concentration 10µM, non-specific counting) and the diluted test compound (final concentration 300nM) were added to each well. One-tenth quantity of the final volume of the synaptosome fraction was added and after preincubated at 37°C for 10 minutes, tritium labeled 5-HT solution (final concentration 8 nM) was added and uptake reaction was started at 37°C. The uptake time was 10 minutes and the reaction was terminated by vacuum filtration through a 96-well fiber glass filter paper plate, and after the filter paper was washed with cold normal saline, it was dried enough and Microscint0 (Perkin-Elmer) was added to the filter and remaining radioactivity on the filter was measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerotonin uptake inhibitory activity (%) was calculated from the radioactivity of total counting as 100%, of non-specific counting as 0%, and of counting obtained with test compound. \n \n \n%\n \n \n \nof inhibition of\n \n \n \n5\n \n-\n \nHT\n \n \n%\n \n \n=\n \n100\n \n-\n \n \n \nCount obtained with test compound\n \n-\n \nNonspecific count\n \n \n \n \n0\n \n%\n \n \n \nUptake\n \n \n \n/\n \n \nTotal count\n \n \n100\n \n%\n \n \n \nUptake\n \n \n-\n \nNonspecific count\n \n \n0\n \n%\n \n \n \nUptake\n \n \n \n \n×\n \n100\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are shown in the next Table 24.\n\n \nTable 24\n \n \n \nTest compound\n \nSerotonin uptake inhibitory ratio (%)(300 nM)\n \n \n \n \nCompound of Example 1\n \n92.4\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 2\n \n78.8\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 3\n \n84.8\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 4\n \n91.0\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 5\n \n89.1\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 6\n \n91.3\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 7\n \n91.0\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 8\n \n95.0\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 9\n \n97.3\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 10\n \n92.6\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 11\n \n92.5\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 13\n \n77.0\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 14\n \n85.2\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 15\n \n87.2\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 16\n \n86.7\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 17\n \n86.3\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 18\n \n91.1\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 19\n \n86.3\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 20\n \n92.8\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 21\n \n81.4\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 22\n \n90.8\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 23\n \n95.5\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 24\n \n97.5\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 25\n \n91.9\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 26\n \n92.0\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 27\n \n94.0\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 28\n \n95.3\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 30\n \n95.8\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 31\n \n96.3\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 32\n \n96.9\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 33\n \n94.3\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 34\n \n94.2\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 35\n \n93.4\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 36\n \n97.4\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 37\n \n97.7\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 38\n \n96.7\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 39\n \n99.2\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 40\n \n91.6\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 41\n \n95.1\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 64\n \n73.0\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 65\n \n72.9\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 66\n \n74.1\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 67\n \n93.9\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 68\n \n95.7\n \n \n \nCompound of Example 69\n \n96.3\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nPreparation Examples\n\n\n \n \n \n100 g of a compound of the present invention, 40 g of Avicel (trade name, product of Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), 30 g of corn starch and 2 g of magnesium stearate was mixed and polished and tableted with a pestle for glycocalyx R10 mm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe obtained tablet was coated with a film using a film coating agent made up of 10 g of TC-5 (trade name, product of Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd., hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), 3 g of polyethylene glycol 6000, 40 g of castor oil and an appropriate amount of ethanol to produce a film coated tablet of the above composition."
