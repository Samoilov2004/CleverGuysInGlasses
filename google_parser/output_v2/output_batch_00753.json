Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/172,007, filed on Jul. 11, 2008, which in turn is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/525,838, filed on Oct. 14, 2005, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,423,007, which in turn is a 35 U.S.C. §371 National Phase Entry Application from PCT/JP2003/010753, filed on Aug. 26, 2003, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119 to Japanese Patent Application No. 2002247843, filed on Aug. 27, 2002, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein in their entireties.\n\n\n \nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compounds having CXCR4 antagonistic action, and to preventive and/or therapeutic medicines containing such compounds for cancers and chronic rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nMany hormones and neurotransmitters regulate vital functions through specific receptors existing in cell membranes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany of these receptors conduct intracellular signaling through the activation of coupled guanine nucleotide-binding protein (as may be hereafter abbreviated to “G-protein”). Also, these receptors are collectively called G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) or 7 trans-membrane receptors (7TMR), as they have common structures having seven trans-cytomembrane domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs one of such G-protein-coupled receptors, a human receptor protein coded by CXCR4 gene is known [Journal of biological chemistry, Vol. 273, 4754 (1998)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, CXCL12/SDF-1α, which is a physiologically active peptide functioning as a ligand of the above-mentioned CXCR4, is known [Science, Vol. 261, 600-603 (1993)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain peptidic compounds having antagonistic action against CXCR4 are disclosed and their anti-HIV activity is described in Fujii, International Publication WO02/20561 Mar. 14, 2003.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancer metastasis is one of the critical factors affecting the life expectancy of patients. It is reported that the expression of CXCR4 is enhanced in breast cancer cells, etc., and that the expression of CXCL12/SDF-1α which is a ligand of CXCR4 is enhanced in cancer-metastasized organs (lymph nodes, lungs, livers and bones) [Nature, Vol. 410, 50-56 (2001)]. Also, in chronic rheumatoid arthritis, the infiltration of CD4 positive mermory T-cells into articular cavity fluids affects the progression of the conditions. It is reported that in CD4 positive T-cells in articular cavity fluids of patients suffering from chronic rheumatoid arthritis, the expression of CXCR4 genes is enhanced, and that the expression of CXCL12/SDF-1α genes is enhanced in articular synovial membrane tissues [Journal of Immunology, Vol. 165, 6590-98 (2000)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention aims at providing novel means using CXCR4 antagonistic compounds for the prevention and/or therapy of cancers and chronic rheumatoid arthritis. Also, the present invention provides novel compounds, in particular, various oligopeptides with common structures, which have preventive and/or therapeutic activity for cancers and chronic rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe inventors of the present invention were dedicated to studying possibilities of solving the above-mentioned problem, and as a result, have discovered that CXCR4 antagonistic compounds previously considered effective as chemotherapeutics for AIDS are effective for the prevention and/or therapy of cancers, including metastatic cancers, and chronic rheumatoid arthritis, and have completed the present invention through further research efforts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThat is, the present invention relates to the followings:\n\n\n

its amide, ester or salt containing the amino acid sequence which is the substantially same amino acid sequence as the sequence of any of the above-mentioned peptides. Here, “the substantially same amino acid sequence” means the amino acid sequence qualitatively identical in the activity of the peptide (e.g. the inhibitory activity on the interaction of a ligand and a receptor) or the anti-cancer activity of the peptide (e.g. migration inhibitory activity, invasion inhibitory activity and anti-metastasis activity) or the anti-rheumatoid arthritis activity (e.g. migration inhibitory activity) or the like. Accordingly, quantitative variances are acceptable to some extent (e.g. about 0.01 to 100 times, preferably 0.5 to 20 times, or more preferably 0.5 to 2 times). Therefore, one or more of the amino acids in the amino acid sequences indicated in any of the above-mentioned formula (Ia) to (Ij) and (1) to (58) can have variances, so far as they have any of the above-mentioned properties. That is to say, in the present invention, any peptide (variant peptide) resulting from the variance in the amino acid sequence such as substitution, deletion or insertion (addition) etc. which brings about any serious (significant) change (i.e. a qualitatively different change, or a qualitatively identical but quantitatively significantly different change) in the physiological property or chemical property of the original (non-variant) peptide is deemed as substantially same as the original (non-variant) peptide having no such variance, and, the amino acid sequence of such variant peptide is deemed as substantially same as the amino acid sequence of the original (non-variant) peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a well-known fact that generally, the change such as substitution, deletion or insertion (addition) of an amino acid in a peptide sequence often does not make a great (notable) change to physiological property or chemical property of such peptide. Such substitution is exemplified by the substitution of a certain amino acid by another amino acid of similar nature (property), and generally, it is considered that if the substitution is made between amino acids having greater similarity in their properties, so much smaller the changes caused by such substitution is in the properties of pre-substituted peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acids are classified, using the similarity of their properties as to one of the criteria, into the following classes, for example: (i) nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids (examples: alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, etc.); (ii) polar (neutral) amino acids (examples: glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, glutamine, etc.); (iii) (basic) amino acids carrying positive electric charge (examples: arginine, lysine, histidine, etc.); (iv)) (acidic) amino acids carrying negative electric charge (examples: asparatic acid, glutamic acid, etc.), and accordingly, amino acid substitution within each class can be conservative with regard to the property of a peptide (namely, substitution generating “substantially same” amino acid sequences).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other words, “substantially same amino acid sequences” may include:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) amino acid sequences wherein 1 or more, preferably 1 to 10, more preferably 1 to 5 amino acids were substituted by other amino acids in the amino acid sequences indicated in the above-mentioned formula (Ia) to (Ij) and (1) to (58);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) amino acid sequences wherein 1 to 7, preferably 1 to 5, more preferably 1 to 3 amino acids were deleted in the amino acid sequences indicated in the above-mentioned formula (Ia) to (Ij) and (1) to (58);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(iii) amino acid sequences wherein 1 to 15, preferably 1 to 10, more preferably 1 to 5 amino acids were added (inserted) in the amino acid sequences indicated in the above-mentioned formula (Ia) to (Ij) and (1) to (58); or\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(iv) peptides including modifications to constitutive amino acids (particularly, the side chains thereof) among the peptides having the amino acid sequences indicated in above (i), (ii) or (iii), or esters thereof or salts thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA peptide of the present invention, if and when the substitution, deletion, insertion (addition), modification, etc. of above (i) to (iv) is intentionally or incidentally provided in the amino acid sequence thereof, can be varied to a stable peptide against heat or protease or a high-activity peptide having more enhanced inhibitory activity. The peptides of the present invention include also these variant peptides or amides thereof, esters thereof or salts thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, among the peptides of the present invention are the peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence indicated in any of the above-mentioned formula (Ia to Ij) and (1) to (58), and the peptide containing the amino acid sequence sharing the homology of about 50 to 99.9% (preferably, 70 to 99.9%, more preferably 90 to 99.9%) with the foregoing amino acid sequence and having the activities of substantially same nature as the peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence indicated in any of the above-mentioned formula (Ia to Ij) and (1) to (58), or amides thereof, esters thereof or salts thereof. Such activities include, for example, inhibitory activities of the peptides such as an inhibitory activity on the binding of a ligand to its receptor, a signaling inhibitory activity. The inhibitory activities of “substantially same nature” mean that the properties such as the inhibitory activity on the ligand binding to the receptor are of the same nature. Therefore, it is acceptable even if non-significant effectiveness levels of the inhibitory activity on the ligand binding to the receptor are found, and it is not matter even if there are differences in molecular weights.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amides, esters or salts of the peptide having the amino acid sequence indicated in any of the above-mentioned formula (1) to (58) include the same ones as are exemplified for the peptide indicated in the above-mentioned formula (Ia). Preferably, the peptide having the amino acid sequence indicated in any of the above-mentioned formula (1) to (58) is better if the carboxyl group of the C-terminal amino acid residue is amidated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides of the present invention including the peptide containing the amino acid sequence indicated in any of the above-mentioned formula (1) to (58) can be produced by conventionally known methods of synthesizing peptides. For the syntheses of peptides, either solid phase peptide synthesis or liquid phase synthesis may be utilized. Namely, an expected peptide can be produced by condensing a partial peptide able to constitute a peptide or an amino acid with remaining portions, and if the product has a protecting group, by eliminating the protecting group. As the known condensation methods and elimination of protecting groups, the following examples (1) to (5) are included:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) M. Bodanszky and M. A.

Yajima, Zoku-Iyakuhin-no-Kaihatsu, Vol. 14, Peptide Synthesis, Hirokawa Publishing Co., Tokyo (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs practical methods for syntheses of peptides, the following examples can be given:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, commercially available resins for synthesis of polypeptides can be used. Such resins include, for example, chloromethyl resin, hydroxymethyl resin, benzhydroxylamine resin, aminomethyl resin, 4-hydroxybenzylalcohol resin, 4-methylbenzhydroxylamine resin, PAM resin, 4-hydroxymethylmethylphenylacetoamidomethyl resin, polyacrylamide resin, 4-(2′,4′-dimetoxyphenyl-hydroxymethyl)phenoxy resin, 4-2′,4′-dimetoxyphenyl-Fmoc aminoethylphenoxy resin, etc. Using such resin, an amino acid with suitably protected α-amino group and side chain functional group is condensed on the resin to the sequence of the expected polypeptide in accordance with conventionally known condensation methods. In the last stage of the reaction, the polypeptide is cleared from the resin and simultaneously various protective groups are removed, and then, by carrying out intramolecular disulfide bond-forming reaction in highly diluted solution, the expected polypeptide or amide thereof is obtained. For the above-mentioned condensation of the protected amino acid, various activated reagents usable for the syntheses of polypeptides can be used, but, it is particularly better to use carboxylmides. Among such carboxylmides are DCC, N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide, N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)cabodiimde, etc. For the activation by these, together with racemization inhibitory additives (for example, HOBt, HOOBt), a protected amino acid is added directly to the resin, or after activating the protected amino acid as symmetric acid anhydride or HOBt ester or HOOBt ester, it can be added to ester resin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolvents used for the activation of protected amino acids and the condensation with resins can be chosen from among the solvents known to be usable for polypeptide condensation reactions. For example, acid amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetoamide and N-methylpyrrolidone, halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride and chloroform, alcohols such as trifluoroethanol, sulfoxides such as methyl sulfoxide, ethers such as pyridine, dioxane and tetrahydrofuran, nitriles such as acetonitrile and propionitrile, esters such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate, or appropriated mixtures of the foregoings are used. A solvent used for activation of a protected amino acid or its condensation with resin can be selected from among the solvents known to be usable for condensing reactions of polypeptides. The reaction temperature is appropriately set within the scope known to be applicable to polypeptide bond forming reactions, usually, at −20° C. to 50° C. Activated amino acid derivatives are usually used at 1.5 to 4 times excess. According to the result of tests adopting ninhydrin reaction, if the condensation is insufficient, the repetition of condensation reactions without eliminating protective groups can lead to sufficient condensation. If sufficient condensation is attained by the repetition of reactions, unreacted amino acids can be acetylated by the use of acetic anhydride or acetylimidazole.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protective group of the amino group used as ingredients include, for example, Z, Boc, tertialypentyloxycarbony, isobornyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycabonyl, Cl—Z, Br—Z, adamantyloxycabonyl, trifluoroacetyl, phtaloyl, formyl, 2-nitrophenylsulphenyl, diphenylphosphinothioyl, Fmoc, etc. Carboxyl group can be protected, for example, by alkyl esterification (e.g. straight-chain, branching or circular alkyl esterification of methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, tertialbutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, 2-adamantyl, etc.), aralkyl esterification (e.g. benzylester, 4-nitrobenzylester, 4-methoxybenzylester, 4-chlorb enzylester, benzhydryl esterification), phenacylesterification, benzylcarbonylhydrazidation, tertialybutoxycarbonylhydrazidation, tritylhydrazidation, etc. The hydroxyl group of serine can be protected, for example, by esterification or etherification. The groups suitable for this eterification include, for example, groups derivatized from carboxylic acid such as lower alkanoyl group such as acetyl group, aroyl group such as benzoyl group, benzyloxycarbonyl group, ethoxycarbonyl group. The groups suitable for etherification include, for example, benzyl group, tetrahydropiranyl group, tertiarybutyl group, etc. As the protective groups of phenolic OH group of tyrosine, for example, Bzl, Cl2-Bzl, 2-nitrobenzyl, Br—Z, tertiarlybutyl, etc. are used. As the protective groups of imidazole of histidine, for example, Tos, 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonyl, DNP, benzyloxymethyl, Bum, Boc, Trt, Fmoc etc. are used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIngredients with activated carboxyl groups include, for example, corresponding acid anhydride, azide, active ester [ester of alcohol (e.g. pentachlorophenol, 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, cyanomethylalcohol, p-nitrophenol, HONB, N-hydroxysuccimide, N-hydroxyphtalimide, HOBO] are used. Ingredients with activated amino group include, for example, corresponding phosphoric amide. As the methods to remove (elimiate) protective groups, for example, catalytic reduction in hydrogen airstream in the presence of a catalyst such as Pd-black or Pd-carbon, acid treatment by anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, methanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid or a mixture thereof, etc, base treatment by diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, piperidine, piperadine, etc., and reduction by natrium in liquid ammonia are used. Elimination reaction by the above-mentioned acid treatment is done generally at the temperature of about −20° C. to 40° C., but in the acid treatment, it is effective to add a cation trapping agent such as anisole, phenol, thioanisole, m-cresol, p-cresol, dimethylsulfide, 1,4-butanedithiol, 1,2-ethanedithiol. 2,4-dinitrophenyl group used as the protective group of imidazole of histidine is removed by thiophenol treatment. Formyl group used as the protective group of indole of tryptophan is removed by elimination of protection by the above-mentioned acid treatment in the presence of 1,2-ethanedithiol, 1,4-butanedithiol, etc. and also is removed by alkaline treatment by dilute sodium hydroxide solution, dilute ammonia, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtection and protective group of functional groups not to be involved in the reaction of ingredients, and elimination of such protective group, and activation of functional groups to be involved in the reaction, etc. can be appropriately selected from among conventionally known groups or conventionally known measures. As alternative methods to obtain amides of polypeptides, there is, for example, a method to manufacture, after amidating and protecting α-carboxyl group of carboxy-terminal amino acid and then extending the peptide chain to the desired chain length on the side of amino group, a polypeptide eliminating the protective group of α-amino group of N-terminal of such peptide chain and a polypeptide eliminating the protective group of carboxyl group of C-terminal, and then these two peptides are condensed in the above-mentioned mixed solvent. The details of the condensation reaction are the same as described above. After purifying the protected polypeptide obtained by the condensation, the desired raw polypeptide can be obtained by eliminating all the protective groups by the above-mentioned method. Having purified this raw polypeptide using various known purification methods, if the main fraction is freeze-dried, an amide type of the desired polypeptide can be obtained. To get an ester type of the polypeptide, for example, make an amino acid ester by condensing α-carboxyl group of carboxy-terminal amino acid with the desired alcohols, and then, the ester type of the desired polypeptide can be obtained in the same way as the amide type of the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the reaction, the peptides of the present invention can be purified and isolated by combining usual purification methods such as solvent extraction, distillation, column chromatography, liquid chromatography, re-crystallization, etc. If a peptide obtained by the above-mentioned methods is a salt-free type, it can be converted to a suitable salt by known methods, or if such peptide is a salt, it can be converted to a salt-free type by known methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the new peptides of the present invention having the amino acid sequences indicated in the above-mentioned formula (1) to (58) can be manufactured by the methods described in the below-mentioned practical examples or similar methods. Also, the peptides of the present invention can be manufactured by the methods described in the International Publication No. 02/20561 Pamphlet or similar methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the event that the peptides of the present invention are used as human drugs or veterinary drugs, usual usages may be applied. For example, according to need, they may be used by the oral route in the forms of sugar-coated tablets, capsules, elixirs, micro-capsulated formulations, etc. or by the parenteral route in the injectable forms of sterile solutions made of water or other pharmacologically acceptable liquid, suspensions, etc. For example, the peptides of the present invention can be manufactured as drugs by incorporating physiologically acceptable carriers, flavoring compound, excipients, vehicles, preservatives, stabilizers, binding agents in the unit dosage formulation forms required for the generally accepted pharmaceutical manufacturing. The quantity of any active ingredient in such drugs should be the optimal amount within the instructed scope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditives which can be incorporated into tablets, capsules, etc. include, for example, binding agents such as gelatin, cornstarch, tragacanth gum and gum Arabic, diluting agents such as crystalline cellulose, swelling agents such as cornstarch, gelatin and alginic acid, lubricant agents such as magnesium stearate, sweetening agents such as sucrose, lactose or saccharine, and flavoring agents such as peppermint, akamono oil or cherry. If the preparation form is capsules, it can contain a liquid carrier such as oil in addition to the above-mentioned materials. Sterile composition for injection can be formulated in accordance with usual pharmaceutical manufacturing practices, by dissolving or suspending active ingredients or natural vegetable oils such as sesame oil and copra oil in the vehicles such as injection solvents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs watery solutions for injections, for example, isotonic solutions containing physiological saline, glucose and other adjunctive agents (e.g., D-sorbitol, D-mannitol, sodium chloride, etc.) can be used, and also can be used together with a suitable solubilizing agent such as alcohol (e.g., ethanol), polyalcohol (e.g., propylene glycohol, polyethylene glycohol), nonionic surfactant (e.g., \nPolysorbate\n 80™, (HCO-50) etc. Oily solutions include sesame oil, soybean oil, etc. and can be used together with solubilizing agents such as benzyl benzoate and benzylalcohol. They can also be combined with a buffering agent (e.g., phosphate buffer solution, sodium acetate buffer solution), a soothing agent (e.g., benzalkonium chloride, procaine hydrochloride, etc.), a stabilizer (e.g., human serum albumine, polyethylene glycohol, etc.), a preservative (e.g., benzylalcohol, phenol, etc.), an antioxidant, etc. A prepared injection is sterilely filled into an ampoule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical preparations manufactured as above are safe and low-toxic, and accordingly, can be administered to, for example, humans and mammals (e.g., mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, sheep, swines, cows, cats, dogs, monkeys, hamadryas, chimpanzees, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose of a peptide of the present invention differs depending on the disease condition, etc. The dose in oral administration is usually about 0.1 to 1000 mg per one time per 60 kg of the body weight, preferably about 1.0 to 500 mg, and more preferably about 1.0 to 200 mg. The single dose in parenteral administration per 60 kg of the body weight differs depending on the administration subject, disease condition, administration method, etc.; for example, in case of injection, usually about 0.01 to 300 mg, preferably about 0.1 to 200 mg, and more preferably about 0.1 to 100 mg per one time may be administered intravenously. For other animals, the dose based on 60 kg of the body weight can be administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides of the present invention have an anti-cancer activity, i.e. an activity for inhibiting movement of cancer cells and a cancer metastasis inhibitory activity. That is to say, the peptides of the present invention, as clearly seen in the below-mentioned practical examples, can be used as drugs for prevention and therapy of cancers, especially cancer metastasis, since they have a cancer metastasis inhibitory activity. Accordingly, the peptides of the present invention as anti-cancer drugs are useful for the amelioration, prevention and therapy of oral cancer, throat cancer, lip cancer, lingual cancer, gingival cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, small intestinal cancer, large intestinal cancer including colorectal cancer, liver cancer, gallbladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, nasal cancer, lung cancer, bone cancer, soft tissue cancer, skin cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, penile cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, brain cancer, thyroid cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, etc. Also, the peptides of the present invention have an anti-chronic rheumatoid arthritis activity, i.e., an inhibitory effect on T-cell movement. In other words, the peptides of the present invention, as clearly seen in the below-mentioned practical examples, can be used as drugs for the prevention and therapy of chronic rheumatoid arthritis, since they have an inhibitory action on T-cell movement. Thus, the peptides of the present invention are useful as drugs for the amelioration, prevention and therapy of chronic rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well-known that CXCR4 antagonistic compounds have an anti-viral activity. Accordingly, it would be obvious to the concerned industry that the peptides of the present invention can be used as preventive and therapeutic drugs for viral infectious disease (e.g. AIDS, SARS, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of the peptides of the present invention as anti-cancer drugs can be made concomitantly with other anti-cancer drugs (for example, chemotherapeutic drugs, immunotherapeutic drugs, or drugs inhibiting the activity of cell growth factors and their receptors) etc. (hereafter referred to as “concomitant drugs”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA peptide of the present invention exhibits a beneficial anti-cancer activity whenused in a single preparation form, but, the activity can be further enhanced when used together with one or more of the above-mentioned concomitant drugs (concomitant use of multiple drugs).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs the said “chemotherapeutic drugs”, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites, anticancer antibiotics and plant-derived anti-cancer drugs can be exemplified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncluded in the examples of “alkylating drugs” are nitrogen mustard, nitrogen mustard-N-oxide hydrochloride, chlorambutyl, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, thiotepa, carboquone, improsulfan tosylte, busulfan, nimustine hydrochloride, mitobronitol, melphalan, dacarbazine, ranimustine, estramustine sodium phosphate, triethylenmelamine, carmustine, lomustine, streptozocin, pipobroman, etoglucide, altretamine, ambamustin, dibrospidium hydrochloride, fotemustin, prednimustin, pumitepa, ribomustin, temozolomide, treosulphan, trophosphamide, zinostatin stimalamer, carboquone, adzelecin, systemstin, bizelesin, platinum complex (carboplatin, cisplatin, miboplatin, nedaplatin, oxaliplatin, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Antimetabolites” include, for example, mercaptopurine, 6-mercaptopurine riboside, thioinosine, methotrexate, enocitabine, cytarabine, cytarabine ocfosfate, ancitabine hydrochloride, 5-FU agents (e.g. fluorouracil, tegafur, UFT, doxifluridine, carmofur, galocitabine, emitefur, etc.), aminopterin, calcium leucovorin, tabloid, butocin, calcium folinate, calcium levofolinate, cladribine, emitefur, fludarabine, gemcitabine, hydroxycarbamide, pentostatin, piritrexim, idoxuridine, mitoguzaon, thiazofurin, ambamustin and gemicitabine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Anticancer antibiotics” include, for example, antracycline anti-cancer agents (doxorubicine hydrochloride, daunorubicin hydrochloride, aclarubicin hydrochloride, pirarubicin hydrochloride, epirubicin hydrochloride, etc.), actinomycin D, actinomycin C, mitomycin C, chromomycin A3, bleomycin hydrochloride, bleomycin sulfate, pleomycin sulfate, neocarzinostatin, mithramycin, sarcomycin, carzinophilin, mitotane, zorbicin hydrochloride, mitoxantrone hydrochloride and idarubicin hydrochloride.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Plant-derived anti-cancer agents” include, for example, vinca alkaloid anti-cancer agents (vinblastine sulfate, vincristine sulfate, vindesin sulfate, vinorelbine, etc.), taxan anti-cancer agents (paclitaxel, docetaxel, etc.), etoposide, etoposide phosphate, teniposide and vinorelbine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “cell growth factors” in the said “drugs inhibiting the activity of cell growth factors and their receptors” can be any material that promotes the growth of cells, and include a factor exhibiting its activity at low concentration by the interaction with its receptor in the peptide of less than 20,000 molecular weight. Specifically, they include (1) EGF (epidermal growth factor) or a material having substantially the same activity as EGF (e.g., EGF, HER2 ligand, etc.), (2) insulin or a material having substantially the same activity as insulin [e.g., insulin, IGF (insulin-like growth factor)-1, IGF-2, etc.], (3) FGF (fibroblast growth factor) a material having substantially the same activity as FGF [e.g., acidic FGF, basic FGF, KGF (keratinocyte growth factor), FGF-10, etc.], (4) other cell growth factors [e.g., CSF (colony stimulating factor), EPO (erythropoietin), IL-2 (interleukin-2), NGF (nerve growth factor), PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), TGFβ (transforming growth factorβ), HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), etc.].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe said “receptors of cell growth factors can be any receptor that has binding capacity with the above-mentioned cell growth factors.

The dose of a concomitant drug can follow the usual dose clinically adopted, and can be determined appropriately depending on the administration subject, administration route, disease conditions, combination, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe administration mode of a peptide of the present invention and a concomitant drug is not particularly limited, and it is acceptable if a polypeptide of the present invention or a salt thereof and a concomitant drug are combined at the time of administration. Such administration mode may be, for example, (1) the administration of a single preparation formulated by the simultaneous combination of a peptide of the present invention and a concomitant drug, (2) the simultaneous administration by the same administration route of two different drugs—one being a drug formulated using a peptide of the present invention and the other being a concomitant drug, (3) the administration by the same route at different times of two different drugs—one being a drug formulated using a peptide of the present invention and the other being a concomitant drug, (4) the simultaneous administration by different routes of two different drugs—one being a drug formulated using a peptide of the present invention and the other being a concomitant drug, (5) the administration by different routes at different times of two different drugs—one being a drug formulated using a peptide of the present invention and the other being a concomitant drug (for example, the administration of a peptide of the present invention followed by a concomitant drug, or vice versa), etc. These administration modes are hereafter collectively referred to as “concomitant drug(s) of the present invention”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny concomitant drug of the present invention has low toxicity, and accordingly, can be safely administered orally or parenterally (e.g., local, rectum, vein, etc.) in the form of pharmaceutical compositions prepared by mixing a peptide of the present invention and/or the above-mentioned concomitant drug with a pharmacologically acceptable carrier in accordance with a method known in the art. Such pharmaceutical compositions include, without limitation, tablets (including sugar-coated tablets and film-coated tablets), powders, granules, capsules (including soft capsules), solutions, injections, suppositories, sustained-release formulations, etc. An injection can be administered to the interior or proximal site of a tumor or directly to the lesion by intraveneous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraorgan, intranasal, intradermal, eye dropping, intracerebral, intrarectal, intravaginal or intraperitoneal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacogically acceptable carriers identical to those used for the above-mentioned pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be used in the manufacturing of the concomitant drugs of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combination ratio of any of the peptides of the present invention and a concomitant drug belonging to the concomitant drugs of the present invention can be determined appropriately depending on the subject to be administered, routes for administration, disease conditions, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe content of a concomitant drug belonging to the concomitant drugs of the present invention varies depending on the drug preparation forms. It is usually about 0.01 to 100% by weight in the whole preparation, or preferably about 0.1 to 50% by weight, or most preferably about 0.5 to 20% by weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe content of an additive such as a carrier in the concomitant drugs of the present invention varies depending on the drug preparation forms. It is usually about 1 to 99.9% by weight in the whole preparation, or preferably about 10 to 90% by weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is described in further details by the following practical examples, which, however, will not limit the range of the present invention.\n\n\n \nManufacturing Example 1\n\n\nManufacturing of Polypeptide TCl4003\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH-Arg-Arg-Nal-Cys-Tyr-Cit-Lys-DLys-Pro-Tyr-Arg-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCit-Cys-Arg-OH (TC14003)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1.

Its IC\n50 \nvalue was 0.54 nmol/L, and it exhibited inhibitory activity comparable to the case of human cells. This means in turn that little species difference was identified between humans and mice with respect to this peptide.\n\n\n \nExperimental Example 9\n\n\nEffects of 4Fbenzoyl-TN-14003 on Mouse Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity Reaction (DTH)\n\n\n \n \n \nPreserved blood of sheep was purchased from Nippon Bio-Supp. Center. The preserved sheep blood was cleansed twice in physiological saline solution, suspended in physiological saline solution, and used as sheep red blood cells (SRBC). As OD541 nm value of oxyhemoglobin at the time of hemolyzation of 1.0×10\n9 \ncells/mL of the SRBC suspension by 14 parts distilled water is considered to be nearly 0.700, SRBC density was accordingly fixed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2×10\n7 \ncells/50 μl of SRBC were administered subcutaneously to the ankles of the left hindlimbs of BALB/c mice (male, 6 week-old, Charles River Japan, Inc.) and sentisized. After 5 days, 10\n8 \ncells/50 μl of SRBC were administered subcutaneously to the ankles of the right hindlimbs and DTH reaction was induced Immediately prior to and 24 hours after the induction of antigens, the thickness of the ankles of the right hindlimbs was measured by a digital micrometer (Mitutoyo Corporation CD-15B), and the increase (mm) in the thickness of ankles was adopted as the indicator of DTH reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4Fbenzoyl-TN14003 was dissolved to PBS, and continuously administered using Alzet osmotic pumps (Alza, 0.5 μL/hr, 7 days persistent type). The osmotic pumps were implanted intradermally to the backs under ether anesthesia on the day before the sensitization. As the control, pumps injected with PBS were similarly implanted. 4F-benzoyl-TN14003 was administered at the doses of 4.8, 24 and 120 μg/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData were expressed as mean value ±s tandard margin of error (n=7). By Williams test, p≦0.025 was valued as significant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result, as indicated in \nFIG. 8\n, 4F-benzoyl-TN14003 (4.8, 24 and 120 μg/day) inhibited footpad edema dose-dependently and significantly, and the inhibitory rates were 9, 31 and 51%, respectively. This suggests that CXCR4 plays an important role in cellular immunity such as DTH reaction.\n\n\n \nExperimental Example 10\n\n\nTherapeutic Effects of 4Fbenzoyl-TN-14003 on Mouse Collagen-Induced Arthritis\n\n\n \n \n \nFK-506 was purified by a known method (Kino T. et al., J. Antibiot., 1987 40(9): 1249-55). Methotrexate was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Ind., indomethacin from Sigma, bovine type II collagen from Collagen Research Center (Tokyo, Japan), Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA from Difco), and anti-mouse IgG2a antibody from Zymed, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBovine type II collagen was dissolved to the 2 mg/mL concentration by 0.05 mol/L of acetic acid solution, emulsion was prepared with an equal volume of FCA. 50 μL of the emulsion was injected intradermally at the base of the tail DBA/LIN mouse (male, 6 week old, Charles River Japan, Inc.) and sensitized. 21 days after the injection, additional immunization was made similarly. For 2 weeks after the additional immunization, body weights and hindlimb thickness were measured and arthritis scoring was made. Arthritis scores were scored at 0-3 points of each limb, and evaluated by the total of the same (12 points being the full points; 0, normal; 1, mild swelling or swelling of a single digit; 2, moderate swelling or swelling of plural digits; 3, severe swelling). Two weeks after the immunization, four limbs and sera were picked.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter coat blocking bovine type II collagen (10 μg/mL PBS solution) on the immunoplate, 100 μL of 1000 times diluted mouse serum was added, and kept at room temperature for 2 hours. After cleansing, anti-mouse IgG2a antibody (1000 times dilution) was added. After cleansing, TMB was added, kept at room temperature for 30 minutes, H\n2\nSO\n4 \nof equal amount was added, and A450 nm was measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndomethacin (1 mg/kg), methotrexate (3 mg/kg) and FK-506 (10 mg/kg) were suspended to 0.5% methyl cellulose, and orally administered every day for 2 weeks from the day of the additional immunization at the dose of 0.1 mL/10g body weight. 0.5% methyl cellulose solution of the equal dose was orally administered to the control group. 4Fbenzoyl-TN14003 was dissolved to PBS, and continuously administered using Alzet osmotic pumps (Alza, 0.5 μL/\nhr\n 2 weeks). The osmotic pumps were implanted intradermally to the backs of the mice under ether anesthesia on the day before the additional immunization. As the control, pumps injected with PBS were similarly implanted. Evaluation of each drug was made for the value obtained 2 weeks after the additional immunization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData were expressed as mean value ±standard margin of error (n=8-12). Comparison between 2 groups was made by Student's t-test, p≦0.05 was valued as significant. Multiple comparison was made by Dunnett test, p≦0.05 was valued as significant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result, all of Indomethacin (1 mg/kg, p.o.), methotrexate (3 mg/kg, p.o.) and FK-506 (10 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly inhibited hindlimb swelling, and exhibited significant or evident inhibitory activity against arthritis score (\nFIG. 9\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4F-benzoyl-TN14003 (120 μg/day) exhibited significant inhibitory activity against hindlimb swelling, arthritis score and body weight loss. It also showed an inhibitory tendency against increase of anti-type II collagen specific IgG2a antibody value (\nFIG. 10\n). These inhibitory effects were equivalent to or better than those of the above-mentioned known drugs.\n\n\n \nINDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY\n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptidic compounds of the present invention having CXCR4 antagonistic activity can inhibit the interaction of CXCR4 and CXCL12/SDF-1α, and accordingly, can inhibit the migrating reaction of cancerous cells of cancers impressing CXCR4, for example, oral cancer, throat cancer, lip cancer, lingual cancer, gingival cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, small intestinal cancer, large intestinal cancer including colorectal cancer, liver cancer, gallbladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, nasal cancer, lung cancer, bone cancer, soft tissue cancer, skin cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, penile cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, brain cancer, thyroid cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, etc., and are useful as drugs for the prevention and/or therapy of these cancers. Also, the peptidic compounds of the present invention can inhibit the migrating reaction of immunocytes induced by CXCL12/SDF-1α and are useful as drugs for the prevention and/or therapy of chronic rheumatoid arthritis."
