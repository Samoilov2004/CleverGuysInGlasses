The present application also claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) to provisionals U.S. Ser. No. 60/496,741, filed Aug. 21, 2003, entitled “Synthesis of Epothilones, Intermediates Thereto and Analogues Thereof”; and U.S. Ser. No. 60/548,402, filed Feb. 27, 2004, entitled “Synthesis of Epothilones, Intermediates Thereto and Analogues Thereof”; the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nEpothilones A and B (2a and 2b, Scheme 1) are naturally occurring cytotoxic macrolides that were isolated from a cellulose degrading mycobacterium, \nSorangium cellulosum \n(Höfle et al. \nAngew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl. \n1996, 35, 1567 and \nJ. Antibiot. \n1996, 49, 560; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). Despite their vastly different structures, epothilones A and B share the same mechanism of action as paclitaxel (Taxol®) which involves growth inhibition of tumor cells by tubulin polymerization and stabilization of microtubule assemblies (Bollag et al. \nCancer Res. \n1995, 55, 2325; incorporated by reference). In spite of its unquestioned clinical value as a front-line chemotherapeutic agent, Taxol® is far from an ideal drug. Its marginal water solubility necessitates recourse to formulation vehicles such as Cremophores that pose their own risks and management issues (Essayan et al. \nJ. Allergy Clin. Immunol. \n1996, 97, 42; incorporated herein by reference). Moreover, Taxol® is vulnerable to deactivation through multiple drug resistance (MDR) (Giannakakou et al. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n1997, 272, 17118; incorporated herein by reference). However, it has also been demonstrated that epothilones A and B retain remarkable potency against MDR tumor cells (Kowalski et al. \nMol. Biol. Cell \n1995, 6, 2137; incorporated herein by reference). Additionally, the increased water solubility in comparison to paclitaxel may be useful for the formulability of epothilones. While the naturally occurring compound, epothilone B (2b, EpoB, in Scheme 1), is a potent member of the epothilone family of natural products, it unfortunately possesses, at least in xenograft mice, a worrisomely narrow therapeutic index (Su et al. \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. \n1997, 36, 1093; Harris et al. \nJ. Org. Chem. \n1999, 64, 8434; each of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the limited therapeutic index of EpoB, other epothilone analogues, in particular the 12,13-desoxyepothilones, were investigated for their ability to provide an improved therapeutic profile (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,242,469, 6,284,781, 6,300,355, 6,369,234, 6,204,388, 6,316,630; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). In vivo experiments conducted on various mouse models demonstrated that 12,13-desoxyepothilone B (3b, dEpoB in Scheme 2) possesses therapeutic potential against various sensitive and resistant human tumors in mice xenografts (Chou et al. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n1998, 95, 9642 and 15798; incorporated herein by reference). Recently, the therapeutic superiority of these desoxyepothilones over other anticancer agents has been conclusively demonstrated by thorough comparative studies (Chou et al. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n2001, 98, 8113; incorporated herein by reference). Due to its impressive in vivo profile, dEpoB has been advanced through toxicology evaluations in dogs, and is now in human trials as an anticancer drug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn light of the promising therapeutic utility of the 12,13-desoxyepothilones, it would be desirable to investigate additional analogues as well as additional synthetic methodologies for the synthesis of existing epothilones, desoxyepothilones, and analogues thereof, as well as novel analogues thereof. In particular, given the interest in the therapeutic utility of this class of compounds, it would also be desirable to develop methodologies capable of providing significant quantities of any epothilones or desoxyepothilones previously described, or those described herein, for clinical trials and for large-scale preparation.\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n is a table of IC\n50 \nvalues of epothilones against CCRF-CEM, CCRF-CEM/VBL, and CCRF-CEM/Taxol cell growth. Cell growth inhibition was measured by XTT tetrazonium assay after 72-hour incubation for cell growth, as described previously (Scudiero et al. \nCancer Res. \n46:4827-4833, 1988; incorporated herein by reference).

For assembly, the incubation was carried out at 35° C. for 40 minutes, and for disassembly of the same samples, the incubation was carried out at 4° C. for 40 minutes. Aborbance at 350 nm was measured for the microtubule stabilization. Solvent blank (DMSO) was subtracted from the absorbance.\n\n\n \nFIG. 94\n shows the potency of epothilones against tumor cell growth in vitro and the relative therapeutic index.\n\n\n \nFIG. 95\n is cell cycle analysis as determined by Propidium iodide DNA staining. Cell cycle was arrested in G2M phase starting from 6 hours and absolutely blocked at 24 hours for OPM-2 myeloma cells after treatment with dEpoB (upper panel) and Fludelone (lower panel). The two drugs induced the same patter of cell cycle arrest.\n\n\n \nFIG. 96\n shows Annexin V staining on the RPMI8226 myeloma cell line. In early apoptotic cells, the membrance phospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, thereby exposing PS to the external cellular environment. Annexin V is a 35-36 kD Ca\n+2 \ndependent phospholipid-binding protein that has a high affinity for PS, and binds to cells with exposed PS. In conjunction with a vital dye such as 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) staining dead cells, this assay allows the identification of early apoptotic cells. The data showed that the majority of cell either enter apoptosis or are dead after 24 hours treatment with dEpoB or Fludelone.\n\n\n \nFIG. 97\n show micrographs of myeloma and lymphoma cell lines treated with Fludelone (125 nM) for 24 hours. The characteristic ring-like structures of the cells arrested in G2/M is seen.\n\n\n \nFIG. 98\n shows the cells count of RPMI8226 myeloma cells treated with Fludelone and dEpoB (125 nM). At different time points (1, 2, 4, 8, 24 hours), the drug was washed out, and the cells were continued to be incubated for up to 48 hours. Note that with as little as 1 hour exposure to Fludelone the tumor cell numbers progressively decrease with the majority of cells undergoing apoptosis at 24 hours whereas with dEpoB cells continue to expand.\n\n\n \nFIG. 99\n shows α-tubulin staining of RPMI8226 myeloma cells. Fludelone appears to stabilize microtubules and greatly increase the microtubule polymer mass at an early stage of treatment (at 12 hours with RPMI8226 myeloma cells). After 24 hours of drug treatment, microtubules mass was decrease and disrupted while cells underwent apoptosis.\n\n\n \nFIG. 100\n is the cell cycle analysis determined by Propidium iodide DNA staining. Solid lines describe the values for G1 and G2, gray shaded area depict the cells in S phase, dotted line delineates the overall curve giving the number of doublets especially evident with Taxol (upper left image). Upper row demonstrates the G2M phase arrest after 24 hours of incubation with Fludelone (10 nM), dEpoB (100 nM), and Taxol (100 nM) of the ovarian cancer cell line IGROV. The lower row demonstrate the increase cell cycle arrest of HT-29 with increased concentrations of Fludelone. The 100 nM incubation with Fludelone resulted in massive apoptosis after 24 hours hampering cell cycle analysis in several cell lines including IGROV and HT-29.\n\n\n \nFIG. 101\n shows Annexin V staining of the Ovcar3 ovarian cancer cell line after 24 hour incubation with 100 nM of Fludelone, Taxol, or dEpoB. Percentages given in the lower left quadrant is the percentage of Annexin V\n+\n/Pl\n−\n negative cells, which resemble cells in the early apoptotic stage.\n\n\n \nFIG. 102\n is a cytospin of HT-29 colon cancer cells after 24 hours of treatment stained with HEMA 3 (200× magnification). (a) control cells treated with the dissolvent (DMSO). (b)-(d) Increased concentrations of \n \n \nFludelone\n \n \n 1, 10, and 100 nM are shown. (e) HT-29 cells after the application of 100 nM dEpoB and (f) after 100 nM of Taxol. All three drugs produce the same phenotype after 24 hours apparent in a ring-like structure of the nucleus resulting in apoptosis.\n\n\n \nFIG. 103\n shows the experimental design of a system for evaluating the action of Fludelone and dEpoB in disseminated and metastatic human tumor xenograft models.\n\n\n \nFIG. 104\n shows cell proliferation and IC50 (the concentration for 50% cell inhibition) assays. Cell proliferation was determined using the \nsodium\n 3′-[1-(phenylamino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate (XTT), which measured the conversion of a tetrazolium compound into formazan by a mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzyme in live cells. The amount of formazan is proportional to the number of living cells present in the assay mixture. Each data point was the average of four independent determinations. The IC50 of Fludelone is about 7.6˜36.67 nM and dEpoB 36.67˜61.34 nM for myeloma cell lines (RPMI8226, CAG). The IC50 of Fludelone is about 60˜80 nM for lymphoma lines (SKIDLBCL and RL).\n\n\n \nFIG. 105\n shows cell proliferation and IC50 assays on normal stromal cells. The same method was used as described in \nFIG. 104\n. Human marrow stromal cell lines, HS-27A and HS-5 immortalized by E6/E7 genes, have normal marrow stromal function, which support stem cell self-renewal, and proliferation. The IC50 of Fludelone and dEpoB is about 90-100 nM for these stromal lines with a comparable population doubling time with tumor lines.\n\n\n \nFIG. 106\n shows the titration of Fludelone and dEpoB concentrations on cell cycle arrest. CAG myeloma cell lines were used. At the concentration of 31.25 nM, both drugs can absolutely blocked cell cycle at G2M phase (data below 31.25 nM is not shown).\n\n\n \nFIG. 107\n shows the Titration of Fludelone and dEpoB concentration on cell cycle arrest. RPMI8226 myeloma cell lines were used. At the concentration of 31.25 nM, both drugs can absolutely blocked cell cycle at G2M phase (data below 31.25 nM is not shown).\n\n\n \nFIG. 108\n shows Annexin V staining on the CAG myeloma cell lines. In early apoptotic cells, the membrane phospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, thereby exposing PS to the external cellular environment. Annexin V is a 35-36 kD Ca\n2+\n dependent phospholipids-binding protein that has a high affinity for PS, and binds to cells with exposed PS. In conjunction with a vital dye such as 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) staining dead cells, this assay allows to identify early apoptotic cells. The data showed that the majority of cells either enter apoptosis or are dead after 24 hours treatment with Fludelone or dEpoB. Note that X-axis is Annexin staining and Y-axis is 7-AAD staining.\n\n\n \nFIG. 109\n is a DNA fragmentation assay. A major biochemical hallmark of apoptosis nucleosome excision from chromatin. Nucleosome excision is caused by endonuclease-mediated digestion of the exposed DNA linker regions between nucleosome in chromatin. Since the 180-200 base pairs of DNA around a histone core are conformationally protected from digestion, this endonuclease-mediated nucleosome excision is observable as a DNA ladder in agarose gels. The data showed that typical DNA ladders were detected after treatment of RPMI8226 and CAG myeloma cells with Fludelone or dEpoB for 24 hrs. The data implicated that cell apoptosis is induced by epothilones through the caspase pathway.\n\n\n \nFIG. 110\n shows the alternation of body weight and the outcome after epothilone (20 mg/kg) treatment of disseminated CAG xenograft myeloma mice.

Mice treated with Fludelone from \nday\n 0 to 28 (20 mg/kg, Q2d) and Velcade from \nday\n 35 to 45 (6.25 ug/mouse, I.V, 3/w). The treatment started on \nday\n 10 and the images are taken after 12 dosages of Fludelone and 5 dosages of Velcade at \nday\n 59. In comparison with the images on \nday\n 40, two of three mice had significantly decreased tumor burden in both femurs and invertebrate column.\n\n\n \nFIG. 119\n is a Kaplan-Meier survival curve of seven xenografted NOD/SCID-mice with CAG myeloma cells. Control mice died within 40 days after transplanting CAG cells, and mice treated with dEpoB died within 50 days.

In general, labels typically fall into three classes: a) isotopic labels, which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes, including, but not limited to, \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n67\nGa, \n99m\nTc (Tc-99m), \n111\nIn, \n123\nI, \n125\nI, \n169\nYb, and \n186\nRe; b) immune labels, which may be antibodies or antigens, which may be bound to enzymes (such as horseradish peroxidase) that produce detectable agents; and c) colored, luminescent, phosphorescent, or fluorescent dyes. It will be appreciated that the labels may be incorporated into the compound at any position that does not interfere with the biological activity or characteristic of the compound that is being detected. In certain embodiments of the invention, photoaffinity labeling is utilized for the direct elucidation of intermolecular interactions in biological systems (e.g., to probe the epothilone binding site in a tubulin dimer). A variety of known photophores can be employed, most relying on photoconversion of diazo compounds, azides, or diazirines to nitrenes or carbenes (See, Bayley, H., Photogenerated Reagents in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (1983), Elsevier, Amsterdam.), the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. In certain embodiments of the invention, the photoaffinity labels employed are o-, m- and p-azidobenzoyls, substituted with one or more halogen moieties, including, but not limited to 4-azido-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzoic acid.\n\n\n“Polymer”: The term “polymer”, as used herein, refers to a composition comprising chains that may be open, closed, linear, branched or cross-linked of repeating units (monomers) that may be the same or different.

In certain other embodiments, the term polymer refers to synthetic polymers, such as biodegradable polymers or other polymeric materials. It will be appreciated that polymeric solid supports are also encompassed by the polymers of the present invention. Inventive compounds can be attached to polymeric supports and thus certain synthetic modifications can be conducted on the solid phase. As used herein, the term “solid support” is meant to include, but is not limited to, pellets, disks, capillaries, hollow fibers, needles, pins, solid fibers, cellulose beads, pore-glass beads, silica gels, polystyrene beads optionally cross-linked with divinylbenzene, grafted co-poly beads, poly-acrylamide beads, latex beads, dimethylacrylamide beads optionally crosslinked with N-N′-bis-acryloylethylenediamine, and glass particles coated with a hydrophobic polymer. One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the choice of particular solid support will be limited by the compatability of the support with the reaction chemistry being utilized. An exemplary solid support is a Tentagel amino resin, a composite of 1) a polystyrene bead crosslinked with divinylbenzene and 2) PEG (polyethylene glycol). Tentagel is a particularly useful solid support because it provides a versatile support for use in on-bead or off-bead assays, and it also undergoes excellent swelling in solvents ranging from toluene to water.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn recognition of the need to develop novel and effective cancer therapies, the present invention provides novel synthetic methodologies enabling access to macrocycles having a broad range of biological and pharmacological activity, as well as novel compounds with such activity, novel therapeutic compositions, and methods of using these compounds and compositions.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the inventive compounds are useful in the treatment of cancer.

Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, certain compounds of the present invention have been modified at C9 and C10 to constrain the conformation of the molecule in much the same manner as a double carbon-carbon bond at the C9-C10 position would. Electronic effects, steric effects, hydrogen bonding, dipole effects, or a combination thereof may be used to create this conformational constraint. For example, cyclic ring systems such as oxiranes, cyclopropyl, and aziridine may be used to constrain the conformation of the molecule. In \n \nother embodiments\n \n 4, 5, or 6-membered rings are used to accomplish the same effect. The effect may also be accomplished by a conjugated p-orbital system such as that found in an ester, thioester, or amide. The effect may also be accomplished by an extended delocalized pi system such as those found in an aromatic ring system. In other embodiments, the steric effects of substituents around the C9 and C10 positions are used to constrain the conformation of the molecule in the same way the molecule is constrained by a C9-C10 carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that asymmetric centers may exist in the compounds of the present invention. Thus, inventive compounds and pharmaceutical compositions thereof may be in the form of an individual enantiomer, diastereomer or geometric isomer, or may be in the form of a mixture of stereoisomers. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention are enantiopure compounds. In certain other embodiments, a mixtures of stereoisomers or diastereomers are provided.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that some of the foregoing classes and subclasses of compounds can exist in various isomeric forms. The invention encompasses the compounds as individual isomers substantially free of other isomers and alternatively, as mixtures of various isomers, e.g., racemic mixtures of stereoisomers. Additionally, the invention encompasses both (Z) and (E) double bond isomers unless otherwise specifically designated. Thus, compounds of the invention generally depicted in structures herein encompass those structures in which double bonds are (Z) or (E). In certain preferred embodiments, the double bond at the C12-C13 position is in the cis or Z configuration. In some embodiments, the double bond at the C9-C10 position is in the trans or E configuration. In still other embodiments, the double bond at the C12-C13 position is in the cis or Z configuration, and the double bond at the C9-C10 position is in the trans or E configuration. The invention also encompasses tautomers of specific compounds as described above.\n\n\nAdditionally, the present invention provides pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of the inventive compounds, and methods of treating a subject using these compounds, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, or either of these in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents. The phrase, “pharmaceutically acceptable derivative”, as used herein, denotes any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or salt of such ester, of such compound, or any other adduct or derivative which, upon administration to a patient, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound as otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof. Pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thus include among others pro-drugs. A pro-drug is a derivative of a compound, usually with significantly reduced pharmacological activity, which contains an additional moiety that is susceptible to removal in vivo yielding the parent molecule as the pharmacologically active species. An example of a pro-drug is an ester that is cleaved in vivo to yield a compound of interest. Pro-drugs of a variety of compounds, and materials and methods for derivatizing the parent compounds to create the pro-drugs, are known and may be adapted to the present invention. Certain exemplary pharmaceutical compositions and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives will be discussed in more detail herein below.\n\n\nCompounds of this invention which are of particular interest include those which:\n\n \n \n \n \nexhibit cytotoxic or growth inhibitory effect on cancer cell lines maintained in vitro or in animal studies using a scientifically acceptable cancer cell xenograft model;\n \nexhibit an ability to polymerize tubulin and stabilize microtubule assemblies;\n \nexhibit minimal levels of toxicity to vital organs;\n \nlead to tumor disappearance in scientifically acceptable cancer cell xenograft models;\n \nlead to tumor shrinkage in scientifically acceptable cancer cell xenograft models;\n \nlead to tumor disappearance in scientifically acceptable cancer cell xenograt models and delayed/or no recurrence of the tumor after stopping treatment;\n \nexhibit transient and reversible body weight decreases and show therapeutic effects in scientifically acceptable cancer cell xenograft models;\n \nexhibit enhanced water solubility over epothilones A, B, C or D, or paclitaxel, or additionally or alternatively exhibit sufficient solubility to be formulated in an aqueous medium using reduced proportion of chremophor; and/or\n \nexhibit a therapeutic profile (e.g., optimum safety and curative effect) that is superior to that of epothilone B, epothilone D, or paclitaxel.\n\n\nA variety of epothilone analogs as described supra have been prepared, characterized, and tested as exemplified herein. 9,10-dehydro-epothilone analogs have been found to be useful in the treatment of cancer, and in particular compounds have been prepared and found to possess one or more of the desired characteristics listed above.\n\n\nSynthetic Methodology\n\n \n \n \n\n\nThe synthesis of certain epothilones, desoxyepothilones and analogues thereof have been previously described (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,242,469, 6,284,781, 6,300,355, 6,204,388, 6,316,630, and 6,369,234; U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 09/797,027, 09/796,959, and 10/236,135; and PCT Publication Nos. WO 99/01124, WO 99/43653, and WO 01/64650, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference). In recognition of the need for improved or additional synthetic methodologies to efficiently generate epothilones, desoxyepothilones and analogues thereof in large quantities, the present invention provides an efficient and modular route for the synthesis of epothilones, desoxyepothilones and analogues thereof. Although the synthesis of certain exemplary compounds is described in the Exemplification herein, it will be appreciated that this methodology is generally applicable to the generation of analogues and conjugates as discussed above for each of the classes and subclasses described herein.\n\n\nIn particular, the 9,10-dehydroepothilone compounds of the present invention may be prepared in a variety of ways using synthetic methodologies useful in the synthesis of epothilones. In certain embodiments, the compounds are prepared using a convergent synthetic route. For example, the epothilone may be synthesized by preparing two or three intermediates which are brought together to yield the desired compound. In one embodiment, one of the intermediates is an acyl portion containing carbons 1-9, and another intermediate contains carbons 10-15 and may also contain the thiazole side chain. These two roughly equal portions of the epothilone may be brought together first using an esterification reaction between C-1 and an oxygen off C-15. The macrocycle may then be closed using a carbon-carbon coupling reaction such as a Suzuki coupling or ring closing metathesis reaction. In one embodiment, the final ring closing step is accomplished using a ring closing metathesis reaction to form the 9,10-double bond and close the macrocycle. The ring closing metathesis reaction is accomplished using an organometallic catalyst such as the Grubbs catalyst as shown in \nScheme\n 8 below. In certain embodiments, the 9,10-double bond is reduced or oxidized, or the 9,10-double bond may be further functionalized to prepare additional epothilone derivatives. In certain embodiments, the 9,10-double bond is converted into a cycloproyl moiety by the treatment of the 9,10-double bond with a carbene or carbenoid reagent such as CH\n2\nN\n2\n.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the 9,10-dehydroepothilone compound is prepared by the isomerization of the double from the 10,11-position (e.g., Epo490) to the 9,10-position. This isomerization may be catalyzed by the presence of a transition metal such as palladium.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the final ring closing step is accomplished using a ring closing metathesis reaction to form the 12,13-double bond and close the macrocycle. In certain embodiments, the 12,13-double bond is reduced or oxidized. In other embodiments, a macroaldolization or macrolactonization reaction is used to form the macrocycle.\n\n\nCertain exemplary syntheses of the compounds of the invention are provided in the Figures and in the Examples. As would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, a variety of analogs and derivatives may be prepared using the synthetic procedures described herein. For example, one could accomplish many of the synthetic steps with different protecting groups or different substituents on the 16-membered ring.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThis invention also provides a pharmaceutical preparation comprising at least one of the compounds as described above and herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, which compounds are capable of inhibiting the growth of or killing cancer cells, and, in certain embodiments of special interest are capable of inhibiting the growth of or killing multidrug resistant cancer cells. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical preparation also comprises as solubilizing or emulsifying agent such as Cremophor (\npolyoxyl\n 35 castor oil) or Solutol (polyethylene glycol 660 12-hydroxystrearate).\n\n\nAs discussed above, the present invention provides novel compounds having antitumor and antiproliferative activity, and thus the inventive compounds are useful for the treatment of cancer. Accordingly, in another aspect of the present invention, pharmaceutical compositions are provided, wherein these compositions comprise any one of the compounds as described herein, and optionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In certain embodiments, these compositions optionally further comprise one or more additional therapeutic agents. In certain other embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is an anticancer agent, as discussed in more detail herein.\n\n\nIt will also be appreciated that certain of the compounds of present invention can exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof. According to the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, salts of such esters, or any other adduct or derivative which upon administration to a patient in need is capable of providing, directly or indirectly, a compound as otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof, e.g., a prodrug.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge, et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in \nJ. Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n66: 1-19 (1977), incorporated herein by reference. The salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention, or separately by reacting the free base function with a suitable organic acid. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, loweralkyl sulfonate and aryl sulfonate.\n\n\nAdditionally, as used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable ester” refers to esters which hydrolyze in vivo and include those that break down readily in the human body to leave the parent compound or a salt thereof. Suitable ester groups include, for example, those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable aliphatic carboxylic acids, particularly alkanoic, alkenoic, cycloalkanoic and alkanedioic acids, in which each alkyl or alkenyl moiety advantageously has not more than 6 carbon atoms. Examples of particular esters include formates, acetates, propionates, butyrates, acrylates and ethylsuccinates.\n\n\nFurthermore, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs” as used herein refers to those prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals with undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. The term “prodrug” refers to compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formula, for example by hydrolysis in blood. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nAs described above, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which, as used herein, includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicle, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the particular dosage form desired. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fifteenth Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1975) discloses various carriers used in formulating pharmaceutical compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is incompatible with the anti-cancer compounds of the invention, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other component(s) of the pharmaceutical composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of this invention. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; Cremophor; Solutol; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil; sesame oil; olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.\n\n\nUses of Compounds and Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThe invention further provides a method for inhibiting tumor growth and/or tumor metastasis. In certain embodiments of special interest, the invention provides a method of treating cancers by inhibiting tumor growth and/or tumor metastasis for tumors multidrug resistant cancer cells. The method involves the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of the compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof to a subject (including, but not limited to a human or animal) in need of it. In certain embodiments, specifically for treating cancers comprising multidrug resistant cancer cells, the therapeutically effective amount is an amount sufficient to kill or inhibit the growth of multidrug resistant cancer cell lines. In certain embodiments, the inventive compounds are useful for the treatment of solid tumors.\n\n\nThe compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be used in treating or preventing any disease or conditions including proliferative diseases (e.g., cancer), autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), and infections (e.g., bacterial, fungal, etc.). The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to animals, preferably mammals (e.g., domesticated animals, cats, dogs, mice, rats), and more preferably humans. Any method of administration may be used to deliver the compound of pharmaceutical compositions to the animal. In certain embodiments, the compound or pharmaceutical composition is administered parenterally.\n\n\nIn yet another aspect, according to the methods of treatment of the present invention, tumor cells are killed, or their growth is inhibited by contacting the tumor cells with an inventive compound or composition, as described herein. Thus, in still another aspect of the invention, a method for the treatment of cancer is provided comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an inventive compound, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising an inventive compound to a subject in need thereof, in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result. In certain embodiments of the present invention a “therapeutically effective amount” of the inventive compound or pharmaceutical composition is that amount effective for killing or inhibiting the growth of tumor cells. The compounds and compositions, according to the method of the present invention, may be administered using any amount and any route of administration effective for killing or inhibiting the growth of tumor cells. Thus, the expression “amount effective to kill or inhibit the growth of tumor cells”, as used herein, refers to a sufficient amount of agent to kill or inhibit the growth of tumor cells. The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular anticancer agent, its mode of administration, and the like. The anticancer compounds of the invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression “dosage unit form” as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of anticancer agent appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts.\n\n\nFurthermore, after formulation with an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in a desired dosage, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In certain embodiments of the invention, the inventive compounds as described herein are formulated by conjugating with water soluble chelators, or water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol as poly (1-glutamic acid), or poly (1-aspartic acid), as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,163, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or parenterally at dosage levels sufficient to deliver from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 40 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, and more preferably from about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. The desired dosage may delivered as delivered every other day, every third day, every week, every two weeks, every three weeks, or every four weeks. In certain embodiments, the desired dosage may be delivered using multiple administrations (e.g., two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten administrations).\n\n\nLiquid dosage forms for oral and parenteral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. In certain embodiments for parenteral administration, the compounds of the invention are mixed with solubilizing agents such an Cremophor, alcohols, oils, modified oils, glycols, polysorbates, cyclodextrins, polymers, and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the compound is mixed with an alcohol, such as ethanol, and Cremophor (polyethoxylated castor oil).\n\n\nInjectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\nThe injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.\n\n\nIn order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.\n\n\nCompositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.\n\n\nSolid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.\n\n\nSolid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like.\n\n\nThe active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.\n\n\nDosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.\n\n\nAs discussed above, the compounds of the present invention are useful as anticancer agents, and thus may be useful in the treatment of cancer, by effecting tumor cell death or inhibiting the growth of tumor cells.

The following examples contain important additional information, exemplification and guidance which can be adapted to the practice of this invention in its various embodiments and equivalents thereof.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nSynthesis of 9,10-dehydro-12,13-desoxy-epothilones\n\n\nThis Example describes the synthesis of trans-9,10-dehydro-12,13-desoxyepothilone B, 26-trifluoro-trans-9,10-dehydro-12,13-desoxyepothilone B, 26-trifluoro-12,13-desoxyepothilone B, and 12,13-desoxyepothilone B and biological testing of these compounds.\n\n\nFluorinated derivatives of epothilones were prepared and tested given the enhanced pharmacokinetics and chemotherapeutic indices of other medicinal agents with fluorine substitutions (Ojima, I.; Inoue, T.; Chakravarty, S.; \nJ. Fluorine Chem. \n1999, 97; Newman, R. A.; Yang, J.; Finlay, M. R. V.; Cabral, F., Vourloumis, D.; Stephens, L. C.; Troncoso, P.; Wu, X.; Logothetis, C. J.; Nicolaou, K. C.; Navone, N. M. \nCancer Chemother. Pharmacol. \n2001, 48, 319-326; each of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reach \ncompound\n 2, we sought to take advantage of a highly convergent route recently reported from our laboratory for the synthesis of epothilone 490 (6, dehydrodeoxy Epo B) en route to dEpoB (1, Scheme 3) (Biswas, K.; Lin, H.; Njardarson, J. T.; Chappell, M. D., Chou, T. C., Guan, Y.; Tong, W. P., He, L.; Horwitz, S. B., Danishefsky, S. J. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n2002, 124 (33); 9825-9832; Rivkin, A.; Njardarson, J. T.; Biswas, K; Chou, T. C.; Danishefsky, S. J. \nJ. Org. Chem. \n2002, 67, 7737-7740; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). In that synthesis, we introduced a flanking vinyl group to compound 4 via a stereospecific Stille coupling of a \nvinyl iodide precursor\n 3 with tri-n-butylvinylstannane. Ring closing metathesis followed by deprotection led to 6, which was then transformed to dEpoB (1) via a regioselective diimide reduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttention was first directed to the synthesis of 15 (Scheme 4). Alkylation of the previously reported lithium enolate of 7 (Chappell, M. D.; Stachel, S. J.; Lee, C. B.; Danishefsky, S. J. \nOrg. Lett. \n2000, 2(11), 1633-1636; incorporated herein by reference) with iodide 8 (synthesized from the known \nalcohol\n 16 using TMSI in methylene chloride) afforded 9 in 78% yield and high diastereoselectivity (>25:1 de). \nCompound\n 9 was advanced in three steps to 10 as shown. Attempts to accomplish addition of methylmagnesium bromide to the Weinreb amide linkage of 10 failed. The breakdown of this reaction was attributed to the presence of the iodoalkene linkage. However we could accomplish our goal by changing the order of these two C—C bond forming steps. Thus, reaction of 10 with vinyltributyltin under Stille conditions could then be followed by addition of methyl Grignard reagent to give the desired \nketone\n 11. Condensation of \nketone\n 11 with \nphosphine oxide\n 12, followed by deprotection of the triethylsilyl ether, afforded \nfragment\n 13 in good yield. Esterification of the resulting 13 with C1-C10 acid fragment 14 (Biswas, K.; Lin, H.; Njardarson, J. T.; Chappell, M. D., Chou, T. C., Guan, Y.; Tong, W. P., He, L.; Horwitz, S. B., Danishefsky, S. J. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n2002, 124 (33); 9825-9832; Rivkin, A.; Njardarson, J. T.; Biswas, K; Chou, T. C.; Danishefsky, S. J. \nJ. Org. Chem. \n2002, 67, 7737-7740; incorporated herein by reference), provided the desired 15, in 75% yield (Scheme 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, attempts to carry out the ring-closing metathesis reaction of 15 using the second generation Grubbs catalyst (Reviews: Grubbs, R. H.; Miller, S. J.; Fu, G. C. \nAcc. Chem. Res. \n1995, 28, 446; Trnka, T. M.; Grubbs, R. H. \nAcc. Chem. Res. \n2001, 34, 18\n; Alkene Metathesis in Organic Chemistry \nEd.: Fürstner, A.; Springer, Berlin, 1998; Fürstner, A. \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. \n2000, 39, 3012; Schrock, R. R. \nTop. Organomet. Chem. \n1998, 1, 1; each of which is incorporated herein by reference) in methylene chloride led primarily to apparent dimerization of the starting material (Equation 1). Given the fact that the RCM works quite well in the related setting of 5→6, we naturally attributed the failure in the case of 15 to the presence of the trifluoromethyl group at C\n12\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was conjectured that the detrimental impact of the resident 26-trifluoro substitutent on the desired reaction, might be alleviated by adding a carbon spacer between the RCM reaction center and the trifluoromethyl group. Accordingly, we undertook a synthesis of 19 (Equation 2) via the ring-closing metathesis of 18, which would present the trifluoromethyl group in the context of a 17-membered ring containing a shipped (1,4)-diene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe synthesis program directed to 19 commenced with the preparation of \ncompound\n 21, which corresponds to the O-alkyl sector of our proposed RCM substrate (Scheme 5). We began with allylation of 10, this time under radical reaction conditions as shown (Keck, G. E.; Yates, J. B. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n1982, 104, 5829; review: Curran, D. P. \nSynthesis \n1988, \nPart\n 1, pp 417-439; \nPart\n 2, pp. 489; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). This conversion was followed by reaction of the alkylated product with methyl magnesium bromide, thus affording the required \nketone\n 20. Condensation of this compound with \nphosphine oxide\n 12, followed by deprotection of the triethylsilyl ether function provided 21 in good yield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEsterification of 21 with the C1-\nC10 acid fragment\n 14, provided the proposed \nRCM precursor\n 18 in 75% yield (Scheme 6). Happily in this case, the ring-closing metathesis reaction of 18 could be accomplished using the second generation Grubbs catalyst in methylene chloride. As in the case of the conversion of 5→6, the reaction provided exclusively the \ntrans isomer\n 22 in 57% yield.\n6 \nFinally, reductive cleavage of the trichloro ethoxycarbonyl protecting group with zinc and acetic acid, followed by deprotection of the TES ether with HF-pyridine, provided the desired 19 containing a trifluoromethyl function at C\n12\n, albeit in the context of the 17-membered ring series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSynthetic\n 19 was evaluated as to its cytotoxic activity. As shown in Table 1-1 below, direct comparison of the previously reported [17]ddEpoB (23) with 27-F\n3\n-[17]ddEpoB (19) indicated that the new perfluorinated compound possessed a comparably high cytotoxic potency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn vitro Cytotoxicities (IC\n50\n) with tumor cell lines\na\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCCRF-CEM\n\n\nCCRF-CEM/VBL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\n(IC\n50 \n(μM)\na\n)\n\n\n(IC\n50 \n(μM)\na\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n27-F\n3\n-[17]ddEpoB (19)\n\n\n0.068\n\n\n0.191\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[17]ddEpoB (23)\n\n\n0.040\n\n\n0.126\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[16]ddEpoB (6)\n\n\n0.020\n\n\n0.068\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nXTT assay following 72 h inhibition. CCRF-CEM is a human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. The CCRF-CEM/\nVBL100\n, CCRF-CEM/\nVM1 \nand CCRF-CEM/\nTaxol \ncell lines all overexpress P-glycoprotein and display a multidrug resistance phenotype to MDR associated oncolytics (Ojima, I.; Inoue, T.; Chakravarty, S.; J. Fluorine Chem. 1999, 97; Newman, R. A.; Yang, J.; Finlay, M. R. V.; Cabral, F., Vourloumis, D.; Stephens, L. C.; Troncoso, P.; Wu, X.; Logothetis, C. J.; Nicolaou, K. C.; Navone, N. M. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2001, 48, 319-326; each of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough the trifluoromethyl isoteric substitution had little effect on the gross cytotoxic activity, preliminary data from metabolic degradation studies in mouse plasma showed 19 to be notably more stable than is the \nparent\n 23. Exposure of \n \nepothilones\n \n 19 and 23 to nude mouse and human plasma led to degradation of 23 within 30 minutes, while \nepothilone\n 19 remained mostly intact. Since pharmokinetic issues are likely to be critical in the actual use of any epothilone agent as a drug, we take this finding to be quite encouraging.\n\n\nThe synthesis of 26-F\n3\n-dEpoB (2) could be accomplished via a highly convergent strategy, related to that employed in the synthesis of 27-F\n3\n-[17]ddEpoB (19). Accordingly, fragments of similar complexity would serve as key building blocks (Scheme 7). We envisioned that the \nacyl sector\n 25, could serve as the polypropionate domain and the \n \nalkyl sector\n \n 21 or 24 would be prepared as previously described in the introduction. The union of the two fragments 21(24) and 25 would be initiated through an esterification and consumated via a subsequent ring-closing metathesis. Finally, cleavage of the protecting groups would provide the desired \n \nanalogs\n \n 28 and 29. Chemoselective reduction of the 9,10-olefin of 28 and 29 would furnish dEpoB (1) and the desired 26-F\n3\n-12,13-desoxyEpoB (2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe synthesis of 1 and 2 commenced with the preparation of \nacyl sector\n 25. \nKetone\n 30, previously reported, was subjected to an aldol reaction with the readily \navailable aldehyde\n 31. Upon deprotonation and reaction of “lithio” 30 with 31, smooth condensation gave rise to a 5.3:1 mixture of \n \naldol products\n \n 32 and 33. The \nmajor diastereoisomer\n 32 was easily separated by flash chromatography and protected as a TBS silyl ether. Hydrolysis of the diisopropyl acetal group under acid catalysis gave \nketo aldehyde\n 34, setting the stage for the second aldol reaction. Following the previously practiced “titano” tert-butyl ester method, with the \nnew aldehyde\n 34 as the coupling partner, the desired \naldol product\n 35 was obtained in high diastereoselectivity (dr>20:1) and yield (86%). Protection of the C3 alcohol of 35 with a TES silyl group was followed by deprotection of the benzyl ether. Oxidation of the resultant primary hydroxy provided the corresponding aldehyde, which was then converted to a terminal olefin via a Wittig reaction to provide 36 in high yield. Finally, hydrolysis of the t-butyl ester of 36 with TESOTf provided the acyl sector 25 (82%) along with side-product 37 (14%), which was converted to \nacyl sector\n 38 in high yield. Spectral and chromatographic properties of 38 were identical to previously obtained material from other programs in Dr. Sinha's laboratories (Scripps).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEsterification of the \n \nallylic alcohols\n \n 21 and 24 with C\n1\n-C\n9 \nacid fragment 25 provided the corresponding \n \nRCM cyclization precursors\n \n 26 and 27, respectively (Scheme 9).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe ring-closing \n \n \nmetathesis reactions\n \n \n 26, 27 and 54 were then carried out using the second generation Grubbs catalyst in toluene, which provided, as in our earlier study, exclusively the \ntrans isomer\n 39a, 40a, and 55 along with the \ncorresponding side products\n 39b, 40b, and 56. Finally, deprotection of silyl ethers with HF-pyridine led to the desired compounds 28, 29, and 57. Spectral and chromatographic properties of 28 were not identical to previously obtained material from the epothilone program in Dr. James D. White's laboratories (Oregon State University). Dr. James D. White thought he had synthesized 28, however inadvertently he made the 12,\n13E isomer\n 41 instead, which would explain the poor biological activity he observed. Consequently, we are the first ones to have synthesized 28 and tested this compound for its antitumor activity.\n\n\n\nThe fully synthetic 28, 29, and 2 have been evaluated against a variety of cell types to determine their antitumor potential. As shown in Table 1-2, all three compounds exhibited high cytotoxic activity against a variety of sensitive and resistant tumor cell lines. Direct comparison of 28 with the previously reported dEpoB (1) indicates that the new compound possesses nearly three times more potency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn vitro Cytotoxicities (IC\n50\n) with tumor cell lines\na\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50 \n(μM)\na\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTumor Cell Lines\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n29\n\n\ndEpoB (1)\n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCRF-CEM\n\n\n0.0014\n\n\n0.0035\n\n\n0.0036\n\n\n0.00051\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCRF-CEM/VBL\n100\n \n\n\n0.0065\n\n\n0.0210\n\n\n0.014\n\n\n0.0106\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCRF-CEM/Taxol\n\n\n0.0017\n\n\n0.0057\n\n\n0.0057\n\n\n0.00073\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nXTT assay following 72 h inhibition. CCRF-CEM is a human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. The CCRF-CEM/\nVBL100\n, CCRF-CEM/\nVM1 \nand CCRF-CEM/\nTaxol \ncell lines all overexpress P-glycoprotein and display a multidrug resistance phenotype to MDR associated oncolytics (Prié, G.; Thibonnet, J.; Abarbri, M.; Duchêne, A.; Parrain, \nJ. Synlett\n 1998, 839; incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo improve the overall yield of our synthesis of 28, 29, and 2, we decided to carry out the RCM reaction in the absense of the thiazole substituted olefin and in so doing avoid the formation of the undesired side product 39b and 40b. Deprotection of the silyl ether of the previously reported 42 and 20 provided hydroxyketones 43 and 44. Esterification of the resultant hydroxyketones 43 and 44 with C\n1\n-C\n9 \nacid fragment 25 provided the corresponding \n \nRCM cyclization precursors\n \n 45 and 46, respectively (Scheme 10). The ring-closing metathesis reaction of 45 and 46 was then carried out using the second generation Grubbs catalyst in toluene, which provided, as in our earlier study, exclusively the \ntrans isomer\n 47 and 48 in high yields. Installation of the thiazole moiety gave 39a, 40a, and 55 in high yield. Deprotection of the two silyl ethers with HF-pyridine led to 28 and 29. Finally, selective reduction of the C9-C10 olefin afforded the \n \ncorresponding epothilones\n \n 1 and 2. The structure of 28 was rigorously corroborated by its high yielding conversion to 1. The total synthesis of 1 has been very substantially simplified relative to previously practiced routes. Thus the use of the readily available 31, obtained from the chiral pool, is certainly a large improvement relative to reliance on (S)-2-methyl-4-pentenal whose synthesis requires intervening chiral auxilliaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith \ncompound\n 28 of rigorously proven structure in hand, we were surprised to find that its spectral properties were not congruent with those previously reported for a compound presumed to be the same entity. However it is clear in retrospect that 28 had not been previously prepared and, in fact the whole family of (E)-9,10-dehydroepothilones reported here is a new class of compounds.\n\n\nExamination of synthetic analogs (2, 28, and 29), in cell culture settings, revealed stronger inhibitory effects on various sensitive and MDR tumor cell lines than are exhibited by our clinical entry dEpoB (1) (Table 1-3). We note that Epo 3 (28) is the first 12,13-desoxyepothilone compound that possessrd substantially improved cytotoxicity relative to that of dEpoB (1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn vitro Cytotoxicities (IC\n50\n) with Tumor Cell Lines\na\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCCRF-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCEM(C)\n\n\nC/VBL\n100\n \n\n\nC/Taxol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEpo 1 (1, dEpoB)\n\n\n0.0036\n\n\n0.016\n\n\n0.0046\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEpo 2 (2)\n\n\n0.0041\n\n\n0.080\n\n\n0.018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEpo 3 (28)\n\n\n0.0009\n\n\n0.0042\n\n\n0.0012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEpo 4 (29)\n\n\n0.0035\n\n\n0.0210\n\n\n0.0057\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nXTT assay following 72 h inhibition. CCRF-CEM is a human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. The CCRF-CEM/VBL\n100 \ncell line is resistant to vinblastine and CCRF-CEM/Taxol to taxol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impressive cell growth inhibition exhibited by \n \nepothilones\n \n 2, 28 and 29 (Epo 2-4) across a range of various drug-resistant tumors prompted determination of the blood plasma stability of these new (E)-9,10 congeners. For instance the recently described (E)-10,11-dehydro-dEpoB (of \ncase\n 1 with a CH\n3 \ngroup at C-12) exhibits very poor plasma stability with respect to lactone opening. It is this plasma instability which has stifled advancement of (E)-10,11-dehydro-dEpoB. By contrast, on exposure of 2, 28 and 29 (Epo 2-4) to murine plasma, we observed a much slower drug degradation as compared to dEpoB (1) by a factor of seven. This stability constitutes a substantial advance from a drug availability perspective relative to dEpoB (see \nFIG. 9\n).\n\n\nThe combination of the cytotoxicity and plasma stability data encourged us to synthesize substantial amounts of 28 (Epo 3) in order to determine its in vivo efficacy, in nude mice bearing human tumor xenografts. Epothilone 28 (Epo 3) demonstrated a markedly improved potency in inhibiting on the growth of implanted tumors, relative to dEpoB (see \nFIG. 10\n). The improved potency and plasma stability allows very substantial reduction of drug dosing (an order of magnitude) in the context of xenografts of 28 (Epo 3).\n\n\nIn our early studies we had found that epothilone B, by way of the 12,13 epoxide, is significantly more cytotoxic than is its 12,13-desoxy analog (dEpoB). However, from the perspective of theraputic index, the desoxy compound seemed to us to be more much promising. More recently, we reported the total synthesis of (E)-9,10-dehydro-12,13-desoxyepothilone B (28) using a stereoselective ring closing metathesis. We showed that the incorporation of E-9,10 unsaturation in the context of the usual Z-12,13 olefin (see compound 1) results in a great increase in in vitro potency. More to the point, this is translatable to an in vivo setting in xenografts mice. Moreover, \ncompound\n 28 enjoys major pharmaceutical advantages relative to dEpoB (1). This allowed for the reduction of the dosing levels for 28 relative to 1 in xenograft experiments to be reduced by an order of magnitude.\n\n\nAccordingly, we wondered if the incorporation of C9-C10 olefin in epothilone B (51, EpoB) would alter its biological profile in the same direction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nEpoxidation of 28 with 2,2′-dimethydroxirane (DMDO) proceeded with high chemoselectively at the more substituted C12-C13 olefin to give an 87% yield of a 1:2.6 ratio of the (E)-9,10-dehydroepothilone B (49) and its diastereomer (50). The stereochemistry of the epoxides was determined by selective diimide reduction of the C9-C10 double bonds. Examination of the spectral properties of these products revealed the minor product (49) to be dEpoB. The preference for α-epoxidation in the case of 28 stands in striking contrast to the highly stereoselective epoxidation of dEpoB, which occurs from the β face leading to EpoB (Meng, D.; Bertinato, P.; Balog, A.; Su, D.-S.; Kamenecka, T.; Sorensen, E.

As shown in Table 1-4, (E)-9,10-dehydroepothiloneB (49) exhibits high cytotoxic activity against a variety of sensitive and resistant tumor cell lines. Direct comparison of 49 and EpoB (51) indicates this new analog possesses nearly 3-fold more potency than EpoB (51) making it one of the most potent epothilone analogs reported to date. Interestingly, α-epoxide series (50, 52) displayed a much lower activity than EpoB (51).

CCRF-CEM is a human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line.

The described herein strategy was then straightforwardly applied to the preparation of the \ncorresponding trifluoro analogs\n 2 and 29 (Epo 4). Furthermore, epoxidation of 28 provided 49 and 50, which upon site-selective diimide reduction gave Epothilone B (51) and 52. The data reported above point to the emergence of a most promising new family of anticancer drugs appropiate for further evaluation en route to then possible advancement to a human clinical setting. Furthermore the new synthesis strategy comprises a significant practical improvement in the total synthesis of dEpoB and Epothilone B.\n\n\nExperimentals\n\n\nGeneral Methods: Reagents obtained from commercial suppliers were used without further purification unless otherwise noted. The following solvents were obtained from a dry solvent system (passed through a prepacked column of alumina) and used without further drying: tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride, diethyl ether, benzene, and toluene. All air and water sensitive reactions were performed in flame-dried glassware under a positive pressure of prepurified argon gas. NMR (\n1\nH and \n13\nC) spectra were recorded on Bruker AMX-400 MHz or Bruker Advance DRX-500 MHz as noted individually, referenced to CDCl\n3 \n(7.27 ppm for \n1\nH and 77.0 ppm for \n13\nC). Infrared spectra (IR) were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR model 1600 spectrometer. Optical rotations were obtained on a JASCO model DIP-370 digital polarimeter at 22±2° C. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on E. \nMerck silica gel\n 60 F254 plates. Compounds which were not UV active were visualized by dipping the plates in a eerie ammonium molybdate or para-anisaldehyde solution and heating. Silica gel chromatography was performed using the indicated solvent on Davisil® (grade 1740, type 60A, 170-400 mesh) silica gel.\n\n\nAcronyms and Abbreviations\n\n\nTES, triethylsilyl; TBS, Dimethyltertbutylsilyl; EDCI, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; HF-PY, hydrogen fluoride in pyridine; DMAP, 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine; DCM, dichloromethane; DMF, N,N-dimethylformamide; THF, tetrahydrofuran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound 32: To a solution of freshly prepared LDA (11.6 mmol) in THF (25 mmol) was added dropwise a solution of ketone 30 (2.40 g, 10.4 mmol) in THF (6.8 mL) at −78° C.

Rivkin et al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n2003, 125, 2899; incorporated herein by reference). Following correlation of in vitro and in vivo experiments directed to MX-1 tumor types, it was apparent that 28 is inherently more cytotoxic than 2b. However, another contributing factor is that the lactone moiety in the 9,10-dehydro series is significantly more stable in mouse and human plasma than is the case for 9,10-dehydro congeners. The sum of these two complementary effects was to render 28 capable of accomplishing complete suppression of tumor in a variety of xenografts at 3 mg/kg as opposed to 30 mg/kg regiment for 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon suspension of treatment, palpable tumors re-appear in some fraction of the animals. Accordingly, at least at present, fully synthetic 28 has not fully met the stringent standards of highly favorable effective therapeutic index and elimination of tumors to a non-relapsing state.\n\n\nThese findings directed our attention to the consequences of substituting the three hydrogens of the 26-methyl group of 28 with three fluorine atoms. Incorporation of the fluorine atoms at this site led to improved stability of the 12,13-double bond toward oxidation (Smart, B. E. \nJ. Fluorine Chem. \n2001, 109, 3; incorporated herein by reference). Previous experience had pointed toward some attenuation of cytotoxicity, by placement of polar groups in the area of the C12-C13 double bond (A. Rivkin et al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n2003, 125, 2899; incorporated herein by reference). In this disclosure, we report the discovery, through total chemical synthesis, of the 9,10-dehydro-26-trifluoroepothilones, focusing particularly on the unique biological performance of \nparent structure\n 29.\n\n\nThe therapeutic efficacy of dEpoB (30 mg/kg), paclitaxel (20 mg/kg) and F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB (29, 20 and 30 mg/kg) against human mammary carcinoma MX-1 xenografts in terms of tumor disappearance and relapse were closely studied, and the results are shown in Table 10-1. Each dose group consisted of four or more nude mice. Body weight refers to total body weight minus tumor weight. All three compounds achieved tumor disappearance. On \nday\n 10 after suspension of treatment, 5/10 (dEpoB), 2/7 (Paclitaxel), and 0/4 (compound 29) mice relapsed. Extended observation following suspension of treatment with 20 mg/kg dosages of 29 showed a long term absence of tumors until \nday\n 27 at which \npoint\n 2 out of 4 mice's tumors relapsed. Remarkably, treatment with 30 mg/kg dosages of 29, resulted in complete tumor disappearance and the absence of any relapse for over two months after suspension of treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherapeutic effect of dEpoB, Paclitaxel and F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB against MX-1 xenograft in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnude mice\n[a]\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nChanges of body weight (%)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOn \nday\n 4\n\n\nOn \nday\n 8\n\n\nTumor free after\n\n\nTumor reappeared\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDosage\n\n\nafter stopping\n\n\nafter stopping\n\n\nQ2Dx6\n\n\non \nday\n 10 after\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug\n\n\n(mg/kg)\n\n\n \nadministration\n \n \nadministration\n \n \n\n\n6 hr-iv.

No further tumor reappearance during the 28th-64th days after stopping treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n[c]\nNo tumor reappearance during 64 days after stopping treatment when experiment terminated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLowering the dose of \nagent\n 29 to 10 mg/kg (Q2D) also led to MX-1 tumor disappearance, but nine doses were required to achieve this result (\nFIGS. 57\n, \n58\n and \n59\nA). As an added challenge, chemotherapeutic treatment was delayed until the tumor size reached 0.5 g (˜2.3% of body weight). Treatment with 25 mg/kg (Q2Dx7) dosages of 29, caused 4/4 of the mouse tumors to disappear. By contrast for dEpoB, 30 mg/kg dosages (Q2Dx8) were required to induce the disappearance of tumors in 3 of 4 mice. However, unlike the case with 29, the apparent disappearances that occurred following treatment with dEpoB were subject to relapses with time. (\nFIG. 59B\n).\n\n\nThe fact that \nagent\n 29 completely suppressed the growth of the human mammary carcinoma MX-1 xenografts, shrank the tumors and made them disappear for as long as 64 days is impressive. Moreover, following the cures accomplished by 29, (20 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg Q2Dx6, i.v.-6 hr infusion, Table 1, above) the body weight of the xenografts returned to pretreatment control level within 12-18 days after suspension of treatment. This finding suggests the lack of vital organ damage. At a curative low dosage of 10 mg/kg, Q2DX12 (\nFIG. 59B\n), the maximal body weight decrease was only 12%, with a body weight gain of 6% during the last three doses. The body weight recovered to the pretreatment control level only three days after cessation of treatment. Table 1 above shows that the animals could survive body weight losses of as much as 27%. The therapeutic safety margin realized herein is remarkably broad for a curative cancer therapeutic agent.\n\n\nThe therapeutic efficacy of 29 against human lung carcinoma xenograft (A549) and the paclitaxel resistant human lung carcinoma A549/Taxol xenografts were also evaluated (\nFIGS. 59C and 59D\n). The slow growing lung carcinoma xenografts A549 were treated with 29 (25 mg/kg, Q2DX6, twice, eight days apart), which resulted in 99.5% tumor suppression with the eventual complete eradication of 4 of the 4 tumors after two more doses (\nFIG. 59C\n). Interestingly, the body weight of the mice decreased as much as 35% without any lethality and suspension of the treatment led to rapid body weight recovery to near the pretreatment control level (\nFIG. 59C\n). In contrast, a parallel study with dEpoB (30 mg/kg, Q2Dx6) resulted in 97.6% tumor suppression but led to no tumor eradication. In an additional study of 29 (20 mg/kg dosage) against A549/Taxol resistant xenograft (\nFIG. 59D\n), tumor growth was totally suppressed and the tumor eventually reduced by 24.4% of the pretreatment control. During this study, the maximal body weight decreased by 24%, however upon suspension of drug treatment the body weight recovered to 90% of the pretreatment control. In a comparison study of (E)-9,10-dehydro-dEpoB (28, 4 mg/kg group), tumor growth was suppressed by 41.6%.\n\n\nThe pertinent data for analyzing what factors endow \ncompound\n 29 with its remarkable therapeutic index in conjunction with comparable data pertinent to closely related congeners are provided in Table 10-2. One notes that in terms of inherent cytotoxicity in moving from EpoB(2b) to dEpoB (1) a whole order of magnitude is lost. About 60% of this loss is restored in the case of 9,10-dehydro-dEpoB (28). Some of this inherent cytotoxicity is forfeited in going to 29, which at least in the cell is ˜1.8 fold as cytotoxic as the benchmark compound dEpoB.\n\n\nWe note that among the 12,13-dehydroepothilones, 29 exhibits by far the best stability in mouse plasma and is also the most stable in human liver S9 plasma. We also note that, in the 2-sets of 12,13-dehydro isomers, the 26-trifluoro pattern carries with it decreased lypophilicity and somewhat increased water solubility (Table 10-2, below). For the moment it would appear that the great advantage of 29 arises from improvements in serum stability and bioavailability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfile of dEpoB derivatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMaximal\n\n\nStability half-life\n\n\n \n\n\nTherapeutic\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nb.w. %\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman\n\n\n \n\n\nLipophilicity\n\n\ndose regimen\n\n\nRelative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCytotoxic\n\n\ndrop\n\n\nMouse\n\n\nLiver S9\n\n\nSolubility\n\n\noctanol/water\n\n\nfor \nQ2D\n 6 hr-\n\n\ntherapuetic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEfficacy\n\n\nwithout\n\n\nplasma\n\n\nFraction\n\n\nin water\n\n\npartition\n\n\niv infusion\n\n\nindex at\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(nM)\n[a]\n \n\n\ndeath\n\n\n(min)\n\n\n(hr)\n\n\n(μg/mL)\n\n\n(POW)\n\n\n(mg/kg)\n\n\nMTD\n[b]\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpoB (2b)\n\n\n0.53 ± 0.2 \n\n\n15\n\n\n57\n\n\n15.8\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n0.6-0.8\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndEpoB (1)\n\n\n5.6 ± 2.8\n\n\n32\n\n\n46 ± 7\n\n\n1.0 ± 0.1\n\n\n9.4\n\n\n4.4\n\n\n25-30\n\n\n++++\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeH-dEpoB (28)\n\n\n0.90 ± 0.40\n\n\n29\n\n\n84 ± 6\n\n\n4.9 ± 0.7\n\n\n27\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n3-4\n\n\n++++\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF\n3\n-dEpoB (2)\n\n\n9.3 ± 5.2\n\n\n22\n\n\n66 ± 7\n\n\n1.6 ± 0.4\n\n\n8\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n15-20\n\n\n++\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF\n3\n-deH-dEpoB\n\n\n3.2 ± 0.3\n\n\n33\n\n\n212 ± 88\n\n\n10.5 ± 2.3 \n\n\n20\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n10-30\n\n\n+++++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(29)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n[a]\nIC\n50 \nvalues are for CCRF-CEM leukemic cells.

The therapeutic experiment for epothilones against human xenografts in nude mice, such as MX-1, were studied in Chou, T. C. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998, 95, 15798 and in 2001, 98, 8113.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the agents, 1-2 and 28-29, were initially discovered through total synthesis. A practical synthesis of 1 has been previously described (Rivkin et al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n2003, 125, 2899; White et al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n2001, 123, 5407; Yoshimura et al. \nAngew. Chem. \n2003, 42, 2518; Rivkin et al. \nJ. Org. Chem. \n2002, 124, 7737; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). First generation discovery level routes to 28 and 29 have also been described. Selective reduction of the 9,10-double bond of 29 afforded 2. The remarkable results obtained from xenograft studies described above, for what is currently the most \npromising compound\n 29, clearly called for its advancement for detailed toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies in higher animals and, from there if appropiate, advancement to human clinical trials. Such prospects totally altered the nature of the synthesis challenge from the preparation of probe samples, to that of producing multigram quantities of these new epothilone agents. A major revamping of our previous routes, initially conceived and demonstrated in a discovery setting, has been accomplished. In particular our new protocols accomplished major simplifications in the stereospecific elaborations of \n \ncarbons\n \n 3 and 26. \nAlcohol\n 32 is prepared as described earlier (Rivkin et al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n2003, 125, 2899; incorporated herein by reference). It will be noted that in the new synthesis, \n \n \nstereocenters\n \n \n 6, 7, and 8 are derived from the trivially \navailable ketone\n 30 and \naldehyde\n 31. Upon alcohol protection and acetal hydrolysis, the corresponding aldehyde was condensed with t-butyl acetate to afforded an aldol like product. Since this condensation is not diastereomerically-controlled, a remedial measure was necessary and achieved. Oxidation of this 1:1 mixture of C3 epimers, afforded \nketone\n 69. Following a highly successful Noyori reduction (Noyori et al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n1987, 109, 5856; incorporated herein by reference) under the conditions shown, \nalcohol\n 70 was in hand. Preparation of \nacid\n 25 was then accomplished in a few additional simple steps as shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new, straightforward and readily scalable synthesis has also been developed for 90 (Scheme 13). The synthesis starts with reaction of commerically available trifluoro ketoester 82 with allyl indium bromide. The key step in the synthesis is the positionally specific and stereospecific dehydration of the resulting tertiary alcohol to produce 84 (in 65% overall yield for two steps). The stereocontrol of this reaction arises from a “dipolar effect” wherein the strongly electron-withdrawing CF\n3 \nand CO\n2\nEt groups are best presented trans with respect to the emerging double bond. The required \niodide\n 86 was obtained in two steps from 84. Alkylation of the previously reported lithium enolate of 7 with \niodide\n 86 in THF afforded 88 in 81% yield and high diastereoselectivity (>25:1 de). Following deprotection of the secondary alcohol, \ncompound\n 88 was advanced in three steps to 90 as shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith 25 and 90 in hand by easily processable chemistry, the route to 29 was clear following protocols first developed in our discovery phase (A. Rivkin et al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n2003, 125, 2899; incorporated herein by reference). The key ring-closing metathesis reaction of 25 was carried out in toluene using the second generation Grubbs catalyst (Grubbs, R. H.; Miller, S. J.; Fu, G. C. \nAcc. Chem. Res. \n1995, 28, 446; Trnka, T. M.; Grubbs, R. H. \nAcc. Chem. Res. \n2001, 34, 18\n; Alkene Metathesis in Organic Chemistry \nEd.: Fürstner, A.; Springer, Berlin, (1998); Fürstner, A. \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. \n2000, 39, 3012; Schrock, R. R. \nTop. Organomet. Chem. \n1998, 1, 1; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). The reaction afforded, exclusively the \ntrans isomer\n 48 in 71% yield. Installation of the thiazole moiety via the protocol shown in \nScheme\n 14 was followed by removal of the two silyl protecting groups with HF-pyridine thereby leading to 29, which was then converted via reduction of the 9,10-olefin to 2 in high yield. Gram quantities of structurally novel epothilones have been prepared by total syntheses in the setting of an academic scale laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimentals\n\n\nGeneral Methods: Reagents obtained from commercial suppliers were used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Methylene chloride was obtained from a dry solvent system (passed through a prepacked column of alumina) and used without further drying. All air and water sensitive reactions were performed in flame-dried glassware under a positive pressure of prepurified argon gas. NMR (\n1\nH and \n13\nC) spectra were recorded on Bruker AMX-400 MHz or Bruker Advance DRX-500 MHz as noted individually, referenced to CDCl\n3 \n(7.27 ppm for \n1\nH and 77.0 ppm for \n13\nC) or CD\n2\nCl\n2 \n(5.32 ppm for \n1\nH and 53.5 ppm for \n13\nC). Infrared spectra (IR) were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR model 1600 spectrometer. Optical rotations were obtained on a JASCO model DIP-370 digital polarimeter. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on E. \nMerck silica gel\n 60 F254 plates. Compounds which were not LTV active were visualized by dipping the plates in para-anisaldehyde solution and heating. Preparative thin layer chromatography was performed using the indicated solvent on Whatman® (LK6F Silica gel 60A) TLC plate.\n\n\nChemicals. All epothilones were synthesized in-house (C. R. Harris, S. J. Danishefsky, \nJ. Org. Chem. \n1999, 64, 8434; D.-S. Su et al. \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. \n1997, 36, 2093; Smart, B. E. \nJ. Fluorine Chem. \n2001, 109, 3; F. Yoshimura, et al. Angew. \nChem. \n2003, 42, 2518; Rivkin et al. \nJ. Org. Chem. \n2002, 124, 7737; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). Paclitaxel (Taxol®) and vinblastine sulfate (VBL) were purchased from Sigma. All these compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide for the in vitro assays, (except VBL in saline). For in vivo studies, all epothilones and paclitaxel were dissolved in Cremophor/ethanol (1:1) vehicle and then diluted with saline for iv infusion for 6 hrs via tail vein using a custom-designed mini-catheter (T.-C. Chou et al. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. \n2001, 98, 8113-8118; T.-C. Chou et al. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n1998, 95, 15798-15802; each of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nTumor and Cell Lines. The CCRF-CEM human lymphoblastic leukemia cells were obtained from Dr. William Beck of the University of Illinois, Chicago. Human mammary carcinoma (MX-1) and human lung carcinoma cells (A549) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, Md.). The paclitaxel-resistant A549/taxol cells (44-fold resistance) were developed with the method as described above (T.-C. Chou et al. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. \n2001, 98, 8113-8118; incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nAnimals. Athymic nude mice bearing the nu/nu gene were obtained from NCI, Frederick, Md. and used for all human tumor xenografts. Male \nnude mice\n 6 weeks or older weighing 20-22 g or more were used. Drugs were administered via the tail vein for 6 hours by i.v. infusion using a home-made infusion mini-catheter and containment tube (T.-C. Chou et al. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. \n2001, 98, 8113-8118; incorporated herein by reference). A programmable Harvard PHD2000 syringe pump with multitrack was used for i.v. infusion. A typical 6 hrs infusion volume for each drug in Cremophor/ethanol (1:1) was 100 ml in 2.0 ml of saline. Tumor volume was assessed by measuring length×width×height (or width) by using a caliper. For tumor-bearing nude mice during the course of experiment, the body weight refers to total weight minus the weight of the tumor. All animal studies conducted in accordance with the guidelines for the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Animals and the protocol approved by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n\nCytotoxicity Assays. In preparation for in vitro cytotoxicity assays, cells were cultured at an initial density 2-5×10\n4 \ncells per milliliter. They were maintained in a 5% CO\n2\n-humidified atmosphere at 37° C. in RPMI medium 1640 (GIBCO/BRL) containing penicillin (100 units/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL, GIBCO/BRL), and 5% heat-inactivated FBS. For solid tumor cells growing in a monolayer (such as A549), cytotoxicity of the drug was determined in 96-well microtiter plates by using the sulforhodamine B method (P. Skehan et al. \nJ. Natl. Cancer. Inst. \n1990, 82, 1107-1112; incorporated herein by reference). For cells grown in suspension (such as CCRF-CEM and its sublines), cytotoxicity was measured, in duplicate, by using the 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-carboxanilide)-2H-terazodium hydroxide (XTT) microculture method (D. A. Scudiero et al. \nCancer Res. \n1988, 48, 4827-4833; incorporated herein by reference) in 96-well microtiter plates. For both methods, the absorbance of each well was measured with a microplate reader (Power Wave XS, Bio-Tek, Winooski, Vt.). Dose-effect relationship data from 6 to 7 concentrations of each drug, in duplicate, were analyzed with the median-effect plot by using a computer program (T.-C. Chou, M. Hayball. \nCalcuSyn for Windows\n, Multiple-drug dose effect analyzer and manual. Biosoft, Cambridge Place, Cambridge, UK (1997); incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nStability of epothilones in mouse and in human liver S9 fraction. The stability study was carried out with a fully automated HPLC system which consisted of a Prospekt-2 (Spark Holland, Netherlands) sample preparation system and an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. Briefly, the \nProspekt\n 2 picked up a C8 extraction cartridge and washed it with acetonitrile and water. The Agilent autosampler, set at 37° C., picked up 20 μl of the sample, loaded it onto the cartridge, washed it with water, then the Prospekt-2 diverted the mobile phase stream through the extraction cartridge onto the analytical column, Reliance \nStable Bond C8\n 4×80 mm with guard column (MacMod, Chadds Ford, Pa.) and the eluent was monitored at 250 nm. The mobile phase consisted of 53 or 65% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid at 0.4 ml/min, so that the retention time of the compound of interest was about 6 minutes. Sample preparation involved the addition of equal volumes of plasma to PBS for a total volume of 300-400 μl, filtered, and the addition of 0.5-2 μl of the substrate (20 mM) to achieve about 30-50 mAU at 250 nm in the HPLC analysis. For pooled human liver microsome S9 fraction (Xeno Tech, Lenex, Kans.), 20 μl (400 μg) or S9 fraction was mixed with 280 μl of PBS then proceeded as above. The sampling period was controlled by the autosampler and peak area data were collected to compare the rate of disappearance of the parent compound.\n\n\nDetermination of partition of octanol-water (POW) number. An HPLC method is used to estimate octanol-water partition. An Agilent 1100 HPLC system is used with an eclipse XDB C18 column 4.6×250 mm with a mobile phase of 60% acetonitrile/40% 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 with a flow rate of 0.8 ml per min. and the eluent is monitored at 250 nm. The standards used are benzyl alcohol, acetophenone, benzophenone, naphthalene, diphenyl ether and dibenzyl with known POW of 1.1, 1.7, 3.2, 4.2, and 4.8 respectively. Sodium dichromate is used to evaluate time zero which is 2.5 min and the retention times for the standards are 3.9, 5.4, 10.6, 14, 18.7 and 19.8 min, respectively. The k value is calculated by the formula of k=(t\nrt\n−t\n0\n)/t\n0\n. Linear regression of log k vs. log POW gives a straight line with r\n2\n=0.966. This graph is used to evaluate the POW value of the epothilone analogs.\n\n\nSpectroscopic Data for 29 (26-trifluoro-(E)-9,10-dehydro-dEpoB)\n\n\n[α]\nD\n \n25 \n−54.6 (c 0.28, CHCl\n3\n); IR (film) ν 3478, 2974, 2929, 1736, 1689, 1449, 1381, 1318, 1247, 1169, 1113, 1039, 983, 867, 736 cm\n−1\n; \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, CDCl\n3\n) δ 1.05 (3H, s), 1.12 (3H, d, J=7.0 Hz), 1.23 (3H, d, J=6.8 Hz), 1.37 (3H, s), 2.04 (1H, brd, J=3.8 Hz, —OH), 2.12 (3H, s), 2.25-2.33 (1H, m), 2.38 (1H, dd, J=15.3 and 3.0 Hz), 2.48 (1H, dd, J=15.4 and 9.8 Hz), 2.54-2.61 (1H, m), 2.66-2.76 (1H, m), 2.71 (3H, s), 2.96 (1H, dd, J=16.5 and 4.5 Hz), 3.02 (1H, dd, J=16.3 and 6.5 Hz), 3.11 (1H, quintet, J=6.7 Hz), 3.19 (1H, brs, ═OH), 3.74 (1H, brs), 4.35 (1H, brd, J=9.5 Hz), 5.42 (1H, dd, J=6.2 and 4.1 Hz), 5.60 (1H, ddd, J=5.8, 5.6, and 4.5 Hz), 5.66 (1H, dd, J=15.8 and 5.8 Hz), 6.24 (1H, t, J=7.2 Hz), 6.64 (1H, s), 7.00 (1H, s); \n13\nC NMR (100 MHz, CDCl\n3\n) δ 15.1, 16.1, 17.7, 18.5, 19.3, 22.5, 28.8, 31.1, 39.6, 39.7, 45.0, 53.7, 71.4, 75.3, 76.8, 116.7, 120.2, 124.3 [q, \n1\nJ (C,F)=273.4 Hz], 127.9, 130.2 [q, \n3\nJ (C,F)=6.0 Hz], 130.6 [q, \n2\nJ (C,F)=28.4 Hz], 132.5, 136.7, 152.0, 165.4, 170.2, 218.4; LRMS (ESI) calcd for C\n27\nH\n37\nF\n3\nNO\n5\nS [M+H\n+\n] 544.2, found 544.1.\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\nIn Vitro Studies\n\n\nA typical experiment involves culturing cells (e.g., CCRF-CEM) at an initial density of 2-5×10\n4 \ncells per ml. They are maintained in a 5% CO\n2\n-humidified atmosphere at 37° C. in RPMI medium 1640 (GIBCO/BRL) containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (GIBCO/BRL), and 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. For cells that were grown in suspension (such as CCRF-CEM and its sublines), cytotoxicitiy is measured by using the 2,-3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5 carboxanilide)-2H terazodium hydroxide (XTT)-microculture tetrazonium method in duplicate in 96-well microtiter plates. For both methods, the absorbance of each well is measured with a microplate reader (EL-340, Bio-Tek, Burlington, Vt.). Each run entails six or seven concentrations of the tested drugs. Dose-effect relationship data are analyzed with the median-effect plot.\n\n\nThe CCRF-CEM human T cells, acute lymphoblastic leukemic cells, its teniposide-resistant subline (CCRF-CEM/VM\n1\n) and vinblastine-resistant subline (CCRF-CEM/VBL\n100\n) are obtained from W. T. Beck (University of Illinois, Chicago, Ill.).\n\n\nIn a typical experiment, as outlined generally above, certain of the inventive compounds (e.g., 9,10-dehydro-EpoD) demonstrated activity in CCRF-CEM cell lines and CCRF-CEM cell lines resistant to Taxol. Certain of these compounds exhibit IC\n50\ns in the range of 0.0015 to about 0.120 for CCRF-CEM cell lines. Certain other compounds exhibit IC\n50\ns in the range of 0.0015 to about 10.5. Certain of these compounds also exhibit IC\n50\ns in the range of 0.011 to about 0.80 for CCRF-CEM/Taxol resistant cell lines and certain other compounds exhibit IC\n50\ns in the range of about 0.011 to about 13.0 μM. In certain embodiments, 26F-EpoD exhibits activities in the range of 0.0015 μM for CCRF-CEM cell lines and in the range of 0.011 μM for CCRF-CEM/Taxol resistant cell lines (\nFIG. 11\n).\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\nIn Vivo Studies\n\n\nAthymic nude mice bearing the nu/nu gene are typically used for tumor xenografts. Outbred, Swiss-background mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. \nMale mice\n 8 weeks or older weighing 22 g and up were used for most experiments. The drug was administered via the tail vein for 6 hr.-i.v. infusion. Each individual mouse was confined in a perforated Falcon polypropylene tube restrainer for drug administration. Tumor volume was assessed by measuring length×width×height (or width) using a caliper. The programmable Harvard PHD2000 syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus) with multi-track was used for i.v. infusion. All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health “Guide for the Care and Use of Animals” and the protocol approved by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. In keeping with the policy of this committee for the humane treatment of tumor-bearing animals, mice were euthanized when tumors reached ≧10% of their total body weight.\n\n\nAs depicted in \nFIG. 8\n, 9,10-dehydro-EpoB was tested in nude mice bearing human mammary carcinoma MX-1. In general, 9,10-dehydro-EpoB was formulated as follows: 9,10-dehydro-EpoB was dissolved in ethanol and Cremophor was added (1:1) at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. This solution was diluted with saline for i.v. infusion. The diluted solution was used for i.v. infusion within one hour. Tumor size and body weight were then measured using dosages of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 30 mg/kg over 15 days. Tumor size and body weight were also measured using a dosage regimen of 0.4 mg/kg Q3Dx2, 0.5 mg/kg Q3Dx2, and 0.6 mg/kg Q3Dx5 (see \nFIGS. 33\n, \n34\n, \n55\n and \n56\n). The every third day dosing regimen was used to reduce toxicity. Other therapeutic studies on 9,10-dehydro-Epo B are shown in \nFIGS. 70 and 71\n (CCRF-CEM/Taxol Q3Dx5) and in \nFIGS. 23 and 24\n (HCT-116, Q2Dx7).\n\n\nThe compound, 9,10-dehydro-12,13-desoxyepothilone B (iso-490 epothilone), is three times more efficacious than dEpoB. 9,10-dehydro-12,13-desxoyepothilone D has been shown to arrest tumor growth after two to three infusions of 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg, each of which was administered every other day. Better results in mice were obtained using a dose of 30 mg/kg of 9,10-dehydro-12,13-desoxyepothilone B using two 6 hour infusion iv every other day. 9,10-dehydro-dEpoB at 5 mg/kg, Q3Dx9, 6 hr.-iv infusion, was also shown to achieve tumor disappearance in nude mice bearing MX-1 xenograft without mouse death and with only a moderate loss of body weight (\nFIGS. 74 and 75\n). This seems to have been accomplished by administering the epothilone analogs every third day to reduce toxicity (see \nFIGS. 53 and 54\n). In summary, 9,10-dehydro-12,13-desoxyepothilone B shows decreased toxicity as compared to other epothilones, greater potency in arresting tumor growth, and greater serum stability. Other therapeutic studies are shown in \nFIGS. 17 and 18\n (HCT-116, Q2Dx5 and Q3Dx5); in \nFIGS. 19 and 20\n (A549/Taxol, Q3Dx7); and in \nFIGS. 21 and 22\n (A549/Taxol, Q2Dx7).\n\n\n9,10-dehydro-Epo B when administered every three days 9-11 times, 6 hour iv infusion, at 0.4-0.6 mg/kg, led to shrinkage and disappearance of the tumor in nude mice with implanted human mammary carcinoma MX-1 xenografts (\nFIGS. 68 and 69\n). Administration every other day for 8 doses led to tumor growth suppression but no shrinkage of the tumor. When 9,10-dehydro-Epo B was administered every other day for 9 doses, the implanted tumor continued to shrink moderately from the second to the eighth day, but body weight recovered very slowly from 76% to 82% of the control during the same period. On the tenth day, one-fourth of tumor was gone. When a dosage of 0.6 mg/kg of 9,10-dehydro-EpoB was administered Q2Wx6, 6 hour infusion, to nude mice with HCT-116 xenografts, four out of four mice died of toxicity within three days after the sixth dosage. 9,10-dehydro-EpoB abolished tumor growth against CCRF-CEM/Taxol using 0.6 mg/kg, Q3Dx5,x2 schedule (\nFIGS. 70 and 71\n).\n\n\n26-trifluoro-9,10-dehydro-12,13-desoxy-epothilone B (F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB) as shown in the Figures is curative at 20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, Q2Dx6, 6 hour infusions, in a nude mouse model implanted with human mammary carcinoma MX-1 xenografts. The data also suggests that 30 mg/kg Q2Dx6 is approximately the maximal tolerated dose. At 20 mg/kg, Q2Dx6, 6 hour infusion, 26-trifluoro-9,10-dehydro-12,13-dexoxy-epothilone B led to tumor shrinkage and disappearance in four out of four nude mice with human mammary carcinoma MX-1 xenografts. There was no reappearance of the tumor on the 20\nth \nday after stopping treatment. On the 27\nth \nday after stoping \ntreatment\n 2/4 reappeared. No further tumor reappearance during 28\nth\n-64\nth \ndays after stopping treatment. By comparison, dEpoB at 30 mg/kg achieved tumor disappearance in the same mouse model in seven out of seven mice; however, the tumor reappeared in 2 out of five mice on the 8\nth \nday after stopping treatment. Administration of 26-trifluoro-9,10-dehydro-12,13-desoxy-epothilone B at 20 mg/kg, Q2Dx6, 6 hr. iv infusion led to a transient drop in body weight of the mice up to 26%. This drop in body weight did not lead to death suggesting no severe toxicity toward vital organs. Two days after the last treatment, body weight began to recover. On the 16\nth \nday after treatment, body weight returned to 109% of the pretreatment control suggesting that toxicity, if any, is completely reversible. In comparison, dEpoB administered at 30 mg/kg led to a 31% decrease in body weight without lethality.\n\n\nWhen 26-trifluoro-9,10-dehydro-12,13-desoxy-epothilone B was administered at 30 mg/kg, Q2Dx6, 6 hour iv infusion, tumor disappearance was 2-3 days earlier than the 20 mg/kg dosage. Body weight dropped 27% at this higher dose and persisted 4 days without leading to lethality confirming no severe toxicity to vital organs. Four days after the last treatment at 30 mg/kg, body weight began to recover. On the 16\nth \nday after treatment, body weight returned to 98% of the pretreatment control again confirming the reversibility of toxicity. Treatment with 26-trifluoro-9,10-dehydro-dEpoB at 20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg led to total tumor disappearance, and no relapse after 62 days was seen at the 30 mg/kg dose. Tumor disappearance was also achieved at 10 mg/kg by administering 9 doses with three additional doses given (\nFIG. 57\n). Only minor loss of body weight was observed at 10 mg/kg 26-trifluoro-9,10-dehydro-dEpoB (\nFIG. 58\n). No further loss of body weight was seen with continued treatment.\n\n\n \nFIG. 59\n summarizes the effect of 26-F\n3\n-9,10-deH-dEpo B (and other epothilones) against MX-1 xenograft, A. at low dose; B. against large tumor; against A549 lung carcinoma xenograft, C; and against Taxol resistant lung carcinoma A549/Taxol xenograft, D.\n\n\n \nFIG. 61\n lists in vitro potency of C-21 modified epothilones against CCRF-CEM, CCRF-CEM/VBL and CCRF-CEM/Taxol.\n\n\n \nFIG. 62\n shows therapeutic effect of 26-F\n3\n-9,10-deH-dEpoB (15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) and Taxol (20 mg/kg) Q2Dx8, 6 hour i.v. infusion against human T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia CCRF-CEM xenograft. Similar body weight decreases were observed in all three groups of treatment (\nFIG. 63\n).\n\n\nTreatment of CCRF-CEM/Taxol xenograft (Taxol resistant) with 26-F\n3\n-9,10-deH-dEpo B, 15 mg/kg achieved 1/3 tumor disappearance, and 30 mg/kg achieved ¾ tumor disappearance. The same treatment with Taxol, 20 mg/kg yielded only partial suppression of tumor growth and failed to achieve tumor shrinkage (\nFIG. 64\n). The body weight changes during this experiment were shown in \nFIG. 65\n.\n\n\nTreatment of human colon carcinoma HCT-116 xenograft with 26-F\n3\n-9,10-deH-dEpo B (20 mg/kg) achieved similar efficacy as Taxol (20 mg/kg). However, F\n3\n-deH-dEpo B at 30 mg/kg yield better therapeutic effect with 2/4 tumor disappearance following 5 doses (\nFIG. 66\n). The body weight changes during this experiment were shown in \nFIG. 67\n.\n\n\nThe therapeutic effects of F\n3\n-9,10-dehydro-dEpoF against MX-1 xenografts at different doses (5-30 mg/kg) with 6 hour i.v. infusion and i.v. injection are shown in \nFIGS. 76 and 77\n.\n\n\nConclusion. The 9,10-dehydro, 26-trifluoro, or both modifications to dEpoB result in a 1.5- to 5-fold increase in cytotoxicity in vitro and a 2- to 5-fold increase in half-life in mouse plasma in vitro. By using human solid tumor xenograft models in nude mice and using the Q2Dx5-9, 6 hr-i.v. infusion technique via tail vein at maximal tolerated doses, the antitumor efficacy and toxicity of 9,10-dehydro-epothilones were evaluated. The ability to achieve complete tumor growth suppression, tumor shrinkage, and disappearance allowed for further investigation to determine the relapse rate and cure rate after stopping treatment. 9,10-dehydro-EpoB, the most potent epothilone known in vitro, although highly efficacious, showed a narrow therapeutic safety margin in vivo. 9,10-dehydro-dEpoB at 4 mg/kg, 9,10-dehydro-EpoB at 0.4 mg/kg, and 21-hydroxy-9,10-dehydro-dEpoB at 3 mg/kg all strongly suppressed tumor growth for a sustained period of time and achieved some tumor shrinkage, and some achieved tumor disappearance. dEpoB at 30 mg/kg, 26-trifluoro-9,10-dehydro-dEpoB at 20 mg/kg, and paclitaxel at 20 mg/kg all showed strong suppression of tumor growth and achieved tumor shrinkage and disappearance of human mammary carcinoma MX-1 xenografts in all mice tested. 26-trifluoro-9,10-dehydro-dEpoB, when compared with dEpoB or paclitaxel, achieved a long term cure without a tumor relapse and showed an equally rapid recovery of body weight to the pretreatment control level.\n\n\nExample 13\n\n\nSynthesis of Cyclopropyl-Epothilone Analogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14\n\n\nOral and Parenteral Administration of 26-trifluoro-9,10-trans-dehdyro-epothilone D in the Treatment of Human Tumors implanted in Nude Mice\n\n\nIn this Example, it is demonstrated that structurally designed 16-membered macrolide microtubule-stabilization agent, 26-trifluoro-9,10-trans-dehdyro-epothilone D, shrinks tumors, renders tumor disappearance, and achieves long term non-relapse when given by 6 hr.-i.v. infusion or orally. Mice bearing large size tumor (\nFIG. 83\n) or Taxol-resistant tumor xenografts (\nFIG. 84\n) are shown to be curable with 26-trifluoro-9,10-trans-dehdyro-epothilone D as a single agent monotherapy. The curative therapeutic spectrum encompasses leukemia as well as breast, colon, and lung carcinomas (\nFIGS. 83\n, \n86\n, and \n90\n). All chemotherapeutic experiments in vivo reported here were carried out using human tumor xenografts in immunodeficient nude mice. This animal model is commonly used in evaluating anti-tumor compounds prior to clinical trials in cancer patients.\n\n\nThe MX-1 and HCT-116 experiments lasted 5.5 and 6.5 months, respectively (\nFIGS. 83 and 86\n). There was no tumor relapse in both experiments with 3.8 and 5.2 months tumor free, respectively, following the cessation of treatment. For the HCT-116 experiment (\nFIG. 86\n), both paclitaxel and 26-trifluoro-9,10-trans-dehdyro-epothilone D at 20 mg/kg were used and both achieved tumor disappearance. However, the paclitaxel treated group relapsed at 1.1 months after stopping treatment, whereas 26-trifluoro-9,10-trans-dehdyro-epothilone D treated animals were tumor free for over 5.2 months. Assuming a tumor doubling time of 4 days (based on the vehicle treated control), the paclitaxel treatment of HCT-116 tumor resulted in 99.7% tumor suppression or 2.56-log cell kill, whereas the cell kill by 26-trifluoro-9,10-trans-dehdyro-epothilone D in MX-1 and HCT-116 experiments would be >8.5-log and >11.6 log, respectively, when the experiments were terminated. Based on the healthy, active conditions of the treated mice with body weight returned to pretreatment levels, it is expected that “cure” can be ensured throughout the 2 year life span of the mice if prolonged treatment or additional cycles of treatment were enforced. This result should be achievable despite the fact that “cure” would be more difficult to attain in immunodeficient mice than in the immuno-competent mice. To our knowledge, this is the longest xenograft therapeutic studies carried out in nude mice in biomedical literature, and the longest complete remission that has been reported either with parenteral or oral administration for a single antitumor agent. It is pertinent to state that it is relatively easy to find a compound that suppresses tumor growth. But it is relatively rare to find a compound that achieves tumor shrinkage. The finding with our compound, 26-trifluoro-9,10-trans-dehdyro-epothilone D, that achieves complete tumor disappearance in all mice with no relapse for as long as 5.2 months to our knowledge has never been reported previously, indicating the great potential of 26-trifluoro-9,10-trans-dehdyro-epothilone D for therapeutic development.\n\n\nAdditional significant benefit of oral therapy is that the use of Cremophor formulation that can cause severe allergic reactions can be avoided. It is well known that the use of Cremophor in the formulation in Taxol, desoxy-EpoB, and 15-aza-Epo13 induced troublesome allergic reactions which make pretreatment with antihistamine and/or steroid necessary.\n\n\nOral effectiveness of 26-trifluoro-9,10-trans-dehdyro-epothilone D is consistent with its remarkable metabolic stability in mouse plasma and in human liver microsomal S9 fraction in vitro. This metabolic stability is attributable to the trifluorination at C-26 position of the epothilone molecule (\nFIG. 91\n). Introducing the double bond at C9-C10 also increased metabolic stability (\nFIG. 91\n). The closeness of the optimal dose of 26-trifluoro-9,10-trans-dehdyro-epothilone D for i.v. infusion (20-30 mg/kg, Q2D) and for the oral administration (20 mg/kg, QD or 30 mg/kg Q2D) suggests that the compound is well absorbed and has excellent bioavailability in vivo.\n\n\nIt is worthy of noting that many of our in vivo therapeutic studies on Fludelone (\nFIGS. 90\n, \n84\n, \n86\n, \n87\n, \n88\n, and \n93\n) against xenografts were carried out in parallel with Taxol, which is one of the most important cancer therapeutic agents currently in use in clinics. The profound findings with Fludelone, in comparison with Taxol, indicate the promising potential of this compound for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nChemicals: All epothilones were synthesized as indicated herein. Paclitaxel (Taxol®) and vinblastine sulfate (VBL) were purchased from Sigma. All these compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide for the in vitro assays, (except VBL in saline). For in vivo studies, all epothilones and paclitaxel were dissolved in Cremophor/ethanol (1:1) vehicle and then diluted with saline for iv infusion for 6 hrs via tail vein using a custom-designed mini-catheter and a programmable pump (Chou, T.-C., Zhang, X.-G., Harris, C. R., Kuduk, S. D., Balog, A., Savin, K. & Danishefsky, S. J. (1998) \nProc. Natl. \nAcad. Sci. USA\n \n95, 15798-15802; Chou, T.-C., O'Connor, O. A., Tong, W. P., Guan, Y., Zhang, X.-G., Stachel, S. J., Lee, C & Danishefsky, S. J. (2001) \nProc. Natl. \nAcad. Sci. USA\n \n98, 8113-8118; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). Oral administration of the drugs were prepared by dissolving the compound in ethanol and suspended with equal volume of Tween-80 and the suspension was diluted with 5 volumes of saline prior to administration to nude mice. The gavage was carried out using a 1 ml syringe and a \ngauge #\n22 ball-tipped animal feeding needle. (Popper & Sons, Inc. New Hyde Park, N.Y.).\n\n\nTumor and Cell Lines: The CCRF-CEM human lymphoblastic leukemia cells and their vinblastine resistant subline (CCRF-CEM/VBL\n100\n, 720-fold resistance) were obtained from Dr. William Beck of the University of Illinois, Chicago, and CCRF-CEM/Taxol (44-fold resistance) by exposing CCRF-CEM cells to increasing sublethal concentration (IC\n50\n-IC\n90\n) of paclitaxel for six months. The degree of resistance are shown in \nFIG. 91\n. Human mammary carcinoma (MX-1), human lung carcinoma cells (A549), and human colon carcinoma (HCT-116) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, Md.).\n\n\nAnimals: Athymic nude mice bearing the nu/nu gene were obtained from NCI, Frederick, Md. and used for all human tumor xenografts. Male \nnude mice\n 6 weeks or older weighing 20-22 g or more were used. Drugs were administered via the tail vein for 6 hours by iv infusion using a homemade infusion mini-catheter and containment tube. A programmable Harvard PHD2000 syringe pump with multitrack was used for iv infusion. A typical 6 hr infusion volume for each drug in Cremophor/ethanol (1:1) was 100 μl in 2.0 ml of saline. For oral administration, both Fludelone and Taxol were dissolved in ethanol and the diluted 5-fold with Tween-80. The Taxol solution should be used within 5 min to avoid precipitation. Tumor volume was assessed by measuring length×width×height (or width) by using a caliper. For tumor-bearing nude mice during the course of experiment, the body weight refers to total weight minus the weight of the tumor. All animal studies conducted in accordance with the guidelines for the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Animals and the protocol approved by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n\nCytotoxicity Assays: In preparation for in vitro cytotoxicity assays, cells were cultured at an initial density 2-5×10\n4 \ncells per milliliter. They were maintained in a 5% CO\n2\n-humidified atmosphere at 37° C. in RPMI medium 1640 (GIBCO/BRL) containing penicillin (100 units/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL, GIBCO/BRL), and 5% heat-inactivated FBS. For solid tumor cells growing in a monolayer (such as HCT-116 and A549), cytotoxicity of the drug was determined in 96-well microtiter plates by using the sulforhodamine B method (Skehan, P., Storeng, R., Scudiero, D., Monks, A., McMahon, J., Vistica, D., Warren, J. T., Bokesch, H., Kenny, S. & Boyd, M. R. (1990) \nJ. Natl. Cancer Inst. \n82, 1107-1112; incorporated herein by reference). For cells grown in suspension (such as CCRF-CEM and its sublines), cytotoxicity was measured, in duplicate, by using the 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-carboxanilide)-2H-terazodium hydroxide (XTT) microculture method (Scudiero, D. A., Shoemaker, R. H., Paull, K. D., Monks, A., Tierney, S., Nofziger, T. H., Currens, M. J., Seniff, D. & Boyd, M. R. (1988) \nCancer Res. \n48, 4827-4833; incorporated herein by reference) in 96-well microtiter plates. For both methods, the absorbance of each well was measured with a microplate reader (Power Wave XS, Bio-Tek, Winooski, Vt.). Dose-effect relationship data from 6 to 7 concentrations of each drug, in duplicate, were analyzed with the median-effect plot by using a computer program (Chou, T.-C. & Talalay, P. T. (1984) \nAdv. Enzyme Reg. \n22, 27-55; Chou, T.-C. & Hayball, M. (1997) \nCalcuSyn for Windows \n(Biosoft, Cambridge, U.K.); each of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nStability of epothilones in mouse and in human liver S9 fraction: The stability study was carried out with a fully automated HPLC system which consisted of a Prospekt-2 (Spark Holland, Netherlands) sample preparation system and an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. Briefly, the \nProspekt\n 2 picked up a C8 extraction cartridge and washed it with acetonitrile and water. The Agilent autosampler, set at 37° C., picked up 20 μl of the sample, loaded it onto the cartridge, washed it with water, then the Prospekt-2 diverted the mobile phase stream through the extraction cartridge onto the analytical column, Reliance \nStable Bond C8\n 4×80 mm with guard column (MacMod, Chadds Ford, Pa.) and the eluent was monitored at 250 nm. The mobile phase consists of 53 or 65% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid at 0.4 ml/min, so that the retention time of the compound of interest is about 6 minutes. Sample preparation involves the addition of equal volumes of plasma to PBS for a total volume of 400 μl, filtered, and the addition of 0.5-2 μl of the substrate (20 mM) to achieve about 30-50 mAU at 250 nm in the HPLC analysis. For pooled human liver microsome S9 fraction (Xeno Tech, Lenex, Kans.), 20 μl (400 μg) or S9 fraction was mixed with 280 μl of PBS then proceeds as above. The sampling period was controlled by the autosampler and peak area data were collected to compare the rate of disappearance of the parent compound.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nStructure-Activity Relationships In Vitro against Human Leukemic, Taxol-and Vinblastin-resistant Leukemic Cells and Solid Tumor Cells. The potency in terms of IC\n50 \n(in μM) for twelve representative epothilones against the growth of human leukemic CCRF-CEM cells and their sublimes resistant to vinblastine CCRF-CEM/VBL and resistant to paclitaxel, CCRF-CEM/Taxol were listed in the table in \nFIG. 94\n. Also listed are the IC\n50 \nvalues for two human solid tumor cell lines: lung carcinoma A549 and colon carcinoma HCT-116. It is shown that deH-EpoB replaces EpoB as the most potent epothilone known. It is also shown that i) 9,10-dehydro-modification on dEpoB, dEpoF, or F\n3\n-dEpoF always resulted in marked increase in potency, whereas trifluorination on the C-26 position somewhat reduced the potency, however metabolic stability is greatly increased by the trifluorination (\nFIG. 91\n); and ii) Most epothilones are not cross-resistant with vinblastine, typical substrate for the P-glycoprotein of multi-drug resistance (MDR) nor cross-resistant with Taxol. Taxol is a good substrate for MDR phenotype but Taxol resistance may also be generated by mutation in tubulin gene. The exceptions are 15-aza-EpoB, 15-aza-deH-dEpoB which shows considerable cross-resistance to both vinblastine and paclitaxel. dEpoF and its derivative showed some cross-resistance with vinblastine but not paclitaxel. iii) Leukemic CCRF-CEM cells and solid-tumor cells A549 and HCT-116 are almost equally susceptible to epothilones. iv) F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB, deH-dEpoB, and deH-EpoB, which are our new lead compounds for further pharmacologic evaluations, are not appreciably cross-resistant to vinblastine nor to paclitaxel.\n\n\nIn earlier studies (Schiff, P. B., Fant, J. & Horwitz, S. B. (1979) \nNature \n(London) 277, 665-667; Meng, D., Su, D.-S., Balog, A., Bertinato, P., Sorsensen, E. J., Danishefsky, S. J., Zheng, Y.-H., Chou, T.-C., He, L. & Horwitz, S. B. (1997) \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n119, 2733-2734; each of which is incorporated herein by reference) it was concluded that epothilone molecules can be dissected into three zones. Thus, in the C-1-8 acyl sector, structural changes are not tolerated in terms of in vitro cytotoxicity and microtubule stabilizing ability. This is in contrast to the C-9˜15 O-alkyl sector and the C-15 pendant aryl sectors wherein considerable modification of structures is tolerated (Haar, E. T., Kowalski, R. J., Hamel, E., Lin, C. M., Longley, R. E., Gunasekera, S. P., Rosenkranz, H. S. & Day, B. W. (1996) \n \nBiochemistry\n \n35, 243-250; Kowalski, R. J., Giannakakou, P. & Hamel, E. (1997) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n272, 2534-2541; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). The design and editing of chemical structures for the present paper follows these rules, guided by pharmacological activities, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic selectivity.\n\n\nEpothilones with 12,13-epoxyl moiety, such as EpoB, and deH-EpoB, although the most potent agents in the epothilone series but they possessed rather poor therapeutic index at their maximal tolerated doses. This hypothesis is illustrated with the therapeutic data given in the table in \nFIG. 91\n.\n\n\nPhysico-chemical, Metabolic, Pharmacological Properties and Therapeutic Results of Epothilone Derivatives. Inter-relating different properties of a series of epothilones facilitates the understanding of factors that contribute to the therapeutic end-results for the lead compounds. Table 91 summarizes the profiles of nine epothilone derivatives. The structure-cytotoxic activity relationship in vitro (\nFIG. 94\n) provides potency-based initial evaluation. For example, new class of 9,10-dehydro modification greatly increased potency in vitro and in vivo. In these preselected compounds, it is more difficult to correlate the structure-microtubule stabilization potency because the potency are all quite high (i.e., similar to the paclitaxel potency). Water solubility and lipophilicity play varied role in the therapeutic effect and may be important for the design of formulation. DeH-dEpoF, F\n3\n-deH-dEpoF and deH-dEpoB greatly increased water solubility relative to other epothilones. The finding that F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB is orally efficacious (see data below in \nFIG. 84\n) reduces the concern of water-insolubility in the drug formulation and the usage of allergy causing Cremophor can be avoided.\n\n\nIn vitro, deH-EpoB, deH-dEpoF, EpoB and deH-dEpoB, in this order have sub-nanomolar IC\n50\n's whereas F\n3\n-deH-dEpoF, dEpoF, F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB, dEpoB and F\n3\n-dEpoB, in this order, have IC\n50\n's range of 1.3 to 9.3 nM (\nFIG. 94\n). DeH-EpoB and EpoB are the most potent epothilones known in vitro and in vivo but they do not yield the best therapeutic index. Apparently, epoxyl moiety on C-12-13 of EpoB and deH-EpoB contribute greatly to the toxicity toward the host as evident by lower value in the maximal-body weight percent drop without a death (\nFIG. 91\n). By contrast, F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB and dEpoB tolerated the highest values of body weight dropped and they showed excellent therapeutic results such as complete tumor remission in all animals. In general, in vitro potency and the optimal therapeutic dose revealed good correlations with 6 hr-i.v. infusion of treatment. Of special interest is that F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB (Fludelone) possesses the widest curative therapeutic dose range (10-30 mg/kg) (Chou, T.-C., Dong, H., Rivkin, A., Yoshimura, F., Gabarda, A. E., Cho, Y. S., Tong, W. F. & Danishefsky, S. J. (2003) \nAngew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. \n42, 4762-4767; incorporated herein by reference) the excellent metabolic stability and the best overall therapeutic results among the epothilones listed (\nFIG. 91\n). Furthermore, F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB provides curative therapeutic effect via oral route of administration. It is concluded that the most potent epothilones does not necessarily perform better as antitumor agents and that F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB is the lead candidate for the therapeutic development.\n\n\nTherapy on Extra Large MX-1 Tumor Xenografts. As shown in \nFIG. 83A\n, treatment of MX-1 xenografts as large as 3.4% of body weight with F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB, 25 mg/kg, 6 hr-i.v. infusion Q3Dx5 beginning D22 after tumor implantation, led to marked tumor shrinkage (>97.4%). During the resting period of 9 days without treatment (D34-D43), the tumor size continued to shrink (>99.3%) and tumor disappeared in 2 out of 5 mice studied, whereas body weight of the treated group recovered to the pretreatment level during the same resting period (\nFIG. 83B\n). Resumption of treatment on D43, Q3Dx4, led to tumor disappearance on the remaining 3 mice on D50, D50 and D51. After D52 (i.e., date of the last dose), animals were observed every three days until D165 when the experiment was terminated. There was no tumor relapse in all 5 animals on D165 (i.e., over 3.7 months after cessation of treatment).\n\n\nThe photographs of the nude mice of this experiment taken on D25, D31, D37, D43 and D52 from one mouse each for the control and treated groups are shown in \nFIG. 83B\n.\n\n\nCurative Cancer Therapy of MX-1 Xenografts by Fludelone via Oral Administration. As shown in \nFIG. 90A\n, F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB given orally at 30 mg/kg every two days for 7 times led to MX-1 tumor shrinkage and tumor disappearance in 2 out of 4 mice. Additional two doses (after skipping on dose) led to tumor disappearance in 4 out of 4 mice. By contrast, oral treatment of Taxol at the same dose and the same schedule of suppressed MX-1 tumor growth but did not lead to tumor shrinkage. Two days after the last dose of Taxol (D36), it induced tumor suppression of 66.9%. F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB treatment induced moderate yet persistent decreases in body weight with maximal drop of 15% of the body weight (\nFIG. 90B\n). Taxol treatment induced little changes in body weight suggesting that oral administration of Taxol was not a suitable treatment apparently due to drug metabolic inactivation or poor bioavailability. In contrast to oral route of administration, our previous report (Chou, T.-C., O'Connor, O. A., Tong, W. P., Guan, Y., Zhang, X.-G., Stachel, S. J., Lee, C & Danishefsky, S. J. (2001) \nProc. Natl. \nAcad. Sci. USA\n \n98, 8113-8118; incorporated herein by reference), Taxol treatment of MX-1 tumor at 20 mg/kg via 6 hr i.v.-infusion could lead to tumor shrinkage and tumor disappearance.\n\n\nCurative Therapeutic Effect of Fludelone against Taxol-Resistant CCRF-CEM/Taxol Xenografts. In our recent report (Chou, T.-C., Dong, H., Rivkin, A., Yoshimura, F., Gabarda, A. E., Cho, Y. S., Tong, W. P. & Danishefsky, S. J. (2003) \nAngew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. \n42, 4762-4767; incorporated herein by reference), we showed that F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB at 20 mg/kg, Q2Dx7, 6 hr-i.v. infusion against Taxol-resistant human lung carcinoma A549/Taxol (44-fold resistance to paclitaxel in vitro) yielded complete tumor growth suppression but failed to achieve tumor disappearance. We now use another paclitaxel-resistant xenograft, CCRF-CEM/Taxol (44-fold resistance to paclitaxel in vitro). As shown in \nFIG. 84\n, Fludelone at 30 mg/kg Q2Dx7, 6 hr-i.v. infusion led to tumor disappearance in 2 out of 4 mice. Additional Q2Dx5 (after skipping one dose) lead to tumor disappearance in 3 out of 4 mice, with the final tumor suppression of 99.8% (\nFIG. 84A\n). At the reduced dose of 15 mg/kg, tumor disappearance occurred in only 1 out of 4 mice on the 5\nth \nday after the two cycle treatment. The final tumor suppression on D34 was 98.8%. The parallel experiment with Taxol at 20 mg/kg yielded tumor growth suppression but with little or no tumor shrinkage. The final tumor suppression on D34 was 75.6%.\n\n\nBoth F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB (at 15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) and Taxol (20 mg/kg) persistently reduced the body weight during the first cycle of 7 treatments via 6 hr-i.v. infusion every other day. Skipping one treatment on D22 led to immediate gaining of body weight in all mice. The second cycle of treatment of Q2Dx5 again persistently reduced the body weight but without lethality to all mice tested (\nFIG. 84B\n).\n\n\nCurative Therapy against Human Colon Carcinoma HCT-116 Xenografts by Fludelone. As shown in \nFIG. 86A\n, F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB at 20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg or Taxol at 20 mg/kg, Q2Dx4, 6 hr-i.v. infusion for 3 cycles all led to tumor disappearance in 4 out of 4 mice. The treatment started on D9 after tumor implantation. There was a one-dose-skip on D17 between the 1\nst \nand 2\nnd \ncycles and there was a two-dose-skip on D27 and D29 between the 2\nnd \nand 3\nrd \ncycles. D9-D37 was the 3-cycle therapy period and D37-D200 was the follow-up period. The experiment lasted 200 days which represent more than a quarter of the average life-span of the mice.\n\n\nFor F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB at 30 mg/kg, tumor disappeared on D21, 23, 33 and 41 and at 20 mg/kg, tumor disappeared on D31, 35, 41, and 45. For both F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB doses, there was no tumor relapse in 4 out of 4 mice on D200 when experiment was terminated. For Taxol at 20 mg/kg, tumor disappeared on D33, 33, 41 and 45 which were similar to the observation with F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB at 20 mg/kg. However, in the Taxol treated group, tumor relapse occurred on D71, 75, 81 and 81.\n\n\nThe schedule of the treatment including the rest period is dictated by the body weight decreases and the physical conditions of the mice. For the F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB treatment at 30 mg/kg dose, the maximal body weight loss was 30% but without lethality which occurred at the end of the 2\nnd \ncycle of treatment (i.e., D29) (\nFIG. 86B\n). The body weight decreases and recovery for \nTaxol\n 20 mg/kg and F\n3\n-deH-\ndEpoB\n 20 mg/kg were similar in both pattern and magnitude.\n\n\nExample 15\n\n\nDetermination of the Mechanism of Action of Fluedelone (F\n3\n-deH-dEpoB) and how it Differs from that of EpoD; Therapeutic Implications of these Differences\n\n\nDrug Sensitivity in Human Multiple Myeloma (MM) and Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL) Tumor Cell Lines\n\n\nMM accounts for 1% of all cancers and 10% of hematological malignancies, with 15,500 new cases diagnosed and >15,000 deaths in 2002. Treatment of MM with conventional chemotherapy is not curative, with a median survival of about 3 years (Barlogie B, Shaughnessy J, Tricot G, Jacobson J, Zangari M, Anaissie E, Walker R, Crowley J. “Treatment of multiple myeloma” \nBlood \n2004; 103: 20-32; incorporated herein by reference). Although high-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cell support increases the rate of complete remission and event-free survival, almost every patient relapses, mandating the crucial need for salvage therapy options. Paclitaxel has been used to treat multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Miller H J, Leong T, Khandekar J D, Greipp P R, Gertz M A, Kyle R A. “Paclitaxel as the initial treatment of multiple myeloma: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study (E1A93)” \nAm. J. Clin. Oncol. \n1998; 21:553-556; Jazirehi A R, Bonavida B “Resveratrol modifies the expression of apoptotic regulatory proteins and sensitizes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma cell lines to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis” \nMol. Cancer Ther. \n2004; 3:71-84; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). However, the application was limited due to its high toxicity and multi-drug resistance. We have evaluated Fludelone and dEpoB against a panel of human MM and NHL lines that have been used in a number of recent studies in NOD/SCID xenograft models for evaluation of novel therapies, including 10-propargyl-10-deazaminopterin (PDX) (Wang E, O'Connor O, She Y, Zelenetz A, Sirotnak F M, Moore M A S “Activity of a novel anti-folate (PDX, 10-propargyl-10-deazaminopterin) against human lymphoma is superior to methotrexate and correlates with tumor RFC-1 gene expression” \nLeukemia \n& \nLymphoma \n2003, 44:1027-1035), anti-telomerase (Wang E S, Wu K, Chin A C, Gryaznov S, Moore M A S “Telomerase inhibition with an oligonucleotide telomerase template antagonist: in vitro and in vivo studies in multiple myeloma and lymphoma” \nBlood \n2004; 103:258-66; incorporated herein by reference) and anti-VEGFR Mab (Wang E, Teruya-Feldstein j, Wu Y, Hicklin D J, Moore M A S “Targeting autocrine and paracrine VEGF receptor pathways regresses human lymphoma xenographs in vivo” \nBlood\n, in press; incorporated herein by reference). Both Fludelone and dEpoB can inhibit myleoma and lymphoma cell proliferation significantly. Myeloma cell lines are very sensitive to Fludelone and dEpoB with extremely low IC50s, while two NHL lines were inhibited at doses of Fudalone that were 5-10 fold higher than were effective in MM (Table 15-1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 15-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCell growth inhibition and IC50 of Fludelone and dEpoB against\n\n\n\n\n\n\na panel of normal human tumors and normal human cell populations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nas determined by the XTT tetrazonium assay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTumor cell line\n\n\nHistology\n\n\ndEpoB\n\n\nFludelone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRPMI8226\n\n\nMyeloma\n\n\n36.67 ± 2.0 \n\n\n7.6 ± 1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAG\n\n\nMyeloma\n\n\n61.34 ± 4.2 \n\n\n12.04 ± 1.8 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPM-2\n\n\nMyeloma\n\n\n38.89 ± 3.3 \n\n\n8.2 ± 2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH929\n\n\nMyeloma\n\n\n42.75 ± 4.5 \n\n\n9.2 ± 1.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMOLP-5\n\n\nMyeloma\n\n\n68.56 ± 5.5 \n\n\n14.4 ± 2.6 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRL\n \n \nLymphoma\n \n \n\n\n90 ± 11\n\n\n80 ± 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSKI-\nDLBCL\n \n \nLymphoma\n \n \n\n\n 72 ± 9.8\n\n\n 60 ± 4.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHS-\n27A\n \n \nMarrow stroma\n \n \n\n\n100 ± 10 \n\n\n102 ± 8 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHS-5\n\n\n \nMarrow stroma\n \n\n\n100 ± 8 \n\n\n96 ± 7 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRC-5\n\n\nEmbryonic lung\n\n\n8.2 ± 4.3\n\n\n7.4 ± 2.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nfibroblasts (human)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHT-29\n\n\nColon Ca\n\n\n7.2 ± 2.2\n\n\n  4 ± 1.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCT-116\n\n\nColon Ca\n\n\n7.5 ± 3.1\n\n\n3.6 ± 1.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMDA MB435\n\n\nBreast Ca\n\n\n7.8 ± 4.2\n\n\n5.8 ± 2.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIGROV\n \n \nOvarian Ca\n \n \n\n\n 15 ± 3.8\n\n\n  2 ± 1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSKOV3\n \n \nOvarian Ca\n \n \n\n\n 13 ± 4.7\n\n\n1.6 ± 0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOvcar-3\n\n\n \nOvarian Ca\n \n\n\n 14 ± 3.6\n\n\n1.1 ± 0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOvcar-4\n\n\n \nOvarian Ca\n \n\n\n 16 ± 2.5\n\n\n1.8 ± 0.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal bone marrow stromal cells (HS-27A and HS-5 lines) showed relative resistance to these compounds, indicating that Fludelone and dEpoB have a safe therapeutic window in MM. (Table 15-1). Fludelone has ˜5 fold greater potency than dEpoB on MM cell lines while both drugs had a comparable toxicity to normal marrow stromal cells. Fetal human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) were sensitive to dEpoB and Flu but a clear therapeutic window was evident with Flu even with these very sensitive normal cells. Fludelone and dEpoB cause myleoma and lymphoma cells to arrest at G2M phase (\nFIG. 95\n) and induced tumor cell apoptosis (\nFIGS. 96 and 97\n). We evaluated the duration of drug exposure in vitro necessary to cause apoptosis in the myeloma cells. Pulse exposure for 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hrs was followed by a washout of the drug and continued incubation for up to 48 hrs. Exposure of cells to either Fludelone or dEpoB for 24 hrs resulted in all cells being dead by 48 hrs. (\nFIG. 98\n). With dEpoB, incubation for 4-8 hrs. slowed cell expansion whereas the same duration of exposure to Fludelone decreased the number of cells from input by ˜50%. A one hour exposure to dEpoB reduced but did not prevent tumor cell expansion over 48 hrs whereas with Flu, tumor numbers decreased by 50% (\nFIG. 98\n). Fludelone and dEpoB shared with paclitaxel the capacity to enhance microtubule bundle formation in tumor cells without appreciably changing the mass of microtubules in the cell shortly after exposure (\nFIG. 99\n). At a later time (˜24 hrs) microtubules are disrupted and cell apoptosis occurs. In a comparison of Fludelone and dEpoB on primary CD138 MM cells obtained from patent marrow we showed that Fludalone but not dEpoB induced tumor apoptosis within 24 hrs.\n\n\nDrug Sensitivity in Human Solid Tumor Cell Lines\n\n\nThe IC50s of Fludelone and dEpoB were determined on a panel of human solid tumor lines (colon, breast and ovarian) (Table 15-1). In every instance the Fludelone IC50 was lower than that of dEpoB. Ovarian cancer lines were particularly sensitive to Fludelone and 4/5 of the ovarian lines had a mean IC50 of 1.6 nM compared to a mean IC50 of 16.5 nM with dEpoB. Both drugs caused tumor cells to arrest in G2M phase (\nFIG. 100\n) and rapidly induced apoptosis (\nFIGS. 101 and 102\n).\n\n\nGlobal Gene Expression of the RPMI-8226 Myeloma Cell Line at 6 and 18 Hrs after Treatment with dEpoB or Fludelone at ×10 of their Respective IC50s\n\n\nGlobal gene expression (Affymetric chip—AU133 2.0) comparison of differential gene expression in the RPMI-8226 human multiple myeloma cell line was undertaken at 6 or 18 hrs after treatment with dEpoB or Fludelone (at ×10 IC50 dose). In the comparison of Fludelone-treated RPMI-08226 with control untreated cells, at 6 \nhrs\n 5 genes were upregulated (Table 15-2) and at 18 \nhrs\n 48 genes were upregulated (Table 15-3). JUN was upregulated at both times (+3.25, +2.64). At 6 \nhrs\n 3 genes were downregulated (Table 15-2) and at 18 \nhrs\n 16 genes were downregulated (Table 15-3). HNRPD (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D-like) was downregulated at both times (−2.46, −3.25). In the comparison of dEpoB-treated RPMI-08226 with control untreated cells at 6 \nhrs\n 21 genes were upregulated (Table 15-2) and at 18 hrs. 26 genes were upregulated (Table 15-3). JUN (+5.66, +3.73) and Tubulin α3 (+2.64, +2.30) were upregulated at both times. At 6 hrs., three genes were downregulated (Table 15-2), and at 18 hrs., sixteen genes were downregulated (Table 15-3).

The proposal is designated to test the hypothesis that the increased anitumor efficacy of Fludelone over dEpoB and earlier epithelones was due to some additional tumor targeting mechanism in addition to microtubule stabilization.

At 6 hrs., ten genes were downregulated, and at 18 hrs., eleven genes were downregulated and 4 genes were downregulated at both times (IFI27, −7.46, −5.28), GIP3 (−6.06, −5.28), IFTM1 (−4.00, −3.25), MX-1 (−2.00, −2.30). These are all are Interferon-inducible genes. Gene expression profiles of ovarian 1A9 and 1A9PTX22 ovarian xenografts have been reported to show diminished expression of IFN response genes (GIP3, IFI27, IFITM1, IFII6, ISG15) 24 hrs after treatment with paclitexal (Bani R M, Nicoletti M I, Alkharouf N W et al. “Gene expression correlating with response to paclitaxel in ovarian carcinoma xenografts” \nMol. Cancer Thera. \n2004; 3:111-121; incorporated herein by reference). Three of these genes (G1P3, IFI27, IFITM1) were strongly overexpressed at 6 hrs after dEpoB treatment of the RPMI-8226 cells but not with Fludelone, and these were also the genes whose expression most strongly distinguished the Fludelone and dEpoB gene profiles. Overexpression of IFN-responsive genes (e.g., IFR9) has recently been associated with resistance to paclitaxel in tumor cell lines and findings support the possible involvement of mediators of IFN signaling other than IFN itself, in responsiveness to paclitaxel (Luker K E, Pica C M, Schreiber R D, Piwnica-Worms D. “Overexpression of IRF9 confers resistance to antimicrotubule agents in breast cancer cells” \nCancer Res. \n2001; 61:6540-7; incorporated herein by reference). This novel IFN-independent role of IRF9 in the development of resistance to antimicrotubule agents was reported in approximately one half of breast and uterine cancers (Luker K E, Pica C M, Schreiber R D, Piwnica-Worms D. “Overexpression of IRF9 confers resistance to antimicrotubule agents in breast cancer cells” \nCancer Res. \n2001; 61:6540-7; incorporated herein by reference). Microarray analysis of tumor lines that were eEpoA or Taxol-resistant showed that the majority of genes which were highly expressed in EpoA-resistant tumors but not in Taxol-resistant tumors encoded interferon-inducible genes (Atadja A P, Yan-Neale T, Towbin H, Buxton F, Cohen D. “Gene expression profiling of epothilone A-resistant cells” \nNovartis Found Symp. \n2002; 243:119-32; incorporated herein by reference). Remarkably, we found that 8/21 (38%) of all genes upregulated following dEpoB treatment of RPMI-8226 were IFN-inducible and none of these were changed by Flu treatment (Table 15-2 through 15-4). The following IFN-inducible genes were shown to be upregulated in 8226 MM cells following 6 hrs or 18 hrs of dEpoB treatment and not changed with Fludelone treatment. In order of degree of upregulation following dEpoB they were 1.) Interferon (IFN) α-inducible IFI 27 (+18.83 increase). This belongs to a family of small interferon-α-inducible genes of unknown function that are upregulated in inflammatory skin disease, epithelial cancers and wound repair (Suomela S, Cao L, Bowcock A and Saarialho-Kere U. “Interferon alpha-inducible protein 27 (IFI27) is upregulated in Psoriatic skin and certain epithelial cancers” \nJ Invest. Dermatol. \n2004; 122:717-721; incorporated herein by reference). 2. IFNα-inducible protein (clone IFI-6-16) GIP3 (Bani R M, Nicoletti M I, Alkharouf N W et al. “Gene expression correlating with response to paclitaxel in ovarian carcinoma xenografts” \nMol. Cancer. Thera. \n2004; 3:111-121; incorporated herein by reference) (+5.28 increase). 3.) IFN-induced transmembrane protein-1, IFTM1 (Bani et al.) (+4.92 increase). 4.) Myxovirus resistance, IFN inducible, MX1 (+2 increase at 6 hrs and +2.3 at 18 hrs). The MX1 genes confer selective innate resistance to influenza virus (Staeheli, \nAd. Viral Res. \n38:147, 1990; incorporated herein by reference). They may also serve basic cellular functions possibly as GTP-binding proteins (Amheiter H and Meier E. “Mx proteins: antiviral proteins by chance or necessity?” \nNew Biol. \n1990; 90 851; incorporated herein by reference). 5.) \nPhospholipid scramblase\n 1 gene PLSCR1. Transcriptional control of the gene is entirely regulated by a single IFN-stimulated response element located at the first exon (Zhou Q, Zhao J, Al-Zoghaibi F, Zhou A et al. “Transcriptional control of the human plasma \nmembrane phospholipid scramplase\n 1 gene is mediated by interferon-alpha” \n \nBlood\n \n2000; 95:2593-2599; incorporated herein by reference). PLSCR1 was implicated in remodeling of plasma membrane phospholipids and mobilization of phosphatidlyserine to the cell surface. It may contribute to the rapid trans-bilayer movement of plasma membrane phospholipids that is observed in injured or apoptotic cells that are exposed to elevated intracellular Ca\n++\n. Studies show it can also translocate to nucleus and may act as a transcription factor (Ben-Efraim I, Zhou Q, Wiedmer T et al. “\nPhospholipid Scramblase\n 1 is imported into the nucleus by a receptor-mediated pathway and interacts with DNA” \nBiochem. \n2004; 43:35181; incorporated herein by reference). 6.) Interferon-induced protein with tetracopeptide repeats, IFITI (+2.3 increase). It has been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and protein-protein studies show that it may activate Rho proteins by interaction with Rho/Rac gunanine nucleotide exchange factors (Ye S, Pand H, Gu Y Y et al. “Protein interaction for an interferon-inducible syste-3526mic lupus associated gene, IFIT1” \nRheumatology \n2003; 42:1155-63; incorporated herein by reference). 7.) 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase-2, OAS2 (+2 increase). This family (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, OAS4) of interferon-induced genes are implicated in stress responses and are important for the anti-viral activity of interferon (Chebath, \nNature \n330:587, 1987; Meurs et al \nJ. Virol. \n66:5804, 1992; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). OAS2 catalyzes the synthesis of adenosine oligomers (2-5A). These then activate RNase L, an endoribonuclease latent in most mammalian cells, that in turn can inactivate viral (picornoviruses e.g. mengovirus) and cellular RNA (Anderson J B, Strabdbygard D J, Hartmann R, Justesen J. \nEur. J. Biochem. \n2004; 271:628-36; incorporated herein by reference). 8.) Histocompatibility class II DPα1, HLA-DPA1 (+2 increased). MHC-Class II are known mediators of the biological functions of IFN (Tissot C and Mechti J B C, “Molecular cloning of a new Interferon-induced factor that represses human \nimmunodeficiency virus Type\n 1 long terminal repeat expression” \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n1995; 270:14891-14898; incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nThe CAG myeloma cell line displays many features of clinical multiple myeloma with both phenotype (CD38+CD138+CD45−) and in vivo engraftment. A xenograft NOD-SCID myeloma mouse model was established by intravenously injection of 10-15 million of CAG cells engineered with fusion HSV-TK-eGFP-Luciferase gene. Therefore whole animal imaging by luciferase bioluminescence can be applied to evaluate tumor burden and drug efficacy in real-time, non-invasively reporting in living mice. The myeloma mouse exhibits bone marrow infiltration and pathological osteolytic bone lesion after 7 to 20 days tumor injection. After implantation of tumor cells, the mice were randomized and divided into vehicle control, dEpoB and Fludelone treatment groups. The dose of both dEpoB and Fludelone was 20 mg/kg, and the drugs were administered by intraperitoneal route. The average number of dose was 10 for dEpoB and 12 for Fludelone during the first 30 days of treatment. In addition, five doses of Velcade (6.25 ug/mouse, i.v) were administered in 3 out of 7 mice initially treated with Fludelone between 35 to 45 days. The results showed that myeloma mice treated with Fludelone had significantly decreased tumor burden evaluated by bioluminescence imaging versus mice treated with dEpoB and controls. All control mice died within 30 days after initiation of treatment, however, Fludelone treated mice had at least doubled the survival time than controls. There was no difference in survival between control and dEpoB treated mice. In combination with the proteasome inhibitor, Velcade, the tumors localized in vertebrate column and femurs can be greatly reduced, indicating that this combination can attack myeloma cells even under marrow microenvironment protection.\n\n\nPrevious data has shown that myeloma cells treated with epothilones exhibited typical apoptosis characteristics. It is not clear whether caspase is involved in this process. Firstly, we investigated the activation of \ncaspase\n 3, an effector caspase in the caspase pathway, in myeloma cells, by Western blot. With either dEpoB or Fludelone treatment, the myeloma cells showed increased 17 kd cleaved \ncaspase\n 3, which correlates with its activity. Immunohistochemical staining of CAG myeloma cells using antibody specific to cleaved caspase-3 was used to show cytoplasmic and perinuclear localization features in apoptotic cells. These data confirmed that caspase was activated in epothilone treated cells. Secondly, we attempted to assay the activity of \n \ncaspase\n \n 8 and 9, initiator caspase in the caspase pathway, by fluorometric method. Again both \n \ncaspase\n \n 8 and 9 activities were found to be increased in myeloma cells. Note that increased \ncaspase\n 9 activity was more prominent than \ncaspase\n 8. The signals triggering the activation of \n \ncaspase\n \n 8 or 9 are actively under investigation.\n\n\nDrug cytotoxicity to hematopoietic stem cells is always a major concern. Human CD34+ stem cells were isolated from umbilical cord blood and incubated with either dEpoB or Fludelone alone for 24 hours. After washing out the drugs, apoptosis assays and 2 weeks progenitor assays were performed to evaluate the influence of epothilone to stem cells. Our data shows that there is no significant toxicity of dEpoB or Fludelone on non-cycling stem cells.\n\n\nExample 16\n\n\n(E)-9,10-Dehydroepothilones: A New Class of Microtubule Stabilizing Antitumor Agents with Highly Promising Characteristics in Murine Xenograft Models\n\n\nThe synthesis of 26-F\n3\n-[16]dEpoB (2) containing the usual 16-membered ring can be accomplished via a highly convergent strategy, related to that employed in the synthesis of 27-F\n3\n-[17]ddEpoB (19). This strategy envisioned the formation of a E-9,10-olefin via a ring-closing metathesis reaction shown below (For an early instance of macrocyclization in a complex setting via a RCM see: Sinha, S. C.; Sun, J. \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. \n2002, 41, 1381; incorporated herein by reference). We anticipated that chemoselective reduction of the E-9,10-olefin of 28 and 29 would furnish dEpoB (1) and the desired 26-F\n3\n-dEpoB (2). The RCM precursor would be prepared by the union of the two fragments (21 or 24) and 123 through an esterification reaction. Coupling partner 123 would be constructed by deletion of the methylene spacer group (found in our earlier routes cf. compound 18) between the secondary methyl group at C8. As noted above, the in vitro level findings with the 17-membered epothilones containing the skipped diene arrangement (see 18), underscored the need for a corresponding investigation of the biological consequences of such a diene in the familiar 16-membered lactone setting. Given the presence of the cis 12,13-olefin in a dEpoB context, such a skipped diene would necessarily contain a 9,10-double bond.\n\n\nRetrosynthesis of the 9,10-dehydroepothilones and 26-F\n3\n-dEpoB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlkylation of the oxazolidinone 7 (Lee, C. B.; Wu, Z.; Zhang, F.; Chappell, M. D.; Stachel, S. J.; Chou, T.-C., Guan, Y.; Danishefsky, S. J., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n2001, 123, 5249; incorporated herein by reference) with the readily synthesized trifluoro and methyl allyl iodides (8 and 124, respectively) allowed for the C15 stereo center to be set in the appropriate absolute configuration\ni \nwith high diastereomeric access, (see \nproducts\n 9 or 125). The latter were converted to their corresponding Weinreb amides (Nahm, S.; Weinreb, S. M.; \nTetrahedron Lett. \n1981, 22, 3815; Levin, J. I.; Turos, E.; Weinreb, S. M. \nSynth. Commun. \n1982, 12, 989; each of which is incorporated herein by reference) and thence to 126 and 42 en route to 24 and 21 by nucleophilic methylation (MeMgBr) and appropriate Horner Wittig olefinations (Lythgoe, B.; Nambudiry, M. E. N.; Ruston, S.; Tideswell, J.; Wright, P. W.; \nTetrahedron Lett. \n1975, 40, 3863; Lythgoe, B. \nChem. Soc. Rev. \n1981, 449; Toh, H. T.; Okamura, W. H. \nJ. Org.

Chem. \n1986, 51, 3098; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). While the use of such oxazolidinones as chiral auxiliaries had been pioneered by Evans and associates (Evans, D. A.; Morrissey, M. M.; Dorow, R. L. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n1985, 107, 4346; Paterson, I.; Bower, S.; McLeod, M. D. \nTetrahedron Lett. \n1995, 36, 175; each of which is incorporated herein by reference), its application to the synthesis of optically defined glycolates by alkylation (rather than by hydroxylation) had not been developed.\n\n\nSynthesis of \n \nFragments\n \n 21 and 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe synthesis of the \npolypropionate fragment\n 25 was enabled by two critical aldol reactions, which established the relative configuration of the C3, C6, and C7 stereocenters. The first aldol reaction involved reaction of the Z-enolate of the \nethyl ketone\n 30 with Roche aldehyde 31 (Cohen, N; Eichel, W. F.; Lopresti, R. J.; Neukom, C.; Saucy, G. \nJ. Org. Chem. \n1976, 41, 3505; Nagaoka, H.; Kishi, Y.; \n \nTetrahedron\n \n1981, 37, 3873; Roush, W. R.; Palkowitz, A. D.; Ando, K. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n1990, 112, 6348; each of which is incorporated herein by reference) to provide the desired 32 with high diastereoselectivity. Recourse to 31, allowed by this synthesis, is a significant advantage over the use of earlier aldehydes which required resolution for the attainment of enantiomerically pure starting materials.\n\n\nProtection of the C7-alcohol followed by hydrolysis of the acetal provided the desired \naldehyde\n 34 and set the stage for the second aldol reaction. Reaction of 34 with Duthaler's D A G (diacetone glucose) Ti-enolate (Duthaler, R. O.; Herold, P.; Lottenbach, W.; Oretle, K.; Reidiker, M. \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. \n1989, 28, 495; incorporated herein by reference) afforded the desired hydroxy \ntert butyl ester\n 35 with very high (>95%) diastereoselectivity. The latter was then converted to the desired \nacid\n 25 in straightforward steps.\n\n\nSynthesis of \nAcid\n 25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \n \nallylic alcohols\n \n 24, 21, and the C\n1\n-C\n9 \nacid fragment 25 were united through an EDCI esterification protocol, thus providing the \n \nRCM precursors\n \n 26 and 27, respectively. Ring-closing metathesis reactions of 26 and 27 were carried out using an RCM catalyst (Scholl, M.; Trnka, T. M.; Morgan, J. P.; Grubbs, R. H. \nTetrahedron Lett. \n1999, 40, 2247; Grubbs, R. H.; Miller, S. J.; Fu, G. C. \nAcc. Chem. Res. \n1995, 28, 446; Trnka, T. M.; Grubbs, R. H. \nAcc. Chem.

Top. \nOrganomet. Chem. \n1998, 1, 1; each of which is incorporated herein by reference) in toluene. These reactions did indeed provide the trans isomers 39a and 40a. However, the major products were 39b and 40b which had arisen from the obvious alternate RCM pathway. These unwanted RCM isomers predominated over the desired 39a and 40a by ratios of ca. 3:1. Finally, deprotection of the silyl ethers of 39a and 40a with HF-pyridine led to the desired E-9,10-dehydro-epothilones 28 (White, J. D.; Carter, R. G.; Sundermann, K. F.; Wartmann, M. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n2001, 123, 5407; White, J. D.; Carter, R. G.; Sundermann, K. F.; Wartmann, M. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc\n. (Addition/Correction) 2003, 125, 3190; each of which is incorporated herein by reference. With \ncompound\n 28 of rigorously proven structure in hand, we were surprised to find that its spectral properties were not congruent with those previously reported for a compound presumed to be the same entity. The actual structure of the compound previously assigned as 28 has now been re-evaluated. In retrospect, it is clear that 28 had not been previously prepared and, in fact the whole family of (E)-9,10-dehydroepothilones reported here is a new genus.) and 29. As planned, the latter were converted to dEpoB (1) and 26-trifluoro-dEpoB (2) via diimide reduction of the E-9,10-olefin (Corey, E. J.; Mock, W. L.; Pasto, D. J. \nTetrahedron Lett. \n1961, 347; Pasto, D. J.; Taylor, R. T. \nOrg. React. \n1991, 40, 91; each of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nBy corresponding methodology, we synthesized the 9,10-dehydro-dEpoF (57) see below. The selective di-imide reductions of the E-9,10-olefins validated the structures of the various synthetic intermediates described above, thereby prompting re-evaluation of previous assignments in the literature.\n\n\nSynthesis of 9,10-Dehydroepothilones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamination of synthetic analogs (28, 29, and 57), in cell culture settings (see Supplemental Edition), revealed them to exert stronger inhibitory effects on various sensitive and MDR tumor cell lines than are exhibited by our current clinical candidate, dEpoB (1). The impressive cell growth inhibition exhibited by \n \n \nepothilones\n \n \n 28, 29, and 57 across a range of various drug-resistant tumors, prompted determination of the blood plasma stability of these new (E)-9,10 congeners. We recall that (E)-10,11-dehydro-dEpoB (Epo490) exhibits very poor plasma stability. Indeed, it was this plasma instability which had blocked further development of Epo490 (6). By contrast, on exposure of 28, 29, and 57 to murine plasma, we observed a much slower drug degradation as compared to dEpoB (1) (by a factor of ca. 7). This stability constitutes a substantial advance, from a drug availability perspective, relative to dEpoB (1), not to speak of epo 490 (6). Based on the preliminary cell culture and pharmacokinetic data of the (E)-9,10-\n \ndehydro derivatives\n \n 28 and 29, it would be appropriate to advance them for in vivo investigations. Such studies are, of course, rather more intensive of drug availability than in vitro measurements (Rivkin, A.; Yoshimura, F.; Gabarda, A. E.; Chou, T.-C.; Dong, H.; Tong, W. P.; Danishefsky, S. J. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n2003, 125, 2899; Chou, T.-C.; Dong, H.; Rivkin, A.; Yoshimura, F.; Gabarda, A. E.; Cho, Y. S.; Tong, W. P.; Danishefsky, S. J., \nAngew. Chem., Int.

Zaharevitz, R. Gussio, P. Giannakakou, \nChem. Biol., \n2000, 7, 593; each of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nThis requirement, and indeed the possible eventual need to prepare multigram quantities of 9,10-dehdyro derivatives for further development, prompted a significant reassessment of our total synthesis route. Of course, the single most serious problem was that the RCM reaction on 26, 27, and 54 which produced 39b, 40b, and 56 only as minor products. The major pathway involved an RCM reaction which was strictly confined to the O-alkyl sector of 26, 27, and 54, leading primarily to the undesired 39b and 40b. Accordingly, it was decided to attempt to defer introduction of the thiazole (by olefination) subsequent to the RCM (vide infra).\n\n\nWith eventual processiblity in multigram scales as our goal, the syntheses of the alkyl and acyl fragments entering into the RCM reaction were re-structured. \nCompound\n 86 was readily synthesized as shown. It was used to \nalkylate oxazolidinone\n 7 in high diastereomeric excess. Following deprotection of the OTES group, and nucleophilic methylation, \ncompound\n 90 was in hand. This α-hydroxyketone would serve as the acyl group acceptor in formation of the central ester to prepare the all critical RCM. An obvious concern was the possible vulnerability of such a hydroxyketone as an acyl acceptor to partial racemization or diversion to regioisomeric α-ketols.\n\n\n \nProcessible Synthesis Fragment\n 90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA serious problem in our earlier synthesis of the \nacid fragment\n 25 was the very expensive and technically demanding Duthaler chemistry (Duthaler, R. O.; Herold, P.; Lottenbach, W.; Oretle, K.; Reidiker, M. \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. \n1989, 28, 495; incorporated herein by reference) to generate the desired S stereochemistry at the C3. To circumvent this problem, the aldol reaction was carried out without any chiral auxiliary to provide a 1:1 mixture of the corresponding β-hydroxy ketone. Reagent controlled asymmetric reduction of the derived keto function (see compound 69), using Noyori conditions (Noyori, R.; Ohkuma, T.; Kitamura, M.; Takaya, H.; Sayo, N.; Kumobayashi, H.; Akutagawa, S. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n1987, 109, 5856; incorporated herein by reference) generated the desired S stereochemistry at the C3 in high diastereomeric excess. The now available β-\nhydroxy ester\n 70 was transformed to \nacid\n 25 in several steps following earlier protocols (Chou, T. C.; O'Connor, O. A.; Tong, W. P.; Guan, Y.; Zhang, Z.-G.; Stachel, S. J.; Lee, C.; Danishefsky, S. J. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n2001, 98, 8113; incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nProcessible Synthesis of \nAcid\n 25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemarkably, esterification of the resultant hydroxyketones 43 and 44 with the C\n1\n-C\n9 \nacid fragment 25 provided the corresponding \n \nRCM cyclization precursors\n \n 45 and 46 without noticeable racemization at C15, or loss of integrity of the initial α-ketol linkage. The ring-closing metathesis reaction of 45 and 46 was carried out using an RCM catalyst (Scholl, M.; Trnka, T. M.; Morgan, J. P.; Grubbs, R. H. \nTetrahedron Lett. \n1999, 40, 2247; Grubbs, R. H.; Miller, S. J.; Fu, G. C. \nAcc. Chem. Res. \n1995, 28, 446; Trnka, T. M.; Grubbs, R. H. \nAcc. Chem.

Organomet. Chem. \n1998, 1, 1; each of which is incorporated herein by reference) in toluene. This reaction, now uncomplicated by alternate metathesis pathways, provided exclusively the \ntrans isomers\n 47 and 48 in high yields. Installation of the thiazole moiety via a Wittig reaction proceeded with high E/Z selectivity and yield, to provide 28 and 29 following deprotection of the two silyl ethers (Hindupur, R. M.; Panicker, B.; Valluri, M.; Avery, M. A. \nTetrahedron Lett. \n2000, 2, 7341; incorporated herein by reference. Attempts to apply Avery's protocol for the installation of the thiazole gave the desired product in low yield and with poor E/Z selectivity). This route now meets the standards of amenability toward large scale synthesis.\n\n\nWe considered whether the incorporation of C9-C10 olefin in epothilone B (51, EpoB) would alter its biological profile in the same direction as was the case with its 12,13 desoxy counterparts. Toward this end, we studied the epoxidation of 28 with 2,2′-dimethydroxirane (DMDO). The reaction indeed proceeded with high chemoselectively at the more substituted C12-C13 olefin. There was obtained an 87% yield of a 1:2.6 ratio of the (E)-9,10-dehydroepothilone B (49) and its diastereomer bearing the α-12,13-oxirane (structure not shown). In vitro studies with 49 (whose configurations at C12 and C13 was established by its reduction to afford Epo B) revealed it to be roughly 2-4 fold more potent than the parent EpoB (51) in various cell lines. While \ncompound\n 49 proved to be the most potent epothilone we encountered in our program, its narrow therapeutic index in xenografts, as well as its difficult accessibility (vide supra) served to discourage further its pre-clinical development. Interestingly, the unnatural α-oxirane was virtually devoid of activity.\n\n\nProcessible Synthesis of (E)-9,10-Dehydroepothilones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother advantage of the restructured (second generation) synthesis, described above is that a variety of heterocycles can be installed via ketone intermediates 39a and 40a. This point is well highlighted by the synthesis of 9,10-dehydro-dEpoF. Wittig reaction of the ketone with the appropriate phosphonium ylides afforded the desired 9,10-dehydro-dEpoF compounds 57 and 59 in high yield and with high E/Z selectivity. Furthermore, we were able to efficiently convert the 21-hydroxy 59 to derivatives of the \n \ntype\n \n 96 and 97, containing amino functionality at C21 in several steps as shown below.\n\n\nDiversification of C-21 of (E)-9,10-Dehydroepothilones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fully synthetic epothilone analogs have been evaluated against a variety of cell types to determine their antitumor potential.\n\n\nThe most salient features of our findings, are as follow: One can expect a loss of ca. an order of magnitude in replacement of the C12-C13 β-epoxide by a E-12,13 double bond (compare EpoB and dEpoB in the sensitive CCRF-CEM cell line). Another expectation, is that inclusion of an E-9,10 double bond, in addition to the Z12,13-olefin leads to a significant increase in cytotoxicity across several cell lines.\n\n\nStill another instructive trend was seen in comparing 12-trifluoro-E-9,10-dehydro-dEpoB (29) (Fludelone), with the corresponding E-9,10-\ndehydro compound\n 28. Inclusion of the three fluorine atoms at C26, attenuates cytotoxicity by up to a factor of 4, relative to (1). This attenuation effect of the 12-trifluoromethyl function is also seen in compounds lacking the 9,10-unsaturation (compare dEpoB (1) and 12-trifluoro-dEpoB (2)).\n\n\nGiven these data, and given the accessibility of these 9,10-dehydro compounds (including 12-trifluoro congeners) through chemical synthesis, we were in a position to initiate in vivo experiments on our most promising compounds. We describe here some particularly striking and promising results with compound 29 (Fludelone), which has emerged as a most exciting possibility for advancement to clinical evaluation. In vivo experiments were carried out using human tumor xenografts in immunodeficient nude mice. For all their imperfections, such models in oncology are widely used in evaluating (Fiebig, H. H.; Berger, D. P.; Preclinical Phase II trials. In: Boven, E. and Winograd, B., Editors, \nThe Nude Mouse in Oncology Research\n, CRC Press, Boca Raton (1995), 318; incorporated herein by reference) the potential of anti-tumor lead compounds en route to clinical development.\n\n\nRemarkably, treatment of MX-1 xenografts with 30 mg/kg dosages of Fludelone, resulted in complete tumor disappearance and the absence of any relapse for over two months after suspension of treatment (See \nFIG. 83A\n). Most importantly, these therapeutic successes can be achieved either by 6 hr-i.v. infusion or by oral administration (See \nFIGS. 83B and 87A\n). On the other hand, treatment of the MX-1 xenografts by oral administration of taxol did not affect the tumor (See \nFIGS. 83B and 87A\n). It goes without saying that if translatable to the human clinical setting, achievement of oral activity could be of significant advantage.\n\n\nTaxol-resistant tumor xenografts (\nFIG. 84A\n) as well as human colon carcinoma (HCT-116, \nFIG. 86A\n) can also be cured with Fludelone by i.v. infusion. The experiments using human mammary carcinoma (MX-1) and human colon carcinoma (HCT-116) xenografts in nude mice lasted 6.0 and 6.6 months, respectively. There was no tumor relapse in either experiment during 4.3 and 5.3 months, respectively, following the cessation of treatment. For the HCT-116 experiment, taxol and Fludelone were compared at 20 mg/kg and both achieved tumor disappearance. The taxol treated group, relapsed 1.1 months after treatment was discontinued, whereas Fludelone-treated animals were tumor free for over 5.3 months.\n\n\nThese results have involved a particularly long and thorough therapeutic study using xenografts and report remarkably long periods of complete remission with parenteral or oral administration of a single antitumor agent.\n\n\nExperimentals\n\n\nGeneral Pharmacology Methods:\n\n\nTumor and Cell Lines. The CCRF-CEM human lymphoblastic leukemia cells and their vinblastine resistant subline (CCRF-CEM/VBL\n100\n, 720-fold resistance) were obtained from Dr. William Beck of the University of Illinois, Chicago, and CCRF-CEM/Taxol (44-fold resistance in vitro) were produced by exposing CCRF-CEM cells to increasing sublethal concentration (IC\n50\n-IC\n90\n) of paclitaxel during the six months. Human mammary carcinoma (MX-1), human lung carcinoma cells (A549) and human colon carcinoma (HCT-116) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, Md.).\n\n\nAnimals. Athymic nude mice bearing the nu/nu gene were obtained from NCI, Frederick, Md. and used for all human tumor xenografts. Except otherwise indicated for the female nude mice, male \nnude mice\n 6 weeks or older weighing 20-22 g or more were used. Drugs were administered via the tail vein for 6 hours by iv infusion using a homemade infusion mini-catheter and restrainer. A programmable Harvard PHD2000 syringe pump with multitrack was used for the iv infusion. A typical 6 hr infusion volume for each drug in Cremophor/ethanol (1:1) was 100 μl in 2.0 ml of saline. For oral administration, both Fludelone and Taxol were dissolved in ethanol and diluted 5-fold with Tween-80. The Taxol solution should be used within 5 min to avoid precipitation. Tumor volume was assessed using a caliper to measure the length×width×height (or width). For tumor-bearing nude mice, the body weight during the course of experiment refers to the total weight minus the weight of the tumor. All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the guidelines for the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Animals and the protocol approved by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n\nCytotoxicity Assays. In preparation for in vitro cytotoxicity assays, cells were cultured at an initial density 2-5×10\n4 \ncells per milliliter. They were maintained in a 5% CO\n2\n-humidified atmosphere at 37° C. in RPMI medium 1640 (GIBCO/BRL) containing penicillin (100 units/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL, GIBCO/BRL), and 5% heat-inactivated FBS. For solid tumor cells growing in a monolayer (such as HCT-116 and A549), cytotoxicity of the drug was determined in 96-well microtiter plates by using the sulforhodamine B method (Skehan, P.; Storeng, R.; Scudiero, D.; Monks, A.; McMahon, J.; Vistica, D.; Warren, J. T.; Bokesch, H.; Kenney, S.; Boyd, M. R. \nJ. Natl. Cancer Inst. \n1990, 82, 1107; incorporated herein by reference). For cells grown in suspension (such as CCRF-CEM and its sublines), cytotoxicity was measured, in duplicate, by using the 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-carboxanilide)-2H-terazodium hydroxide (XTT) microculture method (Scudiero, D. A.; Shoemaker, R. H.; Paull, K. D.; Monks, A.; Tierney, S.; Nofziger, T. H.; Currens, M. J.; Seniff, D.; Boyd, M. R. \nCancer Res. \n1988, 48, 4827; incorporated herein by reference) in 96-well microtiter plates. For both methods, the absorbance of each well was measured with a microplate reader (Power Wave XS, Bio-Tek, Winooski, Vt.). Dose-effect relationship data from 6 to 7 concentrations of each drug, in duplicate, were analyzed with the median-effect plot by using a computer program (Chou, T.-C. & Talalay, P. T. \nAdv. Enzyme Reg. \n1984, 22, 27; Chou, T.-C. & Hayball, M. \nCalcuSyn for Windows \n(Biosoft, Cambridge, U.K.) (1997); each of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nGeneral Chemical Methods: Reagents obtained from commercial suppliers were used without further purification unless otherwise noted. The following solvents were obtained from a dry solvent system (passed through a prepacked column of alumina) and used without further drying: tetrahydrofuran, methylene chrolide, diethyl ether, benzene, and toluene. Triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, diisopropylamine, pyridine, and 2,6-lutidine were distilled from calcium hydride. All air and water sensitive reactions were performed in flame-dried glassware under a positive pressure of prepurified nitrogen gas or argon gas. NMR (\n1\nH and \n13\nC) spectra were recorded on Bruker AMX-400 MHz or Bruker Advance DRX-500 MHz as noted individually, referenced to CDCl\n3 \n(7.27 ppm for \n1\nH and 77.1 ppm for \n13\nC) Infrared spectra (IR) were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR model 1600 spectrometer. Optical rotations were obtained on a JASCO model DIP-370 digital polarimeter. Low resolution (electrospray) mass spectra were recorded on \nPE SCIEX API\n 100. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on E. \nMerck silica gel\n 60 F254 plates. Compounds which were not UV active were visualized by dipping the plates in ethanolic para-anisaldehyde solution, ethanolic phosphomolybdic acid, or ceric ammonium molybdate or and heating. Preparative thin layer chromatography was performed using the indicated solvent on Whatman® (LK6F Silica gel 60A) TLC plate. Silica gel chromatography was performed using the indicated on Davisil® (grade 1740, type 60A, 170-400 mesh) silica gel.\n\n\nChemical shifts are reported in δ values relative to chloroform (δ 7.24 for proton and δ 77.0 for carbon NMR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a solution of \n \nethyl\n \n 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate (24.0 mL, 0.164 mol) in THF-water (3:1=V:V, 320 mL) at room temperature was added allyl bromide (20.0 mL, 1.4 equiv) followed by indium (powder, −100 mesh, 25 g, 1.3 equiv) and the resulting mixture was stirred at 48° C. for 15 h.

Description\n\n\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis present invention is a continuation patent application that claims priority to PCT patent application number PCT/GB2009/000653, filed Mar. 11, 2009, which claims the priority to Great Britain patent application number 0804701.1, filed on Mar. 13, 2008, the entirety of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compounds that are inhibitors of cysteine proteinases, pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds, and their use in therapy. More specifically, the invention relates to compounds that are inhibitors of cathepsin S, a cysteine proteinase of the CA clan. Such compounds are particularly useful for the in vivo therapeutic treatment of diseases in which participation of cathepsin S is implicated.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nProteinases form a substantial group of biological molecules which to date constitute approximately 2% of all the gene products identified following analysis of several completed genome sequencing programmes. Proteinases have evolved to participate in an enormous range of biological processes, mediating their effect by cleavage of peptide amide bonds within the myriad of proteins found in nature. This hydrolytic action is performed by initially recognising, then binding to, particular three-dimensional electronic surfaces displayed by a protein, which align the bond for cleavage precisely within the proteinase catalytic site. Catalytic hydrolysis then commences through nucleophilic attack of the amide bond to be cleaved either via an amino acid side-chain of the proteinase itself, or through the action of a water molecule that is bound to and activated by the proteinase. Proteinases in which the attacking nucleophile is the thiol side-chain of a Cys residue are known as cysteine proteinases. The general classification of ‘cysteine proteinase’ contains many members found in a wide range of organisms from viruses, bacteria, protozoa, plants and fungi to mammals. Cathepsin S and indeed many other crucial mammalian proteinases belong to the papain-like CAC1 family (see Barrett, A. J et al, in ‘Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes’, Eds. Barrett, A. J., Rawlings, N. D., and Woessner, J. F. Publ. Academic Press, 1998, for a thorough discussion).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo date, cysteine proteinases have been classified into five clans, CA, CB, CC, CD and CE (Barrett, A. J. et al, 1998). A proteinase from the tropical papaya fruit ‘papain’ forms the foundation of clan CA, which currently contains over 80 distinct and complete entries in various sequence databases, with many more expected from the current genome sequencing efforts. Proteinases of clan CA/family C1 have been implicated in a multitude of house-keeping roles and disease processes, e.g. human proteinases such as cathepsin K (osteoporosis, osteoarthritis), cathepsin S (multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disorders), cathepsin L (metastases), cathepsin B (metastases, arthritis), cathepsin F (antigen processing), cathepsin V (T-cell selection), dipeptidyl peptidase I (granulocyte serine proteinase activation) or parasitic proteinases such as falcipain (malaria parasite \nPlasmodium falciparum\n) and cruzipain (\nTrypanosoma cruzi \ninfection).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere currently exists a major unmet need for safe orally administered medications for the treatment of immune-based inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, asthma, atherosclerosis etc. The therapeutic inhibition of cathepsin S has been of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry as a potential target for immune system modulation. Cathepsin S is a lysosomal cysteine proteinase that is specifically up-regulated under inflammatory conditions. It is highly expressed in the spleen, in professional antigen presenting cells (APC's) and other MHC class II-positive cells and is inducible by IFN-γ. Intracellular cathepsin S specifically processes invariant chain, a protein involved in the correct loading of MHC-II with antigen (a key step in generating an immune response) (see Shi, G. P. et al., Immunity, 10(2). 197-206, 1999; Lui, W. and Spero, D. M. Drug News Perspect. 17(6), 357-363, 2004). The MHC-II/antigen complex is then displayed on the surface of the APC, for interaction with and activation of T-cells. Disrupting antigen presentation represents a validated approach to treating diseases with an autoimmune component such as rheumatoid arthritis (e.g. see Podolin, P. L., et al., Inflamm Res 50:S159. 2001), multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs well as its intracellular role in antigen presentation, cathepsin S is secreted from macrophages infiltrating sites of inflammation, to aid proteolysis of proteins and facilitate phagocytosis. However, in chronic inflammatory situations cathepsin S is responsible for degradation of structural tissue proteins and also mediates pain. Cathepsin S has been implicated in the destruction of articular cartilage in rheumatoid and osteoarthritis (e.g. see Hou, W-S. et al, Arthritis and Rheumatism, 46(3), 663-674, 2002 and refs cited therein), vascular tissue damage in atherosclerosis (e.g. see Rodgers, K. J. et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 26, 851-6, 2006) and lung tissue damage in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g. see Shapiro, S. D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 30(2), 98-102, 2002 and refs cited therein). Therefore an inhibitior of cathepsin S has the potential to tackle both diseases mediated through antigen presentation and extracellular matrix damage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, cathepsin S has been shown to be critical for the maintenance of neuropathic pain and spinal microglia activation in peripheral nerve-injured rats (see Clark, A. K. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 104(25), 10655-10660, 2007; Barclay, J., et al., Pain, 130(3), 225-234, 2007). Therefore inhibition of cathepsin S has therapeutic potential in the treatment of neuropathic pain (e.g. see WO-A-03020287).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the prior art, the development of cysteine proteinase inhibitors for human use has recently been an area of intense activity (e.g. see Deaton, D. N. and Kumar, S., Prog. Med. Chem. 42, 245-375, 2004; Bromme, D. and Kaleta, J., Curr. Pharm. Des., 8, 1639-1658, 2002; Kim, W. and Kang, K., Expert Opin. Ther. Patents, 12(3), 419-432, 2002; Leung-Toung, R. et al. Curr. Med. Chem., 9, 979-1002, 2002; Lecaille, F. et al., Chem. Rev., 102, 4459-4488, 2002; Hernandez, A. A. and Roush, W. R., Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., 6, 459-465, 2002; Link, J. O. and Zipfel, S. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev., 9(4), 471-482, 2006). Considering the CAC1 family members, particular emphasis has been placed upon the development of inhibitors of human cathepsins, primarily cathepsin K (osteoporosis) and cathepsin S (autoimmune disorders) through the use of covalent-bound but reversible peptide and peptidomimetic nitriles (e.g. see Bekkali, Y. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 17(9), 2465-2469, 2007; WO-A-07137738, WO-A-07003056), linear and cyclic peptide and peptidomimetic ketones (e.g. see Veber, D. F. and Thompson, S. K., Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev., 3(4), 362-369, 2000; WO-A-02057270, WO-A-04007501, WO-A-06064286, WO-A-05066180, WO-A-0069855), ketoheterocycles (e.g. see Palmer, J. T. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 16(11), 2909-2914, 2006, WO-A-04000838), α-ketoamides (e.g. see WO-A-06102243), cyanoamides (WO-A-01077073, WO-A-01068645) and arylnitriles (e.g. see WO-A-07080191, WO-A-07039470, WO-A-06018284, WO-A-05121106, WO-A-04000843) Inhibition of CAC1 proteases by non-covalent bound compounds has been extensively described in the literature. Particular emphasis has been placed upon inhibition of cathepsin K and cathepsin S by arylaminoethylamides (e.g. see Altmann, E., et al, J. Med. Chem., 45(12), 2352-2354, 2002; Chatterjee, A. K. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 17(10), 2899-2903, 2007; US-20050113356, US-20050107368, US-20050118568) and substituted pyrazoles or piperidines (e.g. see Wei, J., et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 17(20), 5525-5528, 2007; US-2007117785, US-2003073672, WO-A-02020013).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus the extensive prior art describes potent in vitro inhibitors of cathepsin S and inhibitors showing efficacy in numerous animal models of disease. However, the many difficulties in developing a human therapeutic for inhibition of cathepsin S are also evident since presently only one compound is in clinical development (RWJ-445380 for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, Quibell, M. (WO-A-02057270) described a new motif for the general inhibition of CAC1 proteinases based upon a cis-5,5-bicyclic ketone (1).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased upon this motif, highly potent and selective inhibitors of cathepsin K were discovered (see WO-A-0807109, WO-A-0807103, WO-A-0807130, WO-A-0807114, WO-A-0807127, WO-A-0807107, WO-A-0807112). The present inventors have now discovered a small genus of 6-(S)-chlorotetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-ones that exhibit potent and selective in vitro inhibition versus human cathepsin S.\n\n\n \nSTATEMENT OF INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nA first aspect of the invention relates to a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, complex or pro-drug thereof,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein:\n\n\none of R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nis H, and the other is selected from C\n1-6\n-alkyl, C\n1-6\n-haloalkyl, C\n1-6\n-alkoxy and C\n6-12\n-aralkyl;\n\n\nor R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare each independently selected from C\n1-6\n-alkyl and halo;\n\n\nR\n9 \nis selected from the following:\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein:\n\n\nX\n1\n, X\n2\n, X\n3\n, X\n4\n, X\n14\n, X\n15\n, X\n16 \nand X\n20 \nare each independently selected from:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCH, C—(C\n1-6\n-alkyl), C—(C\n1-6\n-alkoxy), C-halo and N;

Preferred examples include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, hexyl, heptyl and any simple isomers thereof. Suitable substituents include, for example, one or more C\n1-6 \nalkoxy, OH, COOH, COOMe, NH\n2\n, NMe\n2\n, NHMe, NO\n2\n, CN and/or CF\n3 \ngroups. Additionally, where the alkyl group contains two or more contiguous carbon atoms, an alkene group (—CH═CH—) or alkyne group (—C≡C—) may be present. Furthermore, the alkyl group may optionally contain one or more heteroatoms for example, to give ethers, thioethers, sulphones, sulphonamides, substituted amines, amidines, guanidines, carboxylic acids, carboxamides. If the heteroatom is located at a chain terminus then it is appropriately substituted with one or two hydrogen atoms. For example, the group CH\n3\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— is defined within ‘alkyl’ as a C\n4 \nalkyl that contains a centrally positioned heteroatom whereas the group CH\n3\n—CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— is defined within ‘alkyl’ as an unsubstituted C\n4 \nalkyl. Preferably, the alkyl group is a C\n1-6 \nalkyl group, more preferably a C\n1-4 \ngroup.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term ‘cycloalkyl’ as applied herein refers to a cyclic alkyl group (i.e. a carbocyclic ring) which may be substituted (mono- or poly-) or unsubstituted. Suitable substituents include, for example, one or more C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n1-6 \nalkoxy, OH, COOH, COOMe, NH\n2\n, NMe\n2\n, NHMe, NO\n2\n, CN, CF\n3 \nand/or halo groups. Preferably, the cycloalkyl group is a C\n3-6\n-cycloalkyl, even more preferably a C\n3-4 \ncycloalkyl group. Examples include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and the like. In addition, the carbocyclic ring itself may optionally contain one or more heteroatoms, for example, to give a heterocycloalkyl group such as tetrahydrofuran, pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine or morpholine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term ‘alkyoxy’ refers to the group ‘O-alkyl’ or ‘O-cycloalkyl’, wherein alkyl and cycloalkyl are as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n‘Halogen’ or ‘halo’ as applied herein encompasses F, Cl, Br, I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term ‘haloalkyl’ refers to an alkyl group as defined above substituted by one or more halogen atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term ‘aryl’ refers to a stable 5 or 6-membered monocylic ring which is unsaturated. The aryl group may optionally include one or more heteroatoms selected from O, N and S. In addition, the aryl group may be optionally substituted, for example, by one or more C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n1-6 \nalkoxy, OH, COOH, COOMe, NH\n2\n, NMe\n2\n, NHMe, NO\n2\n, CN, CF\n3 \nand/or halo groups. More preferably, the aryl group may be optionally substituted by one or more Me, OMe, OEt, OiPr, NO\n2\n, Cl or F groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term ‘aralkyl’ as applied herein includes an alkyl group as defined above in combination with an aryl group. The aryl group may be an aromatic ring, for example, a stable 5 or 6-membered monocylic or a stable 9 or 10-membered bicyclic ring which is unsaturated. The aryl group may optionally comprise one or more heteroatoms selected from O, N and S. In addition, the aryl group may be optionally substituted, for example, by one or more C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n1-6 \nalkoxy, OH, COOH, COOMe, NH\n2\n, NMe\n2\n, NHMe, NO\n2\n, CN, CF\n3 \nand/or halo groups. Preferably, the aralkyl group is a C\n1-8\n-alkyl-C\n5-10\n-aryl group, even more preferably a C\n1-8\n-alkyl-phenyl group. More preferably still, the alkyl-aryl group is selected from CH\n2\nPh and CH\n2\nOCH\n2\nPh.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes all salts, hydrates, solvates, complexes and prodrugs of the compounds of this invention.

preferred embodiment, the compound of the invention is selected from Examples 1-22 described hereinbelow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEven more preferably, the compound of the invention is selected from Examples 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 described hereinbelow.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nA further aspect of the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention admixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, excipients or carriers. Other active materials may also be present, as may be considered appropriate or advisable for the disease or condition being treated or prevented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEven though the compounds of the present invention (including their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters and pharmaceutically acceptable solvates) can be administered alone, they will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent, particularly for human therapy. The pharmaceutical compositions may be for human or animal usage in human and veterinary medicine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of such suitable excipients for the various different forms of pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be found in the “Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 2\nnd \nEdition, (1994), Edited by A Wade and P J Weller. The carrier, or, if more than one be present, each of the carriers, must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable carriers include lactose, starch, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sorbitol and the like. Examples of suitable diluents include ethanol, glycerol and water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe choice of pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent can be selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise as, or in addition to, the carrier, excipient or diluent any suitable binder(s), lubricant(s), suspending agent(s), coating agent(s), solubilising agent(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose, anhydrous lactose, free-flow lactose, beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums, such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethyl cellulose and polyethylene glycol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable lubricants include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Preservatives, stabilizers, dyes and even flavoring agents may be provided in the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of preservatives include sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Antioxidants and suspending agents may be also used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition as described above, the process comprising bringing the active compound(s) into association with the carrier, for example by admixture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active agent with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. The invention extends to methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising bringing a compound of general formula (I) in conjunction or association with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier or vehicle.\n\n\n \nSalts/Esters\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can be present as salts or esters, in particular pharmaceutically and veterinarily acceptable salts or esters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention include suitable acid addition or base salts thereof. A review of suitable pharmaceutical salts may be found in Berge et al, J Pharm Sci, 66, 1-19 (1977). Salts are formed, for example with strong inorganic acids such as mineral acids, e.g. hydrohalic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide and hydroiodide, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid sulphate, bisulphate, hemisulphate, thiocyanate, persulphate and sulphonic acids; with strong organic carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 4 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with aminoacids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid. Salts which are not pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable may still be valuable as intermediates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred salts include, for example, acetate, trifluoroacetate, lactate, gluconate, citrate, tartrate, maleate, malate, pantothenate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, butyrate, digluconate, cyclopentanate, glucoheptanate, glycerophosphate, oxalate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, nicotinate, palmoate, pectinate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, proprionate, tartrate, lactobionate, pivolate, camphorate, undecanoate and succinate, organic sulphonic acids such as methanesulphonate, ethanesulphonate, 2-hydroxyethane sulphonate, camphorsulphonate, 2-naphthalenesulphonate, benzenesulphonate, p-chlorobenzenesulphonate and p-toluenesulphonate; and inorganic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, bisulphate, hemisulphate, thiocyanate, persulphate, phosphoric and sulphonic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEsters are formed either using organic acids or alcohols/hydroxides, depending on the functional group being esterified. Organic acids include carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 12 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with aminoacids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid. Suitable hydroxides include inorganic hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide. Alcohols include alkanealcohols of 1-12 carbon atoms which may be unsubstituted or substituted, e.g. by a halogen).\n\n\n \nEnantiomers/Tautomers\n\n\n \n \n \nIn all aspects of the present invention previously discussed, the invention includes, where appropriate all enantiomers, diastereoisomers and tautomers of the compounds of the invention. The person skilled in the art will recognise compounds that possess optical properties (one or more chiral carbon atoms) or tautomeric characteristics. The corresponding enantiomers and/or tautomers may be isolated/prepared by methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnantiomers are characterised by the absolute configuration of their chiral centres and described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog. Such conventions are well known in the art (e.g. see ‘Advanced Organic Chemistry’, 3\nrd \nedition, ed. March, J., John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1985).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention containing a chiral centre may be used as a racemic mixture, an enantiomerically enriched mixture, or the racemic mixture may be separated using well-known techniques and an individual enantiomer may be used alone.\n\n\n \nStereo and Geometric Isomers\n\n\n \n \n \nSome of the compounds of the invention may exist as stereoisomers and/or geometric isomers—e.g. they may possess one or more asymmetric and/or geometric centres and so may exist in two or more stereoisomeric and/or geometric forms. The present invention contemplates the use of all the individual stereoisomers and geometric isomers of those inhibitor agents, and mixtures thereof. The terms used in the claims encompass these forms, provided said forms retain the appropriate functional activity (though not necessarily to the same degree).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of the agent or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. An isotopic variation of an agent of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine and chlorine such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n17\nO, \n18\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF and \n36\nCl, respectively. Certain isotopic variations of the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as \n3\nH or \n14\nC is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated, i.e., \n3\nH, and carbon-14, i.e., \n14\nC, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., \n2\nH, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. For example, the invention includes compounds of general formula (I) where any hydrogen atom has been replaced by a deuterium atom. Isotopic variations of the agent of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of this invention can generally be prepared by conventional procedures using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents.\n\n\n \nProdrugs\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention further includes the compounds of the present invention in prodrug form, i.e. covalently bonded compounds which release the active parent drug according to general formula (I) in vivo. Such prodrugs are generally compounds of the invention wherein one or more appropriate groups have been modified such that the modification may be reversed upon administration to a human or mammalian subject. Reversion is usually performed by an enzyme naturally present in such subject, though it is possible for a second agent to be administered together with such a prodrug in order to perform the reversion in vivo. Examples of such modifications include ester (for example, any of those described above), wherein the reversion may be carried out be an esterase etc. Other such systems will be well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA prodrug may for example constitute a ketal or hemiketal derivative of the exocyclic ketone functionality present in the 6-(S)-chlorotetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one scaffold.\n\n\n \nSolvates\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes solvate forms of the compounds of the present invention. The terms used in the claims encompass these forms.\n\n\n \nPolymorphs\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention further relates to the compounds of the present invention in their various crystalline forms, polymorphic forms and (an)hydrous forms. It is well established within the pharmaceutical industry that chemical compounds may be isolated in any of such forms by slightly varying the method of purification and or isolation form the solvents used in the synthetic preparation of such compounds.\n\n\n \nAssays\n\n\n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention relates to the use of a compound of the invention as defined hereinabove in an assay for identifying further candidate compounds that influence the activity of a cysteine proteinase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the assay is capable of identifying candidate compounds that are capable of inhibiting one or more CAC1 cysteine proteinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore preferably, the assay is a competitive binding assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the candidate compound is generated by conventional SAR modification of a compound of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “conventional SAR modification” refers to standard methods known in the art for varying a given compound by way of chemical derivatisation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one aspect, the identified compound may act as a model (for example, a template) for the development of other compounds. The compounds employed in such a test may be free in solution, affixed to a solid support, borne on a cell surface, or located intracellularly. The abolition of activity or the formation of binding complexes between the compound and the agent being tested may be measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay of the present invention may be a screen, whereby a number of agents are tested. In one aspect, the assay method of the present invention is a high through-put screen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralising antibodies capable of binding a compound specifically compete with a test compound for binding to a compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother technique for screening provides for high throughput screening (HTS) of agents having suitable binding affinity to the substances and is based upon the method described in detail in WO 84/03564.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is expected that the assay methods of the present invention will be suitable for both small and large-scale screening of test compounds as well as in quantitative assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the competitive binding assay comprises contacting a compound of the invention with a cysteine proteinase in the presence of a known substrate of said enzyme and detecting any change in the interaction between said cysteine proteinase and said known substrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the invention provides a method of detecting the binding of a ligand to a cysteine proteinase, said method comprising the steps of:\n\n \n \n \n(i) contacting a ligand with cysteine proteinase in the presence of a known substrate of said enzyme;\n \n(ii) detecting any change in the interaction between said enzyme and said known substrate; and wherein said ligand is a compound of the invention.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nOne aspect of the invention relates to a process comprising the steps of:\n\n\n \n \n(a) performing an assay method described hereinabove;\n\n\n(b) identifying one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain; and\n\n\n(c) preparing a quantity of said one or more ligands.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention provides a process comprising the steps of:\n\n \n \n \n(a) performing an assay method described hereinabove;\n \n(b) identifying one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain; and\n \n(c) preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising said one or more ligands.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention provides a process comprising the steps of:\n\n \n \n \n(a) performing an assay method described hereinabove;\n \n(b) identifying one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain;\n \n(c) modifying said one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain;\n \n(d) performing the assay method described hereinabove;\n \n(e) optionally preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising said one or more ligands.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to a ligand identified by the method described hereinabove.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another aspect of the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a ligand identified by the method described hereinabove.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention relates to the use of a ligand identified by the method described hereinabove in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of one or more disorders selected from rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, transplant rejection, diabetes, Sjogrens syndrome, Grave's disease, systemic lupus erythematosis, osteoarthritis, psoriasis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, allergic rhinitis, asthma, atherosclerosis, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above methods may be used to screen for a ligand useful as an inhibitor of one or more cysteine proteinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of general formula (I) are useful both as laboratory tools and as therapeutic agents. In the laboratory certain compounds of the invention are useful in establishing whether a known or newly discovered cysteine proteinase contributes a critical or at least significant biochemical function during the establishment or progression of a disease state, a process commonly referred to as ‘target validation’.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of validating a known or putative cysteine proteinase as a therapeutic target, the method comprising:\n\n\n \n \n(a) assessing the in vitro binding of a compound as described above to an isolated known or putative cysteine proteinase, providing a measure of potency; and optionally, one or more of the steps of:\n\n\n(b) assessing the binding of the compound to closely related homologous proteinases of the target and general house-keeping proteinases (e.g. trypsin) to provide a measure of selectivity;\n\n\n(c) monitoring a cell-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity, in the presence of the compound; and\n\n\n(d) monitoring an animal model-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity in the presence of the compound.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention therefore provides a method of validating a known or putative cysteine proteinase as a therapeutic target. Differing approaches and levels of complexity are appropriate to the effective inhibition and ‘validation’ of a particular target. In the first instance, the method comprises assessing the in vitro binding of a compound of general formula (I) to an isolated known or putative cysteine proteinase, providing a measure of ‘potency’. An additional assessment of the binding of a compound of general formula (I) to closely related homologous proteinases of the target and general house-keeping proteinases (e.g. trypsin) provides a measure of ‘selectivity’. A second level of complexity may be assessed by monitoring a cell-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity, in the presence of a compound of general formula (I). For example, an ‘osteoclast resorption assay’ has been utilised as a cell-based secondary in vitro testing system for monitoring the activity of cathepsin K and the biochemical effect of proteinase inhibitors (e.g. see WO-A-9850533). An ‘MHC-II processing—T-cell activation assay’ has been utilised as a cell-based secondary in vitro testing system for monitoring the activity of cathepsin S and the biochemical effect of proteinase inhibitors (Shi, G-P., et al, \nImmunity, \n10, 197-206, 1999). When investigating viral or bacterial infections such a marker could simply be a functional assessment of viral (e.g. count of mRNA copies) or bacterial loading and assessing the biochemical effect of proteinase inhibitors. A third level of complexity may be assessed by monitoring an animal model-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity, in the presence of a compound of general formula (I). For example, murine models of \nLeishmania \ninfection, \nP. vinckei \ninfection, malaria (inhibition of falcipain) and \nT. cruzi \ninfection (cruzipain), indicate that inhibition of cysteine proteinases that play a key role in pathogen propagation is effective in arresting disease symptoms, ‘validating’ said targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention therefore extends to the use of a compound of general formula (I) in the validation of a known or putative cysteine proteinase as a therapeutic target.\n\n\n \nBiological Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are structurally distinct from the prior art (e.g. WO-A-02057270; Quibell, M. et. al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 13, 609-625, 2005; Quibell M, et al Bioorg. Med. Chem., 12, 5689-5710, 2004; WO-A-05066180) in that a 6-(S)-chloro substituent and a 4-substituted cyclohexylglycyl moiety form an integral part. This combination of features provides compounds with surprisingly high efficacies for human cathepsin S and high in vitro selectivity versus other mammalian cathepsins, both of which are important properties required for development of an efficacious therapeutic. If either of these intrinsic moieties is removed from compounds of formula I, then a surprisingly large loss in potency and/or a significant loss in selectivity is observed. Indeed, all of the compounds of the present invention prepared to date exhibit potent and selective in vitro inhibition for human cathepsin S with Ki<25 nM. In contrast, the majority of the eighty-two prior art compounds detailed in WO-A-02057270 are significantly less potent against human cathepsin S than the compounds of the present invention, and in the majority of examples, greater than 100-fold less potent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe closest prior art, compound (38) (see WO-A-02057270, pg 151), exhibits a 111-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S upon addition of a 6-(S)-chloro substituent and substitution of the (S)-cyclohexylalanyl moiety with trans-(S)-(4(S)-methylcyclohexyl)glycyl (EXAMPLE 1). The surprising synergistic relationship between these two intrinsic changes is clearly seen when comparing prior art compound (38) with novel compounds (1-6) and EXAMPLE 1. Prior art compound (38) exhibits a 2.5-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S upon substitution of the (S)-cyclohexylalanyl moiety with (S)-(cyclohexyl)glycyl (Compound 1) but provides an inhibitor that has little selectivity verses cathepsin K. Further addition of a 6-(S)-fluoro substituent to Compound 1 provides a 3.8-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S (Compound 2) but again provides an inhibitor that has little selectivity verses cathepsin K. Alternatively, addition of a 6-(S)-chloro substituent to Compound 1 provides a 27-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S (Compound 3) but again provides an inhibitor that has only a modest 4-fold selectivity verses cathepsin K. However, whilst substitution of the (S)-cyclohexylglycyl moiety of Compound 1 with trans-(S)-(4(S)-methylcyclohexyl)glycyl (Compound 4) only provides a modest 3-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S, the selectivity verses other mammalian cathepsins, in particular cathepsin K, is dramatically increased to >65-fold. In contrast, addition of a 6-(S)-chloro substituent to Compound 1 and substitution of the (S)-cyclohexylglycyl moiety with trans-(S)-(4(S)-methylcyclohexyl)glycyl (EXAMPLE 1) not only provides a 45-fold improvement in potency but also gives an inhibitor with high selectivity against other mammalian cathepsins. The importance of both of these modifications for compounds of formula I is clearly seen when comparing EXAMPLE 1 with Compounds 5 and 6. Compound 5 which contains the 6-(S)-fluoro substituent in place of the 6-(S)-chloro substituent of EXAMPLE 1 is 5.6-fold less potent verses cathepsin S, but retains the high selectivity due to presence of the trans-(S)-(4(S)-methylcyclohexyl)glycyl moiety. Compound 6 which contains the 6-(R)-chloro substituent in place of the 6-(S)-chloro substituent of EXAMPLE 1 is 15-fold less potent verses cathepsin S, but again retains the high selectivity due to presence of the trans-(S)-(4(S)-methylcyclohexyl)glycyl moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of further comparison, consider novel compounds (7-12) and EXAMPLES 2 and 3. Addition of a 6-(S)-fluoro substituent to Compound 7 provides a 3.4-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S (Compound 8), an inhibitor with a modest 6.8-fold selectivity verses cathepsin K. Alternatively, addition of a 6-(S)-chloro substituent to Compound 7 provides a 47-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S (Compound 9), an inhibitor with a modest 7.5-fold selectivity verses cathepsin K. However, whilst substitution of the (5)-cyclohexylglycyl moiety of Compound 7 with trans-(S)-(4(S)-methylcyclohexyl)glycyl (Compound 10) only provides a modest 2.2-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S, the selectivity verses other mammalian cathepsins, in particular cathepsin K, is dramatically increased to >125-fold. In contrast, addition of a 6-(S)-chloro substituent to Compound 7 and substitution of the (S)-cyclohexylglycyl moiety with a trans-(S)-(4(S)-methylcyclohexyl)glycyl (EXAMPLE 2) or (S)-(4,4-dimethylcyclohexyl)glycyl (EXAMPLE 3) not only provides a significant improvement in potency verses cathepsin S (77-fold and 15-fold respectively) but also gives an inhibitor with high selectivity against other mammalian cathepsins. Again the importance of both of these modifications for compounds of formula I is clearly seen when comparing EXAMPLE 2 with Compounds 11 and 12. Compound 11 which contains the 6-(S)-fluoro substituent in place of the 6-(S)-chloro substituent of EXAMPLE 2 is 11-fold less potent verses cathepsin S, but retains the high selectivity due to presence of the trans-(S)-(4(S)-methylcyclohexyl)glycyl moiety. Compound 12 which contains the 6-(R)-chloro substituent in place of the 6-(S)-chloro substituent of EXAMPLE 2 is 25-fold less potent verses cathepsin S, but again retains the high selectivity due to presence of the trans-(S)-(4(S)-methylcyclohexyl)glycyl moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the compounds exhibit in vitro inhibition versus human cathepsin S with Ki <10 nM, more preferably <5 nM, even more preferably <2 nM and more preferably still <1 nM. The compounds of the invention exhibit high selectivity against other mammalian cathepsins displaying little or no inhibitory activity for cathepsins K, L, B and V at 1 μM compound.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Use\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of general formula (I) are useful for the in vivo treatment or prevention of diseases in which participation of a cysteine proteinase is implicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the compound of general formula I is selective for cathepsin S. As used herein, the term “selective for cathepsin S” means that the inhibitor is selective for cathepsin S over one or more other mammalian CAC1 cysteinyl proteinases for example cathepsin K, cathepsin L, cathepsin F, cathepsin B and cathepsin V. Preferably, the inhibitor exhibits a selectivity ratio for cathepsin S over other mammalian CAC1 cysteinyl proteinases of greater than 2-fold, more preferably greater than 5-fold, more preferably greater than 10-fold, even more preferably greater than 25-fold, more preferably still, greater than 50-fold or 100-fold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of general formula (I) for use in medicine, especially for preventing or treating diseases in which the disease pathology may be modified by inhibiting a cysteine proteinase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of a compound of general formula (I) in the preparation of a medicament for preventing or treating diseases in which the disease pathology may be modified by inhibiting a cysteine proteinase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain cysteine proteinases function in the normal physiological process of protein degradation in animals, including humans, e.g. in the degradation of connective tissue. However, elevated levels of these enzymes in the body can result in pathological conditions leading to disease. Thus, cysteine proteinases have been implicated in various disease states, including but not limited to, infections by \nPneumocystis carinii, Trypsanoma cruzi, Trypsanoma brucei brucei \nand \nCrithidia fusiculata\n; as well as in osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, autoimmunity, schistosomiasis, malaria, tumour metastasis, metachromatic leukodystrophy, muscular dystrophy, amytrophy, and the like (see WO-A-9404172 and EP-A-0603873 and references cited therein). Additionally, a secreted bacterial cysteine proteinase from \nS. Aureus \ncalled staphylopain has been implicated as a bacterial virulence factor (Potempa, J., et al. J. Biol. Chem., 262(6), 2664-2667, 1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is useful in the prevention and/or treatment of each of the disease states mentioned or implied above. The present invention also is useful in a method of treatment or prevention of diseases caused by pathological levels of cysteine proteinases, particularly cysteine proteinases of the papain superfamily, which methods comprise administering to an animal, particularly a mammal, most particularly a human, in need thereof a compound of the present invention. The present invention particularly provides methods for treating diseases in which cysteine proteinases are implicated, including infections by \nPneumocystis carinii, Trypsanoma cruzi, Trypsanoma brucei, Leishmania mexicana, Clostridium histolyticum, Staphylococcus aureus\n, foot-and-mouth disease virus and \nCrithidia fusiculata\n; as well as in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, autoimmunity, schistosomiasis, malaria, tumour metastasis, metachromatic leukodystrophy, muscular dystrophy, amytrophy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibitors of cathepsin S, particularly cathepsin S-specific compounds, are useful for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, transplant rejection, diabetes, Sjogrens syndrome, Grave's disease, systemic lupus erythematosis, osteoarthritis, psoriasis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, allergic rhinitis, asthma, atherosclerosis, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic pain. The compounds of the invention are particularly useful in the treatment of the above disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred features for each aspect of the invention are as for each other aspect mutatis mutandis.\n\n\n \nAdministration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be adapted for rectal, nasal, intrabronchial, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial and intradermal), intraperitoneal or intrathecal administration. Preferably the formulation is an orally administered formulation. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, i.e., in the form of discrete portions containing a unit dose, or a multiple or sub-unit of a unit dose. By way of example, the formulations may be in the form of tablets and sustained release capsules, and may be prepared by any method well known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for oral administration in the present invention may be presented as: discrete units such as capsules, gellules, drops, cachets, pills or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent; as a powder or granules; as a solution, emulsion or a suspension of the active agent in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion; or as a bolus etc. Preferably, these compositions contain from 1 to 250 mg and more preferably from 10-100 mg, of active ingredient per dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor compositions for oral administration (e.g. tablets and capsules), the term “acceptable carrier” includes vehicles such as common excipients e.g. binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, polyvinylpyrrolidone (Povidone), methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sucrose and starch; fillers and carriers, for example corn starch, gelatin, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium phosphate, sodium chloride and alginic acid; and lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium stearate and other metallic stearates, glycerol stearate stearic acid, silicone fluid, talc waxes, oils and colloidal silica. Flavouring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, cherry flavouring and the like can also be used. It may be desirable to add a colouring agent to make the dosage form readily identifiable. Tablets may also be coated by methods well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active agent in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may be optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther formulations suitable for oral administration include lozenges comprising the active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active agent in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active agent in a suitable liquid carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther forms of administration comprise solutions or emulsions which may be injected intravenously, intraarterially, intrathecally, subcutaneously, intradermally, intraperitoneally or intramuscularly, and which are prepared from sterile or sterilisable solutions. Injectable forms typically contain between 10-1000 mg, preferably between 10-250 mg, of active ingredient per dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be in form of suppositories, pessaries, suspensions, emulsions, lotions, ointments, creams, gels, sprays, solutions or dusting powders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alternative means of transdermal administration is by use of a skin patch. For example, the active ingredient can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin. The active ingredient can also be incorporated, at a concentration of between 1 and 10% by weight, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilisers and preservatives as may be required.\n\n\n \nDosage\n\n\n \n \n \nA person of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine an appropriate dose of one of the instant compositions to administer to a subject without undue experimentation. Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the individual undergoing therapy. The dosages disclosed herein are exemplary of the average case. There can of course be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with this invention, an effective amount of a compound of general formula (I) may be administered to inhibit the proteinase implicated with a particular condition or disease. Of course, this dosage amount will further be modified according to the type of administration of the compound. For example, to achieve an “effective amount” for acute therapy, parenteral administration of a compound of general formula (I) is preferred. An intravenous infusion of the compound in 5% dextrose in water or normal saline, or a similar formulation with suitable excipients, is most effective, although an intramuscular bolus injection is also useful. Typically, the parenteral dose will be about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg; preferably between 0.1 and 20 mg/kg, in a manner to maintain the concentration of drug in the plasma at a concentration effective to inhibit a cysteine proteinase. The compounds may be administered one to four times daily at a level to achieve a total daily dose of about 0.4 to about 400 mg/kg/day. The precise amount of an inventive compound which is therapeutically effective, and the route by which such compound is best administered, is readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by comparing the blood level of the agent to the concentration required to have a therapeutic effect. Prodrugs of compounds of the present invention may be prepared by any suitable method. For those compounds in which the prodrug moiety is a ketone functionality, specifically ketals and/or hemiketals, the conversion may be effected in accordance with conventional methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention may also be administered orally to the patient, in a manner such that the concentration of drug is sufficient to inhibit bone resorption or to achieve any other therapeutic indication as disclosed herein. Typically, a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound is administered at an oral dose of between about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg in a manner consistent with the condition of the patient. Preferably the oral dose would be about 0.5 to about 20 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNo unacceptable toxicological effects are expected when compounds of the present invention are administered in accordance with the present invention. The compounds of this invention, which may have good bioavailability, may be tested in one of several biological assays to determine the concentration of a compound which is required to have a given pharmacological effect.\n\n\n \nCombinations\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a particularly preferred embodiment, the one or more compounds of the invention are administered in combination with one or more other active agents, for example, existing drugs available on the market. In such cases, the compounds of the invention may be administered consecutively, simultaneously or sequentially with the one or more other active agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrugs in general are more effective when used in combination. In particular, combination therapy is desirable in order to avoid an overlap of major toxicities, mechanism of action and resistance mechanism(s). Furthermore, it is also desirable to administer most drugs at their maximum tolerated doses with minimum time intervals between such doses. The major advantages of combining chemotherapeutic drugs are that it may promote additive or possible synergistic effects through biochemical interactions and also may decrease the emergence of resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBeneficial combinations may be suggested by studying the inhibitory activity of the test compounds with agents known or suspected of being valuable in the treatment of a particular disorder. This procedure can also be used to determine the order of administration of the agents, i.e. before, simultaneously, or after delivery. Such scheduling may be a feature of all the active agents identified herein.\n\n\n \nSynthesis\n\n\nSynthesis of 5,5-Bicyclic Core\n\n\n \n \n \nOne aspect of the invention relates to a process of preparing a compound of formula (I) as defined above, said process comprising oxidation of a compound of formula (II).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable oxidising agent may be used to convert the secondary alcohol group of (II) into the corresponding ketone (I). Suitable oxidising agents will be familiar to the skilled artisan. By way of example, the oxidation may be carried out via a Dess-Martin periodinane reaction [Dess, D. B. et al, J. Org. Chem. 1983, 48, 4155; Dess, D. B. et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 7277], or via a Swern oxidation [Mancuso, A. J. et al, J. Org. Chem. 1978, 43, 2480]. Alternatively, the oxidation can be carried out using SO\n3\n/pyridine/Et\n3\nN/DMSO [Parith, J. R. et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967, 5505; U.S. Pat. No. 3,444,216, Parith, J. R. et al,], P\n2\nO\n5\n/DMSO or P\n2\nO\n5\n/Ac\n2\nO [Christensen, S. M. et al, Organic Process Research and Development, 2004, 8, 777]. Other alternative oxidation reagents include activated dimethyl sulphoxide [Mancuso, A. J., Swern, D. J., Synthesis, 1981, 165], pyridinium chlorochromate [Pianeatelli, G. et al, Sythesis, 1982, 245]and Jones' reagent [Vogel, A, I., Textbook of Organic Chemistry, 6\nth \nEdition].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore preferably, the process comprises treating a compound of formula (II) with Dess-Martin periodinane. Preferably, the reaction is carried out using dichloromethane as solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred embodiment, the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (III) into a compound of formula (II) through standard amide bond formation between R\n9\nCONHCH(C\n6\nH\n9\nR\n3\nR\n4\n)COOH and the compound of formula (III; R\n5\n═H) with a suitable carboxylic acid activating agent.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere R\n5 \nis a protecting group or hydrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred embodiment, protecting group R\n5 \nis selected from benzyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl, 1-(biphenyl-4-yl)-1-methylethoxycarbonyl, α,α-dimethyl-3,5-dimethoxylbenzyloxycarbonyl, p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl and trichloroethoxycarbonyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore preferably, R\n5 \nis benzyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) or flouren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment R\n5 \nis H.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a more preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (IV) into a compound of formula (III; R\n5\n═H)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere Lg is a leaving group such as tosylate or mesylate and R\n5 \nis as previously defined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an even more preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (IVa; R\n5\n═H) into a compound of formula (Ma) or a compound of formula (IVb; R\n5\n=Cbz) into a compound of formula (Mb)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor compounds of formulae (Ma) and (IIIb) the displacement of tosylate is typically performed using an excess of lithium chloride in DMF at 130° C. Displacement proceeds with inversion of configuration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (V) into a compound of formula (IV)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore preferably the intra-molecular cyclisation of compound (V) is induced by removal of the protecting group R\n5\n. Preferably, for this embodiment, R\n5 \nis benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), and the process comprises hydrogenating a compound of formula (V) in the presence of a palladium catalyst.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (VI) into a compound of formula (V)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred embodiment, the oxidising agent is mCPBA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment, the oxidising agent is a dioxirane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of dioxiranes as oxidising agents is well documented in the literature [see (a) Hodgson, D. M. et al, Synlett, 310 (2002); (b) Adam, W. et al, Acc. Chem. Res. 22, 205, (1989); (c) Yang, D. et al, J. Org. Chem., 60, 3887, (1995); (d) Mello, R. et al, J. Org. Chem., 53, 3890, (1988); (e) Curci, R. et al, Pure & Appl. Chem., 67(5), 811 (1995); (f) Emmons, W. D. et al, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 89, (1955)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the dioxirane is generated in situ by the reaction of KHSO\n5 \nwith a ketone. However, the oxidation step can also be carried out using an isolated dioxirane, for example a stock solution of the dioxirane formed from acetone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore preferably, the dioxirane is generated in situ using Oxone®, which is a commercially available oxidising agent containing KHSO\n5 \nas the active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one preferred embodiment, the claimed process involves the in situ epoxidation of a compound of formula (VI) using Oxone® (2 KHSO\n5\n.KHSO\n4\n.K\n2\nSO\n4\n) and a ketone co-reactant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, the active ingredient of Oxone® is potassium peroxymonosulfate, KHSO\n5 \n[CAS-RN 10058-23-8], commonly known as potassium monopersulfate, which is present as a component of a triple salt with the formula 2 KHSO\n5\n.KHSO\n4\n.K\n2\nSO\n4 \n[potassium hydrogen peroxymonosulfate sulfate (5:3:2:2), CAS-RN 70693-62-8; commercially available from DuPont]. The oxidation potential of Oxone® is derived from its peracid chemistry; it is the first neutralization salt of peroxymonosulfuric acid H\n2\nSO\n5 \n(also known as Caro's acid).\n\n\n \n \n \nK\n+−\nO—S(═O)\n2\n(—OOH)\n\n\n\n \nPotassium Monopersulfate\n\n\n \n \n \nUnder slightly basic conditions (pH 7.5-8.0), persulfate reacts with the ketone co-reactant to form a three membered cyclic peroxide (a dioxirane) in which both oxygens are bonded to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. The cyclic peroxide so formed then epoxidises the compound of formula VI by syn specific oxygen transfer to the alkene bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the ketone is of formula (XIX)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein R\na \nand R\nb \nare each independently alkyl, aryl, haloalkyl or haloaryl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere R\na \nand/or R\nb \nare alkyl, the alkyl group may be a straight chain or branched alkyl group. Preferably, the alkyl group is a C\n1-20 \nalkyl group, more preferably a C\n1-15\n, more preferably still a C\n1-12 \nalkyl group, more preferably still, a C\n1-8 \nor C\n1-6 \nalkyl group, more preferably a C\n1-4 \nalkyl group.

Treatment of monobromotosylate 47 with zinc dust at room temperature in organic/aqueous mixtures (most preferably an isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, water, ammonium chloride mixture) provides alcohol 14 respectively in high yield. Additionally, completion of the one-pot conversion gives alcohol VII and with defined stereochemistry and in high yield.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCommencing from the commercially available sugar isosorbide, the present invention also provides facile preparation of monobromotosylate 47. One highly preferred preparation is shown below in Scheme 15\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsosorbide (43) is converted to the di-tosylate (42) which is obtained following recrystallisation from methanol in 97% yield. Mono-bromination is effected by 2.5 eq lithium bromide in DMSO (or DMF) with temperature control 110° C.→120° C. The product bromide is isolated following extractive work-up and purification either by column chromatography (74%) or attractive for large scale by recrystallisation from methanol giving a first crop of 55% plus mother liquors containing good quality material that may be pooled from batch runs and purified later. Thus, preparation of monobromotosylate (47) with defined stereochemistry by methods in Scheme 15 is attractive for large scale applications. Treatment of monobromotosylate (47) with zinc dust at room temperature in organic/aqueous mixtures (most preferably an isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, water, ammonium chloride mixture) provides alcohol (14) which is derivatised as the Cbz compound (18) through one pot conversion. In one highly preferred embodiment of the invention, the 6-Cl-5,5-bicylic core is prepared in accordance with the steps set forth in Scheme 1 below:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alcohol functionality of (18) may be derivatised as the para-toluene sulphonate (Ts) giving (R)-2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-1-((S)-2,5-dihydro furan-2-yl)ethyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate (32b) which proceeds through the anti-epoxide (R)-2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-1-((1S,2S,5S)-3,6-dioxabicyclo [3.1.0]hexan-2-yl)ethyl 4-methylbenzenesulphonate (33b). Hydrogenation of tosylate (33b) provides free amine that undergoes intramolecular cyclisation to provide intermediate (74). Intermediate (74) undergoes displacement with an excess of lithium chloride in DMF at 130° C., to give the 6-chloro analogue with inversion of configuration. Urethane protection of the secondary amine of the bicyclic intermediate (69) followed by oxidation to ketone provides intermediate (71) that is particularly useful for solid phase synthesis of compounds of general formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdvantageously, the epoxidation to give the desired anti-epoxide is directed by the presence of the tosylate group.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, intermediate tosylate (74) may be Cbz protected to give protected analogue (34b) that may undergo inversion to chloride (68) through treatment with LiBr in DMF at typically 130° C. (Scheme 1).\n\n\n \nPreparation of Novel Aminoacids\n\n\n \n \n \nThe novel 4-substituted cyclohexylglycine amino acids that are an intrinsic feature of compounds of formula I may be prepared following adaptation of a variety of known general literature syntheses of aminoacids. In one such method, a 4-substituted cyclohexane acetic acid (e.g. trans-4-methylcyclohexane acetic acid CAS 7132-93-6) is converted to the novel chiral aminoacid (e.g. (S)-2-(tent-butoxycarbonylamino)-2-((1r, 4S)-4-methylcyclohexyl)acetic acid (130)) following Scheme 18 (general method is detailed in WO-A-98017626 (pg 49)).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, commercially available trans-(4-methylcyclohexyl)acetic acid (131) (CAS 7132-93-6; ABCR GmbH AB168553; Shanghai FWD Chemicals Ltd K7354) is converted into the Evans auxiliary (127) following the general methods detailed in WO98017626 (pg 49). Asymmetric addition of azide is then conducted by deprotonation of (127) and reaction with trisyl azide. Reduction of azide (128) and concomitant Boc amino protection following the general methods detailed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,128,448 provides intermediate (129). Finally, hydrolysis of the auxiliary is conducted with hydrogen peroxide and lithium hydroxide following the general methods detailed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,128,448. The final product (130) is obtained following simple aqueous extraction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternative 4-substituted cyclohexane acetic acids may be used following Scheme 18 to provide alternative analogues of compounds of formula I. For example, trans-(4-ethylcyclohexyl)acetic acid (CAS 125533-06-4) provides compounds of formula I where R\n3\n═H and R\n4\n=Et; trans-(4-methoxycyclohexyl)acetic acid (CAS 879877-61-9) provides compounds of formula I where R\n3\n═H and R\n4\n═OMe; 4-(trifluoromethylcyclohexyl)acetic acid (CAS 803736-46-1) provides compounds of formula I where R\n3\n═H and R\n4\n═CF\n3\n; trans-(4-n-propylcyclohexyl)acetic acid (CAS 71458-18-9) provides compounds of formula I where R\n3\n═H and R\n4\n=n-propyl; trans-(4-isopropylcyclohexyl)acetic acid (CAS 882658-76-6) provides compounds of formula I where R\n3\n═H and R\n4\n=isopropyl; (4,4-dimethylcyclohexyl)acetic acid (CAS 681448-25-9, see WO-A-04037769, compound 39C, pg 42) through the known aminoacid (S)-2-amino-2-(4,4-dimethylcyclohexyl)acetic acid (CAS 754178-25-1, see WO-A-03062265, example XVII, pg 197), provides compounds of formula I where R\n3\n, R\n4\n=Me; (4,4-difluorocyclohexyl)acetic acid (CAS 915030-40-9, see WO-A-06124490) through the known aminoacid 2-amino-2-(4,4-difluorocyclohexyl)acetic acid (CAS 769169-46-2), provides compounds of formula I where R\n3\n, R\n4\n═F.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther novel 4-substituted cyclohexane acetic acids may readily be prepared from the corresponding 4-substituted cyclohexanone following the general methods detailed by Bennani, Y. L. et al (WO-A-04037769).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSynthesis of Compounds of Formula (I)\n\n\n \n \n \nTo those skilled in the practices of organic chemistry, compounds of general formula (I) may be readily synthesised by a number of chemical strategies, performed either in solution or on the solid phase (see Atherton, E. and Sheppard, R. C. In ‘\nSolid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach’\n, Oxford University Press, Oxford, U.K. 1989, for a general review of solid phase synthesis principles), or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of general formula (I) may be conveniently considered as a combination of three building blocks (P1, P2 and P3) that respectively occupy the 51, S2 and S3 binding sites of the protease (see Berger, A. and Schechter, I., \nPhilos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. [Biol.], \n257, 249-264, 1970 for a description of the designation of enzyme S-subsites and substrate P-subsites within enzyme-substrate or enzyme-inhibitor complexes). The notional concepts of P1, P2 and P3 are used herein for convenience only and the above-mentioned compounds are intended to be within the scope of the invention regardless of binding mode.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitably protected and/or activated building block may then be prepared and subsequently chemically bonded (coupled) together with other building blocks to provide compounds of general formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (I) may be prepared: (1) by the stepwise addition of P3 and P2 to the bicyclic 6-(S)-chlorotetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one core; or (2) by reaction of the bicyclic 6-(S)-chlorotetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one core with a P3−P2 prescursor molecule; or (3) by introducing the P3−P2 group prior to formation of the bicyclic 6-(S)-chlorotetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one core, i.e. prior to the oxidation step or prior to the intramolecular cyclisation step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, alternative orders of coupling of the building blocks are possible, for example P2+P1→P2−P1 then addition of P3→P3−P2−P1 or P3+P2→P3−P2 then addition to P1→P3−P2−P1. Within each of these combinations each of the P1, P2 or P3 building blocks may contain additional alternative functionalities that are further transformed following coupling to give the final compound. For example the ketone functionality of the P1 building block may be protected as a ketal during coupling of building blocks and transformed to the final ketone by hydrolysis following completion of the coupling reactions. Alternatively, the ketone functionality of the P1 building block may be initially introduced via a lower oxidation state such as the corresponding alcohol and following completion of the coupling reactions be re-introduced by oxidation of the alcohol. Alternatively, the ketone functionality of the P1 building block may be protected through a semi-carbazone suitable for solid phase synthesis (e.g. see WO 02/057270 and references cited therein) and following completion of the coupling reactions released from the solid phase by acidolytic reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chemical bond formed by coupling of the building blocks is a secondary amide (P3−P2) or a tertiary amide (P2−P1) that is formed through reaction of an activated carboxylic acid with a primary and secondary amine respectively. Many methods are available for activation of a carboxylic acid prior to coupling to an amine and in principle, any of these methods may be used herein. Typical carboxylic acid activation methods are exemplified but not restricted to the azide method, mixed anhydride method (e.g. via isobutylchloroformate), carbodiimide methods (e.g. via dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3-(3′-dimethylamino propyl)carbodiimide), active ester method (e.g. via p-nitrophenyl ester, N-hydroxysuccinic imido ester, pentafluorophenyl ester), uronium method (e.g. via addition of HBTU, PyBop, BOP), carbonyldiimidazole method or via pre-formation of acyl fluorides or acyl chlorides. In some instances the coupling reaction may be enhanced by the addition of a further activation catalyst such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, or 4-dimethylaminopyridine. A general description of carboxylic acid activation techniques and the use of activation additives may be found in Bodanszky, M. ‘Principles of Peptide Synthesis’, 2\nnd \nrev. ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1993 and references cited therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe α-amino group of the P2 aminoacid building block is usually protected during coupling reactions to the P1 building block to avoid the formation of undesired self-condensation products. The art of α-amino protection is well known in peptide chemistry (e.g. see Bodanszky, M. ‘Principles of Peptide Synthesis’, 2\nnd \nrev. ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1993 and references cited therein) and example protection groups include, but are not limited to, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) and trichloroethoxycarbonyl (Treoc). The Fmoc group is particularly well suited for solid phase syntheses (e.g. see Atherton, E.; Sheppard, R. C. in ‘Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis A Practical Approach’, IRL Press, Oxford, U.K., 1989) typically being removed by treatment with 20% v/v piperidine in dimethylformamide or 1% v/v 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene in dimethylformamide. The Boc group is particularly well suited to solution phase syntheses typically being removed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid based mixtures or HCl in dioxane or ethyl acetate. The Cbz group is also particularly well suited for solution phase syntheses typically being removed by catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen and palladium catalysis or by treatment with HBr in acetic acid. Once the coupling sequence is complete, any protecting groups are removed in whatever manner is dictated by the choice of protecting groups (for a general description of protecting groups and their respective stabilities and methods of removal see Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M. ‘Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis’ John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1991 and references therein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the simplest example, the entire left hand portion of a compound of general formula (I) (i.e. P3−P2) as the carboxylic acid can be prepared in solution by traditional organic chemistry methods and coupled to ketone, alcohol or ketal intermediates such as compounds (IIb), (IIc) and (IId). Then oxidation of the alcohol intermediate (e.g. Dess-Martin periodinane in DCM) or acidolytic cleavage of the ketal intermediate provides compounds of general formula (I). The alcohol oxidation route is particularly useful when the compound of general formula (I) contains a substituent that is labile to trifluoroacetic acid, this being the final reagent used in each of the solid phase syntheses.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of these different coupling tactics have been detailed previously (see (i) Quibell, M. et. al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. \n13, 609-625, 2005. (ii) Wang, Y. et. al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. \n15, 1327-1331, 2005) and the optimum synthetic route is dependant upon the specific substituent combinations of the target compound of general formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn more detail, one preferred strategy for the synthesis of compounds of general formula (I) comprises:—\n\n \n \n \n(a) Preparation of an appropriately functionalised and protected bicyclic ketone or bicyclic alcohol building block in solution;\n \n(b) Attachment of the building block (a) to the solid phase through a linker that is stable to the conditions of synthesis, but readily labile to cleavage at the end of a synthesis (see James, I. W., \nTetrahedron, \n55(Report N\n \no\n \n489), 4855-4946, 1999, for examples of the ‘linker’ function as applied to solid phase synthesis);\n \n(c) Solid phase organic chemistry (see Brown, R. D. \nJ. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. \n1, 19, 3293-3320, 1998), to construct the remainder of the molecule;\n \n(d) Compound cleavage from the solid phase into solution; and\n \n(e) Cleavage work-up and compound analysis.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nA second strategy for the synthesis of compounds of general formula (I) comprises:—\n\n \n \n \n(a) Preparation of an appropriately functionalised and protected bicyclic intermediate building block in solution. Preferred protecting groups for solution phase chemistry are the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), Nα-tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), Nα-benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and Nα-allyloxycarbonyl group (Alloc).\n \n(b) Standard organic chemistry methods for the conversion of building block obtained in step (a) towards compounds of general formula (I).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, in one preferred embodiment of the invention, compounds of formula (I) may be prepared using conventional solution phase chemistry, for example, as described in Quibell, M et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 13, 609-625, 2005 (see in particular, Schemes 3 and 4). The solution phase strategy is attractive in being able to generate larger quantities of preferred analogues, typically on a multi-gram to multi-kilogram scale.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative preferred embodiment of the invention, compounds of formula (I) may be prepared using conventional solid phase chemistry, for example, as described in Quibell M, et al Bioorg. Med. Chem., 12, 5689-5710, 2004, see in particular, Scheme 3 and Section 3.2, and references cited therein; and Bioorg. Med. Chem., 13, 609-625, 2005, see Scheme 5 and Section 2.2, and references cited therein). The solid phase strategy is attractive in being able to generate many thousands of analogues, typically on a 5-100 mg scale, through established parallel synthesis methodologies (e.g. see (a) Bastos, M.; Maeji, N. J.; Abeles, R. H. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n92, 6738-6742, 1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthetic strategy is based on reversible anchorage of the ketone functionality via a hydrazide linker bond using general multipin techniques previously described in the art (Watts J. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 12(11), 2903, 2004; Quibell M., et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 5689-5710, 2004; Grabowksa U. et al, J. Comb. Chem. 2000, 2(5), 475). Compounds of formula (III; R\n5\n=Fmoc) may be oxidised to the corresponding ketone (e.g. XVI, Scheme 3) and utilised in a solid phase synthesis of inhibitor molecules (I). The solid phase linkage of an aldehyde or ketone, has previously been described by a variety of methods (e.g. see (a) James, I. W., 1999, (b) Lee, A., Huang, L., Ellman, J. A., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc, \n121(43), 9907-9914, 1999, (c) Murphy, A. M., et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 114, 3156-3157, 1992). A suitable method amenable to the reversible linkage of an alkyl ketone functionality is through a combination of the previously described chemistries. The semicarbazide, 4-[[(hydrazinocarbonyl)amino]methyl]cyclohexane carboxylic acid. trifluoroacetate (Murphy, A. M., et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 114, 3156-3157, 1992), may be utilised as illustrated in Scheme 3, exemplified by linkage of the Fmoc protected 6-(S)-chlorotetrahydro furo [3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one (71).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConstruct (XVII) is prepared through reaction of the linker molecule and the 6-(S)-chlorotetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one (71) by refluxing in aqueous ethanol/sodium acetate.

The methods used were directly analogous to those described in detail in WO02057270, utilising the 4-{[(Hydrazinocarbonyl)amino]methyl}cyclohexane carboxylic acid trifluoroacetate based linker, solid phase lanterns (ex Mimotopes), standard Fmoc chemistries and acidolytic cleavage followed by semi-preparative HPLC purification (see WO02057270 pg 124-127 for full generic details). Novel compounds (1-22) or prior art compound (38) are detailed for comparison and can readily be prepared by the general methods detailed in WO02057270 or WO0807127 through use of appropriate Fmoc-ketone building blocks (e.g. 6-unsubstituted bicycle (WO02057270), compound 19, pg 134; 6(S)-fluoro bicycle (WO0807127, compound 63, pg 88); 6(S)-chloro bicycle (WO0807127, compound 71, pg 94); 6(R)-chloro bicycle (WO0807127, compound 79, pg 98)).

In all cases the DMSO concentration in the assays was maintained at less than 1% (vol./vol.). The equilibrium inhibition constants (K\ni\n \nss\n) for each compound were measured under steady-state conditions monitoring enzyme activity as a function of inhibitor concentration.

All liver microsome incubations were carried out in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, with a final microsomal protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Compounds were taken from 5 mM DMSO stock solutions and diluted in incubation buffer to give a final concentration of 25 μM, with a final DMSO concentration of 0.5% v/v. In brief, compounds were added to the incubation buffer along with the liver microsomes and incubated at 37° C. for 10 minutes. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of NADPH, previously dissolved in incubation buffer, to give a final concentration of 1 mM and re-incubated at 37° C. Aliquots were removed at 2 and 60 minutes and quenched with an equal volume of cold acetonitrile. After mixing vigorously, the precipitated protein matter was removed by filtration (Multiscreen Solvinert filter plates, Millipore, Bedford, Mass., USA) and the filtrate analysed by reverse phase HPLC with mass spectrometric detection, using single ion monitoring of the [M+H]\n+\n species.

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 12/141,228 filed Jun. 18, 2008 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/948,213 filed Jul. 6, 2007.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to non-basic melanin concentrating hormone receptor-1 (MCHR1) antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions containing MCHR1 antagonists and methods of treating diabetes, obesity and related diseases employing such MCHR1 antagonists.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nSeveral lines of pharmacological and genetic evidence support the role of Melanin Concentrating Hormone Receptor-1 (hereafter “MCHR1”) as a modulator of food intake and body weight. Central administration of melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) increases food intake and body weight both in rats and in mice. Chronic ICV infusion of MCH causes increased food intake and ultimately obesity in mice, while infusion of an MCH peptide antagonist blocks MCH-induced food intake and results in weight loss and decreased feeding in diet-induced obese mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression of both the MCH peptide and receptor are modulated by nutritional status. MCH mRNA is upregulated both in hyperphagic obese mice (ob/ob), and fasted animals. Targeted disruption of the gene for MCH peptide results in hypophagia and leanness. Disruption of the MCHR1 gene causes leanness, altered metabolism, and hyperlocomotion accompanied by mild hyperphagia. Conversely, over-expression of MCH peptide results in hyperphagia, obesity and diabetes. Small molecule MCHR1 antagonists have been shown to cause weight loss in rodent weight and feeding models after both oral and intraperitoneal administration; \nEur. J. Pharmacol., \n438:129-135 (2002), \nNat. Med., \n8:825-830 (2002), \nEur. J. Pharmacol., \n497:41-47 (2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous non-peptide MCHR1 antagonists have been disclosed. The scope of the genus for each reflects a common perception regarding the criteria required for ligand recognition as MCHR1 agonists. A recent review of MCHR1 patent disclosures emphasized the commonality of these structures by the following description; “Ubiquitous throughout the MCH patent literature are molecules consisting of a central scaffold to which linkers to an aryl or heteroaryl group and a basic amino functionality are attached.” (Kowalski, T. J. et al., \nExpert Opin. Investig. Drugs, \n13:1113-1122 (2004)). Pharmacophore models of these geni consistently envision a presumed prerequisite electrostatic interaction between a basic amine center of the antagonist ligand and aspartic acid 123 of the receptor which presumably is envisaged to emulate the mandatory interaction between arginine 14 of MCH peptide agonists with aspartic acid 123 of the MCHR1 receptor. (Ulven, T., \nJ. Med. Chem., \n48:5684-5697 (2005)) However, incorporation of this basic amine in a MCHR1 antagonist increases substantially the probability of binding to off-target ion-channels and biogenic amine receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, there is provided a series of novel high affinity selective MCHR1 antagonists for which binding affinity is not dependent upon inclusion of a basic amine functionality that is common to most of the disclosed MCHR antagonists. As a consequence, the absence of the basic center greatly reduces the probability of off-target interactions such as binding to other biogenic amine receptors as well as binding to ion channels such as the HERG receptor in the heart. The reduction/abolition of affinity for the HERG receptor is especially important since ligand occupancy is associated with initiation of fatal arrhythmias.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, a compound of the Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is provided\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nis a phenylene ring or a heteroaryl ring which is a monocyclic ring or a bicyclic ring which contains one or two nitrogen atoms or one oxygen atom;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1 \nis Z—Y—X—, wherein\n\n \n \n \n \n \nX is O, S,\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nY is a bond, a 3- to 6-membered cycloalkyl, or an alkyl chain; and\n\n\nZ is aryl such as phenyl and naphthyl, or heteroaryl such as pyridinyl, pyridimidinyl, pyrazinyl, benzimidazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, or other “heteroaryl”;\n\n\nR\n2 \nis -E-G-(J)\nm\n, with m being an integer from 1 to 3;\n\n\nE is O, S, or a bond;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nG is lower alkyl, phenylalkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, alkylcycloalkyl, cycloalkoxy, alkylcycloalkoxy, or cycloalkoxyalkyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \neach J is independently hydrogen, hydroxyl, CN, —SO\n2\nR\n7\n, —SR\n7\n, —SOR\n7\n, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, CF\n3\n, CF\n3\nO—, —COOR\n5 \n(wherein R\n5 \nis H, C\n1-3 \nalkyl, or cycloalkyl), or —CO—NR\n5a\nR\n6 \nwherein R\n5a \nand R\n6 \nare each independently selected from H, C\n1-3 \nalkyl, or cycloalkyl, or R\n5a \nand R\n6 \ntaken together can be propanediyl, butanediyl or pentanediyl to form with the N atom to which they are attached a 4-, 5- or 6-membered cyclic amine, such as azetidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, or piperazinyl, optionally substituted with substituents as set out for “heterocyclo”;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n7 \nis lower alkyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n3 \nis C\n1-6 \nalkyl, cycloalkyl, C\n1-6 \nalkoxy, halogen, hydrogen, —S—C\n1-6 \nalkyl, CN, CF\n3\nO, or CF\n3\n;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nand wherein R\n2 \nand R\n3 \ncan be taken together to form a 5- to 7-membered ring which is saturated, unsaturated, or partially unsaturated and may include an E heteroatom, which is O, or 0, 1 or 2 N atoms, which ring is substituted with one or two of —O-G-(J)\nm \ngroups, wherein at least one J is OH, and optionally other substituents as set out for “alkyl”, “aryl”, or “heteroaryl”, such as alkyl and/or OH;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwith the proviso that where\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nis a phenylene ring, E-G and R\n3 \nare not identical unsubstituted lower alkoxy groups, and when G is lower alkyl and J is H, R\n3 \nis not hydrogen; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n8 \nand R\n9 \nare each independently hydrogen, halogen, or lower alkyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nincluding esters thereof, prodrugs thereof, solvates thereof, and all stereoisomers thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the foregoing Z moieties may either be unsubstituted or substituted with 1, 2 or 3 of amino, halo, C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n1-3 \nalkylamino, di-C\n1-3 \nalkylamino, C\n1-3 \nalkoxy, C\n1-3 \nthioalkyl, C\n1-3 \ntrifluoroalkoxy, trifluoromethyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkoxy, or heteroaryl such as pyridyl or substituted with any of the substituents as set out for “aryl”, “heteroaryl”, or “alkyl”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of substituents for the J group in the form of a cyclic amine include but are not limited to lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, OH, CF\n3\n, or CF\n3\nO, or other substituents as set out for “alkyl” and “heteroaryl”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which contains a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of the invention Formula I as defined above, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is also provided a method for the treatment of diabetes, obesity and other related conditions involving the MCHR1 in a mammal (such as a human, dog or cat) in need thereof, which includes the steps of administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of Formula I of the invention as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also sets forth one or more methods for making the compound of Formula I of the invention.

The term “prodrug” as used herein encompasses both the term “prodrug esters” and the term “prodrug ethers”. The term “prodrug esters” as employed herein includes esters and carbonates formed by reacting one or more hydroxyls of compounds of Formula I with either alkyl, alkoxy, or aryl substituted acylating agents or phosphorylating agent employing procedures known to those skilled in the art to generate acetates, pivalates, methylcarbonates, benzoates, amino acid esters, phosphates, half acid esters such as malonates, succinates or glutarates, and the like.

Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred. If the compounds of Formula I have, for example, at least one basic center, they can form acid addition salts. These are formed, for example, with strong inorganic acids, such as mineral acids, for example sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid (phosphate ester) or a hydrohalic acid, with organic carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example acetic acid, which are unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by halogen as chloroacetic acid, such as saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or terephthalic acid, such as hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid, such as amino acids, (for example aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, valine, lysine, or arginine), or benzoic acid, or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C\n1\n-C\n4\n) alkyl or arylsulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted, for example by halogen, for example methyl- or p-toluene-sulfonic acid. Corresponding acid addition salts can also be formed having, if desired, an additionally present basic center. The compounds of Formula I having at least one acid group (for example COOH) can also form salts with bases. Suitable salts with bases are, for example, metal salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, for example sodium, potassium or magnesium salts, or salts with ammonia or an organic amine, such as morpholine, thiomorpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, a mono, di or tri-lower alkylamine, for example ethyl, tert-butyl, diethyl, diisopropyl, triethyl, tributyl or dimethyl-propylamine, or a mono, di or trihydroxy lower alkylamine, for example mono, di or triethanolamine. Corresponding internal salts may furthermore be formed. Salts which are unsuitable for pharmaceutical uses but which can be employed, for example, for the isolation or purification of free compounds of Formula I or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are also included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred salts of the compounds of Formula I which contain a basic group include monohydrochloride, hydrogensulfate, methanesulfonate, phosphate, nitrate or acetate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred salts of the compounds of Formula I which contain an acid group include sodium, potassium and magnesium salts and pharmaceutically acceptable organic amines\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention are contemplated, either in admixture or in pure or substantially pure form.

The reaction was stirred at ambient temperature for 20 min until it became a solid mass; whereupon, the chloropyrazinone prepared in Part C (100 mg, 0.38 mmol) in THF (5 mL) was added resulting in gas evolution. After stirring at ambient temperature for 40 min, the reaction was diluted with CH\n2\nCl\n2\n/H\n2\nO, extracted with CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(2×) and dried over MgSO\n4 \nto afford 220 mg of crude product after evaporation of the solvent. The desired was purified by chromatography on silica gel (12 g) employing gradient elution (0-100% EtOAc/hexane over 12 min) to elute the desired 3-(4-chlorobenzylthio)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)pyrazin-2(1H)-one (130 mg, 89% yield).\n\n\n \nMethod 2\n\n\n \n \n \nA solution of the 1-aryl pyrazine-2,3(1H,4H)-dione prepared in Part B (67 mg, 0.27 mmol), diisopropylethyl amine (0.15 mL, 0.81 mmol), pyBOP (0.23 g, 0.46 mmol), and dimethylaminopyridine (13 mg) in DMF (1.2 mL) was stirred at ambient temperature for 15 min. After addition of 2-pyridylethyl mercaptan (28 mg, 0.40 mmol), the reaction was stirred at ambient temperature for 2.5 h prior to quenching by addition of H\n2\nO and extraction with EtOAc. The EtOAc extracts were washed with water (2×), brine, dried over MgSO\n4 \nand concentrated to yield 204 mg of crude product. Chromatography on silica employing a gradient elution with hexane/EtOAc afforded the desired product 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(2-(pyrazin-2-yl)ethylthio)pyrazin-2(1H)-one (17 mg, 17% yield).\n\n\n \nMethod 2a\n\n\n \n \n \nThe same procedure was employed as that described in Method 2 except that the reaction was run for 18 hr.\n\n\n \nMethod 3\n\n\n \n \n \nFollowing preparation of the oxalamide as described in Part A, ring closure can be effected by prolonged thermal heating in TFA/HOAc at 78° C. for 1d. In the case of 3-methoxy-4-(2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethoxy)aniline which contained a basic amine, the reaction was brought to pH 6 to 7 with saturated NaHCO\n3 \nand then evaporated in vacuo. The residue was absorbed on silica gel and purified by flash chromatography (5 to 15% 2N NH\n3 \nin MeOH/CH\n2\nCl\n2\n) to afford the desired 1-aryl pyrazine-2,3(1H,4H)-dione in 36% yield. This material was subsequently converted to final product following the procedure described in Method 2.\n\n\n \nMethod 4\n\n\n \n \n \nIf the oxalamide as described in Part A contained a primary or secondary alcohol, prolonged thermal heating in TFA/HOAc at 78° C. for 1 day not only effected ring closure but also converted the alcohol moiety to an acetate. The resulting 1-aryl pyrazine-2,3(1H,4H)-dione was converted to the desired 3-thio substituted-1-arylpyrazin-2-one employing Method 1. Following workup and purification as described in Method 1, the acetylated product was converted to the desired 3-thio substituted-1-arylpyrazin-2-one (19 mg, 0.041 mmol) bearing a free hydroxyl by dissolution in MeOH (1.0 mL) and H\n2\nO (0.1 mL) and stirring at ambient temperature for 1 h after addition of potassium carbonate (30 mg). The reaction was then diluted with CH\n2\nCl\n2\n/H\n2\nO prior to extraction with CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(2×). After drying the combined organic layers over MgSO\n4\n, concentration afforded the desired final product (16 mg, 93% yield).\n\n\n \nMethod 5\n\n\n \n \n \nFor weakly nucleophilic thiols more forcing conditions were required effect PyBOP mediated conversion of the 1-aryl pyrazine-2,3(1H,4H)-dione to a 3-thio substituted-1-arylpyrazin-2-ones. Accordingly, a DMF solution (0.4 mL) containing the 1-aryl pyrazine-2,3(1H,4H)-dione prepared in Part B (92 mg, 0.30 mmol), PyBOP (0.27 g, 0.53 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (0.16 mL, 0.9 mmol) was stirred for 3 h before addition of a DMF solution prepared by stirring 5-methoxybenzo[d]thiazole-2-thiol (296 mg, 1.502 mmol) with NaH (60.1 mg, 1.502 mmol, rinsed with hexane 2×) in DMF (0.2 mL) at ambient temperature for 10 min. After stirring at ambient temperature for 7 days, the reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc and washed sequentially with water (2×) and brine prior to drying over MgSO\n4\n. After evaporation of the solvent, CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(10 mL) was added to the 0.30 g of crude product. Filtration to remove any residual solids followed by evaporation of the filtrate afforded 0.10 g crude product. Final purification required flash chromatography on 12 g silica gel using gradient elution (0 to 100% EtOAc/CH\n2\nCl\n2\n) followed by preparatory HPLC (YMC S5 ODS 20×100 mm, 20 mL/min, 30 to 100% B in A over 10 min, .Solvent A=10% MeOH/H\n2\nO-0.1% TFA, Solvent B=90% MeOH/H\n2\nO-0.1% TFA) to afford pure desired product (6.3 mg, 4% yield).\n\n\n \nMethod 6\n\n\n \n \n \nGeneral Experimental Procedures for Preparation of 1-(4-(2-Hydroxy-2-methylpropoxy)-3-methylphenyl)-3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylthio)pyrazin-2(1H)-one\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPart A.
