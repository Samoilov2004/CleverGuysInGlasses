Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to heterocyclyl-substituted alkylamino phenyl derivatives, to processes for the preparation thereof, to medicaments comprising them as well as to their use for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of 5HT7 receptor mediated diseases or conditions.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by better understanding of the structure of proteins and other biomolecules associated with target diseases. One important class of proteins that has been the subject of extensive study is the family of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT) receptors. The 5-HT7 receptor discovered in 1993 belongs to this family and has attracted great interest as a valuable new drug target ( \nTerrón, J.A. Idrugs, 1998, vol. 1, no. 3, pages 302-310: \"The 5HT7 receptor: A target for novel therapeutic avenues?\n\").\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5-HT7 receptors have been cloned from rat, mouse, guinea pig and human cDNA and exhibit a high degree of interspecies homology (approx. 95%), but it is unique in that it has a low sequence homology with other 5-HT receptors (less than 40%). Its expression pattern, in particular structures of the central nervous system (CNS) (highest in hypothalamus in particular suprachiasmatic nuclei and thalamus) and other peripheral tissues (spleen, kidney, intestinal, heart and coronary arthery), implicates the 5-HT7 receptor in a variety of functions and pathologies. This idea is reinforced by the fact that several therapeutic agents, such as tricyclic antidepressants, typical and atypical antipsychotics and some 5-HT2 receptor antagonists, display moderate to high affinity for both recombinant and functional 5-HT7 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFunctionally, the 5-HT7 receptor has been implicated in regulation of circadian rhythms in mammals (\nLovenberg, T.W. et al. Neuron, 1993, 11:449-458 \"A novel adenylyl cyclase-activating serotonin receptor (5-HT7) implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms\n\"). It is known that disruption of circadian rhythms is related to a number of CNS disorders including depression, seasonal affective disorder, sleep disorders, shift worker syndrome and jet lag among others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDistribution and early pharmacological data also suggest that the 5-HT7 receptor is involved in the vasodilatation of blood vessels. This has been demonstrated in vivo (\nTerrón, J.A., Br J Pharmacol, 1997, 121:563-571 \"Role of 5-HT7 receptors in the long lasting hypotensive response induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine in the rat\n\"). Thus selective 5-HT7 receptor agonists have a potential as novel hypertensive agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 5-HT7 receptor has also been related with the pathophysiology of migraine through smooth muscle relaxation of cerebral vessels (\nSchoeffter, P. et al., 1996, Br J Pharmacol, 117:993-994\n ; \nTerrón, J.A., 2002, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 439:1-11 \"Is the 5-HT7 receptor involved in the pathogenesis and prophylactic treatment of migraine?\n\"). In a similar manner, involvement of 5-HT7 in intestinal and colon tissue smooth muscle relaxation makes this receptor a target for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (\nDe Ponti, F. et al., 2001, Drugs, 61:317-332 \"Irritable bowel syndrome. New agents targeting serotonin receptor subtypes\n \"). Recently, it has also been related to urinary incontinence (\nBritish J. of Pharmacology, Sept. 2003, 140(1) 53-60: \"Evidence for the involvement of central 5HT-7 receptors in the micurition reflex in anaeshetized female rats\n\").\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the potential therapeutic applications of agonists or antagonists of the 5HT7 receptor, a great effort has been directed to find selective ligands. Despite intense research efforts in this area, very few compounds with selective 5-HT7 antagonist activity have been reported (\nWesolowska, A., Polish J. Pharmacol., 2002, 54: 327-341, \"In the search for selective ligands of 5-HT5, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 serotonin receptors'\n), yet even fewer 5-HT7-agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome heterocyclyl-substituted-ethylaminophenyl derivatives showing activity towards 5HT7 receptors were described in our application \n \nEP1935886\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, there is still a need to find compounds having pharmacological activity towards the receptor 5-HT7, being both effective and selective, and having good \"drugability\" properties, i.e. good pharmaceutical properties related to administration, distribution, metabolism and excretion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe authors of the present invention hereby provide some novel heterocyclyl-substituted-alkylaminophenyl derivatives complying with the above mentioned characteristics.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA first object of the invention refers to compounds of general formula I:\n\n \n \n\nwherein\n\nX-Y-Z together form\n\n\n\n        -N-N=CR\n1\n- or =C-NR\n2\n-N= ;\n\n\n\nand wherein\n\nR\n1\n is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen or a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted aliphatic radical;\n\nR\n2\n is selected from the group consisting of a phenyl radical, optionally at least mono-substituted by F, Cl, Br, I, SH, OH or O-R with R being an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched and optionally at least mono- substituted by F, Cl, Br, I, SH or OH and which may be bonded by an alkylene group; an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, and optionally at least mono-substituted by F, Cl, Br, I, SH or OH; or O-R with R being an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, and optionally at least mono-substituted by F, Cl, Br, I, SH or OH\n\nn is 1, 2, 3 or 4;\n\nR\n3\n and R\n4\n are independently from each other selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen; a phenyl radical, optionally at least mono- substituted by F, Cl, Br, I, SH, OH or O-R with R being an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched and optionally at least mono-substituted by F, Cl, Br, I, SH or OH and which may be bonded by an alkylene group; or an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, and optionally at least mono-substituted by F, Cl, Br, I, SH or OH; or O-R with R being an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, and optionally at least mono-substituted by F, Cl, Br, I, SH or OH or\n\nR\n3\n and R\n4\n form an saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono- substituted 5- or 6-membered-heterocyclic ring, which may be condensed with an optionally at least mono-substituted mono- or polycyclic ring system;\n\nR\n5\n is selected from hydrogen, halogen, OH, SH, NH\n2\n, a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted aliphatic radical or O-R with R being a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted aliphatic radical;\n\nR\n6\n and R\n7\n each are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted aliphatic radical or\n\nR\n6\n and R\n7\n together with the bridging nitrogen atom form a saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted 5- or 6-membered-heterocyclic ring, which may be condensed with an optionally at least mono- substituted mono- or polycyclic ring system,\n\noptionally in form of one of its stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, its racemate or in form of a mixture of at least two of its stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, in any mixing ratio, or a salt, preferably a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, or a corresponding solvate, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of general formula I show a high affinity to the 5HT7 receptor as well as a high selectivity for this receptor in comparison to e.g. the 5HT6, the sigma 1, the sigma 2, and the 5HT1 receptor. In addition some of these compounds show an agonistic activity on this receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of the present invention a \"mono- or polycyclic ring-system\" means a mono- or polycyclic hydrocarbon ring-system that may be saturated, unsaturated or aromatic. If the ring system is polycyclic, each of its different rings may show a different degree of saturation, i.e. it may be saturated, unsaturated or aromatic. Optionally each of the rings of the mono- or polycyclic ring system may contain one or more heteroatoms as ring members, which may be identical or different and which can preferably be selected from the group consisting of N, O, S and P, more preferably be selected from the group consisting of N, O and S. Preferably the polycyclic ring-system may comprise two rings that are condensed.

Specifically, three different processes for preparing compounds of formula I are herein described, processes A, B and C.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPROCESS A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nProcess A corresponds to a process for preparing compounds of formula I in the particular case that X-Y-Z is -N-N=CR\n1\n, that is, a process for preparing compounds of general formula (Ia) comprising:\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \na) reacting a compound of general formula (II):\n\n \n \n\nwith a compound of general formula (III):\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn the Ullmann reaction between compound (II) and (III) M represents a halogen atom, preferably a bromide and R\n1\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n and n have the same meaning as in claim 1 or 2. The reaction is carried out in a suitable reaction medium and preferably in the presence of a copper catalyst, a suitable ligand and at least one base. This process can be performed by subjecting the reaction mixture to reflux by conventional heating for a period of time sufficient to achieve the title compound (Ia), or by microwave radiation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable reaction media are e.g. organic solvents, such as ethers, preferably diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofurane, dimethyl glycol ether, or alcohols, e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol, or hydrocarbons, preferably benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cyclohexane, petroleum ether, or halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, dichloroethylene, trichloroethylene, chlorobenzene or/and other solvents preferably ethyl acetate, triethylamine, pyridine, dimethulsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, acetonitrile, acetone or nitromethane are included. Mixtures based one or more of the above mentioned solvents and water may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, the bases that may be used in the process are generally organic or inorganic bases, preferably alkali metal hydroxides, e.g. sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or obtained from other metals such as barium hydroxide or different carbonates, preferably potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate or alkoxydes, e.g. sodium methoxide potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide or potassium tert-butoxide, or organic amines, preferably triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine or heterocycles, e.g. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0]undec-7-ene, pyridine, diamino pydine, dimethylaminopyridine, methylpiperidine or morpholine. Alkali metals such as sodium or its hydrides, e.g. sodium hydride, may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigand-free conditions are known for Ullmann coupling, but the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a suitable ligand such as mono- or bidentate ligands, such as phosphines, salicylamides, diamines, diols, amino alcohols, amino acids, phosphoramidites, oximephosphine, oxides, or phosphinidenes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of general formula (II) are either commercially available or can be produced according to methods known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \nPreparation of compounds of general formula (III) can be achieved by two consecutive reductive amination reactions of aldehydes of general formula (V) and (VI),\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n6\n and R\n7\n have the meaning of claim 1 or 2 and m is the total number of carbon atoms contained in R\n6\n or R\n7\n, with a compound of general formula (IV),\n\n \n \n\nwherein M has the meaning described above. The reductive amination is performed by reaction of a mixture comprising a compound of general formula (V) or (VI), and amino compound of general formula (IV) and a reducing agent in a suitable reaction medium, for a period of time sufficient to achieve the title compound (III). The reductive amination reaction can also be performed under microwave radiation preferably for 5 to 60 minutes, and at a temperature between 90 to 120ºC. The use of microwave irradiation limits the formation of undesirable secondary reaction products, compared to what is obtained in a conventional reductive amination procedure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis process can be performed as a direct reaction when the carbonyl compound of general formula (V) or (VI) and the amine compound of general formula (IV) are mixed with the reducing agent without prior formation of the intermediate imine or iminium salt.

The protocol assay was essentially the recommended protocol in the Technical Data Sheet by PerkinEmer Life and Analytical Sciences. The Mass membrane protein/well was typically 12 g and the Receptor/well was about 9-10 fmoles. The Flashplate were let equilibrate at room temperature for one hour before the addition of the components of the assay mixture. The binding buffer was: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA. The radioligand was [\n125\nI]LSD at a final concentration of 0.82 nM. Nonspecific binding was determined with 50 M of Clozapine. The assay volume was 25 l. TopSeal-A were applied onto Flashplate microplates and they were incubated at room temperature for 240 minutes in darkness. The radioactivity were quantified by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry (Wallac 1450 Microbeta Trilux) with a count delay of 4 minutes prior to counting and a counting time of 30 seconds per well. Competition binding data were analyzed by using the LIGAND program ( \nMunson and Rodbard, LIGAND: A versatile, computerized approach for characterization of ligandbinding systems. Anal. Biochem. 107: 220-239, 1980\n ) and assays were performed in triplicate determinations for each point.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults of the radioligand assay for representative compounds/examples are given in the table below:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCOMPOUND/ EXAMPLE\n \n \n \n5-HT\n7\n \n \n \nKi\n \n \n(nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n2\n \n597.1\n \n \n \n3\n \n599±37.4\n \n \n \n4\n \n576.9±81.6\n \n \n \n8\n \n261.3±102.3\n \n \n \n9\n \n112.7±2.6\n \n \n \n10\n \n102±16.4\n \n \n \n11\n \n23.5±5.2\n \n \n \n19\n \n447.3±64.8\n \n \n \n22\n \n391.4\n \n \n \n23\n \n611.4\n \n \n \n25\n \n419.6\n \n \n \n28\n \n81.9\n \n \n \n29\n \n102.1\n \n \n \n30\n \n299.9\n \n \n \n31\n \n83.1\n \n \n \n32\n \n149.7\n \n \n \n33\n \n527.3\n \n \n \n34\n \n146.1\n \n \n \n35\n \n320.3\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nFORMULATION EXAMPLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of a tablet formulation:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompound according to example 28: 5 mg,\n\n \n \n \nLactose: 60 mg\n \nCrystalline cellulose: 25 mg\n \nPovidone K 90: 5 mg\n \nPregelanitized starch: 3 mg\n \nColloidal silica dioxide: 1 mg\n \nMagnesium stearate: 1 mg\n \nTotal weight per tablet: 100 mg\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe above mentioned ingredients were mixed and compressed into a tablet by conventional methods known to those skilled in the art."
