Description\n\n\n\n\n CO-CRYSTALS AND SALTS OF CCR3-INHIBITORS \n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nThis invention relates to co-crystals and salts of CCR3 inhibitors, pharmaceutical compositions containing one of those, and methods of using the same as agents for treatment and/or prevention of a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious, and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, including asthma and allergic diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infection by pathogenic microbes \n\n\n(including viruses), autoimmune pathologies such as the rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis as well as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. \n\n\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION \n\n\nChemokines are chemotactic cytokines, of molecular weight 6-15 kDa, that are released by a wide variety of cells to attract and activate, among other cell types, macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils (reviewed in Luster, New Eng. J Med., 338, 436-445 (1998); Rollins, Blood, 90, 909-928 (1997); Lloyd, Curr Opin Pharmacol., 3, 443-448 (2003); Murray, Current Drug Targets., 7, 579-588 (2006); Smit, Eur J Pharmacol., 533,277-88 (2006) \n\n\nThere are two major classes of chemokines, CXC and CC, depending on whether the first two cysteines in the amino acid sequence are separated by a single amino acid (CXC) or are adjacent (CC). The CXC chemokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL- 8), neutrophil-activating protein-2 (NAP2) and melanoma growth stimulatory activity protein (MGSA) are chemotactic primarily for neutrophils and T \n\n\nlymphocytes, whereas the CC chemokines, such as RANTES, MIP-la, MIP-1 , the monocyte chemotactic proteins (MCP-1 , MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, and MCP-5) and the eotaxins (-1 ,-2, and-3) are chemotactic for, among other cell types, \n\n\nmacrophages, T lymphocytes, eosinophils, mast cells, dendritic cells, and basophils. Also in existence are the chemokines lymphotactin-1 , lymphotactin-2 \n\n (both C chemokines), and fractalkine (a CXXXC chemokine) that do not fall into either of the major chemokine subfamilies. \n\n\nThe chemokines bind to specific cell-surface receptors belonging to the family of G-protein-coupled seventransmembrane-domain proteins (reviewed in Horuk, Trends Pharm. Sci., 15, 159-165 (1994); Murphy, Pharmacol Rev., 54 (2):227-229 (2002); Allen, Annu. Rev. Immunol., 25, 787-820 (2007)) which are termed \n\n\n\"chemokine receptors.\" On binding their cognate ligands, chemokine receptors transduce an intracellular signal through the associated trimeric G proteins, resulting in, among other responses, a rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration, activation of G-proteins, changes in cell shape, increased \n\n\nexpression of cellular adhesion molecules, degranulation, promotion of cell migration, survival and proliferation. There are at least eleven human chemokine receptors that bind or respond to CC chemokines with the following characteristic patterns: CCR-1 (or\"CKR-1 \"or\"CC-CKR-1 \") [MIP-la, MCP-3, MCP-4, RANTES] (Ben-Barruch, et al., Cell, 72, 415-425 (1993), Luster, New Eng. J. Med., 338, 436- 445 (1998)); CCR-2A and CCR-2B (or \"CKR-2A7\"CKR-2B\"or\"CC-CKR-2A7\"CC- CKR-2B\") [MCP-1 , MCP2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-5] (Charo et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91 , 2752-2756 (1994), Luster, New Eng. J. Med., 338, 436-445 (1998)); CCR3 (or\"CKR-3\"or\"CC-CKR-3\") [eotaxin-1 , eotaxin-2, RANTES, MCP-3, MCP-4] (Combadiere, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270, 16491 -16494 (1995), Luster, New Eng. J. Med., 338, 436-445 (1998)); CCR-4 (or\"CKR-4\" or\"CC-CKR-4\") [TARC, MIP-la, RANTES, MCP-1 ] (Power et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270, 19495-19500 (1995), Luster, New Eng. J. Med., 338, 436-445 (1998)); CCR-5 (or\"CKR-5\"OR\"CCCKR-5\") [MIP- la, RANTES, MIP-lp] (Sanson, et al., Biochemistry, 35, 3362-3367 (1996)); CCR-6 (or\"CKR-6\"or \"CC-CKR-6\") [LARC] (Baba et al., J. Biol. Chem., 272, 14893-14898 (1997)); CCR-7 (or\"CKR-7\"or\"CC-CKR-7\") [ELC] (Yoshie et al., J. Leukoc. Biol. 62, 634-644 (1997)); CCR-8 (or\"CKR-8\"or\"CC-CKR-8\") [1 -309, TARC, MIP-1 p] (Napolitano et al., J. Immunol., 157, 2759-2763 (1996), Bernardini et al., Eur. J. Immunol., 28, 582-588 (1998)); CCR-10 (or\"CKR-10\"or\"CC-CKR-10\") [MCP-1 , MCP-3] (Bonini et al, DNA and Cell Biol., 16, 1249-1256 (1997)) ; and CCR31 (or \n\n \"CKR-1 1 \" or \"CC-CKR-1 1 \") [MCP-1 , MCP-2, MCP-4]( Schweickart et al., J Biol Chem, 275 9550-9556 (2000)). \n\n\nIn addition to the mammalian chemokine receptors, the Decoy receptors CCX- CKR, D6 and DARC/Duffy as well proteins expressed by mammalian \n\n\ncytomegaloviruses, herpes viruses and poxviruses, exhibit binding properties of chemokine receptors (reviewed by Wells and Schwartz, Curr. Opin. Biotech., 8, 741 -748 (1997); Comerford, Bioessays., 29(3):237-47 (2007)). Human CC chemokines, such as RANTES and MCP-3, can cause rapid mobilization of calcium via these virally encoded receptors. Receptor expression may be permissive for infection by allowing for the subversion of normal immune system surveillance and response to infection. Additionally, human chemokine receptors, such as CXCR-4, CCR2, CCR3, CCR5 and CCR8, can act as co receptors for the infection of mammalian cells by microbes as with, for example, the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV). \n\n\nChemokine receptors have been implicated as being important mediators of inflammatory, infectious, and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, including asthma and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis, Grave's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and atherosclerosis. For example, the chemokine receptor CCR3 is expressed among others on eosinophils, basophils, TH2 cells, alveolar macrophages, mast cells, epithelial cells, microglia cells, astrocytes and fibroblasts. CCR3 plays a pivotal role in attracting eosinophils to sites of allergic inflammation and in subsequently activating these cells. The chemokine ligands for CCR3 induce a rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration, increased GTP exchange of G-proteins, increased ERK phosphorylation, enhanced receptor internalization, eosinophil shape change, increased expression of cellular adhesion molecules, cellular degranulation, and the promotion of migration. Accordingly, agents that inhibit chemokine receptors would be useful in such disorders and diseases. In addition, agents that inhibit chemokine receptors would also be useful in infectious diseases \n\n such as by blocking infection of CCR3 expressing cells by HIV or in preventing the manipulation of immune cellular responses by viruses such as cytomegaloviruses. \n\n\nTherefore, CCR3 is an important target and antagonism of CCR3 is likely to be effective in the treatment of inflammatory, eosinophilic, immunoregulatory and infectious disorders and diseases (Wegmann, Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol., \n\n\n36(1 ):61 -67 (2007); Fryer J Clin Invest., 1 16(1 ):228-236 (2006); De Lucca, Curr Opin Drug Discov Devel., 9(4):516-524 (2006) \n\n\nSo, the problem underlying the present invention was the provision of CCR3 antagonists, preferred with reduced side effects which are not only potent CCR3- inhibitors, but also are useful for manufacturing a medicament for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases wherein the activity of a CCR3-receptor is involved. \n\n\nIt has been found surprisingly that the substituted piperidines of formula 1 are highly suitable as CCR3 antagonists, having less side effects, e.g. inhibition of norepinephrine (NET), dopamine (DAT) or serotonin reuptake transporters (5- HTT) as described by Watson PS, Bioorg Med Chem Lett., 16(21 ):5695-5699 (2006), or inhibition of 5HT2A, 5HT2C or Dopamine D2 receptors as described by De Lucca, J Med Chem., 48(6):2194-221 1 (2005), or inhibition of the hERG channel as described by De Lucca, Curr Opin Drug Discov Devel., 9(4):516-524 (2006), or inhibition of the alphal B adrenergic receptor. \n\n\nNevertheless such compounds are bases and thus could be problematic for the manufacturing of a medicament since their physical behaviour can cause problems finding a suitable pharmaceutical form. This could be structural problems like stability, light sensitiveness or deliquescence, but also physical problem e.g. if a compound is not soluble or not suitable for common manufacturing processes like milling. \n\n\nNow, it has been surprisingly found that the claimed co-crystals or salts of the compounds of formula 1 are fulfilling enough criteria for a pharmaceutical \n\n development to manufacture a medicament as above described e.g. a sufficient stability, a controllable deliquescence, a solubility high enough to be useful as a medicament, a solid state useful for standard manufacturing processes or a sufficiently defined crystal form. \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nSubject matter of the instant invention is co-crystals of compounds of formula 1 \n\n\n \n\n wherein \n\n\n R\n1\n is C-i-6-alkyl, d-6-haloalkyl, O-C-i-6-haloalkyl, halogene;

Kelley, J.A. Linn, J.W.T. Selway, J. Med. Chem. 1989, 32(8), 1757- 1763], 4-Piperidone (22 g), K\n2\nC0\n3\n (26 g) in acetonitrile (300 ml) is heated at 50°C for 14h. The suspension is filtered and the filtrate concentrated in vacuum. The residue is purified by flash chromatography (cyclohexane/ EtOAc 1 : 1 ) to yield intermediate 11 (17.4 g). \n\n\nStep 2: Intermediate 11 (10 g) and D-H-Glu O'BuJ-OMe (10.8 g) are dissolved in DMF (200 ml) and HOAc (5 ml). Then molecular sieves (1 .0 g, 4A, powder) are added and the suspension stirred overnight. Sodium triacetoxyborohydride (37.5 g) is added and the suspension stirred until complete conversion of the \n\n\nintermediate formed imine is observed. A basic pH is achieved by slow addition of aqueous NaHC0\n3\n solution before additional water and dichloromethane (500 mL) is added. The organic phase is separated and the water phase extracted with dichloromethane (500 ml). The organic phase is washed with brine, dried and concentrated in vacuum to yield intermediate I2 (19.5 g). \n\n\nStep 3: Intermediate I2 (19.5 g, 74% purity) is dissolved in dichloromethane (40 ml) and trifluoroacetic acid (20 ml).

Then, a solution of NaBH(OAc)\n3\n (36.8 g) in DMF (40 ml) is added at below 15°C. The mixture is warmed to room temperature and stirred for 30 minutes. Now a compound of formula I3'-Me \n\n M \n\n\n \n\n can be isolated or AcOH (0.3 ml) is added without isolation of a intermidiate product and the mixture is heated to 105°C for 1 .5 h. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and cold water (188 ml) is added. The pH is adjusted to pH = 8 by addition of NaOH (50% solution in water). Finally, the mixture is extracted with fe/f-butylmethylether (3 x 75 ml), the combined organic phases are washed with brine (1 x 50 ml), dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n and filtered.

The present invention is directed to the use of these compounds in the preparation and execution of screening assays for compounds that modulate the activity of chemokine receptors. Furthermore, the compounds of this invention are useful in establishing or determining the binding site of other compounds to chemokine receptors, e.g., by competitive inhibition or as a reference in an assay to compare its known activity to a compound with an unknown activity. When developing new assays or protocols, compounds according to the present invention could be used to test their effectiveness. \n\n\nSpecifically, such compounds may be provided in a commercial kit, for example, for use in pharmaceutical research involving the aforementioned diseases. The compounds of the instant invention are also useful for the evaluation of putative specific modulators of the chemokine receptors. In addition, one could utilize compounds of this invention to examine the specificity of G protein coupled receptors that are not thought to be chemokine receptors, either by serving as examples of compounds which do not bind or as structural variants of compounds active on these receptors which may help define specific sites of interaction. \n\n\nThe CCR3 receptor binding test is based on a K562 cell line (leukemia myelogenic blast cells) transfected with the human chemokine receptor CCR3 (hCCR3-C1 cells). The cell membranes were prepared by disrupting the hCCR3-C1 cells by nitrogen decomposition. The preparation was centrifuged at 400 g 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant was transferred into fresh tubes followed by a second \n\n\ncentrifugation at 48000 g, 4°C for 1 h. The membranes were re-suspended in the SPA incubation buffer (25mM HEPES, 25mM MgCI\n2\n 6xH\n2\n0, 1 mM CaCI\n2\n 2xH\n2\n0) without bovine serum albumin and homogenized by passing through a single use needle (Terumo, 23Gx1 \"). The membranes were stored in aliquots at -80°C. \n\n The CCR3 receptor binding assay was performed in a Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) design with the radioligand recombinant human \n125\nlodine-eotaxin-1 . Cell membranes of hCCR3 C1 cells were again homogenized by passing through a single use needle (Terumo, 23Gx1 \") and diluted in SPA incubation buffer in suitable concentrations (0.5 -10 g protein/well) in 96 well microtiter plates (1450- 514, Perkin Elmer). The SPA assay was set up in the SPA incubation buffer with a final volume of 200μΙ and final concentration of 25mM HEPES, 25mM MgCI\n2\n 6xH\n2\n0, 1 mM CaCI\n2\n 2xH\n2\n0 and 0, 1 % bovine serum albumin . The SPA assay mixture contained 60 μΙ of the membrane suspension, 80 μΙ of Wheat Germ Agglutinin coated PVT beads (organic scintillator, GE Healthcare, RPNQ-0001 ) 0,2 mg/well) , 40 μΙ of recombinant human \n125\nJodine-eotaxin-1 (Biotrend), diluted in SPA buffer to a final concentration of 30.000 dpm per well, and 20 μΙ of the test compound (dissolved in DMSO dilutions). The SPA assay mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Bound radioactivity was determined with a scintillation counter (Micro Beta \"Trilux\", Wallac). Included were controls for total binding (no displacer added, Bo) and non-specific binding (NSB) by adding unlabelled recombinant human Eotaxin-1 (Biotrend, Cat #300-21 ) or a reference compound. \n\n\nDetermination of the affinity of a test compound was calculated by subtraction of the non-specific binding (NSB) from the total binding (Bo) or the binding in the presence of the test compound (B) at a given compound concentration. The NSB value was set to 100% inhibition. The Bo-NSB value was set to 0% inhibition. \n\n\nThe dissociation constant K, was calculated by iterative fitting of experimental data obtained at several compound concentrations over a dose range from 0.1 to Ι ΟΟΟΟηΜ using the law of mass action based program \"easy sys\" (Schittkowski, Num Math 68, 129-142 (1994)). \n\n\nThe utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as inhibitors of chemokine receptor activity may be demonstrated by methodology known in the art, such as the assays for CCR3 ligand binding, as disclosed by Ponath et al., J. \n\n Exp. Med., 183,2437-2448 (1996) and Uguccioni et al., J. Clin. Invest., \n\n\n100, 1 1371 143 (1997). Cell lines for expressing the receptor of interest include those naturally expressing the chemokine receptor, such as EOL-3 or THP-1 , those induced to express the chemokine receptor by the addition of chemical or protein agents, such as HL-60 or AML14.3D10 cells treated with, for example, butyric acid with interleukin-5 present, or a cell engineered to express a recombinant chemokine receptor, such as L1.2, K562, CHO or HEK-293 cells. Finally, blood or tissue cells, for example human peripheral blood eosinophils, isolated using methods as described by Hansel et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 145, 105-1 10 (1991 ), can be utilized in such assays. In particular, the compounds of the present invention have activity in binding to the CCR3 receptor in the aforementioned assays and inhibit the activation of CCR3 by CCR3 ligands, including eotaxin-1 , eotaxin-2, eotaxin-3, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4 or RANTES. \n\n\nAs used herein, \"activity\" is intended to mean a compound demonstrating an inhibition of 50% at 1 μΜ or higher in inhibition when measured in the \n\n\naforementioned assays. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds as inhibitor of CCR3 receptor activity. \n\n\nKi values are (human Eotaxin-1 at human CCR3-Rezeptor): \n\n\n# hCCR3 Ki (nM) # hCCR3 Ki (nM) \n\n\n1 23,4 8 8,5\n\n\n2 69,6 9 0,9\n\n\n3 46,5 10 6,0\n\n\n4 67,5 1 1 3,2\n\n\n5 196,6 12 4,7\n\n\n6 72,0 13 19, 1\n\n\n7 10,4 14 1401 ,6 \n\n # hCCR3 Ki (nM) # hCCR3 Ki (nM) \n\n\n15 3,5 26 231 ,6 \n\n\n 16 6,8 27 413,8 \n\n\n 17 4,3 28 17,8 \n\n\n 18 4,6 29 4, 1 \n\n\n 19 4,0 30 70,3 \n\n\n 20 121 ,5 31 87,2 \n\n\n 21 5,2 32 2,3 \n\n\n 22 2,3 33 7,9 \n\n\n 23 4,2 34 7,9 \n\n\n 24 5,8 35 61 ,3 \n\n\n 25 8,3 36 1 ,7 \n\n\nINDICATIONS \n\n\nThe co-crystals and salts of the compounds of formula 1 as described above are useful for manufacturing a medicament for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases wherein the activity of a CCR3-receptor is involved. \n\n\nPreferred is the manufacturing of a medicament for the prevention and/or treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious, and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases of the respiratory or gastrointestinal complaints, inflammatory diseases of the joints and allergic diseases of the nasopharynx, eyes, and skin, including asthma and allergic diseases, eosinophilic diseases, infection by pathogenic microbes (which, by definition, includes viruses), as well as autoimmune pathologies such as the rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis, as well as diseases associated with abnormal enhanced neovascularization such as \n\n age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema Age-related macular degeneration is a leading cause of blindness world wide. Most blindness in AMD results from invasion of the retina by choroidal neovascularization. CCR3 is specifically expressed in choroidal neovascular endothelial cells of AMD patients. In an often used mouse animal model for AMD laser injury-induced choroidal neovascularization was dimished by genetic depletion of CCR3 or CCR3 ligands as well as by treatment of the mice with an anti-CCR3 antibody or an CCR3 antagonist (Takeda et al, Nature 2009, \n\n\n460(7252):225-30) \n\n\nMost preferred is the manufacturing of a medicament for the prevention and/or treatment of e.g. inflammatory or allergic diseases and conditions, including respiratory allergic diseases such as asthma, perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, hypersensitivity lung diseases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic cellulitis (e. g., Well's syndrome), eosinophilic \n\n\npneumonias (e. g., Loeffler's syndrome, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia), eosinophilic fasciitis (e. g., Shulman's syndrome), delayed-type hypersensitivity, interstitial lung diseases (ILD) (e. g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or ILD \n\n\nassociated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, polymyositis or \n\n\ndermatomyositis); non-allergic asthma; Exercise induced bronchoconstriction; systemic anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity responses, drug allergies (e. g., to penicillin, cephalosporins), eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome due to the ingestion of contaminated tryptophan, insect sting allergies; autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus \n\n\nerythematosus, myasthenia gravis, immune thrombocytopenia (adult ITP, neonatal thrombocytopenia, paediatric ITP), immune haemolytic anaemia (auto-immune and drug induced), Evans syndrome (platelet and red cell immune cytopaenias), Rh disease of the newborn, Goodpasture's syndrome (anti-GBM disease), Celiac, Auto-immune cardio-myopathy juvenile onset diabetes; glomerulonephritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, Behcet's disease; graft rejection (e. g., in transplantation), including allograft rejection or graftversus-host disease; inflammatory bowel \n\n diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; spondyloarthropathies; scleroderma; psoriasis (including Tcell mediated psoriasis) and inflammatory dermatoses such as an dermatitis, eczema, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, urticaria; vasculitis (e. g., necrotizing, cutaneous, and hypersensitivity vasculitis); erythema nodosum; eosinophilic myositis, eosinophilic fasciitis; cancers with leukocyte infiltration of the skin or organs; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. \n\n\nMETHOD OF TREATMENT \n\n\nAccordingly, the present invention is directed to co-crystals and salts of \n\n\ncompounds of formula 1 as discribed above which are useful in the prevention and/or treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious, and \n\n\nimmunoregulatory disorders and diseases, including asthma and allergic diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infection by pathogenic microbes (which, by definition, includes viruses), autoimmune pathologies such as the rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis as well as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. \n\n\nFor example a co-crystal or salt of an instant compound which inhibits one or more functions of a mammalian chemokine receptor (e. g., a human chemokine receptor) may be administered to inhibit (i. e., reduce or prevent) inflammation, infectious diseases or abnormal enhanced neovascularization. As a result, one or more inflammatory process, such as leukocyte emigration, adhesion, chemotaxis, exocytosis (e. g., of enzymes, growth factors, histamine) or inflammatory mediator release, survival or proliferation of CCR3 expressing cells is inhibited. For example, eosinophilic infiltration to inflammatory sites (e. g., in asthma or allergic rhinitis) can be inhibited according to the present method. In particular, the co- crystal or salt of the following examples has activity in blocking the activation and migration of cells expressing the CCR3 receptor using the appropriate chemokines \n\n in the aforementioned assays. In another instance, endothelial proliferation and neovascularization may be inhibited (i. e., reduced or prevented). As a result abnormal enhanced neovascularization, i.e. of the retina, is inhibited. \n\n\nIn addition to primates, such as humans, a variety of other mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention. For instance, mammals, including but not limited to, cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rats or other bovine, ovine, equine, canine, feline, rodent or murine species can be treated. However, the method can also be practiced in other species, such as avian species. The subject treated in the methods above is a mammal, male or female, in whom inhibition of chemokine receptor activity is desired. \n\n\nDiseases or conditions of human or other species which can be treated with inhibitors of chemokine receptor function, include, but are not limited to: \n\n\ninflammatory or allergic diseases and conditions, including respiratory allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, hypersensitivity lung diseases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic cellulitis (e. g., Well's syndrome), eosinophilic pneumonias (e. g., Loeffler's syndrome, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia), eosinophilic fasciitis (e. g., Shulman's syndrome), delayed-type hypersensitivity, interstitial lung diseases (ILD) (e. g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or ILD associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, polymyositis or dermatomyositis); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (including rhinovirus- induced exacerbations); systemic anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity responses, drug allergies (e. g., to penicillin, cephalosporins), eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome due to the ingestion of contaminated tryptophan, insect sting allergies; autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, juvenile onset diabetes; \n\n\nglomerulonephritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, Behcet's disease; graft rejection (e. g., in transplantation), including allograft rejection or graftversus-host disease; \n\n\ninflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; \n\n\nspondyloarthropathies; scleroderma; psoriasis (including Tcell mediated psoriasis) \n\n and inflammatory dermatoses such as an dermatitis, eczema, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, urticaria; vasculitis (e. g., necrotizing, cutaneous, and hypersensitivity vasculitis); eosinophilic myositis, eosinophilic fasciitis; cancers with leukocyte infiltration of the skin or organs. Other diseases or conditions in which undesirable inflammatory responses are to be inhibited can be treated, including, but not limited to, reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, certain hematologic malignancies, cytokine-induced toxicity (e. g., septic shock, endotoxic shock), polymyositis, dermatomyositis. Infectious diseases or conditions of human or other species which can be treated with inhibitors of chemokine receptor function, include, but are not limited to, HIV. \n\n\nAlso diseases associated with abnormal enhanced neovascularization such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema can be treated. \n\n\nIn another aspect, the instant invention may be used to evaluate the putative specific agonists or antagonists of a G protein coupled receptor. The present invention is directed to the use of these compounds in the preparation and execution of screening assays for compounds that modulate the activity of chemokine receptors. Furthermore, the compounds of this invention are useful in establishing or determining the binding site of other compounds to chemokine receptors, e. g., by competitive inhibition or as a reference in an assay to compare its known activity to a compound with an unknown activity. When developing new assays or protocols, compounds according to the present invention could be used to test their effectiveness. \n\n\nSpecifically, such compounds may be provided in a commercial kit, for example, for use in pharmaceutical research involving the aforementioned diseases. The compounds of the instant invention are also useful for the evaluation of putative specific modulators of the chemokine receptors. In addition, one could utilize compounds of this invention to examine the specificity of G protein coupled receptors that are not thought to be chemokine receptors, either by serving as \n\n examples of compounds which do not bind or as structural variants of compounds active on these receptors which may help define specific sites of interaction. \n\n\nCOMBINATIONS \n\n\nThe co-crystals and salts of compounds of formula 1 as described above may be used on their own or combined with other active substances of formula 1 \n\n\naccording to the invention.

Inhalable \n\n\npreparations include inhalable powders, propellant-containing metered-dose aerosols or propellant-free inhalable solutions. Within the scope of the present invention, the term propellant-free inhalable solutions also include concentrates or sterile inhalable solutions ready for use. The formulations which may be used \n\n within the scope of the present invention are described in more detail in the next part of the specification. \n\n\nThe inhalable powders which may be used according to the invention may contain a co-crystal or salt of 1 either on its own or in admixture with suitable \n\n\nphysiologically acceptable excipients. \n\n\nIf the active substances 1 are present in admixture with physiologically acceptable excipients, the following physiologically acceptable excipients may be used to prepare these inhalable powders according to the invention: monosaccharides (e.g. glucose or arabinose), disaccharides (e.g. lactose, saccharose, maltose), oligo- and polysaccharides (e.g. dextrans), polyalcohols (e.g. sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol), salts (e.g. sodium chloride, calcium carbonate) or mixtures of these excipients. Preferably, mono- or disaccharides are used, while the use of lactose or glucose is preferred, particularly, but not exclusively, in the form of their hydrates. For the purposes of the invention, lactose is the particularly preferred excipient, while lactose monohydrate is most particularly preferred. \n\n\nWithin the scope of the inhalable powders according to the invention the excipients have a maximum average particle size of up to 250 pm, preferably between 10 and 150 pm, most preferably between 15 and 80 pm. It may sometimes seem appropriate to add finer excipient fractions with an average particle size of 1 to 9 pm to the excipient mentioned above. These finer excipients are also selected from the group of possible excipients listed hereinbefore. Finally, in order to prepare the inhalable powders according to the invention, micronized active substance 1 , preferably with an average particle size of 0.5 to 10 μηι, more preferably from 1 to 5 μηι, is added to the excipient mixture. Processes for producing the inhalable powders according to the invention by grinding and micronising and finally mixing the ingredients together are known from the prior art. \n\n The inhalable powders according to the invention may be administered using inhalers known from the prior art. \n\n\nThe inhalation aerosols containing propellant gas according to the invention may contain a co-crystal or and salt of 1 dissolved in the propellant gas or in dispersed form. The co-crystals or and salts of 1 may be contained in separate formulations or in a common formulation, in which the co-crystals or salts of 1 are either both dissolved, both dispersed or in each case only one component is dissolved and the other is dispersed. The propellant gases which may be used to prepare the inhalation aerosols are known from the prior art. Suitable propellant gases are selected from among hydrocarbons such as n-propane, n-butane or isobutane and halohydrocarbons such as fluorinated derivatives of methane, ethane, propane, butane, cyclopropane or cyclobutane. The abovementioned propellant gases may be used on their own or mixed together. Particularly preferred propellant gases are halogenated alkane derivatives selected from TG134a and TG227 and mixtures thereof. \n\n\nThe propellant-driven inhalation aerosols may also contain other ingredients such as co-solvents, stabilisers, surfactants, antioxidants, lubricants and pH adjusters. All these ingredients are known in the art. \n\n\nThe propellant-driven inhalation aerosols according to the invention mentioned above may be administered using inhalers known in the art (MDIs = metered dose inhalers). \n\n\nMoreover, the active substances 1 according to the invention may be administered in the form of propellant-free inhalable solutions and suspensions. The solvent used may be an aqueous or alcoholic, preferably an ethanolic solution. The solvent may be water on its own or a mixture of water and ethanol. The relative proportion of ethanol compared with water is not limited but the maximum is preferably up to 70 percent by volume, more particularly up to 60 percent by volume and most preferably up to 30 percent by volume. The remainder of the \n\n volume is made up of water. The solutions or suspensions containing a co-crystal or salt of 1 are adjusted to a pH of 2 to 7, preferably 2 to 5, using suitable acids. The pH may be adjusted using acids selected from inorganic or organic acids.

Examples of particularly suitable organic acids include ascorbic acid, citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, acetic acid, formic acid and/or propionic acid etc. Preferred inorganic acids are hydrochloric and sulphuric acids. It is also possible to use the acids which have already formed an acid addition salt with one of the active substances. Of the organic acids, ascorbic acid, fumaric acid and citric acid are preferred. If desired, mixtures of the above acids may be used, particularly in the case of acids which have other properties in addition to their acidifying qualities, e.g. as flavourings, antioxidants or complexing agents, such as citric acid or ascorbic acid, for example. According to the invention, it is particularly preferred to use hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH. \n\n\nIf desired, the addition of editic acid (EDTA) or one of the known salts thereof, sodium edetate, as stabiliser or complexing agent may be omitted in these formulations. Other embodiments may contain this compound or these \n\n\ncompounds. In a preferred embodiment the content based on sodium edetate is less than 100 mg/100ml, preferably less than 50mg/100ml, more preferably less than 20mg/100ml. Generally, inhalable solutions in which the content of sodium edetate is from 0 to 10mg/100ml are preferred. Co-solvents and/or other excipients may be added to the propellant-free inhalable solutions. Preferred co- solvents are those which contain hydroxyl groups or other polar groups, e.g. \n\n\nalcohols - particularly isopropyl alcohol, glycols - particularly propyleneglycol, polyethyleneglycol, polypropyleneglycol, glycolether, glycerol, polyoxyethylene alcohols and polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters. The terms excipients and additives in this context denote any pharmacologically acceptable substance which is not an active substance but which can be formulated with the active substance or substances in the physiologically suitable solvent in order to improve the \n\n\nqualitative properties of the active substance formulation. Preferably, these \n\n substances have no pharmacological effect or, in connection with the desired therapy, no appreciable or at least no undesirable pharmacological effect. The excipients and additives include, for example, surfactants such as soya lecithin, oleic acid, sorbitan esters, such as polysorbates, polyvinylpyrrolidone, other stabilisers, complexing agents, antioxidants and/or preservatives which guarantee or prolong the shelf life of the finished pharmaceutical formulation, flavourings, vitamins and/or other additives known in the art. The additives also include pharmacologically acceptable salts such as sodium chloride as isotonic agents. \n\n\nThe preferred excipients include antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, for example, provided that it has not already been used to adjust the pH, vitamin A, vitamin E, tocopherols and similar vitamins and provitamins occurring in the human body. \n\n\nPreservatives may be used to protect the formulation from contamination with pathogens. Suitable preservatives are those which are known in the art, particularly cetyl pyridinium chloride, benzalkonium chloride or benzoic acid or benzoates such as sodium benzoate in the concentration known from the prior art. The preservatives mentioned above are preferably present in concentrations of up to 50 mg/100 ml, more preferably between 5 and 20 mg/100 ml. \n\n\nPreferred formulations contain, in addition to the solvent water and the co-crystal or salt of 1 , only benzalkonium chloride and sodium edetate. In another preferred embodiment, no sodium edetate is present. \n\n\nThe dosage of the compounds according to the invention is naturally highly dependent on the method of administration and the complaint which is being treated. When administered by inhalation the compounds of formula 1 are characterised by a high potency even at doses in the g range. The co-crystals or salts of compounds of formula 1 may also be used effectively above the g range. The dosage may then be in the gram range, for example. \n\n In another aspect the present invention relates to the above-mentioned \n\n\npharmaceutical formulations as such which are characterised in that they contain a co-crystal or salt of a compound of formula 1 , particularly the above-mentioned pharmaceutical formulations which can be administered by inhalation. \n\n\nThe following examples of formulations illustrate the present invention without restricting its scope: \n\n\nEXAMPLES OF PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS \n\n\nA) Tablets per tablet \n\n\n active substance 1 100 mg \n\n\n lactose 140 mg \n\n\n maize starch 240 mg \n\n\n polyvinylpyrrolidone 15 mg \n\n\n magnesium stearate 5 mg \n\n\n500 mg \n\n\nThe finely ground active substance, lactose and some of the maize starch are mixed together.
