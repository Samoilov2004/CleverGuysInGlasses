CETP is involved in the metabolism of any lipoprotein in living organisms, and has a major role in the reverse cholesterol transfer system. Namely, CETP has drawn attention as a mechanism for preventing accumulation of cholesterol in peripheral cells and preventing arteriosclerosis. In fact, with regard to HDL having an important role in this reverse cholesterol transfer system, a number of epidemiological researches have shown that a decrease in CE (cholesteryl ester) of HDL in blood is one of the risk factors of coronary artery diseases. It has been also clarified that the CETP activity varies depending on the animal species, wherein arteriosclerosis due to cholesterol-loading is hardly induced in animals with lower activity, and in reverse, easily induced in animals with higher activity, and that hyper-HDL-emia and hypo-LDL (low density lipoprotein)-emia are induced in the case of CETP deficiency, thus rendering the development of arteriosclerosis difficult, which in turn led to the recognition of the significance of blood HDL, as well as significance of CETP that mediates transfer of CE in HDL into blood LDL. While many attempts have been made in recent years to develop a drug that inhibits such activity of CETP, a compound having a satisfactory activity has not been developed yet.\n\n\n \nDetailed Description of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nFor purposes of interpreting this specification, the following definitions will apply and whenever appropriate, terms used in the singular will also include the plural and vice versa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"alkyl\" refers to a fully saturated branched or unbranched hydrocarbon moiety.

The term is used to designate a racemic mixture where appropriate. \"Diastereoisomers\" are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms, but which are not mirror-images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn- Ingold- Prelog R-S system. When a compound is a pure enantiomer the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon may be specified by either \nR\n or \nS\n. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated (+) or (-) depending on the direction (dextro- or levorotatory) which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (\nR\n)- or (\nS\n)-. The present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers, including racemic mixtures, optically pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active (\nR\n)- and (\nS\n)- isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. If the compound contains a double bond, the substituent may be E or Z configuration. If the compound contains a disubstituted cycloalkyl, the cycloalkyl substituent may have a cis- or trans-configuration. All tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salts\" refers to salts that retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the compounds of this invention and, which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. Non-limiting examples of the salts include non-toxic, inorganic and organic base or acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. In many cases, the compounds of the present invention are capable of forming acid and/or base salts by virtue of the presence of amino and/or carboxyl groups or groups similar thereto. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids and organic acids. Inorganic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Organic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, \np-\n toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be formed with inorganic and organic bases. Inorganic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum, and the like; particularly preferred are the ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium salts. Organic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, basic ion exchange resins, and the like, specifically such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, and ethanolamine. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from a parent compound, a basic or acidic moiety, by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting free acid forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base (such as Na, Ca, Mg, or K hydroxide, carbonate, bicarbonate, or the like), or by reacting free base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate acid. Such reactions are typically carried out in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two. Generally, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred, where practicable. Lists of additional suitable salts can be found, e.g., in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., (1985\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, surfactants, antioxidants, preservatives (e.g., antibacterial agents, antifungal agents), isotonic agents, absorption delaying agents, salts, preservatives, drugs, drug stabilizers, binders, excipients, disintegration agents, lubricants, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, dyes, such like materials and combinations thereof, as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art (see, for example, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed.

See\n Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, (W.B. Saunders Co. 27th ed. 1988\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"inhibition\" or \"inhibiting\" refers to the reduction or suppression of a given condition, symptom, or disorder, or disease, or a significant decrease in the baseline activity of a biological activity or process. Preferably, the condition or symptom or disorder or disease is mediated by CETP activity or responsive to the inhibition of CETP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"treating\" or \"treatment\" of any disease or disorder refers in one embodiment, to ameliorating the disease or disorder (i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the disease or at least one of the clinical symptoms thereof). In another embodiment \"treating\" or \"treatment\" refers to ameliorating at least one physical parameter, which may not be discernible by the patient. In yet another embodiment, \"treating\" or \"treatment\" refers to modulating the disease or disorder, either physically, (e.g., stabilization of a discernible symptom), physiologically, (e.g., stabilization of a physical parameter), or both.

These are formed, with inorganic acids or organic acids. Suitable inorganic acids include but are not limited to, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, a phosphoric or hydrohalic acid. Suitable organic acids include but are not limited to, carboxylic acids, such as (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkanecarboxylic acids which, for example, are unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, e.g., acetic acid, such as saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, e.g., oxalic, succinic, maleic or fumaric acid, such as hydroxycarboxylic acids, e.g., glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid, such as amino acids, e.g., aspartic or glutamic acid, organic sulfonic acids, such as (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkylsulfonic acids, e.g., methanesulfonic acid; or arylsulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted, e.g., by halogen.

Salts may be formed using conventional methods, advantageously in the presence of an ethereal or alcoholic solvent, such as a lower alkanol. From the solutions of the latter, the salts may be precipitated with ethers, e.g., diethyl ether. Resulting salts may be converted into the free compounds by treatment with acids. These or other salts can also be used for purification of the compounds obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen both a basic group and an acid group are present in the same molecule, the compounds of the present invention can also form internal salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides pro-drugs of the compounds of the present invention that converts \nin vivo\n to the compounds of the present invention. A pro-drug is an active or inactive compound that is modified chemically through \nin vivo\n physiological action, such as hydrolysis, metabolism and the like, into a compound of this invention following administration of the prodrug to a subject. The suitability and techniques involved in making and using pro-drugs are well known by those skilled in the art. Prodrugs can be conceptually divided into two non-exclusive categories, bioprecursor prodrugs and carrier prodrugs. See \nThe Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, Ch. 31-32 (Ed. Wermuth, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 2001\n). Generally, bioprecursor prodrugs are compounds are inactive or have low activity compared to the corresponding active drug compound, that contains one or more protective groups and are converted to an active form by metabolism or solvolysis. Both the active drug form and any released metabolic products should have acceptably low toxicity. Typically, the formation of active drug compound involves a metabolic process or reaction that is one of the follow types:\n\n \n \n \n1. Oxidative reactions, such as oxidation of alcohol, carbonyl, and acid functions, hydroxylation of aliphatic carbons, hydroxylation of alicyclic carbon atoms, oxidation of aromatic carbon atoms, oxidation of carbon-carbon double bonds, oxidation of nitrogen-containing functional groups, oxidation of silicon, phosphorus, arsenic, and sulfur, oxidative N-delakylation, oxidative O- and S-delakylation, oxidative deamination, as well as other oxidative reactions.\n \n2. Reductive reactions, such as reduction of carbonyl groups, reduction of alcoholic groups and carbon-carbon double bonds, reduction of nitrogen-containing functions groups, and other reduction reactions.\n \n3. Reactions without change in the state of oxidation, such as hydrolysis of esters and ethers, hydrolytic cleavage of carbon-nitrogen single bonds, hydrolytic cleavage of non-aromatic heterocycles, hydration and dehydration at multiple bonds, new atomic linkages resulting from dehydration reactions, hydrolytic dehalogenation, removal of hydrogen halide molecule, and other such reactions.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nCarrier prodrugs are drug compounds that contain a transport moiety, e.g., that improve uptake and/or localized delivery to a site(s) of action. Desirably for such a carrier prodrug, the linkage between the drug moiety and the transport moiety is a covalent bond, the prodrug is inactive or less active than the drug compound, and any released transport moiety is acceptably non-toxic. For prodrugs where the transport moiety is intended to enhance uptake, typically the release of the transport moiety should be rapid. In other cases, it is desirable to utilize a moiety that provides slow release, e.g., certain polymers or other moieties, such as cyclodextrins. See, \n \nCheng et al., US20040077595\n \n, application Ser. No. \n \n10/656,838\n \n. Such carrier prodrugs are often advantageous for orally administered drugs. Carrier prodrugs can, for example, be used to improve one or more of the following properties: increased lipophilicity, increased duration of pharmacological effects, increased site-specificity, decreased toxicity and adverse reactions, and/or improvement in drug formulation (e.g., stability, water solubility, suppression of an undesirable organoleptic or physiochemical property). For example, lipophilicity can be increased by esterification of hydroxy groups with lipophilic carboxylic acids, or of carboxylic acid groups with alcohols, e.g., aliphatic alcohols. \nWermuth, The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, Ch. 31-32, Ed. Werriuth, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 2001\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary prodrugs are, e.g., esters of free carboxylic acids and \nS\n-acyl and \nO\n-acyl derivatives of thiols, alcohols or phenols, wherein acyl has a meaning as defined herein. Preferred are pharmaceutically acceptable ester derivatives convertible by solvolysis under physiological conditions to the parent carboxylic acid, e.g., lower alkyl esters, cycloalkyl esters, lower alkenyl esters, benzyl esters, mono- or di-substituted lower alkyl esters, such as the ω-(amino, mono- or di-lower alkylamino, carboxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl)-lower alkyl esters, the α-(lower alkanoyloxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl or di-lower alkylaminocarbonyl)-lower alkyl esters, such as the pivaloyloxymethyl ester and the like conventionally used in the art. In addition, amines have been masked as arylcarbonyloxymethyl substituted derivatives which are cleaved by esterases \nin vivo\n releasing the free drug and formaldehyde (\nBundgaard, J. Med. Chem. 2503 (1989\n)). Moreover, drugs containing an acidic NH group, such as imidazole, imide, indole and the like, have been masked with N-acyloxymethyl groups (\nBundgaard, Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier (1985\n)). Hydroxy groups have been masked as esters and ethers. \n \nEP 039,051\n \n (Sloan and Little) discloses Mannich-base hydroxamic acid prodrugs, their preparation and use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the close relationship between the compounds, the compounds in the form of their salts and the pro-drugs, any reference to the compounds of the present invention is to be understood as referring also to the corresponding pro-drugs of the compounds of the present invention, as appropriate and expedient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the compounds of the present invention, including their salts, can also be obtained in the form of their hydrates, or include other solvents used for their crystallization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention have valuable pharmacological properties. The compounds of the present invention are useful as inhibitors for cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). CETP is a 74KD glycopeptide, it is secreted by the liver and is a key player in facilitating the transfer of lipids between the various lipoproteins in plasma. The primary function of CETP is to redistribute cholesteryl esters (CE) and triglycerides between lipoproteins. See\n Assmann, G et al., \"\nHDL cholesterol and protective factors in atherosclerosis,\n\" Circulation, 109: 1118-1114 (2004\n). Because most triglycerides in plasma originate in VLDLs and most CEs are formed in HDL particles in the reaction catalyzed by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, activity of CETP results in a net mass transfer of triglycerides from VLDLs to LDLs and HDLs and a net mass transfer of CEs from HDLs to VLDLs and LDLs. Thus, CETP potentially decreases HDL-C levels, increases LDL-cholesteryl (LDL-C) levels and reduces HDL and LDL particles size, and inhibition of CETP could be a therapeutic strategy for raising HDL-cholesteryl (HDL-C), have a favorable impact on the lipoprotein profile, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention as CETP inhibitors are useful for the delay of progression and/or treatment of a disorder or disease that is mediated by CETP or responsive to inhibition of CETP. Disorders, conditions and diseases that can be treated with the compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to, hyperlipidemia, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, dyslipidemia, hyperbetalipoproteinemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, familial hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disorder, coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease, coronary vascular disease, angina, ischemia, heart ischemia, thrombosis, cardiac infarction such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, reperfusion injury, angioplasty restenosis, hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes such as type II diabetes mellitus, diabetic vascular complications, obesity, infection or egg embryonation of schistosoma, or endotoxemia etc..\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the present invention provides:\n\n \n \n \na compound of the present invention as described herein above for use as a medicament;\n \nthe use of a compound of the present invention as described herein above for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the delay of progression and/or treatment of a disorder or disease mediated by CETP, or responsive to inhibition of CETP.\n \nthe use of a compound of the present invention as described herein above for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the delay of progression and/or treatment of a disorder or disease selected from hyperlipidemia, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, dyslipidemia, hyperbetalipoproteinemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, familial hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disorder, coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease, coronary vascular disease, angina, ischemia, heart ischemia, thrombosis, cardiac infarction such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, reperfusion injury, angioplasty restenosis, hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes such as type II diabetes mellitus, diabetic vascular complications, obesity or endotoxemia etc.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by the procedures described in the following sections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the compounds of formula (I) can be prepared according to the following general procedures and schemes.

The more active enantiomer is advantageously isolated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I) wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention comprises isotopes of hydrogen, such as \n2\nH and \n3\nH, carbon, such as \n11\nC, \n13\nC and \n14\nC, chlorine, such as \n38\nCl, fluorine, such as \n18\nF, iodine, such as \n123\nI and \n125\nI, nitrogen, such as \n13\nN and \n15\nN, oxygen, such as \n15\nO, \n17\nO and \n18\nO, phosphorus, such as \n32\nP, and sulphur, such as \n35\nS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, \ni.e\n. \n2\nH, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased \nin vivo\n half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations Sections using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn starting compounds and intermediates which are converted to the compounds of the invention in a manner described herein, functional groups present, such as amino, thiol, carboxyl and hydroxy groups, are optionally protected by conventional protecting groups that are common in preparative organic chemistry. Protected amino, thiol, carboxyl and hydroxy groups are those that can be converted under mild conditions into free amino thiol, carboxyl and hydroxy groups without the molecular framework being destroyed or other undesired side reactions taking place.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe purpose of introducing protecting groups is to protect the functional groups from undesired reactions with reaction components under the conditions used for carrying out a desired chemical transformation. The need and choice of protecting groups for a particular reaction is known to those skilled in the art and depends on the nature of the functional group to be protected (hydroxy group, amino group, etc.), the structure and stability of the molecule of which the substituent is a part and the reaction conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWell-known protecting groups that meet these conditions and their introduction and removal are described, e.g., in \nMcOmie, \"\nProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\n\", Plenum Press, London, NY (1973\n); and \nGreene and Wuts, \"\nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\n\", John Wiley and Sons, Inc., NY (1999\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above-mentioned reactions are carried out according to standard methods, in the presence or absence of diluent, preferably, such as are inert to the reagents and are solvents thereof, of catalysts, condensing or said other agents, respectively and/or inert atmospheres, at low temperatures, room temperature or elevated temperatures, preferably at or near the boiling point of the solvents used, and at atmospheric or super-atmospheric pressure. The preferred solvents, catalysts and reaction conditions are set forth in the appended illustrative Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further includes any variant of the present processes, in which an intermediate product obtainable at any stage thereof is used as starting material and the remaining steps are carried out, or in which the starting materials are formed \nin situ\n under the reaction conditions, or in which the reaction components are used in the form of their salts or optically pure antipodes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention and intermediates can also be converted into each other according to methods generally known \nper se\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition can be formulated for particular routes of administration such as oral administration, parenteral administration, and rectal administration, etc. In addition, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be made up in a solid form including capsules, tablets, pills, granules, powders or suppositories, or in a liquid form including solutions, suspensions or emulsions. The pharmaceutical compositions can be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical operations such as sterilization and/or can contain conventional inert diluents, lubricating agents, or buffering agents, as well as adjuvants, such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifers and buffers etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the pharmaceutical compositions are tablets and gelatin capsules comprising the active ingredient together with\n\n \n \n \na) diluents, e.g., lactose, dextrose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, cellulose and/or glycine;\n \nb) lubricants, e.g., silica, talcum, stearic acid, its magnesium or calcium salt and/or polyethyleneglycol; for tablets also\n \nc) binders, e.g., magnesium aluminum silicate, starch paste, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone; if desired\n \nd) disintegrants, e.g., starches, agar, alginic acid or its sodium salt, or effervescent mixtures; and/or\n \ne) absorbents, colorants, flavors and sweeteners.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nTablets may be either film coated or enteric coated according to methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable compositions for oral administration include an effective amount of a compound of the invention in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsion, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use are prepared according to any method known in the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions can contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients are, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example, starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets are uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInjectable compositions are preferably aqueous isotonic solutions or suspensions, and suppositories are advantageously prepared from fatty emulsions or suspensions. Said compositions may be sterilized and/or contain adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances. Said compositions are prepared according to conventional mixing, granulating or coating methods, respectively, and contain about 0.1-75%, preferably about 1-50%, of the active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable compositions for transdermal application include an effective amount of a compound of the invention with carrier. Advantageous carriers include absorbable pharmacologically acceptable solvents to assist passage through the skin of the host. For example, transdermal devices are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound of the skin of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and means to secure the device to the skin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable compositions for topical application, e.g., to the skin and eyes, include aqueous solutions, suspensions, ointments, creams, gels or sprayable formulations, e.g., for delivery by aerosol or the like. Such topical delivery systems will in particular be appropriate for dermal application, e.g., for the treatment of skin cancer, e.g., for prophylactic use in sun creams, lotions, sprays and the like. They are thus particularly suited for use in topical, including cosmetic, formulations well-known in the art. Such may contain solubilizers, stabilizers, tonicity enhancing agents, buffers and preservatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising the compounds of the present invention as active ingredients, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, the addition of water (e.g., 5%) is widely accepted in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. See, e.g.,\n Jens T. Carstensen, Drug Stability: Principles & Practice, 2d. Ed., Marcel Dekker, NY, N.Y., 1995, pp. 379-80\n. In effect, water and heat accelerate the decomposition of some compounds. Thus, the effect of water on a formulation can be of great significance since moisture and/or humidity are commonly encountered during manufacture, handling, packaging, storage, shipment, and use of formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise lactose and at least one active ingredient that comprises a primary or secondary amine are preferably anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and/or storage is expected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn anhydrous pharmaceutical composition should be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions are preferably packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastics, unit dose containers (e. g., vials), blister packs, and strip packs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise one or more agents that reduce the rate by which the compound of the present invention as an active ingredient will decompose. Such agents, which are referred to herein as \"stabilizers,\" include, but are not limited to, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, pH buffers, or salt buffers, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention likewise relates to a combination of a compound of formula (I), (I A) or (I B), respectively, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with a further active principle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combination may be made for example with the following active principles, selected from the group consisting of a:\n\n \n \n \n(i) HMG-Co-A reductase inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n \n(ii) angiotensin II receptor antagonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n \n(iii) angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n \n(iv) calcium channel blocker or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n \n(v) aldosterone synthase inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n \n(vi) aldosterone antagonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n \n(vii) dual angiotensin converting enzyme/neutral endopeptidase (ACE/NEP) inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n \n(viii) endothelin antagonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n \n(ix) renin inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n \n(x) diuretic or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and\n \n(xi) an ApoA-I mimic.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAn angiotensin II receptor antagonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is understood to be an active ingredients which bind to the AT\n1\n-receptor subtype of angiotensin II receptor but do not result in activation of the receptor. As a consequence of the inhibition of the AT\n1\n receptor, these antagonists can, for example, be employed as antihypertensives or for treating congestive heart failure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe class of AT\n1\n receptor antagonists comprises compounds having differing structural features, essentially preferred are the non-peptidic ones.

For example, mention may be made of the compounds which are selected from the group consisting alacepril, benazepril, benazeprilat, captopril, ceronapril, cilazapril, delapril, enalapril, enaprilat, fosinopril, imidapril, lisinopril, moveltopril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, spirapril, temocapril, and trandolapril, or, in each case, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred ACE inhibitors are those agents that have been marketed, most preferred are benazepril and enalapril.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe class of CCBs essentially comprises dihydropyridines (DHPs) and non-DHPs such as diltiazem-type and verapamil-type CCBs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA CCB useful in said combination is preferably a DHP representative selected from the group consisting of amlodipine, felodipine, ryosidine, isradipine, lacidipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, niguldipine, niludipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, nitrendipine, and nivaldipine, and is preferably a non-DHP representative selected from the group consisting of flunarizine, prenylamine, diltiazem, fendiline, gallopamil, mibefradil, anipamil, tiapamil and verapamil, and in each case, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Especially preferred as DHP is amlodipine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, especially the besylate, thereof. An especially preferred representative of non-DHPs is verapamil or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, especially the hydrochloride, thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAldosterone synthase inhibitor is an enzyme that converts corticosterone to aldosterone to by hydroxylating cortocosterone to form 18-OH-corticosterone and 18-OH-corticosterone to aldosterone. The class of aldosterone synthase inhibitors is known to be applied for the treatment of hypertension and primary aldosteronism comprises both steroidal and non-steroidal aldosterone synthase inhibitors, the later being most preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreference is given to commercially available aldosterone synthase inhibitors or those aldosterone synthase inhibitors that have been approved by the health authorities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe class of aldosterone synthase inhibitors comprises compounds having differing structural features. For example, mention may be made of the compounds which are selected from the group consisting of the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, fadrozole (including the (+)-enantiomer thereof), as well as the steroidal aromatase inhibitor exemestane, or, in each case where applicable, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most preferred non-steroidal aldosterone synthase inhibitor is the (+)-enantiomer of the hydrochloride of fadrozole (\n \nUS patents 4617307\n \n and \n \n4889861\n \n) of formula\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred steroidal aldosterone antagonist is eplerenone of the formula\n\n \n \n\nor spironolactone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred dual angiotensin converting enzyme/neutral endopetidase (ACE/NEP) inhibitor is, for example, omapatrilate (cf. \n \nEP 629627\n \n), fasidotril or fasidotrilate, or, if appropriable, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred endothelin antagonist is, for example, bosentan (cf. \n \nEP 526708 A\n \n), furthermore, tezosentan (cf. \n \nWO 96/19459\n \n), or in each case, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA renin inhibitor is, for example, a non-peptidic renin inhibitor such as the compound of formula\n\n \n \n\nchemically defined as 2(S),4(S),5(S),7(S)-N-(3-amino-2,2-dimethyl-3-oxopropyl)-2,7-di(1-methylethyl)-4-hydroxy-5-amino-8-[4-methoxy-3-(3-methoxy-propoxy)phenyl]-octanamide.

In particular, the following assays are used.\n\n\n \n(1) \nCETP in vitro assay:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nCETP Activity Kit (#RB-RPAK) was purchased from Roar Biochemical, Inc. (New York, NY, USA). To each well of a 96-well NBS half-area plate (costar #3686), 1.2 ng/well of the donor solution, 1 µL of the acceptor solution and 5 µL compound solution diluted in 100% DMSO were added in a 38 µL of buffer containing 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.4. Then, the plate was sealed with Themowell\n™\n Sealers (costar #6524) and followed by a mixing on a plate shaker by MICROPLATE MIXER MPX-96 (IWAKI) at power 3 for 10 sec at room temperature. After 10-min incubation at 37°C, the reaction was started by adding 5 µL of rhCETP solution (Cardiovascular Target, New York, NY, USA) and mixed on the plate shaker for 10 sec, then the fluorescence intensity at 0 min was measured by a ARVO SX (Perkin Elmerr, USA) at excitation wavelength of 465 nm and emission wavelength of 535 nm. After 120 min-incubation at 37°C, fluorescence intensity was measured again. The inhibition of rhCETP activity by a compound was calculated by the following calculation. Inhibition%= {1- (F120 - F0) / (f120 - f0)}x 100 F: measured fluorescence intensity with compound at 0 or 120 min. f: measured fluorescence intensity of without compound at 0 or 120 min.\n\nThe IC\n50\n values are determined from the dose-effect curve by Origin software. IC\n50\n values, especially from about 0.1 nM to about 50 µM, are determined for the compounds of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n(2) \nEffects on plasma HDL levels in hamster:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nEffects of compounds on HDL-cholesterol level in hamsters are investigated by the method reported previously with some modifications (\nEur, J. Phamacol, 466 (2003) 147-154\n). In brief, male Syrian hamsters (10-11 week-old age, SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) are fed a high cholesterol diet for two weeks. Then, the animals are dosed singly with the compound suspended with carboxyl methyl cellulose solution. HDL-cholesterol levels are measured by using commercially available kit (Wako Pure Chemical, Japan) after the precipitation of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins with 13% polyethylene glycol 6000.\n\n\n \n(3) \nPreparation of human pro-apolipoprotein AI (pro-apoAl)\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe cDNA of human pro-apoal (NCBI accession number: NMR_000039) is cloned from human liver Quick-Clone\n™\n cDNA (Clontech, CA) and inserted to a pET28a vector (Novagen, Germany) for bacterial expression. Expressed protein as a fusion protein with 6xHis-tag at N-terminus in BL-21 Gold (DE3) (Strategene, CA) is purified using HiTrap Chelating (GE Healthcare, CT).\n\n\n \n(4) \nPreparation of donor microemulsion\n \n\n\n \n \n \nPro-apoAI containing microemulsion as a donor particle is prepared following previous reports (\nJ. Biol. Chem., 280:14918-22\n). Glyceryl trioleate (62.5 ng, Sigma, MO), 3-sn-phosphatidylcholine (583 ng, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan), and cholesteryl BODIPY\n®\n FL C\n12\n (250 ng, Invitrogen, CA) are dissolved in 1 mL of chloroform. The solution is evaporated, then residual solvent is removed in vacuum for more than 1 hr. The dried lipid mixture is dissolved in 500 µL of the assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.4) containing 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM EDTA) and sonicated at 50°C with a microtip (MICROSON\n™\n ULTRASONIC CELL DISRUPTOR, Misonix, Farmingdale, NY) at output power 006 for 2 min. After sonication, the solution is cooled to 40°C, added to 100 µg of human pro-apoAl, and sonicated at output power 004 for 5 min at 40°C. The solution, BODIPY-CE microemulsion as a donor molecule is stored at 4°C after filtration through a 0.45 µm PVDF filter.\n\n\n \n(5) \nIn vitro CETP activity assay in human plasma\n \n\n\n \n \n \nHuman EDTA plasma samples from healthy men are purchased from New Drug Development Research Center, Inc. Donor solution is prepared by a dilution of donor microemulsion with assay buffer. Human plasma (50 µL), assay buffer (35 µL) and test compound dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (1 µL) are added to each well of 96 well half area black flat bottom plate. The reaction is started by the addition of donor solution (14 µL) into each well. Fluorescence intensities are measured every 30 min at 37°C with excitation wave length of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 535 nm. The CETP activity (Fl/min) is defined as the changes of fluorescence intensity from 30 to 90 min.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of the invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention concerns TRPV1 antagonists characterized by a bicyclic portion and, when possible, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof along with the formulations containing them. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are useful in the treatment of pain and other conditions ameliorated by the inhibition of the vanilloid receptor TRPV 1.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a member of ion channels mainly localized on primary afferent neurons. Activation of TRPV1 on sensory neurons by chemical stimulants including capsaicin and resiniferatoxin, as well as low pH (<6), heat (>42°C), and nucleosides such as ATP, leads to an influx of Ca2+ and Na+ ions through the channel, causing depolarization of the cell and transmission of painful stimuli. Unlike traditional analgesic drugs that either suppress inflammation (e.g. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors) or block pain transmission (e.g. opiates), TRPV1 channel inhibitors aim to prevent pain by blocking a receptor where pain is generated. In patients, the expression of TRPV 1 is up-regulated in a number of painful inflammatory disorders. TRPV1 as a pain target has been validated by genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition experiments. The pungency of capsaicin and many other agonists at the vanilloid receptor clearly define TRPV1 as a key transducer in the pain pathway. Characterization of TRPV1 mice, which lack both copies of the TRPV1 gene, shows a complete absence of thermal hyperalgesia associated with inflammation demonstrating the key role of TRPV1 in disease and providing impetus to develop selective TRPV1 antagonists as a novel pain therapy with the potential for an improved side effect profile compared to existing therapies. Some 10 years post cloning and many novel selective and chemically distinct TRPV1 antagonists have now been identified and a number of these have been assessed in preclinical models of pain. Some of them reverse mechanical hyperalgesia in the Freund's complete adjuvant model of inflammatory pain in rodents. Others show efficacy in neuropathic pain models, in post-operative pain and in cancer pain. These data provide robust validation of this approach for the treatment of a broad range of pain conditions in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the bladder, the presence of TRPV1 was demonstrated in various cell types, including urothelium, detrusor muscle and fibroblasts. There is good evidence that TRPV1 in urothelium is functional. Capsaicin evokes an inward current similar to that seen in DRG neurons in patch-clamped human urothelial cells. Furthermore capsaicin induces calcium uptake in human urothelial cells culture which is blocked by the TRPV1 antagonists implying that the regulation of TRPV1 is similar in sensory neurons and urothelial cells. Overactive bladder (OAB) is a syndrome characterised by urgency (with or without urge incontinence), usually with frequency and nocturia, in the absence of other pathologic or metabolic conditions that might explain the symptoms. Differently from antimuscarinic compounds dominating the market of OAB that only act on the efferent components, TRPV1 antagonists, acting on sensory nerves or on urothelium, are effective in diverse experimental models of cystitis/overactive bladder without interfere with the physiological volume-induced avoiding contractions (VIVC) and distention of the urinary bladder in healthy animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe documented ability of citric acid as well as pungent compounds such as capsaicin to induce cough when delivered to the lungs of experimental animals and humans, combined with the contribution of TRPV1-sensitive nerves to airway hyper responsiveness and bronco constriction has led to a large degree of interest in the potential for targeting TRPV1 for the treatment of a range of respiratory diseases. These effects are thought to derive from the key contribution of TRPV1 which is highly expressed by sensory neurons and vagal afferents that innervate the airways, to the cough reflex. Preclinical studies have now demonstrated antitussive efficacy of a range of TRPV1 antagonists in rodent models.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDescription of the invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to TRPV1 inhibitors of formula \n(I)\n\n\n \n \n\nwherein:\n\n \n \n \nY is a group of formula:\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nin which:\n\n \nJ is NH, O or a bond;\n \nm is 0, 1 or 2; with the proviso that when J is a bond, then m is not zero;\n \nK is NH, O or CH\n2;\n \n \nW is NH, O, a bond or CH\n2\n;\n \nQ is NH, O, a bond or CH\n2\n;\n \nn is 0 or 1;\n \nU1, U2, U3, U4 and U5 form an aromatic ring and are independently CH, N, O, S, or one of them may be absent.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe aromatic ring is optionally substituted with one or both R1 and R2 groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen one of U1-U5 is absent, the general formula \nI\n also includes mono or bi-substituted five membered heterocycle rings (e.g. furan, imidazole, thiazole, triazole, oxazole, isoxazole, thiophene, pyrazole).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR1 and R2 are independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, trifluoromethyl, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkylamino, monocyclic ring system containing 0-4 heteroatoms independently selected from N and O, which can be optionally substituted by OH, phenyl, heterocycle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR3 is hydrogen or with n = 1 is CH2 and forms a cycle with R1 = CH2 or = CH2-CH2\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen one asymmetrical carbon is present in a compound of the formula (I), such a compound may exist in optically active form or in the form of mixtures of optical isomers, e. g. in the form of racemic mixtures.

Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of the compounds according to the invention or of their non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, maleic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid. Preferred pharmaceutically salts of the compounds of the present invention are those with the inorganic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe salts may be formed by conventional means, such as by reacting the free base form of the suitable compounds of formula I with one or more equivalents of the appropriate acid in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble or in a solvent such as water which is removed under vacuum.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCompositions of the invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions that comprise compounds of the present invention. The pharmaceutical compositions comprise compounds of the present invention that may be formulated together with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other mammals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments or drops), buccally or as an oral or nasal spray.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as, but not limited to, lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as, but not limited to, corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as, but not limited to, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as, but not limited to, cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as, but not limited to, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as, but not limited to, ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as, but not limited to, magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as, but not limited to, sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of this invention for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like), vegetable oils (such as olive oil), injectable organic esters (such as ethyl oleate) and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents that delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This can be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInjectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsulated matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly (orthoesters) and poly (anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol and silicic acid; b) binders such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia; c) humectants such as glycerol; d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates and sodium carbonate; e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin; f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; g) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard- filled gelatin capsules using such carriers as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solid dosage forms of tablets, dragées, capsules, pills and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well-known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and may also be of a composition such that they release the active ingredient (s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned carriers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBesides inert diluents, the oral compositions may also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, tragacanth and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating carriers or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono-or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals, which are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients and the like. The preferred lipids are natural and synthetic phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins) used separately or together.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, \nPrescott, Ed., Methods in Cell Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N. Y. (1976), p. 33\n et seq.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives, buffers or propellants that may be required. Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the treatment of painful conditions such as those listed below, a suitable indicated dosage level is about 0.1mg to 1000mg/day, preferably from about 5mg to 500mg per day. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 3 times a day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that the amount of a compound of formula I required for use in any treatment will vary not only with the particular compounds or compositions selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated, and the age and condition of the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe agents of invention are useful vanilloid receptor antagonists for the treatment of pain of various genesis or aetiology and as anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of inflammatory reactions, diseases or conditions. They are useful for the treatment of inflammatory pain, for the treatment of hyperalgesia, and in particular for the treatment of severe chronic pain. They are, for example, useful for the treatment of pain, inflammation consequential to trauma, e.g. associated with burns or subsequent to surgical intervention, e.g. as post-operative analgesics, as well as for the treatment of inflammatory pain of diverse genesis, e.g. for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. They are suitable as analgesics for the treatment of pain associated with, e.g. angina or cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther forms of pain associated with the activity of TRPV1 are headache, dental pain, pelvic pain, migraine, mastalgia and visceral pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disorders in which TRPV1 is involved are not limited to pain. Such diseases include: nerve-related diseases, e.g. neuropathies, nerve injury and stroke; irritable bowel syndrome; gastrointestinal disorders, e.g. gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, Crohn's disease; respiratory diseases, e.g. asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cough; urinary incontinence; urinary bladder hypersensitiveness; skin diseases, e.g. psoriasis, dermatitis; cardiac diseases e.g. myocardial ischemia; hair growth related disorders e.g. hirsutism, alopecia; rhinitis; pancreatitis; vulvodynia; psychiatric disorders, e.g. anxiety or fear; obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention have potent analgesic effect and potential anti-inflammatory activity and their pharmaceutically formulations are thought to alleviate or to treat in particular neuropathic pain conditions such as diabetic neuropathy and post-herpetic neuralgia, urinary incontinence and cough.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention will be now illustrated by means of the following examples.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAll commercially available compounds were purchased from Vendors and were used without further purification.

The stock concentration (10 mM) of capsaicin, Fura-2-AM-ester, ionomycin and all tested compounds were prepared in 100% DMSO.\n\n\n \n\n\nCa\n2+\n fluorescence measurements in cultured rat dorsal root\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMale SD rats (∼ 50 g, Charles River, Italy) were terminally anaesthetized and decapitated. Dorsal root ganglia were removed and placed in cold Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) before being transferred to collagenase (2 mg/ml) and trypsin (1 mg/ml) for 35 min at 37°C. The ganglia, placed in cold DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin, were dissociated in single cells by several passages through a series of syringe needles (23G down to 25G). The medium and the ganglia were filtered to remove debris, topped up with 4 ml of DMEM medium and centrifuged (1100 rpm for 6 min). The final cell pellet was re-suspended in DMEM medium [supplemented with 100 ng/ml mouse Nerve Growth Factor (mouse-NGF-7S) and cytosine-ß-D-arabinofuranoside free base (ARA-C) 2.5 µM]. The cells were plated on poly-L-lysine (8.3 µM)- and laminin (5 µM)-coated 25 mm glass cover slips and kept for 2 days at 37°C in a humidified incubator gassed with 5% CO\n2\n and air, then treated with Fura-2-AM-ester (5 µM) in a Ca\n2+\n buffer solution having the following composition (mM): CaCl\n2\n 1.4, KCl 5.4, MgSO\n4\n 0.4, NaCl 135, D-glucose 5, HEPES 10 with BSA (0.1%), at pH 7.4, for 40 min at 37°C. The cells were then washed twice with the Ca\n2+\n buffer solution and transferred to a chamber on the stage of a Nikon eclipse TE300 microscope. Fura-2-AM-ester was excited at 340 nM and 380 nM to indicate relative [Ca\n2+\n]\ni\n changes by the F\n340\n/F\n380\n ratio recorded with a dynamic image analysis system (Laboratory Automation 2.0, RCS, Florence, Italy) and the cells were allowed (at least 10 min) to attain a stable fluorescence before beginning the experiment. A calibration curve was set up using buffer containing Fura-2-AM-ester and determinant concentrations of free Ca\n2+\n. This curve was then used to convert the data obtained from the F\n340\n/F\n380\n ratio to [Ca\n2+\n]\ni\n (nM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll exemplified compounds were tested at the concentration of 300 nM against the calcium uptake induced by 30 nM capsaicin. For selected molecules, the IC\n50\n value was calculated.\n\n\n \n\n\nCFA-induced thermal hyperalgesia in rats\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis method was used for the determination of acute nociceptive thermal threshold and combines a chemical stimulus and heat for measuring pain sensitivity. Male SD rats (Charles River, Italy) weighing 100 to 250 gr. were used. Anti-hyperalgesic effects were investigated by using the Hargreaves' test. Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA; Sigma, USA) was used to induce thermal hyperalgesia. CFA contains killed \nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n and is designed to provide continuous release of antigens necessary for stimulating a strong, persistent immune response. This effect causes the reduction of the hind paw withdrawal response latency induced by heat during the Hargreaves' test. Thermal stimulation was performed 30, 60, 120 and 180 (240 min only if needed) minutes after the oral administration of the antagonists. During the CFA-induced thermal hyperalgesia experiments two different solubilization protocols were used: when items presented an amino group, a pH=2 aqueous solution of HCl and 2.5% Tween80 was used; otherwise molecules were suspended in 0.5% Methocel and 2.5% Tween80. Compounds were orally administrated (30 µmol/kg/10ml) to rats 24 hours after the CFA treatment. CFA was injected into the plantar surface of a rat's hind paw at a fixed dose of 50µl by the use of a micro syringe.\n\n\n \n\n\nCFA-induced Tactile Allodynia in rats\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMale SD rats (Charles River, Italy) weighing 100 to 250 g were put into a clean plastic cage on an elevated glass plate for 30 min before the test. This lets the animals accommodate to their new environment before testing. Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA, 50 µl) was injected into the plantar surface of the right hind paw. Tactile stimulation was performed with von Frey filaments (from 0.07 to 26 g). All antagonists were orally administered 22 hours after to the CFA administration. Von Frey filaments were applied 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min after compound administrations. Median 50% (EG\n50\n) threshold of von Frey filaments was calculated by using the up-down method as previously described. All tested compounds were suspended in 0.5% Methocel and 2.5% Tween80 and orally administrated (30 µmol/kg/10ml) to rats by gavage 24 hours after the CFA treatment. CFA was injected into the plantar surface of a rat's hind paw at a fixed dose of 50µl by the use of a micro syringe.\n\n\n \n\n\nRectal temperature measurements in rats\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBody temperature was measured by a digital thermometer inserted at a depth of approximately 3 cm into the rectum of each animal (male SD rats, Charles River, Italy, 100 to 250 g). A pre-dose value of body temperature was measured prior to the administration of the test substance or vehicles. Animals were distributed among groups by the manual method to achieve the almost same mean values of body temperature of the groups based on the pre-dose value. All compounds were dissolved in 6% DMSO/ 6% Tween80 and then intraperitoneally (10 µmol/Kg/5 ml) administrated to rats.\n\n\n \n\n\nCCI-induced mechanical hyperalgesia\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMale SD rats (Charles River, Italy) weighing 250 g were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.), 0.1 ml/10 g) and, under a dissecting microscope, the right common sciatic nerve was exposed at the level of the mid thigh and, proximal to the trifurcation of the nerve; four ligatures (4/0 chromic silk, Ethicon) were loosely tied around it, at about 0.5 mm spacing, until they elicited a brief twitch in the respective hind, taking care to preserve epineural circulation. Sham-operated animals (sciatic exposure without ligation) were used as controls. 14 days after the surgery, mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed using an analgesimeter (Ugo Basile, Italy, Randall-Selitto analgesic apparatus). This device generated a mechanical force on the affected paw and the nociceptive threshold was defined as the force (in g) at which the rat withdraws the paw (with a cut-off of 450 g). Two baseline measurement values were obtained 75 and 45 min before the actual test. After the second baseline measurement, animals were randomly allocated to the different treatment groups. Paw pressure test was performed 0, 75, 120, 165, 210 and 300 min after the oral administration of the compounds. All tested compounds were orally administrated (30 µmol/kg/10ml) to rats by gavage.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRESULTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCa\n2+\n fluorescence measurements in cultured rat dorsal root ganglia neurons\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCapsaicin (0.3 µM) caused an increase in [Ca\n2+\n] in the vast majority (95%) of dorsal root ganglia neurons, which were thereby identified as TRPV1 expressing neurons. All synthesized derivatives were tested and all were able to inhibit the calcium uptake and several compounds exhibited more than 80% inhibition, e.g. compounds of Examples 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 23, 31, 32, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 45, 46, 47, 48, 51, 53, 63.
