Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compounds having pharmacological activity towards the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor, and more particularly to substituted N-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-sulfonamide compounds, to processes of preparation of such compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, and to their use in therapy, in particular for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of a disorder or a disease in which 5-HT\n6 \nis involved.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by better understanding of the structure of proteins and other biomolecules associated with target diseases. One important class of proteins that has been the subject of extensive study is the family of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT) receptors. The superfamily of serotonin receptors (5-HT) includes 7 classes (5-HT\n1\n-5-HT\n7\n) encompassing 14 human subclasses [D. Hoyer, et al., \nNeuropharmacology, \n1997, 36, 419]. The 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor is the latest serotonin receptor identified by molecular cloning both in rats [F. J. Monsma, et al., \nMol. Pharmacol., \n1993, 43, 320; M. Ruat, et al., \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., \n1993, 193, 268] and in humans [R. Kohen, et al., \nJ. Neurochem., \n1996, 66, 47]. Compounds with 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor affinity are useful for the treatment of various disorders of the Central Nervous System and of the gastrointestinal tract, such as irritable intestine syndrome. Compounds with 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor affinity are also useful in the treatment of anxiety, depression and cognitive memory disorders [M. Yoshioka, et al., \nAnn. NY Acad. Sci., \n1998, 861, 244; A. Bourson, et al., \nBr. J. Pharmacol., \n1998, 125, 1562; D. C. Rogers, et al., \nBr. J. Pharmacol. Suppl., \n1999, 127, 22P; A. Bourson, et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., \n1995, 274, 173; A. J. Sleight, et al., \nBehav. Brain Res., \n1996, 73, 245; T. A. Branchek, et al., \nnnu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., \n2000, 40, 319; C. Routledge, et al., \nBr. J. Pharmacol., \n2000, 130, 1606]. It has been shown that typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs for treating schizophrenia have a high affinity for 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors [B. L. Roth, et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., \n1994, 268, 1403; C. E. Glatt, et al., \nMo. Med., \n1995, 1, 398; F. J. Mosma, et al., \nMol. Pharmacol., \n1993, 43, 320; T. Shinkai, et al., \nAm. J. Med. Genet., \n1999, 88, 120]. Compounds with 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor affinity are useful for treating infant hyperkinesia (ADHD, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder) [W. D. Hirst, et al., \nBr. J. Pharmacol., \n2000, 130, 1597; C. Gérard, et al., \nBrain Research, \n1997, 746, 207; M. R. Pranzatelli, \nDrugs of Today, \n1997, 33, 379].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, it has been shown that the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor also plays a role in food ingestion [\nNeuropharmacology, \n2001, 41, 210-219]. In this sense, the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor has generated enormous interest amongst academic and pharmaceutical industry scientists as a molecular target for the development of a new generation of safe and more effective anti-obesity drugs. Heal, D. et al. describe in \nPharm. Ther.; \n2008; 117(2), 207-31, the major developments that have occurred in the field of medicinal chemistry and pharmacology of 5-HT\n6 \nligands, with particular emphasis on their application as novel anti-obesity drugs. The last 5 years have witnessed an increasing understanding of the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor and its structural requirements, producing an explosion in the number and diversity of novel, highly selective 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor agonists, partial agonists and antagonists that have been designed and synthesised.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFood ingestion disorders, particularly obesity, are a serious, fast growing threat to the health of humans of all age groups, since they increase the risk of developing other serious, even life-threatening diseases such as diabetes or coronary diseases as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are several documents describing the use of sulphonamide derivatives exhibiting a modulating activity at 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor which have been useful in the treatment of feeding disorders like anorexia, obesity, bulimia and similar disorders and also type 2 diabetes (EP1747779, EP1676841, EP1632491, WO2003/042175, WO2007/004959, WO2006/126939). Particularly, the compound 5-chloro-N-[3-(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)-1H-indol-5-yl]naphthalene-2-sulphonamide, also known as E-6837, has shown a selective and high affinity binding for the recombinant human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor, producing a reduction in the food intake, thus inducing a significant body weight loss [Fisas, A. et al., \nBrit. J. Pharm.; \n2006; 148; 973-983].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, it would be highly desirable to develop new compounds that are particularly suitable as active ingredients in medicaments, especially in medicaments for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of disorders or diseases related to 5-HT\n6\n.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe inventors have surprisingly found that the substituted N-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-sulfonamide compounds of general formula I given below show good to excellent affinity for 5-HT\n6\n-receptors.

the compounds of the invention are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of a hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a \n13\nC- or \n14\nC-enriched carbon or \n15\nN-enriched nitrogen are within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates” refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, solvate, or any other compound which, upon administration to the recipient is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound as described herein. However, it will be appreciated that non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts also fall within the scope of the invention since those may be useful in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The preparation of salts and solvates can be carried out by methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor instance, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds provided herein are synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts arc, for example, prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent or in a mixture of the two. Generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol or acetonitrile are preferred. Examples of the acid addition salts include mineral acid addition salts such as, for example, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, nitrate, phosphate, and organic acid addition salts such as, for example, acetate, maleate, fumarate, citrate, oxalate, succinate, tartrate, malate, mandelate, methanesulphonate and p-toluenesulphonate. Examples of the alkali addition salts include inorganic salts such as, for example, sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, magnesium, aluminium and lithium salts, and organic alkali salts such as, for example, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, N,N-dialkylenethanolamine, triethanolamine, glucamine and basic aminoacids salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be in crystalline form either as free compounds or as solvates and it is intended that both forms are within the scope of the present invention. Methods of solvation are generally known within the art. Suitable solvates are pharmaceutically acceptable solvates. In a particular embodiment the solvate is a hydrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) or their salts or solvates are preferably in pharmaceutically acceptable or substantially pure form. By pharmaceutically acceptable form is meant, inter alia, having a pharmaceutically acceptable level of purity excluding normal pharmaceutical additives such as diluents and carriers, and including no material considered toxic at normal dosage levels. Purity levels for the drug substance are preferably above 50%, more preferably above 70%, most preferably above 90%. In a preferred embodiment it is above 95% of the compound of formula (I), or of its salts, solvates or prodrugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention represented by the above described formula (I) may include stereoisomers depending on the presence of chiral centres or isomers depending on the presence of multiple bonds (e.g. Z, E). The single isomers, enantiomers or diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof in any ratio fall within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) defined above can be obtained by available synthetic procedures. For example, they can be prepared by reaction of a compound of general formula (II):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein:\n\n \n \n \nX represents a leaving group, preferably a halogen atom, more preferably a chlorine atom, and\n \nR\n6 \nis a halogen or a C\n1-5 \nalkyl radical optionally substituted by at least one halogen, with a compound of general formula (III),\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein:\n\n \n \n \nR\n1 \nto R\n5 \nare as defined above, and R\n7 \nis hydrogen, C\n1-5 \nalkyl radical or a cycloalkyl group.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a solvent selected from the group consisting of acetonitrile, ethyle acetate, diethyl ether, N,N-dimethylformamide, pyridine, chloroform, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofurane, toluene and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the reaction is carried out in the presence of at least one base, more preferably in the presence of at least one base selected from the group consisting of sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and diethylisopropylamine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe temperature of the reaction is preferably between 0° C. and 30° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of general formula (III) are primary or secondary amines in most cases commercially available or may be prepared by processes known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compound of general formula (III) is a primary amine (R\n7 \nis hydrogen), the compound of general formula (I) obtained in the reaction is a secondary sulfonamide (Scheme I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compound of general formula (III) is a secondary amine (R\n7 \nis not hydrogen), the compound of general formula (I) obtained in the reaction is a tertiary sulfonamide (Scheme 1).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tertiary sulfonamide may also be prepared by reaction of a secondary sulfonamide of general formula (I) wherein R\n7 \nis hydrogen, with an alkyl or cycloalkyl halide, preferably an alkyl or cycloalkyl iodide (Scheme 2). Particularly, said reaction is made in a medium selected from the group consisting of acetonitrile, ethyle acetate, diethyl ether, N,N-dimethylformamide, pyridine, chloroform, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofurane, toluene and mixtures thereof. Said reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of at least one base, more preferably in the presence of at least one base selected from the group consisting of sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the compounds of general formula (III), the protecting groups for the heteroatom may be used. Some examples include cyclic imide derivatives, such as maleimides or succinimides, a variety of carbamates, such as tert-butoxy-carbonyl (BOC) and fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc), a variety of amides, such as acetamides, and alkyl and aryl amine derivatives, such as N-benzyl or N-allyl amines. Additional examples of nitrogen and oxygen protecting groups can be found in reference books such as Protective groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J. F. W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T. W. Greene & P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley & sons, 1999.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the deprotection process is necessary, the methodology is known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the compounds of general formula (I) are obtained in form of a mixture of stereoisomers, particularly enantiomers or diastereomers, said mixtures may be separated by standard procedures known to those skilled in the art, e.g. chromatographic methods or crystallization with chiral reagents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe obtained reaction products may, if desired, be purified by conventional methods, such as crystallisation, chromatography and trituration. Where the above described processes for the preparation of compounds of the invention give rise to mixtures of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. If there are chiral centers the compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne preferred pharmaceutically acceptable form is the crystalline form, including such form in pharmaceutical composition. In the case of salts and solvates the additional ionic and solvent moieties must also be non-toxic. The compounds of the invention may present different polymorphic forms, it is intended that the invention encompasses all such forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of general formula (I) as defined above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, isomer or solvate thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “carrier, adjuvant or vehicle” relates to molecular entities or substances with which the active ingredient is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers, adjuvants or vehicles can be sterile liquids, such as waters and oils, including those of petroleum or with an animal, plant or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like, excipients, disintegrants, wetting agents or diluents. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences” by E. W. Martin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of pharmaceutical compositions include any solid (tablets, pills, capsules, granules etc.) or liquid (solutions, suspensions or emulsions) composition for oral, topical or parenteral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment the pharmaceutical compositions are in oral form, either solid or liquid. Suitable dose forms for oral administration may be tablets, capsules, syrops or solutions and may contain conventional excipients known in the art such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maize starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate; disintegrants, for example starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium starch glycollate or microcrystalline cellulose; or pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulfate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling or tabletting. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers. Such operations are conventional in the art. The tablets may for example be prepared by wet or dry granulation and optionally coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice, in particular with an enteric coating.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may also be adapted for parenteral administration, such as sterile solutions, suspensions or lyophilized products in the appropriate unit dosage form. Adequate excipients can be used, such as bulking agents, buffering agents or surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mentioned formulations will be prepared using standard methods such as those described or referred to in the Spanish and US Pharmacopoeias and similar reference texts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the compounds or compositions of the present invention may be by any suitable method, such as intravenous infusion, oral preparations, and intraperitoneal and intravenous administration. Oral administration is preferred because of the convenience for the patient and the chronic character of the diseases to be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally an effective administered amount of a compound of the invention will depend on the relative efficacy of the compound chosen, the severity of the disorder being treated and the weight of the sufferer. However, active compounds will typically be administered once or more times a day for example 1, 2, 3 or 4 times daily, with typical total daily doses in the range of from 0.1 to 1000 mg/kg/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds and compositions of this invention may be used with other drugs to provide a combination therapy. The other drugs may form part of the same composition, or be provided as a separate composition for administration at the same time or at different time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of this invention relates to a method of treating or preventing a 5-HT\n6 \nmediated disease or condition, which method comprises administering to a patient in need of such a treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutical composition thereof. Among the 5-HT\n6 \nmediated diseases that can be treated are: disorders or diseases related to food intake, preferably the regulation of appetite, the maintenance, increase or reduction of body weight; obesity; bulimia; anorexia; cachexia; type II diabetes; irritable colon syndrome; a disorder of the central nervous system; anxiety; panic attacks; depression; bipolar disorders; cognitive disorders; memory disorders; senile dementia; psychosis; neurodegenerative disorders, preferably selected from the group consisting of Morbus Alzheimer, Morbus Parkinson, Morbus Huntington and Multiple Sclerosis; schizophrenia; psychosis; and hyperactivity disorders, preferably attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are given only as further illustration of the invention, they should not be taken as a definition of the limits of the invention.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nSynthesis of 6-Chloroimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-sulfonyl chloride (compound of formula II)\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a 1000 mL reaction flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, neat chlorosulfonic acid (3.60 mol, 240 mL) was placed and heated at 120° C.

In said membranes the receptor concentration is 2.18 pmol/mg protein and the protein concentration is 9.17 mg/ml. The experimental protocol follows the method of B. L. Roth et al. [B. L. Roth et al., \nThe Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, \n1994, 268, 1403] with the following slight changes. The respective part of the literature description is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe commercial membrane is diluted (1:40 dilution) with the binding buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM EDTA (pH 7.4). The radioligand used is [\n3\nH]-LSD at a concentration of 2.7 nM with a final volume of 200 μl. incubation is initiated by adding 100 μl of membrane suspension, (≈22.9 μg membrane protein), and is prolonged for 60 minutes at a temperature of 37° C. The incubation is ended by fast filtration in a Brandel Cell Harvester through fiber glass filters made by Schleicher & Schnell GF 3362 pretreated with a solution of polyethylenimine at 0.5%. The filters are washed three times with three milliliters of buffer Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 7.4. The filters are transferred to flasks and 5 ml of Ecoscint H liquid scintillation cocktail are added to each flask. The flasks are allowed to reach equilibrium for several hours before counting with a Wallac Winspectral 1414 scintillation counter. Non-specific binding is determined in the presence of 100 μM of serotonin, Tests were made in triplicate. The inhibition constants (K\ni\n, nM) were calculated by non-linear regression analysis using the program EBDA/LIGAND described in Munson and Rodbard, \nAnalytical Biochemistry, \n1980, 107, 220, which is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding results for some of the compounds of the invention are give in the following table:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\n5-HT\n6 \nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n11.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n12.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n14.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n8.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n12.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n5.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n7.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n31\n\n\n68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n5.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n34\n\n\n7.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n36\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n37\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n38\n\n\n37.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n6.6"
