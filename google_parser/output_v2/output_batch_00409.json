Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides pharmaceutically active pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine compounds and analogues. Such compounds are useful for inhibiting Janus Kinase (JAK). This invention also is directed to compositions comprising methods for making such compounds, and methods for treating and preventing conditions mediated by JAK.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein kinases are families of enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of specific residues in proteins, broadly classified into tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. Inappropriate kinase activity, arising from mutation, overexpression, or inappropriate regulation, dysregulation or deregulation, as well as over or under production of growth factors or cytokines has been implicated in many diseases, including but not limited to cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies, asthma and other respiratory diseases, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic disorders, and neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Inappropriate kinase activity triggers a variety of biological cellular responses relating to cell growth, cell differentiation, survival, apoptosis, mitogenesis, cell cycle control, and cell mobility implicated in the aforementioned and related diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, protein kinases have emerged as an important class of enzymes as targets for therapeutic intervention. In particular, the JAK family of cellular protein tyrosine kinases (Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2) play a central role in cytokine signaling (Kisseleva et al, Gene, 2002, 285, 1; Yamaoka et al. Genome Biology 2004, 5, 253)). Upon binding to their receptors, cytokines activate JAK which then phosphorylate the cytokine receptor, thereby creating docking sites for signaling molecules, notably, members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family that ultimately lead to gene expression. Numerous cytokines are known to activate the JAK family. These cytokines include, the IFN family (IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-omega, Limitin, IFN-gamma, IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22), the gp130 family (IL-6, IL-11, OSM, LIF, CNTF, NNT-1/BSF-3, G-CSF, CT-1, Leptin, IL-12, IL-23), gammaC family (IL-2, IL-7, TSLP, IL-9, IL-15, IL-21, IL-4, IL-13), IL-3 family (IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF), single chain family (EPO, GH, PRL, TPO), receptor tyrosine kinases (EGF, PDGF, CSF-1, HGF), and G-protein coupled receptors (AT1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere remains a need for alternative compounds that effectively inhibit JAK enzymes, including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and/or Tyk2.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention is directed, in part, to compounds that generally fall within the structure of\n\n\n \nFormula I:\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;\n\n\nwherein the A ring is heterocyclyl;\n\n\nwherein the A ring is optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of halo, carboxy, cyano, oxo, aryl, heterocyclyl, (C\n1\n-C\n8\n)alkyl, —OP(O)(R\n10\n)\nn\n, —OR\n11\n, —OC(O)R\n12\n, —C(O)OR\n12\n, —C(O)R\n13\n, —C(O)NR\n14\nR\n15\n, —NR\n16\nR\n17\n, —N(R\n18\n)C(O)R\n19\n, —N(R\n18\n)S(O)\n2\nR\n19\n, —SO\n2\nR\n20\n, and —SO\n2\nNR\n21\nR\n22\n; wherein the (C\n1\n-C\n8\n)alkyl is optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of halo, cyano, aryl, heterocyclyl, —OR\n23\n, —OC(O)R\n24\n, —NR\n25\nR\n26\n, —C(O)NR\n27\nR\n28\n, —SR\n29\n, —SO\n2\nR\n30\n, —SO\n2\nNR\n31\nR\n32\n, —N(R\n33\n)C(O)R\n34\n, and —N(R\n35\n)S(O)\n2\nR\n36\n;\n\n\nR\n10 \nis selected from the group consisting of hydroxy and (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy;\n\n\nn is one or two;\n\n\nR\n11 \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, hydroxy(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, aryl, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkylaminocarbonyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxycarbonyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, halo(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, heterocyclylcarbonyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, and aminocarbonyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl;\n\n\nR\n12\n, R\n13\n, R\n14\n, R\n15\n, R\n16\n, R\n17\n, R\n18\n, R\n21\n, R\n22\n, R\n24\n, R\n25\n, R\n26\n, R\n27\n, R\n28\n, R\n31\n, R\n32\n, R\n33\n, R\n34\nR\n35 \nand R\n36 \nare independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl;\n\n\nR\n19 \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy, halo(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, and aryl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy;\n\n\nR\n20 \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, aryl, aryl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, and (C\n3\n-C\n8\n)cycloalkyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl;\n\n\nR\n23 \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, aryl, heterocyclyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, and (C\n3\n-C\n8\n)cycloalkyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl;\n\n\nR\n29 \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and heterocyclyl; and\n\n\nR\n30 \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, and (C\n3\n-C\n8\n)cycloalkyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl;\n\n\nwherein aryl, wherever it occurs, is optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of halo, hydroxy, cyano, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, halo(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, and (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy;\n\n\nwherein heterocyclyl, wherever it occurs, is optionally and independently substituted with one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of oxo, cyano, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, (C\n3\n-C\n8\n)cycloalkylaminocarbonyl, and (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkylsulfonyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention will be more carefully understood from the following description given by way of example only.

For a review on suitable salts, see \nHandbook of Pharmaceutical Salts Properties, Selection, and Use \nby Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, 2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I may be prepared by one or more of three methods: (i) by reacting the compound of formula I with the desired acid or base; (ii) by removing an acid- or base-labile protecting group from a suitable precursor of the compound of formula I or by ring-opening a suitable cyclic precursor, for example, a lactone or lactam, using the desired acid or base; or (iii) by converting one salt of the compound of formula I to another by reaction with an appropriate acid or base or by means of a suitable ion exchange column. All three reactions are typically carried out in solution. The resulting salt may precipitate out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionisation in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may exist in a continuum of solid states ranging from fully amorphous to fully crystalline. The term ‘amorphous’ refers to a state in which the material lacks long range order at the molecular level and, depending upon temperature, may exhibit the physical properties of a solid or a liquid. Typically such materials do not give distinctive X-ray diffraction patterns and, while exhibiting the properties of a solid, are more formally described as a liquid. Upon heating, a change from solid to liquid properties occurs which is characterised by a change of state, typically second order (glass transition'). The term ‘crystalline’ refers to a solid phase in which the material has a regular ordered internal structure at the molecular level and gives a distinctive X-ray diffraction pattern with defined peaks. Such materials when heated sufficiently will also exhibit the properties of a liquid, but the change from solid to liquid is characterised by a phase change, typically first order (‘melting point’).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. The term ‘solvate’ is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term ‘hydrate’ is employed when said solvent is water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA currently accepted classification system for organic hydrates is one that defines isolated site, channel, or metal-ion coordinated hydrates—see \nPolymorphism in Pharmaceutical Solids \nby K. R. Morris (Ed. H. G. Brittain, Marcel Dekker, 1995). Isolated site hydrates are ones in which the water molecules are isolated from direct contact with each other by intervening organic molecules. In channel hydrates, the water molecules lie in lattice channels where they are next to other water molecules. In metal-ion coordinated hydrates, the water molecules are bonded to the metal ion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water/solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included within the scope of the invention are multi-component complexes (other than salts and solvates) wherein the drug and at least one other component are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Complexes of this type include clathrates (drug-host inclusion complexes) and co-crystals. The latter are typically defined as crystalline complexes of neutral molecular constituents which are bound together through non-covalent interactions, but could also be a complex of a neutral molecule with a salt. Co-crystals may be prepared by melt crystallisation, by recrystallisation from solvents, or by physically grinding the components together—see Chem Commun, 17, 1889-1896, by O. Almarsson and M. J. Zaworotko (2004). For a general review of multi-component complexes, see J Pharm Sci, 64 (8), 1269-1288, by Haleblian (August 1975).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also exist in a mesomorphic state (mesophase or liquid crystal) when subjected to suitable conditions. The mesomorphic state is intermediate between the true crystalline state and the true liquid state (either melt or solution). Mesomorphism arising as the result of a change in temperature is described as ‘thermotropic’ and that resulting from the addition of a second component, such as water or another solvent, is described as ‘lyotropic’. Compounds that have the potential to form lyotropic mesophases are described as ‘amphiphilic’ and consist of molecules which possess an ionic (such as —COO\n−\nNa\n+\n, —COO\n−\nK\n+\n, or —SO\n3\n \n−\nNa\n+\n) or non-ionic (such as —N\n−\nN\n+\n(CH\n3\n)\n3\n) polar head group. For more information, see \nCrystals and the Polarizing Microscope \nby N. H. Hartshorne and A. Stuart, 4\nth \nEdition (Edward Arnold, 1970).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHereinafter all references to compounds of formula I include references to salts, solvates, multi-component complexes and liquid crystals thereof and to solvates, multi-component complexes and liquid crystals of salts thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention include compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined, including all polymorphs and crystal habits thereof, prodrugs and isomers thereof (including optical, geometric and tautomeric isomers) as hereinafter defined and isotopically-labeled compounds of formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs indicated, so-called ‘prodrugs’ of the compounds of formula I are also within the scope of the invention. Thus certain derivatives of compounds of formula I which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into compounds of formula I having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as ‘prodrugs’. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in \nPro\n-\ndrugs as Novel Delivery Systems\n, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T. Higuchi and W. Stella) and \nBioreversible Carriers in Drug Design\n, Pergamon Press, 1987 (Ed. E. B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of formula I with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as ‘pro-moieties’ as described, for example, in \nDesign of Prodrugs \nby H. Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include: (i) where the compound of formula I contains a carboxylic acid functionality (—COOH), an ester thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid functionality of the compound of formula (I) is replaced by (C\n1\n-C\n8\n)alkyl; (ii) where the compound of formula I contains an alcohol functionality (—OH), an ether thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the alcohol functionality of the compound of formula I is replaced by (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyloxymethyl; and (iii) where the compound of formula I contains a primary or secondary amino functionality (—NH\n2 \nor —NHR where R≠H), an amide thereof, for example, a compound wherein, as the case may be, one or both hydrogens of the amino functionality of the compound of formula I is/are replaced by (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkanoyl. Further examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references. Moreover, certain compounds of formula I may themselves act as prodrugs of other compounds of formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included within the scope of the invention are metabolites of compounds of formula I, that is, compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug. Some examples of metabolites in accordance with the invention include: (i) where the compound of formula I contains a methyl group, an hydroxymethyl derivative thereof (—CH\n3\n->—CH\n2\nOH): (ii) where the compound of formula I contains an alkoxy group, an hydroxy derivative thereof (—OR->—OH); (iii) where the compound of formula I contains a tertiary amino group, a secondary amino derivative thereof (—NR\n1\nR\n2\n->—NHR\n1 \nor —NHR\n2\n); (iv) where the compound of formula I contains a secondary amino group, a primary derivative thereof (—NHR\n1\n->—NH\n2\n); (v) where the compound of formula I contains a phenyl moiety, a phenol derivative thereof (-Ph->-PhOH); and (vi) where the compound of formula I contains an amide group, a carboxylic acid derivative thereof (—CONH\n2\n->COOH).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula I containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound of formula I contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cis/trans (or Z/E) isomers are possible. Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier, tautomeric isomerism (‘tautomerism’) can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds of formula I containing, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group, or so-called valence tautomerism in compounds which contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncluded within the scope of the present invention are all stereoisomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the compounds of formula I, including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, and mixtures of one or more thereof. Also included are acid addition or base salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, d-lactate or l-lysine, or racemic, for example, dl-tartrate or dl-arginine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCis/trans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallisation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound of formula I contains an acidic or basic moiety, a base or acid such as 1-phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% by volume of isopropanol, typically from 2% to 20%, and from 0 to 5% by volume of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen any racemate crystallises, crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound (true racemate) referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer. While both of the crystal forms present in a racemic mixture have identical physical properties, they may have different physical properties compared to the true racemate. Racemic mixtures may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art—see, for example, \nStereochemistry of Organic Compounds \nby E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen (Wiley, 1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of formula I wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number which predominates in nature. Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, such as \n2\nH and \n3\nH, carbon, such as \n11\nC, \n13\nC and \n14\nC, chlorine, such as \n36\nCl, fluorine, such as \n18\nF, iodine, such as \n123\nI and \n125\nI, nitrogen, such as \n13\nN and \n15\nN, oxygen, such as \n15\nO, \n17\nO and \n18\nO, phosphorus, such as \n32\nP, and sulphur, such as \n35\nS. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of formula I, for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. \n3\nH, and carbon-14, i.e. \n14\nC, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. \n2\nH, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n15\nO and \n13\nN, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically-labeled compounds of formula I can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D\n2\nO, d\n6\n-acetone, d\n6\n-DMSO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso within the scope of the invention are intermediate compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined, all salts, solvates and complexes thereof and all solvates and complexes of salts thereof as defined hereinbefore for compounds of formula I. The invention includes all polymorphs of the aforementioned species and crystal habits thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen preparing compounds of formula I in accordance with the invention, it is open to a person skilled in the art to routinely select the form of compound of formula I which provides the best combination of features for this purpose. Such features include the melting point, solubility, processability and yield of the intermediate form and the resulting ease with which the product may be purified on isolation.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nAlso provided are compositions which can be prepared by mixing one or more compounds described herein, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or tautomers thereof, with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, binders, diluents or the like, to treat or ameliorate a variety of JAK related conditions. The pharmaceutical compositions of the instant invention can be manufactured by methods well known in the art such as conventional granulating, mixing, dissolving, encapsulating, lyophilizing, emulsifying or levigating processes, among others. The compositions can be in the form of, for example, granules, powders, tablets, capsule syrup, suppositories, injections, emulsions, elixirs, suspensions or solutions. The instant compositions can be formulated for various routes of administration, for example, by oral administration, transmucosal administration, rectal administration, topical administration or subcutaneous administration as well as intrathecal, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intranasal, intraocular or intraventricular injection. The compound or compounds of the instant invention can also be administered in a local rather than a systemic fashion, such as injection as a sustained release formulation. The following dosage forms are given by way of example and should not be construed as limiting the instant invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor oral, buccal, and sublingual administration, powders, suspensions, granules, tablets, pills, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets are acceptable as solid dosage forms. These can be prepared, for example, by mixing one or more compounds of the instant invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or tautomers thereof, with at least one additive or excipient such as a starch or other additive. Suitable additives or excipients are sucrose, lactose, cellulose sugar, mannitol, maltitol, dextran, sorbitol, starch, agar, alginates, chitins, chitosans, pectins, tragacanth gum, gum arabic, gelatins, collagens, casein, albumin, synthetic or semi-synthetic polymers or glycerides, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone. Optionally, oral dosage forms can contain other ingredients to aid in administration, such as an inactive diluent, or lubricants such as magnesium stearate, or preservatives such as paraben or sorbic acid, or anti-oxidants such as ascorbic acid, tocopherol or cysteine, a disintegrating agent, binders, thickeners, buffers, sweeteners, flavoring agents or perfuming agents. Additionally, dyestuffs or pigments can be added for identification. Tablets and pills can be further treated with suitable coating materials known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration can be in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, syrups, elixirs, suspensions, slurries and solutions, which can contain an inactive diluent, such as water. Pharmaceutical formulations can be prepared as liquid suspensions or solutions using a sterile liquid, such as, but not limited to, an oil, water, an alcohol, and combinations of these. Pharmaceutically suitable surfactants, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, can be added for oral or parenteral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, suspensions can include oils. Such oils include, but are not limited to, peanut oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, olive oil and mixtures of oils. Suspension preparation can also contain esters of fatty acids such as ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, fatty acid glycerides and acetylated fatty acid glycerides. Suspension formulations can include alcohols, such as, but not limited to, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, hexadecyl alcohol, glycerol and propylene glycol. Ethers, such as but not limited to, poly(ethyleneglycol), petroleum hydrocarbons such as mineral oil and petrolatum; and water can also be used in suspension formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds may also be administered topically, (intra)dermally, or transdermally to the skin or mucosa. Typical formulations for this purpose include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, wafers, implants, sponges, fibres, bandages and microemulsions. Liposomes may also be used. Typical carriers include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Penetration enhancers may be incorporated—see, for example, J Pharm Sci, 88 (10), 955-958, by Finnin and Morgan (October 1999).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther means of topical administration include delivery by electroporation, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, sonophoresis and microneedle or needle-free (e.g. Powderject™, Bioject™, etc.) injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for topical administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor nasal administration, the pharmaceutical formulations can be a spray or aerosol containing and appropriate solvents and optionally other compounds such as, but not limited to, stabilizers, antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, pH modifiers, surfactants, bioavailablity modifiers and combinations of these. A propellant for an aerosol formulation can include compressed air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or a hydrocarbon based low boiling solvent. The compound or compounds of the instant invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from a nebulizer or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInjectable dosage forms generally include aqueous suspensions or oil suspensions which can be prepared using a suitable dispersant or wetting agent and a suspending agent. Injectable forms can be in solution phase or in the form of a suspension, which is prepared with a solvent or diluent. Acceptable solvents or vehicles include sterilized water, Ringer's solution, or an isotonic aqueous saline solution. Alternatively, sterile oils can be employed as solvents or suspending agents. Generally, the oil or fatty acid is non-volatile, including natural or synthetic oils, fatty acids, mono-, di- or tri-glycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor injection, the pharmaceutical formulation can be a powder suitable for reconstitution with an appropriate solution as described above. Examples of these include, but are not limited to, freeze dried, rotary dried or spray dried powders, amorphous powders, granules, precipitates, or particulates. For injection, the formulations can optionally contain stabilizers, pH modifiers, surfactants, bioavailability modifiers and combinations of these. The compounds can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection such as by bolus injection or continuous infusion. A unit dosage form for injection can be in ampoules or in multi-dose containers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor rectal administration, the pharmaceutical formulations can be in the form of a suppository, an ointment, an enema, a tablet or a cream for release of compound in the intestines, sigmoid flexure and/or rectum. Rectal suppositories are prepared by mixing one or more compounds of the instant invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or tautomers of the compound, with acceptable vehicles, for example, cocoa butter or polyethylene glycol, which is present in a solid phase at normal storing temperatures, and present in a liquid phase at those temperatures suitable to release a drug inside the body, such as in the rectum. Oils can also be employed in the preparation of formulations of the soft gelatin type and suppositories. Water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, and glycerols can be employed in the preparation of suspension formulations which can also contain suspending agents such as pectins, carbomers, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose or carboxymethyl cellulose, as well as buffers and preservatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBesides those representative dosage forms described above, pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and carries are generally known to those skilled in the art and are thus included in the instant invention. Such excipients and carriers are described, for example, in “Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences” Mack Pub. Co., New Jersey (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations of the invention can be designed for to be short-acting, fast-releasing, long-acting, and sustained-releasing. Thus, the pharmaceutical formulations can also be formulated for controlled release or for slow release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe instant compositions can also comprise, for example, micelles or liposomes, or some other encapsulated form, or can be administered in an extended release form to provide a prolonged storage and/or delivery effect. Therefore, the pharmaceutical formulations can be compressed into pellets or cylinders and implanted intramuscularly or subcutaneously as depot injections or as implants such as stents. Such implants can employ known materials such as silicones and biodegradable polymers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may contain, for example, from about 0.1% by weight, to about 90% or more by weight, of the active material, depending on the method of administration. Where the compositions comprise dosage units, each unit can contain, for example, from about 0.1 to 500 mg or more of the active ingredient. The dosage as employed for adult human treatment can range, for example, from about 0.1 to 1000 mg per day, depending on the route and frequency of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific dosages can be adjusted depending on conditions of the JAK related condition, the age, body weight, general health conditions, sex, and diet of the subject, dose intervals, administration routes, excretion rate, and combinations of drugs. Any of the above dosage forms containing effective amounts are well within the bounds of routine experimentation and therefore, well within the scope of the instant invention. Generally, the total daily dose can typically range from about 1 mg/kg/day to about 500 mg/kg/day in single or in divided doses. Typically, dosages for humans can range from about 5 mg to about 100 mg per day, in a single or multiple doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA therapeutically effective dose or amount can vary depending upon the route of administration and dosage form. Some compositions of the instant invention is a formulation that exhibits a high therapeutic index. The therapeutic index is the dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects which can be expressed as the ratio between LD\n50 \nand ED\n50\n. The LD\n50 \nis the dose lethal to 50% of the population and the ED\n50 \nis the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population. The LD\n50 \nand ED\n50 \ncan be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in animal cell cultures or experimental models.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical preparations of the JAK inhibitors, such as the compound (I), either from alone or in combination with one or more additional agents which may include but are not limited to cyclosporin A, rapamycin, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, micophenolate (e.g. Cellcept®, Myfortic®, etc.), azathioprine, brequinar, deoxyspergualin, leflunomide, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist (e.g. fingolimod, KRP-203, etc.), LEA-29Y, anti-IL-2 receptor antibody (e.g. daclizumab, etc.), anti-CD3 antibody (e.g. OKT3, etc.), Anti-T cell immunogloblin (e.g. AtGam, etc.), aspirin, CD28-B7 blocking molecules (e.g. Belatacept, Abatacept, etc.), CD40-CD154 blocking molecules (e.g. Anti-CD40 antibody, etc.), protein kinase C inhibitor (e. g. AEB-071, etc.), acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, piroxicam, methotrexate, an anti inflammatory steroid (e.g. prednisolone or dexamethasone) or those disclosed in PCT application no. PCT/IB2007/002468. These combinations can be administrated as part of the same or separate dosage forms, via the same or different routes of administration, and on the same or different administration schedules according to standard pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is an article of manufacture comprising a pharmaceutical composition comprising a provided compound contained within a packaging material and a label or package insert which indicates that said pharmaceutical composition can be used for treating a JAK related condition, as described herein.\n\n\n \nMethods of Treatment\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides methods of treating or preventing a condition associated with JAK in a subject, such as a mammal, i.e., a human or non-human mammal, comprising administering an effective amount of one or more compounds described herein to the subject. The JAK associated condition can be related to JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and/or Tyk2. Suitable non-human subjects that can be treated include domestic or wild animals, companion animals, such as dogs, cats and the like; livestock, including horses, cows and other ruminants, pigs, poultry, rabbits and the like; primates, for example monkeys, such as macaques including rhesus monkeys and cynomolgus (also known as crab-eating or long-tailed) monkeys, marmosets, tamarins and the like, apes, including chimpanzees and orangutans; and rodents, such as rats, mice, gerbils, guinea pigs and the like. In one embodiment, the compound is administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable form, optionally in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nJAK/STAT signaling has been implicated in the mediation of many abnormal immune responses such as allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases such as transplant (allograft) rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, as well as in solid and hematologic malignancies such as leukemia and lymphomas. For a review of the pharmaceutical intervention of the JAK/STAT pathway see Frank, (1999), Mol. Med. 5:432:456 and Seidel et al., (2000), Oncogene 19:2645-2656.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nJAK3 in particular has been implicated in a variety of biological processes. For example, the proliferation and survival of murine mast cells induced by IL-4 and IL-9 have been shown to be dependent on JAK3 and gamma chain-signaling. Suzuki et al., (2000), Blood 96:2172-2180. JAK3 also plays a crucial role in IgE receptor-mediated mast cell degranulation responses (Malaviya et al., (1999), Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 257:807-813), and inhibition of JAK3 kinase has been shown to prevent type I hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis (Malaviya et al., (1999), J. Biol. Chem. 274:27028-27038). JAK3 inhibition has also been shown to result in immune suppression for allograft rejection (Kirken, (2001), Transpl. Proc. 33:3268-3270). JAK3 kinases have also been implicated in the mechanism involved in early and late stages of rheumatoid arthritis (Muller-Ladner et al., (2000), J. Immunal. 164:3894-3901); familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Trieu et al., (2000), Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 267:22-25); leukemia (Sudbeck et al., (1999), Clin. Cancer Res. 5:1569-1582); mycosis fungoides, a form of T-cell lymphoma (Nielsen et al., (1997), Prac. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:6764-6769); and abnormal cell growth (Yu et al., (1997), J. Immunol. 159:5206-5210; Catlett-Falcone et al., (1999), Immunity 10:105-115).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe JAK kinases, including JAK3, are abundantly expressed in primary leukemic cells from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood cancer, and studies have correlated STAT activation in certain cells with signals regulating apoptosis (Demoulin et al., (1996), Mol. Cell. Biol. 16:4710-6; Jurlander et al., (1997), Blood 89:4146-52; Kaneko et al., (1997), Clin. Exp. Immun. 109:185-193; and Nakamura et al., (1996), J. Biol. Chem. 271: 19483-8). They are also known to be important to lymphocyte differentiation, function and survival. JAK-3 in particular plays an essential role in the function of lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells. Given the importance of this JAK kinase, compounds which modulate the JAK pathway, including those selective for JAK3, can be useful for treating conditions where the function of lymphocytes, macrophages, or mast cells is involved (Kudlacz et al., (2004) Am. J. Transplant 4:51-57; Changelian (2003) Science 302:875-878).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConditions in which targeting of the JAK pathway or modulation of the JAK kinases, particularly JAK3, are contemplated to be therapeutically useful include, arthritis, asthma, autoimmune diseases, cancers or tumors, diabetes, certain eye diseases, disorders or conditions, inflammation, intestinal inflammations, allergies or conditions, neurodegenerative diseases, psoriasis, transplant rejection, and viral infection.

The starting materials can be purchased or prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. Similarly, the preparation of the various intermediates can be achieved using methods known in the art. The starting materials may be varied and additional steps employed to produce compounds encompassed by the invention, as demonstrated by the examples below. In addition, different solvents and reagents can typically be used to achieve the above transformations. Furthermore, in certain situations, it may be advantageous to alter the order in which the reactions are performed. Protection of reactive groups may also be necessary to achieve the above transformations. In general, the need for protecting groups, as well as the conditions necessary to attach and remove such groups, will be apparent to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. When a protecting group is employed, deprotection will generally be required. Suitable protecting groups and methodology for protection and deprotection such as those described in \nProtecting Groups in Organic Synthesis \nby Greene and Wuts are known and appreciated in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein can be synthesized as set forth in the examples of the present application. The cyclic amines of the A ring can be obtained from a commercially available source such as Sigma Aldrich.\n\n\n \nGeneral Synthetic Procedure 1\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein can also be synthesized according to the following general Scheme I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some synthetic methods, functional groups may need to be protected and deprotected during synthesis of a compound of the invention. In the present application protecting groups are indicated by the letters Pg alone or with a numerical designation, such as Pg or Pg1. Those skilled in the art recognize that protection and deprotection of compounds can be achieved by conventional methods, for example as described in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis” by T W Greene and P G M Wuts, John Wiley & Sons Inc (1999), and references therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Scheme 1,4-Chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (a) can be obtained commercially (GL Synthesis, Inc., Worchester, Mass.). 4-[(Methylamino)-cyclohexyl]methanol (b) can be obtained from the corresponding carboxylic acid, 4-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, by treatment with a reducing agent, such as lithium aluminium hydride, which can occur in an aprotic, anhydrous solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran. Conversion of (a) to (b) can occur at a range of temperatures, typically between about 0 to 60° C. and completion of the reaction can take up to several hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Scheme I, a compound of structure (c) can be synthesized by the reaction of 4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (a) with 4-[(methylamino)-cyclohexyl]methanol (b) in a suitable solvent, such as a polar, aprotic solvent, for example N,N-dimethylformamide, aqueous dioxane and/or dimethylsulfoxide, in the presence of a suitable base, such as triethylamine and/or potassium carbonate. This reaction can occur at elevated temperatures up to about 90° C. and the reaction can occur for up to a few hours or longer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound of structure (d) can be synthesized from a compound of structure (c) as shown above. For example, a compound of structure (d) can be synthesized by using a brominating reagent, such as thionyl bromide or phosphorous tribromide, in a polar, aprotic solvent, such as methylene chloride, to afford an unprotected cyclohexylmethylbromide, and which can give the protected compound of structure (d) by addition of a suitable protecting reagent, such as tosyl chloride.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound of structure (e) can be prepared by using protection processes from a compound of structure (c). For example, when Pg and Pg1 are both tosyl, (e) can be prepared in a one step reaction upon treatment of the unprotected compound of structure (c) with tosyl chloride in the presence of a polar, aprotic solvent, such as methylene chloride, a catalyst, such as DMAP, and a weak base, such as triethylamine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound of structure (f) can be synthesized from a compound of structure (e) by S-alkylation using a suitable nucleophile. Thus compounds of structure (e), wherein the protecting group (Pg1) is a suitable hydroxyl protecting group such as tosyl or mesyl, can be reacted with potassium thioacetate in a polar solvent, such as dimethylsulfoxide or N-methylpyrrolidine, to give compounds of structure (f). This reaction can occur at elevated temperatures up to 75° C. and can take place for up to 2 hours or longer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound of structure (g) can be synthesized by an oxidation procedure from the compound of formula (f). The oxidation step is not critical to the present scheme, and many oxidizing conditions are known to those skilled in the art, for example those described in “Handbook of Reagents for Organic Synthesis—Oxidising and Reducing Agents” edited by S. D. Burke and R. L. Danheiser. In some embodiments, a compound of structure (f), optionally wetted with water, can be treated with formic acid followed by slow addition of hydrogen peroxide. Such a reaction can occur with stirring at room temperature, for a time up to about 15 hours or more, to give a compound of structure (g). Alternatively, Oxone® (DuPont) may be employed in a polar solvent such as acetic acid. In one embodiment, the reaction is performed in the presence of potassium acetate and the potassium salt of the compound of formula (g) is produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound of structure (g) can be synthesized directly from a compound of structure (e) upon treatment with a suitable sulfur nucleophile, such as sodium sulfite, in a polar solvent. Alternatively, a compound of structure (g) can be synthesized from a compound of structure (d) upon nucleophilic substitution with sodium sulfite.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment of sulphonic acids of formula (g) with a chlorinating agent, such as thionyl chloride, in a polar, aprotic solvent, such as methylene chloride, with a polar cosolvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, can provide the appropriate chlorinated compounds. This reaction can occur under reflux conditions. The chlorinated compound can then react in an aprotic, anhydrous solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, with a suitable amine, which can be in neat, gaseous form, or dissolved in an aprotic, anhydrous solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, to produce a compound of structure (h). In some embodiments, this reaction can occur at room temperature. Optionally an anhydrous, weak base, such as triethylamine, may be used to mop up hydrochloric acid generated in the reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula Ia of the present invention can be prepared from compounds of formula (h), wherein Pg is a suitable protecting group, by deprotection procedures known to those skilled in the art. For example, when the protecting group (Pg) is tosyl, suitable deprotection conditions involve reaction with a base, such as lithium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide in a protic solvent such as methanol or isopropanol and optionally miscible cosolvents such as tetrahydrofuran and water. This deprotection reaction can occur at about room temperature for several hours or more and thereby produce the deprotected amine of formula Ia.\n\n\n \nGeneral Synthetic Procedure 2\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein were synthesized according to the following general Scheme 2\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the Examples, Ts refers to a tosyl group, having the following structure where \n indicates the point of attachment:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep 1: To a 250 ml round bottom flask charged with ((1r,4r)-4-(methyl(7-tosyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)cyclohexyl)methanesulfonic acid (4.2 g, 8.75 mmol), dichloromethane (80 mL) and N,N′-dimethylformamide (300 μL), thionyl chloride (10 mL) was added slowly over 10 minutes at 22-28° C. (the reaction was exothermic and gas evolved during addition). The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 3 hours. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and stirred overnight under N\n2\n. Most of solvents were evaporated at reduced pressure and then at high vacuum for at least 2 hours to give a dry brown solid which was used immediately for the next step without any purification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep 2: 2 mL (125 μmol) of freshly prepared sulfonyl chloride from Step 1 (0.0625M) in anhydrous N,N′-dimethylformamide was added to vial charged with 200 μmol of the appropriate amine, R\n1\nR\n2\nNH, followed by 100 μL of triethylamine. After the reaction mixture was shaken at room temperature for 16 hours, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. A solution of 2 mL of 5% Na\n2\nCO\n3 \nand 2 mL of ethyl acetate were added to the vial. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged. The organic phase was collected and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep 3: Samples were re-dissolved in 1 mL of MeOH/THF/H2O (2/2/1, v/v/v). 0.1 mL of 2N lithium hydroxide (200 μmol) was added and the reaction mixtures were stirred at room temperature overnight.

The system was flushed with nitrogen and thionyl chloride (0.38 mL, 5.22 mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was heated at 40-45° C. for 2 hours, concentrated in vacuo and the residue was dissolved in chloroform (5 mL). Triethylamine (0.3 mL) was added followed by a solution of (3R)-3-pyrrolidinol (383 mg, 4.18 mmol) in chloroform (5 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred under nitrogen at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO\n3\n. The organic layer was washed with brine and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran (3 mL), methanol (3 mL) and water (1 mL). Lithium hydroxide (50 mg, 2.08 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was evaporated and water was added. The resulting precipitate was filtered and washed with water.

Tyk2 (His-Tyk2 (888-1182, C936S, C1142S)) used in this study was expressed and purified at Pfizer Laboratories. Adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) was obtained from (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.). The JAKtide peptide (peptide sequence, FITC-KGGEEEEYFELVKK) used for the JAK2 and JAK3 assays and the IRS-1 peptide (peptide sequence, 5-FAM-KKSRGDYMTMQIG) used for the JAK1 and Tyk2 assays were purchased from (American Peptide Company, Sunnyvale, Calif.). Coating Reagent 3 was purchased from (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, Mass.).\n\n\n \nMethods\n\n\n \n \n \nA peptide mobility shift assay was used to quantify the phosphorylation of the JAKtide (JAK2 and JAK3) or the IRS-1 peptide (JAK1 and Tyk2). Reactions were carried out in a 384-well plate (Matrical MP-101) in a 10 L total volume. Reaction mixtures contained 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.0005% Tween-20, ATP (4 M for JAK2 and JAK3, 40 M for JAK1 and 7 M for Tyk2)), 2% DMSO and 1 M peptide substrate (JAKtide for JAK2 and JAK3 and IRS-1 peptide for JAK1 and Tyk2). Compounds were diluted serially in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and tested in an 11 point dose response in duplicate or quadruplicate (200 nl of compound/DMSO was added per L reaction). The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the final concentration of 2 nM JAK2, 1 nM JAK3, 12 nM Tyk2 or 20 nM JAK1. The assay was run for 240 minutes for JAK1, 150 minutes for JAK2, 90 minutes for JAK3 and 70 minutes for Tyk2. The assays were stopped at the specified times with 20 uL of 140 mM HEPES, 22.5 mM EDTA and 0.15% Coating Reagent 3. The plates were placed on a LabChip 3000 (LC3000) instrument from (Caliper Life Sciences) to measure the formation of phosphorylated peptide. Data was analyzed using Hits Well Analyzer Software from (Caliper Life Sciences) to obtain the amount of product formed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData was then imported into an internal application where each data point is expressed as % inhibition based on uninhibited and no enzyme controls. Dose-response data is then fit using a 4 parameter logistic equation (Equation 1) to determine an IC\n50\n.\n\n\n \n

food and water ad libitum. Mice are immunized subcutaneously with 50 g of chicken type II collagen (Dr. Marie Griffiths, University of Utah) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), and boosted 21 days later with 50 g of the same antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). The compound is resuspended in 0.5% methylcellulose/0.025% Tween-20 (Sigma) containing 50 mM citric acid monohydrate, pH 3 (Fisher Scientific; Pittsburgh, Pa.). Mice are administered vehicle or varying doses of the compound by oral gavage, and disease is monitored daily beginning on day 35 post-immunization. Severity is scored on a scale of 0-3 in each paw (maximum score of 12/mouse), where 0=no symptoms, 1=redness or swelling of digits of the paw, 2=gross swelling or deformity of the whole paw, 3=ankylosis of the joint, and is expressed as the average severity score for each treatment group. Area under the curve (AUC) from a time course of disease severity is calculated for each dose of compound and percent of control activity is used as a measure of efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, reference to “a” or “an” means “one or more.” Throughout, the plural and singular should be treated as interchangeable, other than the indication of number.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be understood by one skilled in the art, for any and all purposes, particularly in terms of providing a written description, all ranges disclosed herein also encompass any and all possible subranges and combinations of subranges thereof as well as the individual values making up the range, particularly integer values. Any listed range can be easily recognized as sufficiently describing and enabling the same range being broken down into at least equal halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, tenths, etc. As a non-limiting example, each range discussed herein can be readily broken down into a lower third, middle third and upper third, etc. For example, the range C\n1\n-C\n6\n, includes the subranges C\n2\n-C\n6\n, C\n3\n-C\n6\n, C\n3\n-C\n5\n, C\n4\n-C\n6\n, etc., as well as C\n1 \n(methyl), C\n2 \n(ethyl), C\n3 \n(propyl), C\n4 \n(butyl), C\n5 \n(pentyl) and C\n6 \n(hexyl) individually. As will also be understood by one skilled in the art, all language such as “up to,” “at least,” “greater than,” “less than,” “more than,” “or more” and the like include the number recited and refer to ranges which can be subsequently broken down into subranges as discussed above. In the same manner, all ratios disclosed herein also include all subratios falling within the broader ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne skilled in the art will also readily recognize that where members are grouped together in a common manner, such as in a Markush group, the present invention encompasses not only the entire group listed as a whole, but each member of the group individually and all possible subgroups of the main group. Additionally, for all purposes, the present invention encompasses not only the main group, but also the main group absent one or more of the group members. The present invention also envisages the explicit exclusion of one or more of any of the group members in the claimed invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be understood by the skilled artisan, all numbers, including those expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth, are approximations and understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about.” These values can vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by those skilled in the art utilizing the present teachings of the present invention. It is also understood that such values inherently contain variability necessarily resulting from the standard deviations found in their respective testing measurements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above detailed description of embodiments is intended only to acquaint others skilled in the art with the invention, its principles, and its practical application so that others skilled in the art may adapt and apply the invention in its numerous forms, as they may be best suited to the requirements of a particular use. This invention, therefore, is not limited to the above embodiments, and may be variously modified."

Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to imidazoquinoline derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nThe immune system is comprised of innate and acquired immunity, both of which work cooperatively to protect the host from microbial infections. It has been shown that innate immunity can recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns through toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed on the cell surface of immune cells. Recognition of invading pathogens then triggers cytokine production (including interferon alpha (IFNα)) and upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules on phagocytes, leading to modulation of T cell function. Thus, innate immunity is closely linked to acquired immunity and can influence the development and regulation of an acquired response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTLRs are a family of type I transmembrane receptors characterized by an NH\n2\n-terminal extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain (LRR) and a COOH-terminal intracellular tail containing a conserved region called the Toll/IL1 receptor (TIR) homology domain. The extracellular domain contains a varying number of LRR, which are thought to be involved in ligand binding. Eleven TLRs have been described to date in humans and mice. They differ from each other in ligand specificities, expression patterns, and in the target genes they can induce.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigands which act via TLRs (also known as immune response modifiers (IRMS)) have been developed, for example, the imidazoquinoline derivatives described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,338 which include the product Imiquimod for treating genital warts, and the adenine derivatives described in WO 98/01448 and WO 99/28321.\n\n\n \nDISCLOSURE OF INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis patent application describes a class of imidazoquinoline compounds having immuno-modulating properties which act via TLR7 that are useful in the treatment of viral or allergic diseases and cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, there is therefore provided a compound of formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein\n\n\nR\n1 \nrepresents C\n1\n-C\n8 \nalkyl group, C\n3-8 \ncycloalkyl group, or a 3- to 8-membered saturated heterocyclic ring group comprising a O atom, wherein each of said groups is optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from halogen, cyano, hydroxyl and C\n1\n-C\n3 \nalkoxy;\n\n\nZ\n1 \nrepresents a C\n2\n-C\n6 \nalkylene, wherein a carbon atom in Z\n1 \nwhich is not adjacent to a nitrogen atom may be replaced with an oxygen atom;\n\n\nX\n1 \nrepresents NR\n5\n, >N—COR\n5\n, >N—CONR\n5\nR\n5a\n, CONR\n5\n, NR\n5\nCO, NR\n5\nCONR\n6 \nor NR\n6\nCONR\n5\n;\n\n\nY\n1 \nrepresents a single bond or C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkylene;\n\n\neach R\n2 \nis independently selected from halogen, cyano, hydroxy, thiol, C\n1\n-C\n3 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n3 \nhydroxyalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n3 \nhaloalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n3 \nalkoxy, C\n1\n-C\n3 \nhaloalkoxy,\n\n\nC\n1-3 \nalkylthio, C\n1-3 \nalkylsulfonyl and C\n1-3 \nalkylsulfinyl;\n\n\nR\n3 \nrepresents C\n1-6 \nalkyl optionally substituted by C\n1-6 \nalkoxy;\n\n\neach R\na \nis independently selected from halogen, cyano, hydroxy, thiol, C\n1\n-C\n3 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n3 \nhydroxyalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n3 \nhaloalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n3 \nalkoxy, C\n1\n-C\n3 \nhaloalkoxy, C\n1-3 \nalkylthio, C\n1-3 \nalkylsulfonyl and C\n1-3 \nalkylsulfinyl;\n\n\nR\n5 \nand R\n5a \neach independently represents hydrogen, a 3- to 8-membered saturated heterocyclic ring comprising a ring group O, S(O)\np \nor NR\n10\n, a C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl group or C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl group, the latter two groups being optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from NR\n7\nR\n8 \nor R\n9\n;\n\n\nR\n7 \nand R\n8 \neach independently represent hydrogen, a 3- to 8-membered saturated heterocyclic ring comprising a ring group O, S(O)\np \nor NR\n10a\n, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl or C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl, the latter two groups being optionally substituted by one or more groups independently selected from halogen, cyano, S(O)\nq\nR\n11\n, OR\n12\n, CO\n2\nR\n12\n, OC(O)R\n12\n, SO\n2\nNR\n12\nR\n13\n, CONR\n12\nR\n13\n, NR\n12\nR\n13\n, NR\n12\nSO\n2\nR\n14\n, NR\n12\nCOR\n13\n, or a 3- to 8-membered saturated heterocyclic ring comprising a ring group O, S(O)\np \nor NR\n10b\n,\n\n\nor R\n7 \nand R\n8 \ntogether with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a 3- to 8-membered saturated heterocyclic ring comprising a ring nitrogen atom and optionally one or more further heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur and sulphonyl, the heterocyclic ring being optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from halogen, cyano, S(O)\nq\nR\n15\n, OR\n15\n, CO\n2\nR\n15\n, COR\n15\n, OC(O)R\n15\n, SO\n2\nNR\n15\nR\n16\n, CONR\n15\nR\n16\n, NR\n15\nR\n16\n, NR\n15\nSO\n2\nR\n17\n, NR\n15\nCOR\n16\n, NR\n15\nCO\n2\nR\n16\n, heteroaryl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nhaloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n8 \ncycloalkyl and C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, the latter two groups being optionally substituted by one or more groups independently selected from cyano, S(O)\nq\nR\n18\n, OR\n18\n, CO\n2\nR\n18\n, SO\n2\nNR\n18\nR\n19\n, CONR\n18\nR\n19 \nor NR\n18\nR\n19\n;\n\n\nR\n9 \nrepresents halogen, cyano, CO\n2\nR\n20\n, S(O)\nq\nR\n20\n, OR\n20\n, SO\n2\nNR\n2\nOR\n22\n, CONR\n2\nOR\n22\n, NR\n20\nSO\n2\nR\n21\n, NR\n20\nCO\n2\nR\n21\n, NR\n20\nCOR\n22 \nor a 3- to 8-membered saturated heterocyclic ring comprising a ring group NR\n10c\n;\n\n\nR\n10\n, R\n10a\n, R\n10b \nand R\n10c \nindependently represent hydrogen, CO\n2\nR\n23\n, S(O)\nq\nR\n23\n, COR\n24\n, or a C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n6 \nalkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n6 \nalkynyl or C\n3\n-C\n8 \ncycloalkyl group, each of which may be optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from halogen, cyano, OR\n28 \nor NR\n25\nR\n26\n;\n\n\nR\n6\n, R\n11\n, R\n12\n, R\n13\n, R\n15\n, R\n16\n, R\n18\n, R\n19\n, R\n20\n, R\n22\n, R\n24\n, R\n25 \nand R\n26 \neach independently represent hydrogen, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl or C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl;\n\n\nR\n14\n, R\n17\n, R\n21 \nand R\n23 \neach independently represent C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl or C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl;\n\n\nm, n, p and q each independently represent an integer 0, 1 or 2;

They may for example contain from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Examples of C\n1\n-C\n8 \nalkyl groups/moieties include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl or n-octyl. Similarly, an alkylene group/moiety may be linear or branched. Examples of C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkylene groups/moieties include methylene, ethylene, n-propylene, n-butylene, n-pentylene, n-hexylene, 1-m ethylethylene, 2-methylethylene, 1,2-dimethylethylene, 1-ethylethylene, 2-ethylethylene, 1-, 2- or 3-methylpropylene and 1-, 2- or 3-ethylpropylene. An alkenyl or alkynyl group is an unsaturated linear or branched group, containing for example from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. It should be appreciated that, in formula (I), if more than one substituent contains a group or moiety S(O)\np \nor S(O)\nq \nor if a substituent contains two or more S(O)\np \nor S(O)\nq\n, then each “p” or each “q” independently represents an integer 0, 1 or 2. For example, if R\n7 \nrepresents a C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl group substituted by two groups S(O)\nq\nR\n11\n, then each “q” may be the same or different. In the same way, each group “R\n11\n”, where there is more than one such group, may be the same or different.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCycloalkyl or carbocycle groups are rings containing, for example, from 3 to 8 carbon atoms and are saturated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeterocyclic groups are rings which may be saturated, partially unsaturated or unsaturated, and contain from 3 to 20 atoms, at least one and suitably from 1 to 4 atoms are heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen. Rings may be monocyclic, fused, bridged, or spiro bicyclic heterocyclic ring system(s). Monocyclic heterocyclic rings contain from about 3 to 12 ring atoms, with from 1 to 5 heteroatoms selected from N, O and S, and suitably from 3 to 7 member atoms, in the ring. Bicyclic heterocycles contain from 7 to 17 member atoms, suitably 7 to 12 member atoms, in the ring. Bicyclic heterocyclic(s) rings may be fused, spiro, or bridged ring systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of heterocyclic groups which are saturated or partially saturated include cyclic ethers (oxiranes) such as ethyleneoxide, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and substituted cyclic ethers. Heterocycles containing nitrogen include, for example, azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine, tetrahydrotriazine, tetrahydropyrazole, and the like. Typical sulfur containing heterocycles include tetrahydrothiophene, dihydro-1,3-dithiol-2-yl, and hexahydrothiepin-4-yl. Other heterocycles include dihydro-oxathiol-4-yl, tetrahydro-oxazolyl, tetrahydro-oxadiazolyl, tetrahydrodioxazolyl, tetrahydro-oxathiazolyl, hexahydrotriazinyl, tetrahydro-oxazinyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, tetrahydropyrimidinyl, dioxolinyl, octahydrobenzofuranyl, octahydrobenzimidazolyl, and octahydrobenzothiazolyl. For heterocycles containing sulfur, the oxidized sulfur heterocycles containing SO or SO\n2 \ngroups are also included. Examples include the sulfoxide and sulfone forms of tetrahydrothiophene. A suitable value for a heterocyclyl group which bears 1 or oxo or thioxo substituents is, for example, 2-oxopyrrolidinyl, 2-thioxopyrrolidinyl, 2-oxoimidazolidinyl, 2-thioxoimidazolidinyl, 2-oxopiperidinyl, 2,5-dioxopyrrolidinyl, 2,5-dioxoimidazolidinyl or 2,6-dioxopiperidinyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeterocyclic groups which are aromatic in nature are referred to as “heteroaryl” groups. These groups are aromatic mono-, bi-, or polycyclic heterocyclic ring incorporating one or more (for example 1-4) heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S. The term heteroaryl includes both monovalent species and divalent species. Examples of heteroaryl groups include furyl, pyrrolyl, thienyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, 1,3,5-triazenyl, benzofuranyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, benzothienyl, benzoxazolyl, benzimidazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzothiazolyl, indazolyl, purinyl, benzofurazanyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, cinnolinyl, pteridinyl, naphthyridinyl, carbazolyl, phenazinyl, benzisoquinolinyl, pyridopyrazinyl, thieno[2,3-b]furanyl, 2H-furo[3,2-b]-pyranyl, 5H-pyrido[2,3-d]-o-oxazinyl, 1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]-oxazolyl, 4H-imidazo[4,5-d]thiazolyl, pyrazino[2,3-d]pyridazinyl, imidazo[2,1-b]thiazolyl, imidazo[1,2-b][1,2,4]triazinyl. “Heteroaryl” also covers ring systems wherein at least one ring is an aromatic ring containing 1 or more heteroatoms selected from O, S and N and one or more of the other rings is a non-aromatic, saturated or partially unsaturated ring optionally containing one or more heteroatoms selected from O, S and N, for example 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1,8-naphthyridinyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrido[2,3-b]pyrazinyl and 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrido[3,2-b][1,4]oxazinyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred heteroaryl group is a 5-7 member aromatic ring or 6,6- or 6,5-fused bicyclic ring containing one or more ring heteroatoms selected from N, S, O. Examples include pyridine, pyrimidine, thiazole, oxazole, pyrazole, imidazole, furan, isoxazole, pyrrole, isothiazole and azulene, naphthyl, indene, quinoline, isoquinoline, indole, indolizine, benzo[b]furan, benzo[b]thiophene, 1H-indazole, benzimidazole, benzthiazole, benzoxazole, purine, 4H-quinolizine, cinnoline, phthalazine, quinazoline, quinoxaline, 1,8-naphthyridine, pteridine and quinolone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment R\n1 \nrepresents a straight or branched chain C\n1-8 \nalkyl group optionally substituted by C\n1-3 \nalkoxy or hydroxy, for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, methoxymethyl, methoxyethyl or hydroxyethyl.

Suitable nitrating agents include nitric acid. The reaction is suitably effected in an organic solvent such as an organic acid such as propionic acid. The reaction may be carried out at elevated temperature, for example from room temperature to 150° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (C) may be prepared by reacting the compound of formula (B) with a mixture of thionyl chloride and DMF to give the aryl chloride which can then be displaced with an aminoalkanol. The chlorination is suitably carried out in a solvent such as dichloromethane, preferably at elevated temperature. The displacement of the chloride with an aminoalkanol, is suitably carried out in the presence of a base for example triethylamine or Hunigs base and in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, at a temperature in the range from 0 to 40° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (D) are prepared by adding a suitable protecting group to the hydroxy terminal group. This can be effected using conventional chemistry as outlined for example in ‘Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis’ by Theodora Green (publisher: John Wiley 85 Sons). A suitable protecting group P for the hydroxy group is, for example, an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl, or a silyl group for example tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (D) may also be prepared by adding a protected aminoalkanol to a compound of formula (B), using the same conditions as above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of formula (D) is then reduced to form a compound of formula (E). Suitable reducing agents include iron powder in a suitable solvent such as acetic acid or sodium borohydride in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as a 15% of nickel chloride in a suitable solvent such as methanol or hydrogenation. Suitable hydrogenation conditions include the use of hydrogen gas at elevated pressure, for example at 2-5 Bar in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as a 1% platinum on carbon catalyst. The reaction is suitably effected at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (E) are then cyclised to form the compound of formula (F). Suitable cyclisation conditions include reaction with an acid chloride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine in a suitable solvent such as N-methyl pyrrolidinone or an acid in the presence of a coupling reagent such as O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphat purum (HATU) in the presence of a base such as triethylamine in a suitable solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidine. Alternatively the compound of formula (F) may be prepared by cyclisation reaction with an orthoester in a suitable solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidinone in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as 10 mol % of toluensulphuric acid. The reaction is suitably effected at elevated temperatures, for example from 30-150° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (F) may be oxidised to compounds of formula (G) by reaction with an oxidising agent such as meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid or hydrogen peroxide. The reaction is suitably effected in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or ethanol at reduced temperatures for example in the range of −10° C. to room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubsequently, the compound of formula (G) is reacted with p-toluenesulphonyl chloride and aqueous ammonia to convert it to the compound of formula (H). The reaction is suitably effected in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane. Temperatures in the range from 0-40° C. and conveniently at room temperature are suitably employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDeprotection of the resultant compound of formula (H) yields a compound of formula (J). The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe product of formula (J) is then converted to a compound of formula (II) by formation of a suitable leaving group such as halo, for instance chloro or bromo, or an activated alcohol such as a mesylate or tosylate. For example, the chloride may be formed by reacting the compound of formula (J) with thionyl chloride, preferably in a solvent such as dichloromethane at a temperature between 20-40° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formulae (IV) and (IVA) may be prepared by an analogous route as illustrated in Scheme B.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere R\na\n, m, R\n3 \nand Z\n1 \nare as defined in relation to formula (I), R\n5b \nis as defined in relation to formula (IVA) and P\n1 \nis an amino protecting group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (K) or (L) may be prepared by reacting the compound of formula (B) with a mixture of thionyl chloride and DMF to give the aryl chloride which can then be displaced with a di-amino alkane, or a protected form thereof. The chlorination is suitably carried out in a solvent such as dichloromethane, preferably at elevated temperature. The displacement of the chloride with a di-amino alkane, or a protected form thereof, is suitably carried out in the presence of a base for example triethylamine or Hunigs base and in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, at a temperature in the range from 0 to 40° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere a diaminoalkane is used, a compound of formula (K) is prepared which may be subsequently protected to form a compound of formula (L) using conventional methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable protecting group P\n1 \nis for example, a group such as an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl. A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReduction of the product of formula (L) using for example analogous conditions to those described above for the reduction of the compound of formula (D), will yield a compound of formula (M). This in turn may be cyclised to a compound of formula (N) using conditions analogous to those described above for the cyclisation of the compound of formula (E), oxidised to a compound of formula (O) using conditions analogous to those described above for the oxidation of the compound of formula (F), and the product reacted with p-toluenesulphonyl chloride and aqueous ammonia to form the compound of formula (S) using for example conditions analogous to those described above for the preparation of the compound of formula (H).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDeprotection of the resultant compound of formula (S) yields a compound of formula (IV). The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an alkoxycarbonyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an alkoxycarbonyl group such as a t-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulfuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A phthaloyl protecting group which be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitably in Scheme B, R\n5 \nis hydrogen, which may be converted to a different R\n5 \ngroup later, for example once the compound of formula (IV) has been converted to a compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (VI) where X\n3 \nis NR\n5 \nmay be prepared by reacting compounds of formula (II) with compounds of formula (XI):\n\n\n \n \n \nR\n5\nNH\n2\n  (XI)\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCoupling Conditions Will be Similar to Those Described Above for the Reactions (a) and (c).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (I) may be converted to other compounds of formula (I) using conventional methods. For example, in process (h) above, compounds where R\n5 \nis hydrogen may be reacted with compounds of formula (X):\n\n\n \n \n \nL\n4\n-COR\n5\n  (X)\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwhere L\n4 \nis a leaving group such as halo for instance chloro, and R\n5 \nis defined in relation to formula (I). The reaction is suitably carried out in an organic solvent such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide and/or dichloromethane optionally in the presence of a base such as triethylamine. Temperatures in the range from 0 to 150° C. are suitably employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, oxidation of compounds of formula (I) during process (d) above can be carried out under conventional conditions, for example by reaction with an oxidising agent such as meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid or hydrogen peroxide. The reaction is suitably effected in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or ethanol at temperatures for example in the range of 0-40° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (IX) above where X\n4 \nis an activated acid such as an acid chloride are suitably prepared by a reaction as set out in Scheme C.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere R\na\n, m, R\n3 \nand Z\n1 \nare as defined in relation to formula (I), R\nx \nis an alkyl such as methyl or ethyl, or ester protecting group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConditions used for the reactions shown in Scheme C are generally similar to those used in analogous steps in Scheme B.

The activated acid is then treated with a compound of formula (III), the reaction may conveniently be carried out in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide, with a base such as triethylamine at a temperature, for example, in the range from 0 to 80° C.

Thus, the preparation of the compounds of formula (I) may involve, at an appropriate stage, the removal of one or more protecting groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protection and deprotection of functional groups is described in ‘Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry’, edited by J.

For example, the daily dosage of the compound of the invention, if inhaled, may be in the range from 0.05 micrograms per kilogram body weight (μg/kg) to 100 micrograms per kilogram body weight (μg/kg). For example, a dose of about 0.1 to 100 μg/kg such as a dose of about 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 or 100 μg/kg. Alternatively, if the compound is administered orally, then the daily dosage of the compound of the invention may be in the range from 0.01 micrograms per kilogram body weight (μg/kg) to 100 milligrams per kilogram body weight (mg/kg).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosages mentioned herein refer to the dose of Compound (1) as the free base. Accordingly, the equivalent dose of a particular salt will be higher because of the increased molecular weight of the salt compared to the free base.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be used on their own but will generally be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition in which the formula (I) compound/salt (active ingredient) is in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable pharmaceutical formulations are described in, for example, “Pharmaceuticals—The Science of Dosage Form Designs”, M. E. Aulton, Churchill Livingstone, 1988.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will preferably comprise from 0.05 to 99% w (percent by weight), more preferably from 0.05 to 80% w, still more preferably from 0.10 to 70% w, and even more preferably from 0.10 to 50% w, of active ingredient, all percentages by weight being based on total composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore defined, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention which comprises mixing a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore defined with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be administered topically (including to the skin, eye, buccal cavity, respiratory tract or nasally) in the form, e.g., of creams, solutions, suspensions, heptafluoroalkane (HFA) aerosols and dry powder formulations, for example, formulations administered from a suitable device such as a pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI), a dry powder inhaler (DPI) or nebuliser, such as the inhaler device known as the Turbuhaler™; or systemically, e.g. by oral administration in the form of tablets, capsules, syrups, powders or granules; or by parenteral administration in the form of a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion for injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion); or by rectal administration in the form of suppositories.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDry powder formulations and pressurized HFA aerosols of the compounds of the invention (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts) may be administered by oral or nasal inhalation. For inhalation, the compound is desirably finely divided. The finely divided compound preferably has a mass median diameter of less than 10 micrometres (μm), and may be suspended in a propellant mixture with the assistance of a dispersant, such as a C\n8\n-C\n20 \nfatty acid or salt thereof, (for example, oleic acid), a bile salt, a phospholipid, an alkyl saccharide, a perfluorinated or polyethoxylated surfactant, or other pharmaceutically acceptable dispersant. For nasal administration the compound is suitably dissolved in an aqueous medium, which is suitably buffered to maintain the pH at a desired level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered by means of a dry powder inhaler. The inhaler may be a single or a multi dose inhaler, and may be a breath actuated dry powder inhaler.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne possibility is to mix the finely divided compound of the invention with a carrier substance, for example, a mono-, di- or polysaccharide, a sugar alcohol, or another polyol. Suitable carriers are sugars, for example, lactose, glucose, raffinose, melezitose, lactitol, maltitol, trehalose, sucrose, mannitol; and starch. Alternatively the finely divided compound may be coated by another substance. The powder mixture may also be dispensed into hard gelatine capsules, each containing the desired dose of the active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother possibility is to process the finely divided powder into spheres which break up during the inhalation procedure. This spheronized powder may be filled into the drug reservoir of a multidose inhaler, for example, that known as the Turbuhaler™ in which a dosing unit meters the desired dose which is then inhaled by the patient. With this system the active ingredient, with or without a carrier substance, is delivered to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor oral administration the compound of the invention may be admixed with an adjuvant or a carrier, for example, lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol; a starch, for example, potato starch, corn starch or amylopectin; a cellulose derivative; a binder, for example, gelatine or polyvinylpyrrolidone; and/or a lubricant, for example, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, polyethylene glycol, a wax, paraffin, and the like, and then compressed into tablets. If coated tablets are required, the cores, prepared as described above, may be coated with a concentrated sugar solution which may contain, for example, gum arabic, gelatine, talcum and titanium dioxide. Alternatively, the tablet may be coated with a suitable polymer dissolved in a readily volatile organic solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the preparation of soft gelatine capsules, the compound of the invention may be admixed with, for example, a vegetable oil or polyethylene glycol. Hard gelatine capsules may contain granules of the compound using either the above-mentioned excipients for tablets. Also liquid or semisolid formulations of the compound of the invention may be filled into hard gelatine capsules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid preparations for oral application may be in the form of syrups or suspensions, for example, solutions containing the compound of the invention, the balance being sugar and a mixture of ethanol, water, glycerol and propylene glycol. Optionally such liquid preparations may contain colouring agents, flavouring agents, saccharine and/or carboxymethylcellulose as a thickening agent or other excipients known to those skilled in art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered in conjunction with other compounds used for the treatment of the above conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention therefore further relates to combination therapies wherein a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition or formulation comprising a compound of the invention is administered concurrently or sequentially or as a combined preparation with another therapeutic agent or agents, for the treatment of one or more of the conditions listed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases COPD, asthma and allergic rhinitis the compounds of the invention may be combined with agents such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors such as anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies (for example Remicade, CDP-870 and adalimumab) and TNF receptor immunoglobulin molecules (such as Enbrel);

MS:ESI 633 (M+1)\n\n\n \nBiological Assay\n\n\nHuman TLR7 Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe most common variant sequence of human TLR7 (represented by the EMBL sequence AF240467) was cloned into the mammalian cell expression vector pUNO and transfected into a HEK293 cell line already stably expressing the pNiFty2-SEAP reporter plasmid; integration of the reporter gene was maintained by selection with the antibiotic zeocin. Transfectants with stable TLR7 expression were selected using the antibiotic blasticidin. In this reporter cell-line, expression of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) is controlled by an NFkB/ELAM-1 composite promoter comprising five NFkB sites combined with the proximal ELAM-1 promoter. TLR signaling leads to the translocation of NFkB and activation of the promoter results in expression of the SEAP gene. TLR7-specific activation was assessed by determining the level of SEAP produced following overnight incubation of the cells at 37° C. with the standard compound in the presence of 0.1% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Concentration dependent induction of SEAP production by compounds was expressed as the concentration of compound which produced half of the maximal level of SEAP induction for that compound

Accordingly, in one embodiment according to the invention there is provided a compound of the formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as described herein other than the compounds:\n\n \n \n \nEthyl 2-(31(N-(2-(4-amino-2-(2-methoxyethyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl)ethyl)-2-(diethylamino)acetamido)methyl)phenoxy)acetate;\n \nMethyl 2-(31(N-(2-(4-amino-2-(2-methoxyethyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl)ethyl)-2-(diethylamino)acetamido)methyl)phenoxy)acetate;\n \nIsopropyl 2-(3-((N-(2-(4-amino-2-(2-methoxyethyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl)ethyl)-2-(diethylamino)acetamido)methyl)phenoxy)acetate;\n \nEthyl 2-(3-((N-(2-(4-amino-2-(2-methoxyethyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl)ethyl)-2-(diethylamino)acetamido)methyl)phenoxy)-2-methylpropanoate; and Methyl 2-(3-((N-(2-(4-amino-2-(2-methoxyethyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl)ethyl)-2-(diethylamino)acetamido)methyl)phenoxy)-2-methylpropanoate.\n \n\n\nEffect of the Compounds on Antigen-Induced Pulmonary Inflammation in a Rat Asthma Model\n\n\n \n \n \nRats were sensitized and challenged to produce allergic airway inflammation in a similar manner to that described by Underwood et al (British Journal of Pharmacology 2002; 137: 263-275, 2002). Male Brown Norway rats were sensitized subcutaneously with ovalbumin (OVA) and aluminum hydroxide on day 0, and challenged with aerosolized OVA solution on day 14. The test compound was administered twice intratracheally 24 hours before and 24 hours after the OVA-challenge and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected 48 hours after the OVA-challenge. Then eosinophils and Th2 cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13) in the BALF were measured to evaluate efficacy of the test compounds of this invention. The results obtained are shown in the following table.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEosinophils and Th2 cytokines in BALF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds\n\n\nDose(mg/kg)\n\n\nEosinophiles\n\n\nIL-5\n\n\nIL-13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n(n = 6)\n\n\n53%\n\n\n66%\n\n\n89%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.0\n\n\n(n = 6)\n\n\n77%\n\n\n72%\n\n\n85%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 20\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n(n = 6)\n\n\n14%\n\n\nNo effect\n\n\nNo effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.1\n\n\n(n = 5)\n\n\n56%\n\n\nNo effect\n\n\n22%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 27\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n(n = 5)\n\n\n64%\n\n\n41%\n\n\n72%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n(n = 5)\n\n\n89%\n\n\n90%\n\n\n88%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 56\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n(n = 4)\n\n\n78%\n\n\n86%\n\n\n89%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.0\n\n\n(n = 6)\n\n\n94%\n\n\n99%\n\n\n98%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 80\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n(n = 5)\n\n\n15%\n\n\nNo effect\n\n\nNo effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n(n = 5)\n\n\n89%\n\n\n91%\n\n\n83%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 94\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n(n = 6)\n\n\n68%\n\n\n34%\n\n\n50%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n(n = 6)\n\n\n91%\n\n\n90%\n\n\n82%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 161\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n(n = 8)\n\n\n54%\n\n\nNT\n\n\nNo effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.3\n\n\n(n = 8)\n\n\n66%\n\n\nNT\n\n\n64%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 163\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n(n = 8)\n\n\n45%\n\n\nNT\n\n\n50%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.3\n\n\n(n = 8)\n\n\n65%\n\n\nNT\n\n\n80%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Eosinophil(Cells/BALF), IL-5(pg/mL BALF) and IL-13(pg/mL BALF): data shows inhibition (%) to OVA-Challenge control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“No effect” in the Table means that the test compound showed the almost same level of IL-5/IL-13 induction as the OVA-challenge control."
