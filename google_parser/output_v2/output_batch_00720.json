(canceled) Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to an anti-CGRP antibody for use in the prevention and/or treatment of chronic pain and/or symptoms of chronic pain, and to a method of treating and/or preventing chronic pain and/or symptoms of chronic pain using an anti-CGRP antibody.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nChronic pain is a long lasting pain that persists longer than the temporal course of natural healing of the underlying causative injury or disease. It serves no beneficial or protective function and an estimated 2.7 million people in the UK are invalided due to chronic pain conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancer pain is one of the most common types of chronic pain and demonstrates nociceptive components due to tumour growth and neuropathic components due to tumour induced nerve damage. It further involves structural damage, nerve entrapment and damage, inflammatory processes which lead to the disruption of normal tissue metabolism, the production of inflammatory prostaglandins and cytokines, and tissue damage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo date, the main analgesics employed for treatment of chronic pain are opiates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Both classes of drugs can produce severe side-effects; NSAIDS can cause gastric ulceration and renal damage, opiates can cause nausea, constipation, confusion and dependency problems. Opioids fail to produce pain relief in all individuals suffering chronic pain, even at high doses and development of analgesic resistance to opioids complicates their utility for long term therapy. In particular cancer pain treatment requires the use of unacceptably high levels of opiates bringing with it side-effects and at least 20% of treated patients still have uncontrolled pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, there is a critical medical need to identify new pharmaceutically active compounds that interfere with key steps of the chronic pain process and particularly for the treatment and/or prevention of chronic nociceptive pain and/or symptoms of chronic nociceptive pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly we have found that administration of an anti-CGRP antibody is effective, with a peripheral site of action, in the prevention and/or treatment of chronic pain and in particular chronic nociceptive pain such as cancer pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) is a 37 amino acid neuropeptide which acts as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It binds with high affinity to the CGRP receptor, Calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR), activating adenylate cyclase and protein kinase A production.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCentrally penetrating spinally administered, small molecule selective CGRP antagonists have been shown to be useful in the treatment of neuropathic and nociceptive pain conditions (Adwanikar et al, Pain 2007) suggesting that removal of endogenous CGRP in the spinal cord has an antinociceptive effect. Additionally intrathecal administration of antiserum against CGRP has been shown to reduce nociceptive behaviour in rodent models of arthritis (Kuraishi, Y., et. al Neurosci. lett (1998) 92, 325-329).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly we have found that administration of an anti-CGRP antibody is effective, with a peripheral site of action, in the prevention and/or treatment of chronic pain and in particular chronic nociceptive pain when administered peripherally. This peripheral administration route provides a distinct advantage over the requirement to administer antibodies intrathecally or spinally, a more high risk and inconvenient procedure.\n\n\n \nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides the use of an anti-CGRP antagonist antibody for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention and/or treatment of chronic pain and/or symptoms of chronic pain, wherein the medicament is prepared to be peripherally administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides a method of prevention and/or treatment of chronic pain and/or symptoms of chronic pain, in an individual, which comprises peripherally administering to said individual a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-CGRP antagonist antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the anti-CGRP antagonist antibody acts peripherally on administration.\n\n\n \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n.

Lippincott Company, 1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDefinitions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn âantibodyâ is an immunoglobulin molecule capable of specific binding to a target, such as a carbohydrate, polynucleotide, lipid, polypeptide, etc., through at least one antigen recognition site, located in the variable region of the immunoglobulin molecule. As used herein, the term encompasses not only intact polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, but also fragments thereof (such as Fab, Fabâ², F(abâ²)\n2\n, Fv, dAb), single chain antibodies (ScFv), mutants thereof, chimeric antibodies, diabodies, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, and any other modified configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that comprises an antigen recognition site. An antibody includes an antibody of any class, such as IgG, IgA, or IgM (or sub-class thereof), and the antibody need not be of any particular class. Depending on the antibody amino acid sequence of the constant domain of its heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâFvâ is an antibody fragment that contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. In a two-chain Fv species, this region consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv species, one heavy and one light chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a dimeric structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding specificity on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. However, even a single variable domain (or half of a Fv comprising only 3 CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although generally at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge regions. A F(ab)2 fragment is a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody can have one or more binding sites (for combining with antigen). If there is more than one binding site, the binding sites may be identical to one another or may be different. For instance, a naturally-occurring immunoglobulin has two identical binding sites, a single chain antibody or Fab fragment has one binding site, while a âbispecificâ or âbifunctionalâ antibody (diabody) has two different binding sites, in terms of sequence and/or antigen/epitope recognition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn âisolated antibodyâ is an antibody that (1) is not associated with naturally-associated components, including other naturally-associated antibodies, that accompany it in its native state, (2) is free of other proteins from the same species, (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, or (4) does not occur in nature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âmonoclonal antibodyâ refers to a homogeneous antibody population wherein the monoclonal antibody is comprised of amino acids (naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring) that are involved in the selective binding of an antigen. A population of monoclonal antibodies is highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. The term âmonoclonal antibodyâ encompasses not only intact monoclonal antibodies and full-length monoclonal antibodies, but also fragments thereof (such as Fab, Fabâ², F(abâ²)\n2\n, Fv), single chain (ScFv), mutants thereof, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, and any other modified configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that comprises an antigen recognition site of the required specificity and the ability to bind to an antigen. It is not intended to be limited as regards to the source of the antibody or the manner in which it is made (e.g., by hybridoma, phage selection, recombinant expression, transgenic animals, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âhumanizedâ antibodies refer to forms of non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies that are specific chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains, or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fabâ², F(abâ²)2 or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementarity determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity, and biological activity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, the humanized antibody may comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences, but are included to further refine and optimize antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region or domain (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Antibodies may have Fc regions modified as described in WO 99/58572. Other forms of humanized antibodies have one or more CDRs (one, two, three, four, five, six) which are altered with respect to the original antibody, which are also termed one or more CDRs âderived fromâ one or more CDRs from the original antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âhuman antibodyâ means an antibody having an amino acid sequence corresponding to that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies known in the art or disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody includes antibodies comprising at least one human heavy chain polypeptide or at least one human light chain polypeptide. One such example is an antibody comprising murine light chain and human heavy chain polypeptides. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art. In one embodiment, the human antibody is selected from a phage library, where that phage library expresses human antibodies (Vaughan et al., 1996, Nature Biotechnology, 14:309-314; Sheets et al., 1998, PNAS, (USA) 95:6157-6162; Hoogenboom and Winter, 1991, J. Mol. Biol., 227:381; Marks et al., 1991, J. Mol. Biol., 222:581). Human antibodies can also be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. This approach is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; and 5,661,016. Alternatively, the human antibody may be prepared by immortalizing human B lymphocytes that produce an antibody directed against a target antigen (such B lymphocytes may be recovered from an individual or may have been immunized in vitro). See, e.g., Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985); Boerner et al., 1991, J. Immunol., 147 (1):86-95; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,373.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA single chain antibody (scFc) is an antibody in which VL and VH regions are paired to form a monovalent molecule via a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain (Bird et al Science, 242: 423-426 (1988) and Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:5879-5883 (1988)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabodies are bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is tooshort to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâChimeric antibodiesâ refers to those antibodies wherein one portion of each of the amino acid sequences of heavy and light chains is homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular class, while the remaining segment of the chains is homologous to corresponding sequences in another. Typically, in these chimeric antibodies, the variable region of both light and heavy chains mimics the variable regions of antibodies derived from one species of mammals, while the constant portions are homologous to the sequences in antibodies derived from another. One clear advantage to such chimeric forms is that, for example, the variable regions can conveniently be derived from presently known sources using readily available hybridomas or B cells from non human host organisms in combination with constant regions derived from, for example, human cell preparations. While the variable region has the advantage of ease of preparation, and the specificity is not affected by its source, the constant region being human, is less likely to elicit an immune response from a human subject when the antibodies are injected than would the constant region from a non-human source. However, the definition is not limited to this particular example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âfunctional Fc regionâ possesses at least one effector function of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary âeffector functionsâ include C1q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down-regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor; BCR), etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain (e.g. an antibody variable domain) and can be assessed using various assays known in the art for evaluating such antibody effector functions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA ânative sequence Fc regionâ comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. A âvariant Fc regionâ comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification, yet retains at least one effector function of the native sequence Fc region. Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80% sequence identity with a native sequence Fc region and/or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide, and most preferably at least about 90% sequence identity therewith, more preferably at least about 95% sequence identity therewith.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein âantibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicityâ and âADCCâ refer to a cell-mediated reaction in which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc receptors (FcRs) (e.g. natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. ADCC activity of a molecule of interest can be assessed using an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and NK cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al., 1998, PNAS (USA), 95:652-656.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âFc receptorâ and âFcRâ describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcÎ³RI, FcÎ³RII, and FcÎ³RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. FcÎ³RII receptors include FcÎ³RIIA (an âactivating receptorâ) and FcÎ³RIIB (an âinhibiting receptorâ), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, 1991, Ann. Rev. Immunol., 9:457-92; Capel et al., 1994, Immunomethods, 4:25-34; and de Haas et al., 1995, J. Lab. Clin. Med., 126:330-41. âFcRâ also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., 1976, J. Immunol., 117:587; and Kim et al., 1994, J. Immunol., 24:249).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâComplement dependent cytotoxicityâ and âCDCâ refer to the lysing of a target in the presence of complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (C1q) to a molecule (e.g. an antibody) complexed with a cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 202:163 (1996), may be performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms âG1â and âantibody G1â are used interchangeably to refer to an antibody produced by the expression vectors having deposit numbers ATCC-PTA-6867 and ATCC-PTA-6866. The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain and light chain variable regions are shown in SEQ ID Nos. 1 and 2. The CDR portions of antibody G1 (including Chothia and Kabat CDRs) are diagrammatically depicted in FIG. 5 of WO2007/054809, the content of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The polynucleotides encoding the heavy and light chain variable regions are shown in SEQ ID Nos,. 9 and 10. The characterization of antibody G1 is described in the Examples of WO2007/054809, the entire content of which is herein incorporated by reference. G1 is a humanized monoclonal blocking antibody (IgG2) which blocks binding and activity of the neuropeptide CGRP (a and b) and its effect of neurogenic vasodilatation caused by CGRP release. G1 is an IgG2Îa monoclonal anti-CGRP antagonist antibody derived from the murine anti-CGRP antagonist antibody precursor, denoted muMAb7E9 as identified in a screen using spleen cells prepared from a mouse immunized with human and rat CGRP that were fused with murine plasmacytoma cells. G1 was created by grafting the muMAb 7E9 derived CDRs of light and heavy chain into the closest human germ line sequence followed by the introduction of at least 1 mutation into each CDR and 2 framework mutations in V\nH\n. Two mutations were introduced into the Fc domain of G1 to suppress human Fc-receptor activation. G1 and muMab7E9 have been shown to recognise the same epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms âG2â and âantibody G2â are used interchangeably to refer to an anti-rat CGRP mouse monoclonal antibody as described in Wong H C et al. Hybridoma 12:93-106 (1993). The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain and light chain variable regions are shown in SEQ ID Nos. 19 and 20. The polynucleotides encoding the heavy and light chain variable regions are shown in SEQ ID Nos. 27 and 28. The CDR portions of antibody G2 are provided in SEQ ID Nos. 21 to 26. G2 has been shown to recognise the same epitope as G1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âimmunospecificâ binding of antibodies refers to the antigen specific binding interaction that occurs between the antigen-combining site of an antibody and the specific antigen recognized by that antibody (i.e., the antibody reacts with the protein in an ELISA or other immunoassay, and does not react detectably with unrelated proteins).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn epitope that âspecifically bindsâ, or âpreferentially bindsâ (used interchangeably herein) to an antibody or a polypeptide is a term well understood in the art, and methods to determine such specific or preferential binding are also well known in the art. A molecule is said to exhibit âspecific bindingâ or âpreferential bindingâ if it reacts or associates more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration and/or with greater affinity with a particular cell or substance than it does with alternative cells or substances. An antibody âspecifically bindsâ or âpreferentially bindsâ to a target if it binds with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other substances. It is also understood by reading this definition that, for example, an antibody (or moiety or epitope) that specifically or preferentially binds to a first target may or may not specifically or preferentially bind to a second target. As such, âspecific bindingâ or âpreferential bindingâ does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding. Generally, but not necessarily, reference to binding means preferential binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms âpolypeptideâ, âoligopeptideâ, âpeptideâ and âproteinâ are used interchangeably herein to refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. The polymer may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and it may be interrupted by non-amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling component. Also included within the definition are, for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid (including, for example, unnatural amino acids, etc.), as well as other modifications known in the art. It is understood that, because the polypeptides of this invention are based upon an antibody, the polypeptides can occur as single chains or associated chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâPolynucleotide,â or ânucleic acid,â as used interchangeably herein, refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present, modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after polymerization, such as by conjugation with a labeling component. Other types of modifications include, for example, âcapsâ, substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, cabamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, ply-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid supports. The 5â² and 3â² terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping groups moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2â²-O-methyl-, 2â²-O-allyl, 2â²-fluoro- or 2â²-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, Î±-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs and abasic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O)S(âthioateâ), P(S)S (âdithioateâ), â(O)NR\n2 \n(âamidateâ), P(O)R, P(O)ORâ², CO or CH\n2 \n(âformacetalâ), in which each R or Râ² is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (âOâ) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âvariable regionâ of an antibody refers to the variable region of the antibody light chain or the variable region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combination. The variable regions of the heavy and light chain each consist of four framework regions (FR) connected by three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) also known as hypervariable regions. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies. There are at least two techniques for determining CDRs: (1) an approach based on cross-species sequence variability (i.e., Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, (5th ed., 1991, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Md.)); and (2) an approach based on crystallographic studies of antigen-antibody complexes (Chothia et al. (1989) Nature 342:877; Al-lazikani et al (1997) J. Molec. Biol. 273:927-948)). As used herein, a CDR may refer to CDRs defined by either approach or by a combination of both approaches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âconstant regionâ of an antibody refers to the constant region of the antibody light chain or the constant region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an âanti-CGRP antagonist antibodyâ (interchangeably termed âanti-CGRP antibodyâ) refers to an antibody which is able to bind to CGRP and inhibit CGRP biological activity and/or downstream pathway(s). An anti-CGRP antagonist antibody encompasses antibodies that block, antagonize, suppress or reduce (including significantly) CGRP biological activity. For purpose of the present invention, it will be explicitly understood that the term âanti-CGRP antagonist antibodyâ encompass all the previously identified terms, titles, and functional states and characteristics whereby the CGRP itself, a CGRP biological activity, or the consequences of the biological activity, are substantially nullified, decreased, or neutralized in any meaningful degree. Examples of anti-CGRP antagonist antibodies are provided herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âsubstantially pureâ refers to material which is at least 50% pure (i.e., free from contaminants), more preferably at least 90% pure, more preferably at least 95% pure, more preferably at least 98% pure, more preferably at least 99% pure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âhost cellâ includes an individual cell or cell culture that can be or has been a recipient for vector(s) for incorporation of polynucleotide inserts. Host cells include progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily be completely identical (in morphology or in genomic DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation. A host cell includes cells transfected in vivo with a polynucleotide(s) of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âtreatmentâ is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired clinical results. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: improvement or alleviation of any aspect of chronic pain and/or symptom of chronic pain. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: including lessening severity, alleviation of pain and/or a symptom associated with chronic pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn âeffective amountâ of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results including clinical results such as alleviation or reduction in pain sensation. An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective amount of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to treat, ameliorate, reduce the intensity of and/or prevent chronic pain or symptom associated with chronic pain. As is understood in the clinical context, an effective amount of a drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or may not be achieved in conjunction with another drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an âeffective amountâ may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable result may be or is achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, âprepared forâ herein means the medicament is in the form of a dosage unit or the like suitably packaged and/or marked for use in peripheral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâReducing incidenceâ of chronic pain and/or a symptom associated with chronic pain means any of reducing severity (which can include reducing need for and/or amount of (e.g., exposure to) other drugs and/or therapies generally used for these conditions), duration, and/or frequency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâAmelioratingâ chronic pain and/or a symptom associated with chronic pain means a lessening or improvement of one or more symptoms of chronic pain and/or symptoms associated with chronic pain as compared to not administering an anti-CGRP antagonist antibody. âAmelioratingâ also includes shortening or reduction in duration of a symptom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâPalliatingâ chronic pain and/or a symptom associated with chronic pain means lessening the extent of one or more undesirable clinical manifestations of chronic pain in an individual or population of individuals treated with an anti-CGRP antagonist antibody in accordance with the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used therein, âdelayingâ the development of chronic pain means to defer, hinder, slow, retard, stabilize, and/or postpone progression of chronic pain and/or a symptom associated with chronic pain. This delay can be of varying lengths of time, depending on the history of the disease and/or individuals being treated. As is evident to one skilled in the art, a sufficient or significant delay can, in effect, encompass prevention, in that the individual does not develop chronic pain. A method that âdelaysâ development of the symptom is a method that reduces probability of developing the symptom in a given time frame and/or reduces extent of the symptoms in a given time frame, when compared to not using the method. Such comparisons are typically based on clinical studies, using a statistically significant number of subjects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âbiological sampleâ encompasses a variety of sample types obtained from an individual and can be used in a diagnostic or monitoring assay. The definition encompasses blood and other liquid samples of biological origin, solid tissue samples such as a biopsy specimen or tissue cultures or cells derived therefrom, and the progeny thereof. The definition also includes samples that have been manipulated in any way after their procurement, such as by treatment with reagents, solubilization, or enrichment for certain components, such as proteins or polynucleotides, or embedding in a semi-solid or solid matrix for sectioning purposes. The term âbiological sampleâ encompasses a clinical sample, and also includes cells in culture, cell supernatants, cell lysates, serum, plasma, biological fluid, and tissue samples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn âindividualâ or âsubjectâ is a vertebrate, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human.

An expression control sequence can be a promoter, such as a constitutive or an inducible promoter, or an enhancer. The expression control sequence is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be transcribed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âpharmaceutically acceptable carrierâ includes any material which, when combined with an active ingredient, allows the ingredient to retain biological activity and is non-reactive with the subject's immune system. Examples include, but are not limited to, any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions such as oil/water emulsion, and various types of wetting agents. Preferred diluents for aerosol or parenteral administration are phosphate buffered saline or normal (0.9%) saline. Compositions comprising such carriers are formulated by well known conventional methods (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, A. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990; and Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20th Ed. Mack Publishing, 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term âperipherally administeredâ as used herein refers to the route by which the a substance, medicament and/or anti-CGRP antagonist antibody is to be delivered, in particular it means not centrally, not spinally, not intrathecally, not delivered directly into the CNS.

Hybridoma 12:93-106 (1993)).\n\n\n \nExample 1 \n\n\nSet Up of the Rodent Cancer Mechanistic Pain Model\n\n\n \n \n \nTumour cells used are syngeneic MRMT-1 rat mammary gland carcinoma cells donated from the Novartis Institute (London). The cells are cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) with 10% foetal bovine serum (FCS), 1% L-\nglutamine\n 2% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). Two brief washes are carried out with 0.1% w/v trypsin to release those cells which adhere to the flask, and then quenched with an equal volume of 10% FCS, followed by centrifugation of the solution for 3 minutes at 1200 rpm. The pellet is washed and resuspended in Hanks medium, and the concentration of cells calculated using a Haemocytometer, with trypan blue staining to determine the number of dead MRMT-1 cells. The final concentration of 3Ã10\n3 \ncells was then obtained by diluting the solution according to the number of cells seen. The final solution was kept on ice until time of injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMale Sprague-Dawley rats weighing close to 170 g at time of surgery were used to generate the cancer model. Anaesthesia was induced in the rats using halothane or isoflurane (1.5-2%) 66% N\n2\nO and 33% O\n2\n, the leg was shaved over the appropriate area and disinfected with chlorhexidine (Animalcare Ltd, UK.). A small incision in order to expose the anterior-medial surface of the distal end of the tibia was made. A hole was bored in the periosteum using a 0.7 mm dental drill, through which a 2 cm polythene tubing was fed 1 cm into the intra-medullar cavity of the tibia. Using a Hamilton syringe the pre-prepared 10 Î¼l of 3Ã10\n3 \nMRMT-1 cells were injected through the tubing into the cavity. The tubing was then removed and the hole plugged using bone restorative material (IRM, Dentsply USA). The wound was then irrigated with 0.9% saline and closed with a metal clip. The sham animals were operated upon using the same procedure but injected with 10 Î¼l of Hank's solution alone. The animals were placed in a thermoregulated recovery box until such time that they were able to be placed back in their housing cages.\n\n\n \nExample 2 \n\n\nAssessment of Rodent Anti-CGRP Antibody G2 in the Cancer Pain Model\n\n\n \n \n \nTesting behaviour towards mechanical stimuli uses von Frey filaments (North Coast Medical Inc., USA) to the plantar surface of both the ipsilateral and contralateral hindpaw. The rats were placed in a Perspex cubicle with a mesh floor and allowed to acclimatise for 10 minutes. Each von Frey was applied 10 times to each hindpaw alternating between the ipsilateral and contralateral, for duration of 2-3 seconds each time. Von Frey Filaments used have bending forces of 1, 5, 9 and 15 g, and a period of 5 minutes was left between ascending von Frey forces. A nocifensive response (a lift) is defined as a brisk withdrawal of the hindpaw and the number of lifts for each paw at each von Frey are recorded (maximum of 10) and expressed as a percentage response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn assessment of the efficacy of rodent anti-CGRP antibody G2 in attenuating hypersensitivity to a wide variety of static mechanical, cooling and integrated stimuli was carried out as well as the background basal pain behaviours in this validated model of cancer induced bone pain. The responses measured are attenuated by standard analgesic treatments such as morphine and gabapentin. All measures were made by the same scientist in a blind fashionâblinded to the identity of the compound/control and to the treatment of the animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG2-was given IV at 10 mg/kg at \nday\n 9 and rats were tested at 2 hrs and then on \n \ndays\n \n 10, 11, 12 and then 14-18 days post treatment (\nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG2 had marked effect on the behavioural responses to the higher intensity mechanical stimuli. Withdrawal frequencies to von Frey 8 g were reduced two hours after injection and were significantly reduced over that seen in the vehicle treated group on days 11 and 12 (\n \ndays\n \n 2 and 3 after injection, p=0.0164 and 0.0311, respectively). In fact, the G2 treated animals now had pain scores similar to the baseline values. By day 14 (\nday\n 5 post-G2 injection) there was no discernible difference between the G2 and vehicle-treated groups. Both groups reached a similar level of hypersensitivity to von Frey 8 g by \nday\n 18 after MRMT-1 injection (\nday\n 9 post-treatment).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar reversal in hypersensitivity to \nvon Frey\n 15 g was also apparent. A reduction in hypersensitivity to \nvon Frey\n 15 g from vehicle treated group was evident at 2 hours post-injection with significance seen at 2 and 3 days after drug administration (p=0.02 and 0.03 respectively). The reductions were lost by 6 days after G2 administration and both groups now reached similar maximal withdrawal frequencies by 18 days post MRMT-1 injection (\nFIG. 2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results indicate that G2 reduces noxious pain experienced in the metastatic bone cancer rat model.\n\n\n \nExample 3 \n\n\nRota Rod Test for Motor Impairment\n\n\n \n \n \nA further end point tested in the bone cancer pain model was ambulation (by rotarod). The test is to obtain a measurement of locomotor impairment comparing antibody treated with control animals, each subjected to the same test under the same conditions. The rota rod test consists of 4 rotateable drums divided by flanges with a motor-driven drum accelerated (Ugo Basile, Comerio, VA, Italy). For a given trial, a rat is placed on the rotating rod and the rotation speed is accelerated from 4 to 16 rpm in 2 min. The time of maximal performance is typically set at 120 sec. Each animal generally receives three trials per day, at 1 hr intervals, for several consecutive days post surgery. The latency to fall off the rod is represented as mean of the three trials. No differences were found between the antibody G2 group and the vehicle group in the latency to fall from the rotarod during forced ambulation (\nFIG. 3\n). This suggests that G2 does not impair pathways involved in motor co-ordination, or attention and points to a lack of CNS side-effects produced by the antibody.\n\n\n \nExample 4 \n\n\nBinding Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nA binding assay was performed to measure the IC\n50 \nof anti-CGRP antibody G1 and G2 in blocking human Î±-CGRP from binding to the CGRP1-receptor in SK-N-MC cells. Dose response curves were plotted and K\ni \nvalues were determined using the equation: K\ni\n=IC\n50\n/(1+([ligand]/K\nD\n); \nFIG. 4\n, where the equilibrium dissociation constant K\nD\n=8 pM for human Î±-CGRP to CGRP1-receptor as present in SK-N-MC cells. The reported IC\n50 \nvalue (in terms of IgG molecules) was converted to binding sites so that it could be compared with the affinities (K\nD\n) determined by Biacore, using N-biotinylated human and rat Î±-CGRPs were captured on individual flow cells at low levels (typically 100 response units) to provide the reaction surfaces, while an unmodified flow cell served as a reference channel. G1 was titrated over the chip surface Binding affinities were deduced from the quotient of the kinetic rate constants (K\nD\n=k\noff\n/k\non\n) see Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG2\n\n\nMouse Mab 7E9\n\n\nG1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKD (nM), Î±-Hu\n\n\n17\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC50 (nM) Î±-Hu\n\n\n37\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKD (nM) Î±-Rat\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n58\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nN-biotin-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCGRP\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\non chip\n\n\nÂ° C.\n\n\nk\non \n(1/Ms)\n\n\nk\noff \n(1/s)\n\n\nT\n1/2 \n(h)\n\n\nK\nD \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÎ±-human\n\n\n25\n\n\n1.86 Ã 10\n5\n \n\n\n7.80 Ã 10\nâ5\n \n\n\n24.68\n\n\n0.042\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÎ±-humam\n\n\n37\n\n\n5.87 Ã 10\n5\n \n\n\n3.63 Ã 10\nâ5\n \n\n\n5.30\n\n\n0.063\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÎ²-human\n\n\n37\n\n\n4.51 Ã 10\n5\n \n\n\n6.98 Ã 10\nâ5\n \n\n\n2.76\n\n\n0.155\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÎ±-rat\n\n\n25\n\n\n5.08 Ã 10\n4\n \n\n\n6.18 Ã 10\nâ5\n \n\n\n3.12\n\n\n1.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÎ±-rat\n\n\n37\n\n\n1.55 Ã 10\n5\n \n\n\n3.99 Ã 10\nâ4\n \n\n\n0.48\n\n\n2.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÎ²-rat\n\n\n37\n\n\n5.16 Ã 10\n5\n \n\n\n7.85 Ã 10\nâ5\n \n\n\n2.45\n\n\n0.152\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding affinity of G1 for human Î± and Î² CGRP was equivalent (Kd=0.155 and 0.152 nM respectively). Binding affinity of G2 for rat Î± and Î² CGRP was equivalent (16 and 17 nM, respectively). Additionally G1 binding affinity is 40-fold more potent in human than rat for Î±-CGRP (Kd=0.042 and 1.22 nM, respectively) and equi-potent in human and rat for Î²-CGRP (Kd=0.155 and 0.152 nM, respectively). Antibody G1 also demonstrated good cross species selectivity and binds rat Î±-CGRP with the same affinity as antibody G2 (around 1.2 nM) Table 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG1 binds human and cynomolgus monkey Î±- and Î²-CGRP with high affinity (K\nD\n=63 and 155 pM, respectively). G1 displays species selectivity for human/cyno CGRP and binds Î±- and Î²-CGRP from other species e.g. rat with lower affinity (K\nD\n=2.57 nM and 152 pM, respectively).\n\n\n \nExample 5 \n\n\nHalf Life of Anti-CGRP in-vivo\n\n\n \n \n \nSerum measurements of anti-CGRP in rat, \nFIG. 5\n, indicate that the half life is of the order of 7 days. The antibody is peripherally restricted having a molecular weight of around 150,000, \nFIGS. 5\n \na\n, \n5\n \nb\n, i.e. it does not cross into the central nervous system or cross the blood brain barrier.\n\n\n \nExample 6 \n\n\nSelectivity of Anti-CGRP Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nWe determined the specificity of antibody G1 to human or rat CGRP by using the Biacore chip to âprobeâ the free concentration of a premixed complex of mAb+peptide. As expected when we pre-incubated antibody G1 with human or rat CGRP the response was fully blocked. In contrast pre-incubating G1, with an excess of amylin, calcitonin or adrenomedullin was comparable to the control response (G1 plus buffer) demonstrating that G1 did not form a complex with these peptides (\nFIG. 7\n).\n\n\n \nExample 7 \n\n\nIdentification of Antibody G1 Binding Epitope\n\n\n \n \n \nInteraction analysis was conducted at 25Â° C. on a Biacore 3000â¢ system equipped with streptavidin-coated (SA) sensor chips (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using a standard Biacore running buffer (HBS-P). First we confirmed that an N-biotinylated 25-37 human Î±-CGRP fragment bound with the same affinity to antibody G1, as full-length N-biotinylated human Î±-CGRP. Each amino acid between position 27-37 was then mutated individually to alanine and expressed the fold loss in affinity compared to the wild-type fragment. N-biotinylated fragments were captured on individual flow cells at low levels (typically 100 response units) to provide the reaction surfaces, while an unmodified flow cell served as a reference channel. Purified Fab fragments of antibody G1 were generated. Fab fragments were titrated over the chip using 1 Î¼M as the top concentration of a two-fold dilution series. Association and dissociation phases were monitored at 100 Î¼l/min for 1 minute and 5 minutes respectively. Surfaces were regenerated with a mixture of 35% ethanol+25mM NaOH+0.5M NaCl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alanine scan results show that antibody G1 binds to the C-terminal region of human Î±-CGRP, particularly residues 25 to 37, and shows specific binding to a region (i.e. loss of affinity is markedly increased when the specific binding region is mutated) which can be defined as the epitope and which lies within the last 5 C-terminal amino acids, i.e. from G33A to F37A. Most profound changes in affinity are caused through the G33A and F37A mutation (\nFIG. 6\n). C-terminal Phe is important for selectivity of antibody G1 for CGRP vs related peptides and gene family members (\nFIG. 8\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides an anti-CGRP antagonist antibody which specifically binds to an epitope defined by amino acids G33 to F37 of CGRP. The anti-CGRP antagonist antibody may specifically bind to the epitope defined by the amino acid sequence GSKAF, more specifically to the epitope of CGRP is defined as GXXXF where X can be any amino acid, the G33 and F37 being the most important residues of the epitope for defining high affinity binding of the anti-CGRP antagonist antibody.\n\n\n \nExample 8 \n\n\nAnalysis of Indicators of Physical or Psychological Dependence\n\n\n \n \n \nNeither antibody G1 nor antibody G2 demonstrate CNS penetration. Additionally long term observation of animals (rats) dosed with either antibody to levels used in the previous examples did not reveal adverse CNS events such as sedation or stimulation/euphoric behaviour in comparison to control animals. These observations indicate an absence of dependency risk for the antibodies and hence a significantly improved safety of the antibodies over current opiates used in current pain therapies.\n\n\n \nExample 9 \n\n\nAnalysis of Indicators of Gastro-Intestinal Adverse Effects\n\n\n \n \n \nA 1 month in-vivo rat study with antibody G2 and 1 week comparative study with antibody G1 demonstrated that no adverse gastro intestinal effects were observed on behaviour, food intake, stool production or histopathology in comparison to control animals. These observations indicate an absence of gastrointestinal risk for the antibodies and hence a significantly improved safety of the antibodies over current NSAIDs used in current pain therapies.\n\n\n \nExample 10 \n\n\nG1 and G2 as Anti-CGRP Antagonist Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nA known consequence of CGRP biological activity is the generation neurogenic flare when delivered in vivo. G1 and G2 are demonstrated to be anti-CGRP antagonist antibodies in that they prevent the development of neurogenic flare in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing a neurogenic skin flare rat model the efficacy of G1 was tested for its ability to block CGRP effect in vivo. The saphenous nerve in the rat is electrically stimulated causing CGRP release from nerve endings and leading to vasodilation, the resulting changes in blood flow can be measured using laser Dopler methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChanges in blood flow parameters were expressed as the area under the curve (AUC, change in arbitrary Doppler flux units multiplied by time). CGRP receptor antagonist CGRP\n8-37 \n(400 nmol/kg, i.v.) was used as a positive control to validate the specificity of the model (data not shown). To determine the effect of G1 prior to dosing for each animal, the baseline blood flow response to stimulation was established with two saphenous nerve stimulations each 30 minutes apart. Rats were treated with G1 after the blood flow response of the second stimulation had returned to baseline levels (approximately 10 minutes post stimulation) and an additional four stimulations at 30 minute intervals were performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults (\nFIG. 9\n) demonstrated that in vehicle treated animals no significant change in blood flow response was but rats treated with G1 showed a significant decrease in blood flow response starting at 90 and 120 minutes post dose for 10 mg/kg and 1mg/kg, respectively. Similar activity was achieved using D2. Additionally in further neurogenic flare and vasodilatation model tests G1 showed marked effect at 7 days post IV dosing (predicted ED\n50\n=6 ug/ml in saphenous nerve stimulation model). The conclusions form the tests done is that G1 and G2 demonstrate anti-CGRP antagonist activity. Similar CGRP function-blocking ability for the antibodies is also shown in the publication, Zeller J, et. al. Br J Pharmacol. 2008 December; 155(7):1093-103.
