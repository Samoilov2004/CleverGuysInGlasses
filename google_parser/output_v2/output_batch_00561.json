Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a sulfonamide compound or a salt thereof, which is useful as an active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition, in particular, a pharmaceutical composition for treating a lower urinary tract symptom.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nOveractive bladder that is one of the diseases which cause a lower urinary tract symptom refers to a clinical condition of the disease characterized by urinary urgency regardless of the presence or absence of incontinence, which is usually accompanied by pollakiuria and nocturia (Neurourology and Urodynamics, 21, 167-178 (2002)). For a treatment thereof, currently an anticholinergic agent is mainly used, and constant treatment results are obtained. However, it has been reported that the use thereof is difficult with patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or elderly patients since it is known to cause side-effects such as dry mouth, constipation and blurred vision, as well as carrying a risk of urinary retention. In addition, it is known that there exist patients showing no improvement with treatment with the anticholinergic agent. In view of the above-mentioned facts, there are great expectations for a drug with a new mechanism of action for the overactive bladder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProstaglandin E\n2 \n(PGE\n2\n) is a bioactive substance for which arachidonic acid is used as a precursor, and is known to participate in regulation of the functions of the body through four subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors, i.e., EP 1, EP2, EP3, and EP4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is known that intravesical instillation of PGE\n2 \nresults in strong urinary urgency and reduction in the bladder capacity in human (Urological Research, 18(5), 349-352 (1990)), and that intravesical instillation of PGE\n2 \nresults in reduction in the bladder capacity of a rat (The Journal of Urology, 153(6), 2034-2038 (1995)), and a possibility that PGE\n2 \naffects the function of the lower urinary tract is suggested. In recent years, it has been reported that administration of an EPI receptor antagonist to a model rat with a spinal cord injury is useful in improving the voiding function (Journal of The Japanese Urological Association, February 2001, Vol. 92, No. 2, p. 304), that the abnormal voiding function of a model mouse with urethral stricture is eliminated by the knock-out of an EPI receptor, and that exacerbation of the abnormal voiding function is shown with intravesical instillation of PGE\n2 \n(Patent Document 1). Consequently, it is believed that the EP1 receptor antagonist is useful as an agent for treating a lower urinary tract symptom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, with respect to the EP1 receptor antagonist, from the mechanism of action thereof, side effects specific to an anticholinergic agent are expected to be avoided, and in addition, an effect on patients who show no improvement by treatment with the anticholinergic agent can also be expected. Furthermore, this agent can be expected to further improve potent subjective symptoms by acting on sensory nerves. Furthermore, this agent has been reported to exhibit an effect of improving the clinical condition without lowering the voiding efficiency of a rat with spinal cord injury (General Assembly Proceedings of the 89th Japanese Urological Association (Kobe, 2001), pamphlet, MP-305), and thus it can be expected to be administered safely to patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or elderly patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, it is also widely known that PGE\n2 \nis produced locally as an accompaniment to inflammation or tissue disorders, and is known to participate in expression of pain or fever as well as to enhance the inflammatory reaction. In recent years, it has become known that an EP 1 receptor antagonist shows efficacy in model animals with various types of pain such as inflammatory pain (Anesthesiology, 97(5), 1254-1262 (2002)), postoperative pain (Anesthesia and Analgesia, 95(6), 1708-1712 (2002)), and neuropathic pain (Anesthesia and Analgesia, 93(4), 1012-1017 (2001)). In addition, there have been reports on the clinical effect of administration of an EP1 receptor antagonist on visceral pain caused by hydrochloric acid (Gastroenterology, 124(1), 18-25 (2003)). From the above-mentioned facts, it is believed that the EP1 receptor antagonist is also useful as an agent for treating various types of pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, it is known that the EP1 receptor antagonist has an inhibitory action on aberrant crypt foci of the colonic mucosa, and on intestinal polyp formation (Patent Document 2), and it is believed that the EP 1 receptor antagonist is also useful as an agent for treating colon cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a sulfonamide compound having an EP 1 receptor antagonistic action, for example, compounds represented by the formulae (A), (B), (C), and (D) have been reported (Patent Documents 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(In the formula above, R\n4 \nrepresents (1) hydrogen, (2) C1 to 8 alkyl, C2 to 8 alkenyl, or C2 to 8 alkynyl, (3) C1 to 6 alkyl substituted with one or two groups selected from the group consisting of COOZ\n8\n, CONZ\n9\nZ\n10\n, OZ\n8 \ngroup, and C1 to 4 alkoxy-C1 to 4 alkoxy, (4) C3 to 7 cycloalkyl, or (5) C1 to 4 alkyl, C2 to 4 alkenyl, or C2 to 4 alkynyl, each substituted with phenyl or C3 to 7 cycloalkyl, and Z\n4 \nrepresents SO\n2 \nor CO.

For example, the optical isomers can be obtained by means of general optical resolution methods of racemic products (for example, by fractional crystallization converting the compound into diastereomer salts with optically active bases or acids, by chromatography using a chiral column or the like, and others), or can also be prepared from an appropriate optically active starting compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacological activity of the compound of the formula (I) was confirmed by the following tests.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest Example 1 Test to Measure Receptor Antagonistic Activity Using EP1 Receptor-Expressing Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) that stably expressed rat EP1 receptor were dispensed onto a 96-well poly-D-lysine-coated plate (product name: BIOCOAT, PDL96W black/clear, by Nippon Becton Dickinson) at 2×10\n4 \ncells/well on the day before the experiment, and incubated overnight at 37° C. under 5% carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) in a culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (product name: DMEM, Invitrogen). The culture medium was replaced with a loading buffer (a washing solution containing 4 μM of fluorescent-labeled indicator (product name: Fluo3-AM, Dojindo): Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), 20 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 2.5 mM Probenecid, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)), and left to stand at room temperature for 3 hours, and the cells were washed using a plate washer (product name: ELx405, Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.) in which the washing solution had been set up. The compound that had been preliminarily dissolved and diluted in the washing solution was added thereto, and set up in a system for measuring the intracellular calcium (Ca) concentration (product name: FLIPR, Molecular Devices, Inc.). After 5 minutes, PGE\n2 \nwas added to a final concentration of 100 nM, and the change in intracellular Ca concentration was measured. The difference between a maximum value and a minimum value in the intracellular Ca concentration change was determined, and retained as measurement data. When a response with addition of 100 nM PGE\n2 \nwas taken as 0% and a response with addition of a buffer was taken as 100%, the concentration causing 50% inhibition was determined as an IC\n50 \nvalue.

HEK293EBNA cells (American Type Culture Collection) were transfected with the rat EP1 expression vector using a transfection reagent (product name: Fugene-6, Roche-Diagnostics), and then cultured for 2 days in a medium containing 10% FBS (product name: DMEM, Invitrogen) at 37° C. under 5% CO\n2\n. After culturing, the cells were collected, treated with a cell lysate (20 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) buffer pH 7.5, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid(EDTA)), and ultracentrifuged (23000 revolutions, 25 minutesx2) for rough preparation of a membrane sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA reaction liquid containing the prepared membrane sample (15 μg) and \n3\nH-PGE\n2 \n(150 μl, composition: 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES)/potassium hydroxide (KOH) pH 6.0, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM magnesium chloride (MgCl\n2\n), 0.02% 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propanesulfonate (CHAPS)) was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The reaction was stopped with an ice-cooled buffer, and suction-filtering was performed under reduced pressure to trap the bound \n3\nH-PGE\n2 \nto a glass filter (product name: UNIFILTER-96, GF/B, PerkinElmer), so as to measure the radioactivity of the binding with a microplate scintillation counter (product name: TopCount, Packard) using Microscinti (product name: MICROSCINTI 20, PerkinElmer).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dissociation constant (Kd) and the maximum binding amount (Bmax) were determined from Scatchard plotting (“Annals of the New York Academy of Science” (US), 1949, Vol. 51, p. 660). Nonspecific bindings were determined as bindings in the presence of an excess amount (2.5 μM) of label-free PGE\n2\n. The assessment of the inhibitory action on \n3\nH-PGE\n2 \nbinding by the compound was carried out by adding 2.5 nM \n3\nH-PGE\n2 \nand the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibition constant Ki (nM) for each compound was obtained using the following formula:\n\n\n \n \n \nKi=IC\n50\n/(1+([C]/Kd))\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the formula, [C] represents the concentration of \n3\nH-PGE\n2 \nemployed in the reaction system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result, for example, the compound of Example 71 showed a Ki value of 0.47 M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest Example 3 Action on Rat with Acetic Acid-Induced Pollakiuria\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-pollakisuria action of the compound was assessed using a pathological model. It has been known that intravesical treatment with acetic acid in rat damages the bladder mucosa, thereby activating the afferent nerve transmitting nociceptive stimulus (“The Journal of Neuroscience”, (US), December 1992, Vol. 12, No. 12, p. 4878-89). Since the pollakiuria condition is induced by intravesical treatment with acetic acid, it is possible to assess the therapeutic effects of the compound against the symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the experiment, male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories) having weights ranging from 200 to 450 g were used. The urinary bladder was exteriorized by midline abdominal incision under pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg, i.p.), and residual urine in the bladder was removed with a syringe equipped with a 27G needle. Thereafter, 0.5 to 0.7 mL of a 1% acetic acid solution was injected into the bladder and the wound was closed. Two days later, experimentation was carried out. Rats were placed in metabolic cages for acclimation for 1 hour, and then the test drug was orally administered. Immediately thereafter, change in the amount of urination was continuously measured for 6 hours. Total amount of urine was divided by total urination incidents to calculate the effective bladder capacity. As a result, it was noted that the effective bladder capacity of the group of which the bladders had been treated with acetic acid was decreased as compared to that of the sham-operated group, and thus showed pollakiuria condition. On the other hand, it was confirmed that there were compounds which improved the pollakiuria condition excellently at a minimum effective dose (MED) of 3 mg/kg among the compounds of the formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest Example 4 Test on Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 Enzyme Inhibition (Evaluation of Drug Interaction)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) Inhibition Test I (Calculation of Inhibitory Activity I)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing a 96-well plate, a substrate (midazolam), a test compound and human liver microsome (0.1 mg protein/ml) were incubated at 37° C. for 20 minutes in a 100 mM phosphate buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM NADPH.

In addition the compounds are predicted to lower blood glucose by increasing hepatic glucose uptake. Such compounds may have utility in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and obesity.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nMammalian cells respond to extracellular stimuli by activating signaling cascades that are mediated by members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family, which include the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), also known as stress activated protein kinase (SAPK). Three distinct genes, JNK1, JNK2, JNK3 have been identified and at least ten different splicing isoforms of JNKs exist in mammalian cells [Gupta et al., EMBO J., 15:2760-70 (1996)]. While JNK1 and JNK2 express in many tissues, JNK3 specifically expresses in the brain. Thus, JNK3 has a potential to be particularly involved in nervous function. The JNK signal transduction system of stress response MAP kinase family system is activated by changes in osmotic pressure, DNA damage, anisomycine, heat shock, ultraviolet radiation, ischemia, inflammatory cytokines and the like and various stress stimulations relating to apoptosis induction, it is considered to constitute a major intracellular information transduction path responsible for stress response (Biochemica et Biophysica Acta, vol. 1333, pp. F85-F104 (1997)). From an experiment using a JNK1 deletion mouse, JNK is reported to be an important mediator involved in obesity and insulin resistance (Nature, vol. 420, pp. 333-336 (2002)).\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE

In a glove box, treatment of tert-butyl 4-(3-aminoisoquinolin-6-yl)-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxylate with 1.5 eq. of NaH in THF at room temperature presumably formed the amino-sodium salt. This reaction accompanied a visible evolvement of H\n2\n. Let the reaction go for 10 minutes before distributing the solution to four vials containing aldehydes and ketones, respectively. To these four vials 4.0 eq of Ti(OiPr)\n4 \nliquid was added. The vials were capped and placed in a 50° C. heating block in fumehood, and stirred for 14 h. After cooling to room temperature, 3.0 eq of NaBH\n4 \nsuspended in THF was added to the above reaction vials, respectively, and stirred for 14 h. 2-methoxylethyl ether appeared to solubilize NaBH\n4 \nbetter and can also be used for the reduction. Carefully, 2N HCl aqueous solution was added to allow the pH to reach 1 or 2. The mixture was stirred for 1 h, and then the pH was adjusted to 8 by adding 2N aqueous NaOH. Precipitate was removed by passing the mixture through a syringe filter. The filtrate was analyzed using LCMS which showed the yields of the desired products ranging from 40 to 70%.\n\n\n\nAny of the above compounds described in schemes A-S can be converted into another analogous compound by standard chemical manipulations. These chemical manipulations are known to those skilled in the art and include a) removal of a protecting group by methods outlined in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, Second Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1991; b) displacement of a leaving group (halide, mesylate, tosylate, etc) with a primary or secondary amine, thiol or alcohol to form a secondary or tertiary amine, thioether or ether, respectively; c) treatment of phenyl (or substituted phenyl) carbamates with primary of secondary amines to form the corresponding ureas as in Thavonekham, B et. al. Synthesis (1997), 10, p 1189; d) reduction of propargyl or homopropargyl alcohols or N-BOC protected primary amines to the corresponding E-allylic or E-homoallylic derivatives by treatment with sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride (Red-Al) as in Denmark, S. E.; Jones, T. K. J. Org. Chem. (1982) 47, 4595-4597 or van Benthem, R. A. T. M.; Michels, J. J.; Speckamp, W. N. Synlett (1994), 368-370; e) reduction of alkynes to the corresponding Z-alkene derivatives by treatment hydrogen gas and a Pd catalyst as in Tomassy, B. et. al. Synth. Commun. (1998), 28, p 1201 f) treatment of primary and secondary amines with an isocyanate, acid chloride (or other activated carboxylic acid derivative), alkyl/aryl chloroformate or sulfonyl chloride to provide the corresponding urea, amide, carbamate or sulfonamide; g) reductive amination of a primary or secondary amine using R\n1\nCH(O); and h) treatment of alcohols with an isocyanate, acid chloride (or other activated carboxylic acid derivative), alkyl/aryl chloroformate or sulfonyl chloride to provide the corresponding carbamate, ester, carbonate or sulfonic acid ester.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may have asymmetric carbon atoms. Diasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixtures into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomeric mixtures and pure enantiomers are considered as part of the invention.\n\n\nThe compounds of formulas (I) that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate the compound of formula (I) from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained. The desired acid salt can also be precipitated from a solution of the free base in an organic solvent by adding to the solution an appropriate mineral or organic acid.\n\n\nThose compounds of formula (I) that are acidic in nature are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques. The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of this invention are those which form non-toxic base salts with the acidic compounds of formula (I). Such non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium calcium and magnesium, etc. These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmacologically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum yields of the desired final product.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may also be useful in the treatment of other metabolic disorders associated with impaired glucose utilization and insulin resistance include major late-stage complications of NIDDM, such as diabetic angiopathy, atherosclerosis, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, and diabetic ocular complications such as retinopathy, cataract formation and glaucoma, and many other conditions linked to NIDDM, including dyslipidemia glucocorticoid induced insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesteremia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertension. Brief definitions of these conditions are available in any medical dictionary, for instance, \nStedman's Medical Dictionary \n(Xth Ed.).\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions/Formulations, Dosaging and Modes of Administration\n\n\nMethods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a specific amount of active compound are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art are familiar with formulation and administration techniques. Such topics would be discussed, e.g. in Goodman and Gilman's \nThe Pharmaceutical Basis of Therapeutics\n, current edition, Pergamon Press; and \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\n, current edition. Mack Publishing, Co., Easton, Pa. These techniques can be employed in appropriate aspects and embodiments of the methods and compositions described herein. The following examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to serve as limitations of the present invention.\n\n\nThe amino heterocyclyl compounds of formula (I) may be provided in suitable topical, oral and parenteral pharmaceutical formulations for use in the treatment of GK mediated diseases. The compounds of the present invention may be administered orally as tablets or capsules, as oily or aqueous suspensions, lozenges, troches, powders, granules, emulsions, syrups or elixirs. The compositions for oral use may include one or more agents for flavoring, sweetening, coloring and preserving in order to produce pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets may contain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as an aid in the manufacture of such tablets. As is conventional in the art these tablets may be coated with a pharmaceutically acceptable enteric coating, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract to provide a sustained action over a longer period.\n\n\nFormulations for oral use may be in the form of hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin. They may also be in the form of soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.\n\n\nAqueous suspensions normally contain active ingredients in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of an aqueous suspension. Such excipients may be a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; a dispersing or wetting agent that may be a naturally occurring phosphatide such as lecithin, a condensation product of ethylene oxide and a long chain fatty acid, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, a condensation product of ethylene oxide and a long chain aliphatic alcohol such as heptadecaethylenoxycetanol, a condensation product of ethylene oxide and a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate or a fatty acid hexitol anhydrides such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to know methods using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents that have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be formulated as a suspension in a non toxic perenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringers solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\nThe amino heterocyclyl compounds of formula (I) may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at about 25 Celcius but liquid at rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter and other glycerides.\n\n\nFor topical use preparations, for example, creams, ointments, jellies solutions, or suspensions, containing the compounds of the present invention are employed.\n\n\nThe amino heterocyclyl compounds of formula (I) may also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multimellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipides, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.\n\n\nDosage levels of the compounds of the present invention are of the order of about 0.5 mg/kg body weight to about 100 mg/kg body weight. A preferred dosage rate is between about 30 mg/kg body weight to about 100 mg/kg body weight. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a number of factors including the activity of the particular compound being administered, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. To enhance the therapeutic activity of the present compounds they may be administered concomitantly with other orally active antidiabetic compounds such as the sulfonylureas, for example, tolbutamide and the like.\n\n\nThe examples and preparations provided below further illustrate and exemplify the compounds of the present invention and methods of preparing such compounds. It is to be understood that the scope of the present invention is not limited in any way by the scope of the following examples and preparations. In the following examples molecules with a single chiral center, unless otherwise noted, exist as a racemic mixture. Those molecules with two or more chiral centers, unless otherwise noted, exist as a racemic mixture of diastereomers. Single enantiomers/diastereomers may be obtained by methods known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe invention will now be described in reference to the following Examples.

The 6-(1H-Pyrazol-4-yl)-isoquinolin-3-ylamine (200.0 mg, 0.9 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at 75° C. for 24 hours. The reaction was monitored by LC/MS. Evaporation of DMA gave a residue that was washed with NaHCO\n3 \nto remove the by-products from HATU. The crude residue then was dissolved in MeOH (10 mL) and was treated with K\n2\nCO\n3 \n(26.0 mg, 0.5 mmol) at 75° C. for 18 hrs. The solvent was evaporated and the product extracted with CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(20 mL). The extracts were washed with water (3×10 mL) and evaporated. The crude product was purified by ISCO (with petroleum ether:ethyl acetate 50:50) to give the title compound as a light yellow crystalline solid product (143.3 mg, 41.4%). \n1\nH NMR (DMSO-d\n6\n, 400 MHz): δ 3.68 (2H, s), 3.73 (3H, s), 6.79-6.98 (2H, m), 7.31 (2H, d, J=8.8 Hz,), 7.81 (1H, dd, J=8.6, 1.5 Hz,), 8.00 (1H, d, J=8.6 Hz), 8.08 (1H, s), 8.14 (1H, s), 8.41 (2H, d, J=8.3 Hz), 9.03 (1H, s), 10.69 (1H, s), 13.09 (1H, s). \n13\nCNMR (DMSO-d\n6\n, 100 MHz): δ 42.18, 55.01, 106.30, 113.76, 120.44, 120.56, 124.11, 124.39, 126.71, 127.87, 128.06, 130.13, 135.26, 136.96, 137.87, 147.51, 150.75, 158.14, 170.14. HRMS: m/z 359.1489, calc. 359.1503. MS m/z, (APCI); 359.2 [(M+1)\n+\n100].\n\n\nPreparation of intermediate 1: N-(4-Bromobenzyl)-2,2-diethoxyethanimidamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2 L, three-neck round bottom flask (equipped with magnetic stir bar, thermometer, and addition funnel), charged diethoxyacetonitrile (111.1 g, 860 mmol) and methanol (620 mL, anhydrous) while under a steady nitrogen flow. Via an addition funnel, slowly charged 25 wt % solution of sodium methoxide (4.64 g, 86 mmol, 19.7 mL) in methanol. (Note: addition is slightly exothermic). The mixture was stirred for 15 h, at which point, the solvent was removed under vacuum (Note: starting material had not been completely converted according to NMR). The residue was dissolved in methanol and charged with a fresh sodium methoxide solution—same concentration/equivalents—and stirred another 15 h). The solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue was dissolved in diethyl ether (1.0 L), with the organic phase washed with water (3×500 mL), then brine (1×300 mL). The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, the salts filtered and the solvent reduced under vacuum to give 89.9 g of a crude mixture of methyl 2,2-diethoxyethanimidoate and un-reacted starting material (10-12 mol % by NMR) as a thin oil. Note that best yields of the imidate are obtained when the organic layer is stripped of at 400 mbar and 45° C. because of its volatility.\n\n\nThe oil was dissolved in methanol (300 mL,) and placed into a 2 L round bottom flask (equipped with magnetic stir bar, reflux condenser) along with 1-(4-bromophenyl)methanamine (100.0 g, 537 mmol) and the mixture subjected to heating in a pre-heated oil bath. The mixture was stirred at 70° C. for 18 h and then allowed to cool. The solvent was removed to give 158.8 g of the desired intermediate (1) in 93.8% yield (based on 1-(4-bromophenyl)methanamine as limiting reagent).\n\n\nPreparation of intermediate 2: 6-Bromoisoquinolin-3-amine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 3 L, three-neck round bottom flask (equipped with magnetic stir bar, thermometer, addition funnel), charged conc. sulfuric acid (1.12 L). While maintaining an internal temperature of 20-25° C. with an ice water bath, dropwise charged N-(4-bromobenzyl)-2,2-diethoxyethanimidamide (158.8 g, 504 mmol). After addition, removed bath and allowed to stir at ambient temperature for 72 h.\n\n\nA 12-L, 3-necked round bottom flask, equipped with a large stirrer bar, dropping funnel and thermometer was charged with water (5 L). The flask was placed in an IPA bath and cooled externally with solid CO\n2 \nto an internal temperature of 8° C. Over a period of 1¾ h, the reaction mixture was added slowly to the water, keeping the internal temperature between 0° C. and 10° C., resulting in a yellow suspension. With continued cooling, a 12 M NaOH solution was added over a 4 h period, keeping the internal temperature below 30° C. A final pH of 9-10 was reached (required 4.6 L, 12 M NaOH). Note that upon reaching neutral pH, the suspension changed to a much darker yellow. The suspension was filtered over a medium glass filter and the remaining residue was washed repeatedly with a total of 4 L of water to wash away precipitated Na-salts which resulted in a significant decrease of the amount of solids on the filter. The residue was dried in high vac at room temperature over KOH to give 143 g of a yellow powder. Elemental analysis showed 5.9 weight % of Na which corresponds to 36.4 weight % of Na\n2\nSO\n4\n. This material was used for further elaboration.\n\n\nPreparation of intermediate 3: 6-(1H-Pyrazol-4-yl)isoquinolin-3-amine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 3-L, three-necked rbf, equipped with a condenser, thermometer and large stirrer bar was charged with DME (1 L) and a 2M Cs\n2\nCO\n3 \n(1 L, 10 eq). The two-phased system purged with nitrogen under vigorous stirring for 45 min, followed by the addition of 6-bromoisoquinolin-3-amine (44 g, 64 w % purity, 126 mmol), the commercially available boronate (50 g, 170 mmol), and PdCl\n2\n(dppf), CH\n2\nCl\n2 \ncomplex (10.6 g, 14.2 mmol, Strem) and MeOH (2 mL). The nitrogen purge was discontinued and replaced by a nitrogen in/outlet on top of the condenser. The reaction mixture was heated to rfx (internal temperature 80° C.) for a period of 16 h and allowed to cool to room temperature. The cooled reaction mixture appeared as a two-layer system with a virtually colorless, aqueous layer and a dark organic layer in which a light brown precipitate had formed. The reaction mixture was filtered over a short path of Celite (pre-wetted with MeOH) and the Celite was subsequently washed with DME (110 mL). Removal of the solids improved visibility and the water layer could be readily separated. The organic layer was further diluted with ethyl acetate (700 mL) resulting in the separation of more solids which were remove by short-path filtration over a fresh batch of Celite (pre-wetted with MeOH). The filtrate was concentrated to a volume of 30 mL and the formed solids were isolated by filtration and washed with diethyl ether (40 mL) to give 4.8 g (11%) of the desired product as a yellow solid.\n\n\nAn alternative procedure for the preparation is as follows: To a 3-necked flask equipped with stirrer, nitrogen inlet and internal thermometer was charged with 3-amino, 6-bromoisoquinoline (6.0 g, 20.0 mmol), 2-(2′,6′-dimethoxybiphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine (S-Phos) (2.0 g 3.0 mmol), thoroughly freshly degassed DME (200 mL), water (40 mL), and Cs\n2\nCO\n3 \n(46.2 g, 142.0 mmol). The suspension was placed under nitrogen in a pre-heated oil bath at 86° C. Meanwhile, a solution of 1-BOC-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)pyrazole (10.8 g, 36.0 mmol) in degassed DME (30 mL) was prepared and stored under nitrogen. When the internal temperature of the suspension had reached 84° C., the Pd\n2\n(dba)\n3 \n(2.8 g, 3.0 mmol) was added, and quickly followed by dropwise addition of the pyrazole boronate solution (via syringe over 5 min). The resulting bi-phasic dark orange solution was stirred at 84° C. for 20 mins. The flask was then placed in an ice bath to cool rapidly. Once at ambient temperature, the mixture was filtered to remove inorganic substance, washed with water (2×25 mL). Upon reduction of the solution volume via evaporation the solid product was filtered and collected. The light yellow product was washed with ethyl ether 3 time (20 ml) to give a pale yellow solid product. Yield: 6.1 g, 98.4%.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n2-(5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-N-[6-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)isoquinolin-3-yl]acetamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a solution of 2-(5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)acetic acid (219.2 mg, 0.5 mmol) in 5 mL of anhydrous THF was added oxalyl chloride (119.6 mg, 0.95 mmol), and 100 μL of DMF also was added. A effervescence occurred. Within 1-4 minutes the effervescence stopped. The mixture was stirred for 30 minute at room temperature, followed by addition of 6-(1H-Pyrazol-4-yl)-isoquinolin-3-ylamine in 5 mL of pyridine (100.0 mg, 0.5 mmol). The reaction was stirred at the ambient temperature over 16 hours as it was monitored by LC/MS. To the reaction mixture was added K\n2\nCO\n3 \n(196.7 mg, 1.4 mmol) and water (2 mL). The solution was heated to 70° C. for 5 hours.

Activity\n\n\nThe percentage of inhibition (at 1 μM or 10 μM unless otherwise stated) and/or the Ki (in nM unless otherwise stated) for the compounds exemplified in the present application were obtained according to the protocol below:\n\n\n% Inhibition and K\ni \nDetermination\n\n\nA coupled spectrophotometric assay, coupling JNK1α1 activity to the oxidation of β-NADH to NAD+ through the action of pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), was used to determine the potency (percent inhibition at 1 or 10 μM or K\ni\n) of compounds against JNK1α1 (Genbank Accession Number: L26318). The final reaction conditions were as follows: 20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM DTT, 200 μM peptide substrate (KRELVEPLTPSGEAPNQALLR), 300 μM NADH, 500 μM PEP (phophoenolpyruvate), 9-10 units/mL LDH, 8-12 units/mL PK, 40 nM JNK1α1\n—\n364nHis (catalytic domain containing amino acids 1-364 and N-terminal hexahistidine tag, previously activated by MKK4 and MKK7beta in vitro), 0-100 μM test compound, 2.5% DMSO, and 50 μM ATP (2.5×Km). The reaction was monitored by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. The initial reaction rate was determined by the slope of the change in absorbance. To calculate percent inhibition the rate of the reaction in the presence of 1 or 10 μM compound was compared to the rate of the reaction with only DMSO multiplied by 100 percent. Note, the background rate of the above reaction in the presence of 10 μM PHA-00738186 was subtracted from all rates. To calculate the K\ni\n, the reaction rates (with the background subtracted) were plotted vs. the compound concentration (0-100 μM) and fit to the tight binding for competitive inhibitors (Morrison) equation (see below).\n\n\n\nY\n=(−\nX+Eo\n−(\nKi\n*(1\n+A/Km\n))+((\nX−Eo\n+(\nKi\n*(1\n+A/Km\n)))^2+4*\nEo\n*(\nKi\n*(1\n+A/Km\n)))^0.5)*(\nVm*A\n/(\nKm+A\n)/(2*\nEo\n))  Formula:\n\n \n \n \n \nParameters: Eo, Ki, A, Km, Vo\n \nY is initial reaction velocity;\n \nX is inhibitor concentration;\n \nA is [ATP];\n \nKi is inhibition constant;\n \nVm is Vmax;\n \nEo is total (initial) enzyme concentration;\n \nKm is ATP Km;\n \n \n \n\n\nThe compounds were prepared in 100% DMSO at a 40× concentration. For percent inhibition experiments this would be 400 or 40 μM for 10 and 1 μM final concentration, respectively. For the Ki determination 3× serial dilutions were made starting at 4 mM (100 μM at 1×) in DMSO. A total of 11 concentrations were used for the analysis. The compounds were added to the reaction plate first. Next, a solution containing the HEPES, MgCl\n2\n, DTT, peptide substrate, NADH, PEP, PK/LDH enzyme, and JNK1α1\n—\n364nHis enzyme was added to the assay plate. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Then the plate was warmed to 30° C. for 5 minutes. The reaction was initiated with the addition of ATP. The reaction was run in a plate reader at 30° C. for 20 minutes with absorbance readings made about every 10 seconds.\n\n\nJNK1α1 364nHis Purification Procedure\n\n\nGrowth and Induction Conditions\n\n\nBL21 (DE3) cells containing JNK1α1\n—\n364nHis vector were grown at 37° C. until optical density (OD\n600\n) was between 0.6 to 0.8. Expression was induced by addition of isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.1-0.2 mM and incubated at 23° C. overnight.
