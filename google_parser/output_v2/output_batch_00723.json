Description\n\n\n\n\nThe present invention relates to compounds which are useful as pharmaceuticals, to methods for preparing these compounds, compositions containing them and their use in the treatment and prevention of allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis and other inflammatory diseases mediated by prostaglandin D\n2 \n(PGD\n2\n) acting at the CRTH2 and/or the DP receptor on cells including eosinophils, basophils and Th2 lymphocytes.\n\n\nPGD\n2 \nis an eicosanoid, a class of chemical mediator synthesised by cells in response to local tissue damage, normal stimuli or hormonal stimuli or via cellular activation pathways. Eicosanoids bind to specific cell surface receptors on a wide variety of tissues throughout the body and mediate various effects in these tissues. PGD\n2 \nis known to be produced by mast cells, macrophages and Th2 lymphocytes and has been detected in high concentrations in the airways of asthmatic patients challenged with antigen (Murray et al, (1986), \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n315: 800-804). Instillation of PGD\n2 \ninto airways can provoke many features of the asthmatic response including bronchoconstriction (Hardy et al, (1984) \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n311: 209-213; Sampson et al, (1997) \nThorax \n52: 513-518) and eosinophil accumulation (Emery et al, (1989) \nJ. Appl. Physiol. \n67: 959-962).\n\n\nThe potential of exogenously applied PGD\n2 \nto induce inflammatory responses has been confirmed by the use of transgenic mice overexpressing human PGD\n2 \nsynthase which exhibit exaggerated eosinophilic lung inflammation and Th2 cytokine production in response to antigen (Fujitani et al, (2002) \nJ. Immunol. \n168: 443-449).\n\n\nThe first receptor specific for PGD\n2 \nto be discovered was the DP receptor which is linked to elevation of the intracellular levels of cAMP. However, PGD\n2 \nis thought to mediate much of its proinflammatory activity through interaction with a G protein-coupled receptor termed CRTH2 (chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells) which is expressed by Th2 lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils (Hirai et al, (2001) \nJ. Exp. Med. \n193: 255-261, and EP0851030 and EP-A-1211513 and Bauer et al, EP-A-1170594). It seems clear that the effect of PGD\n2 \non the activation of Th2 lymphocytes and eosinophils is mediated through CRTH2 since the selective CRTH2 agonists 13,14 dihydro-15-keto-PGD\n2 \n(DK-PGD\n2\n) and 15R-methyl-PGD\n2 \ncan elicit this response and the effects of PGD\n2 \nare blocked by an anti-CRTH2 antibody (Hirai et al, 2001; Monneret et al, (2003) \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n304: 349-355). In contrast, the selective DP agonist BW245C does not promote migration of Th2 lymphocytes or eosinophils (Hirai et al, 2001; Gervais et al, (2001) \nJ. Allergy Clin. Immunol. \n108: 982-988). Based on this evidence, antagonising PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor is an attractive approach to treat the inflammatory component of Th2-dependent allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis.\n\n\nEP-A-1170594 suggests that the method to which it relates can be used to identify compounds which are of use in the treatment of allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, autoimmune disease, reperfusion injury and a number of inflammatory conditions, all of which are mediated by the action of PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor.\n\n\nCompounds which bind to CRTH2 are taught in WO-A-03066046 and WO-A-03066047. These compounds are not new but were first disclosed, along with similar compounds, in GB 1356834, GB 1407658 and GB 1460348, where they were said to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. WO-A-03066046 and WO-A-03066047 teach that the compounds to which they relate are modulators of CRTH2 receptor activity and are therefore of use in the treatment or prevention of obstructive airway diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a number of other diseases including various conditions of bones and joints, skin and eyes, GI tract, central and peripheral nervous system and other tissues as well as allograft rejection.\n\n\nPL 65781 and JP 43-24418 also relate to indole derivatives which are similar in structure to indomethacin and, like indomethacin, are said to have anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activity. Thus, although this may not have been appreciated at the time when these documents were published, the compounds they describe are COX inhibitors, an activity which is quite different from that of the compounds of the present invention. Indeed, COX inhibitors are contraindicated in the treatment of many of the diseases and conditions, for example asthma and inflammatory bowel disease for which the compounds of the present invention are useful, although they may sometimes be used to treat arthritic conditions.\n\n\nThe present inventors have discovered a series of indole acetic acids which are particularly active antagonists of PGD2 at the CRTH2 receptor.\n\n\nWO-A-9950268, WO-A-0032180, WO-A-0151849 and WO-A-0164205 all relate to indole acetic acids. However, these compounds are said to be aldose reductase inhibitors useful in the treatment of diabetes mellitus (WO-A-9950268, WO-A-0032180 and WO-A-0164205) or hypouricemic agents (WO-A-0151849).\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,363,912 also relates to indole acetic acids which are said to be inhibitors of thromboxane synthetase and to be useful in the treatment of conditions such as thrombosis, ischaemic heart disease and stroke. The compounds are all substituted with a pyridyl group.\n\n\nWO-A-9603376 relates to compounds which are said to be sPLA\n2 \ninhibitors which are useful in the treatment of bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis. These compounds are amides or hydrazides rather than carboxylic acids.\n\n\nJP 2001247570 relates to a method of producing a 3-benzothiazolylmethyl indole acetic acid, which is said to be an aldose reductase inhibitor.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,859,692 relates to compounds which are said to be leukotriene antagonists useful in the treatment of conditions such as asthma, hay fever and allergic rhinitis as well as certain inflammatory conditions such as bronchitis, atopic and ectopic eczema. However, \nJ. Med. Chem., \n6(33), 1781-1790 (1990), which has the same authors as this prior patent application, teaches that compounds with an acetic acid group on the indole nitrogen do not have significant peptidoleukotriene activity. In view of this, it is most surprising that the compounds of the present invention, which all have an acetic acid group on the indole nitrogen, are useful for treating conditions such as asthma, hay fever and allergic rhinitis.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,273,782 is directed imidazole substituted indole acetic acids which are said to be useful in the treatment of conditions such as thrombosis, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, migraine and the vascular complications of diabetes. There is no mention in the document of conditions mediated by the action of PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 3,557,142 relates to 3-substituted-1-indole carboxylic acids and esters which are said to be useful in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.\n\n\nWO-A-03/097598 relates to compounds which are CRTH2 receptor antagonists. They do not have an aromatic substituent.\n\n\nCross et al, \nJ. Med. Chem. \n29, 342-346 (1986) relates to a process for preparing imidazole-substituted indole acetic acids from the corresponding esters. The compounds to which it relates are said to be inhibitors of thromboxane synthetase.\n\n\nEP-A-0539117 relates to indole acetic acid derivatives which are said to be leukotriene antagonists.\n\n\nUS 2003/0153751 relates to compounds which are sPLA\n2 \ninhibitors. All of the exemplified compounds have bulky substituents at the 2- and 5-positions of the indole system.\n\n\nUS 2004/011648 discloses indole acetic acid derivatives which are inhibitors of PAI-1. There is no suggestion that the compounds might have CRTH2 antagonist activity.\n\n\nWO 2004/058164 relates to compounds which are said to be asthma and allergic inflammation modulators. There is no demonstration of any activity for indole acetic acid derivatives.\n\n\nCompounds which bind to the CRTH2 receptor are disclosed in WO-A-03/097042 and WO-A-03/097598. These compounds are indole acetic acids and in WO-A-03/097042 the indole system is fused at the 2-3 positions to a 5-7 membered carbocyclic ring. In WO-A-03/097598 there is a pyrrolidine group at the indole 3-position.\n\n\nWO-A-03/101981 and WO-A-03/101961 both relate to compound which are said to be CRTH2 antagonists and which are indole acetic acids with an —S— or —SO\n2\n— group linked to the indole 3-position.\n\n\nIn our patent application PCT/GB2004/004417, we disclose indole carboxylic acids which are particularly active CRTH2 antagonists. The present application relates to similar compounds which are even more active.\n\n\nIn a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a compound of general formula (I):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein R\n1 \nis halo or cyano;\n\n\nR\n2 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl; and\n\n\nR\n3 \nis phenyl substituted with one or more substituents chosen from C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, halo or —SO\n2\n(C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl);\n\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, complex or prodrug thereof.\n\n\nIn the present specification “C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl” refers to a straight or branched saturated hydrocarbon chain having one to six carbon atoms and optionally substituted with one or more halo substituents or with one or more C\n3\n-C\n7 \ncycloalkyl groups.

Examples of prodrugs include alkyl esters of the compounds of general formula (I), for example the esters of general formula (II) below.\n\n\nIf a chiral centre or another form of isomeric centre is present in a compound of the present invention, all forms of such isomer or isomers, including enantiomers and diastereoisomers, are intended to be covered herein. Compounds of the invention containing a chiral centre may be used as a racemic mixture, an enantiomerically enriched mixture, or the racemic mixture may be separated using well-known techniques and an individual enantiomer may be used alone.\n\n\nIn preferred compounds of the present invention, independently or in combination, R\n1 \nis halo and R\n2 \nis methyl or ethyl.\n\n\nIt is particularly preferred that R\n1 \nis fluoro and R\n2 \nis methyl.\n\n\nEspecially active compounds of the invention include:\n\n \n \n[3-(1-Benzenesulfonyl-1H-pyrrol-2-ylmethyl)-5-fluoro-2-methyl-indol-1-yl]-acetic acid;\n \n{5-Fluoro-2-methyl-3-[1-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-1H-pyrrol-2-ylmethyl]-indol-1-yl}-acetic acid; and\n \n{3-[1-(2,4-Difluoro-benzenesulfonyl)-1H-pyrrol-2-ylmethyl]-5-fluoro-2-methyl-indol-1-yl}-acetic acid.\n \n\n\nParticularly preferred salts of the compounds of the present invention include:\n\n\nthe potassium, sodium, ammonium, lysine, diethylamine, TRIS, piperazine, ethyl diamine and ethanolamine salts.\n\n\nThe compound of general formula (I) may be derived in vivo from a prodrug.

Other active materials may also be present, as may be considered appropriate or advisable for the disease or condition being treated or prevented.\n\n\nThe carrier, or, if more than one be present, each of the carriers, must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient.\n\n\nThe formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, bronchial (inhaled), topical (including eye drops, buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) administration and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\nThe route of administration will depend upon the condition to be treated but preferred compositions are formulated for non-oral delivery, for example, nasal, buccal or topical administration, including topical administration to the eye, intravenous, bronchial, intramuscular, subcutaneous administration.\n\n\nSuch compositions are particularly useful in the treatment of diseases and conditions such as allergic asthma, perennial allergic rhinitis, seasonal allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, contact hypersensitivity (including contact dermatitis), conjunctivitis, especially allergic conjunctivitis, eosinophilic bronchitis, ulcerative colitis, autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, acne, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis.\n\n\nThe composition may be prepared by bringing into association the above defined active agent with the carrier. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active agent with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. The invention extends to methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising bringing a novel compound of general formula (I) or (II) in conjunction or association with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier or vehicle.\n\n\nFormulations for oral administration in the present invention may be presented as: discrete units such as capsules, sachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension of the active agent in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion; or as a bolus etc.\n\n\nFor compositions for oral administration (e.g. tablets and capsules), the term “acceptable carrier” includes vehicles such as common excipients e.g. binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, polyvinylpyrrolidone (Povidone), methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sucrose and starch; fillers and carriers, for example corn starch, gelatin, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium phosphate, sodium chloride and alginic acid; and lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium stearate and other metallic stearates, glycerol stearate stearic acid, silicone fluid, talc waxes, oils and colloidal silica. Flavouring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, cherry flavouring and the like can also be used. It may be desirable to add a colouring agent to make the dosage form readily identifiable. Tablets may also be coated by methods well known in the art.\n\n\nA tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active agent in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active agent.\n\n\nOther formulations suitable for oral administration include lozenges comprising the active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active agent in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active agent in a suitable liquid carrier.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, however, it is preferred that the compound is administered by a route other than the oral route. For topical application to the skin, compounds of general formula (I) or (II) may be made up into a cream, ointment, jelly, solution or suspension etc. Cream or ointment formulations that may be used for the drug are conventional formulations well known in the art, for example, as described in standard text books of pharmaceutics such as the British Pharmacopoeia.\n\n\nCompounds of general formula (I) or (II) may be used for the treatment of the respiratory tract by nasal, bronchial or buccal administration of, for example, aerosols or sprays which can disperse the pharmacological active ingredient in the form of a powder or in the form of drops of a solution or suspension. Pharmaceutical compositions with powder-dispersing properties usually contain, in addition to the active ingredient, a liquid propellant with a boiling point below room temperature and, if desired, adjuncts, such as liquid or solid non-ionic or anionic surfactants and/or diluents. Pharmaceutical compositions in which the pharmacological active ingredient is in solution contain, in addition to this, a suitable propellant, and furthermore, if necessary, an additional solvent and/or a stabiliser. Instead of the propellant, compressed air can also be used, it being possible for this to be produced as required by means of a suitable compression and expansion device.\n\n\nParenteral formulations will generally be sterile.\n\n\nTypically, the dose of the compound will be about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg; so as to maintain the concentration of drug in the plasma at a concentration effective to inhibit PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor. The precise amount of a compound of general formula (I) or (II) which is therapeutically effective, and the route by which such compound is best administered, is readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by comparing the blood level of the agent to the concentration required to have a therapeutic effect.\n\n\nCompounds of general formula (I) or (II) may be used in combination with one or more active agents which are useful in the treatment of the diseases and conditions listed above, although these active agents are not necessarily inhibitors of PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor.\n\n\nTherefore, the pharmaceutical composition described above may additionally contain one or more of these active agents.\n\n\nThere is also provided the use of a compound of general formula (I) or (II) in the preparation of an agent for the treatment of diseases and conditions mediated by PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor, wherein the agent also comprises an additional active agent useful for the treatment of the same diseases and conditions.\n\n\nThese additional active agents which may have a completely different mode of action include existing therapies for allergic and other inflammatory diseases including:\n\n\nβ2 agonists such as salmeterol;\n\n\ncorticosteroids such as fluticasone;\n\n\nantihistamines such as loratidine;\n\n\nleukotriene antagonists such as montelukast;\n\n\nanti-IgE antibody therapies such as omalizumab;\n\n\nanti-infectives such as fusidic acid (particularly for the treatment of atopic dermatitis);\n\n\nanti-fungals such as clotrimazole (particularly for the treatment of atopic dermatitis);\n\n\nimmunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and particularly pimecrolimus in the case of inflammatory skin disease.\n\n\nCRTH2 antagonists may also be combined with therapies that are in development for inflammatory indications including:\n\n\nother antagonists of PGD\n2 \nacting at other receptors, such as DP antagonists;\n\n\ninhibitors of phoshodiesterase type 4 such as cilonilast;\n\n\ndrugs that modulate cytokine production such as inhibitors of TNFα converting enzyme (TACE);\n\n\ndrugs that modulate the activity of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 such as blocking monoclonal antibodies and soluble receptors;\n\n\nPPAR-γ agonists such as rosiglitazone;\n\n\n5-lipoxygenase inhibitors such as zileuton.\n\n\nIn yet a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a product comprising a compound of general formula (I) or (II) and one or more of the agents listed above as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of a disease or condition mediated by the action of PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor.\n\n\nThe invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the following non limiting example.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nPreparation of [3-(1-Benzenesulfonyl-1H-pyrrol-2-ylmethyl)-5-fluoro-2-methyl-indol-1-yl]-acetic acid (Compound 1)\n\n\na.
