Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \n1. Field of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure relates to fluorinated benzothiazole derivatives, a preparation method thereof, and an imaging agent for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease using the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Description of the Related Art\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the turn of this century, with the population gradually aging due to increased human life expectancy, degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease are becoming an important public health issue. The prevalence rate of Alzheimer's disease is 1% in people in their sixties and 20% to 30% in the elderly up to 85 years old. Along with the rise in the prevalence rate due to the increase in life expectancy, the serious progression of the disease and the need for prolonged treatment cause not only psychological and economic hardship to patients and their families, but also much damage to society.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSo far, Alzheimer's disease has been diagnosed from clinical symptoms such as reduction in cognitive capabilities, irreversible amnesia, loss of directional sense, dyslogia, etc., or from reduction in glucose metabolism in parietal lobe areas using [\n18\nF]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). However, the recent direct visualization of beta-amyloid plaques of a degenerative brain allows for a more accurate diagnosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBeta-amyloid plaques were defined by ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) organized by the US NIA (National Institute of Aging) in 2004 as the most potent biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, the quantification of beta-amyloid plaque accumulation using noninvasive in vivo molecular imaging may be a technology with which an epochal development in early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease may be brought about. Methods for allowing for the visualization of beta-amyloid plaques from living individual cells include single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) as a nuclear medicinal analysis method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadiopharmaceuticals to be used will be used at a very small concentration in which pharmacological effects are ruled out, and to visualize beta-amyloid plaques, a significant amount of the pharmaceutical should be introduced into the brain. Then, it should cross the blood brain barrier (hereinafter, ‘BBB’). Thus, in order for radiopharmaceuticals to be used for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease to cross the BBB, a lipophilicity sufficient for diffusion into the cell membrane should be present. In addition, the uptake of ideal radiopharmaceuticals for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease should rapidly occur in a normal human brain, and then they should be released ex vivo in a short time without any interference with the metabolism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong compounds known so far, a Pittsburgh Compound-B (hereinafter, ‘PIB’) labeled with carbon-11, a radioactive isotope, is a marker to identify beta-amyloid plaque deposition in the brain for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and is known as the most potent compound among derivatives of benzothiazoles (hereinafter, ‘BTA’) (Mathis, C. A., Wang. Y., Holt, D. P., Huang, G-F., Debnath, M. L., Klunk, W. E., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n2003, 46:2740-2754; Cai, L., Innis, R. B., Pike, V. W., \nCurr. Med. Chem. \n2007, 14 (1):19-52).

However, C-11 with a short half-life should be used for synthesis of the PIB, and because the marking method is so complicated and its productivity is so low, it is impossible to synthesize the compound in the absence of a cyclotron which can produce C-11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo solve these problems, much research has been conducted on BTA derivatives labeled with iodine-125 and technetium-99m as different kinds of radioactive isotopes as described in Table 1. However, because [\n125\nI]TZDM remains too long in a normal brain and a [99mTc]6-BTA labeled with technetium-99m is too big to cross the BBB of the brain and too polar, it is more difficult to obtain a better brain image than with the PIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuch research has been conducted on the development of BTA radiopharmaceuticals labeled with fluorine-18 using various derivatives. For example, because it is too difficult to label a fluorine-18 directly to the ring of an aromatic compound, a fluorine-18 labeled BTA derivative was developed through the O-alkylation at a hydroxyl group in position 6 of the BTA ring, showing poor results (refer to [\n18\nF]6-C\n3\nH\n6\nF-BTA in Table 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, a fluorine-18 labeled compound ([\n18\nF]AH110690 in Table 1, GE Healthcare) in \nposition\n 3 of the right phenyl of the PIB compound has been developed and is known to be under clinical experiments in Europe since 2008. However, because the compound has a low yield in fluorine-18 labeling of the aromatic ring and the labeling process includes three or more steps, the compound with a 110-minute half life has problems in terms productivity. However, a method of direct fluorine-18 labeling of the aromatic ring may be a result showing that it corresponds to the development strategy of fluorine-18 labeled BTA compounds which will substitute for [\n11\nC]PIB, and so far there has been no case reported of a direct fluorine-18 labeling of the BTA itself, and not of the right phenyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present inventors have synthesized fluorinated BTA derivatives with an excellent bonding force to beta-amyloid plaques as a potent biomarker for Alzheimer's disease and precursors of BTA derivatives which enable direct fluorine-18 labeling of the BTA, confirmed in ex vivo experiments that these BTA derivatives have excellent binding affinity and lipophilicity to beta-amyloid plaques, recognized through in vivo cerebral uptake and elimination rates in normal mice and brain imaging photos in normal humans that they are materials with which diagnostic imaging of Alzheimer's disease is possible, and have made the present invention.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nOne object of the present invention is to provide fluorinated benzothiazole derivatives represented by Chemical Formula 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing the fluorinated benzothiazole derivatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill another object of the present invention is to provide precursors of benzothiazole derivatives represented by Chemical Formula 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEven another object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing the precursors of benzothiazole derivatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another object of the present invention is to provide an imaging agent for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease using fluorinated benzothiazole derivatives represented by Chemical Formula 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther another object of the present invention is to provide a method for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease using the imaging agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to achieve the objects, the present invention provides fluorinated benzothiazole derivatives represented by Chemical Formula 1, precursors of these derivatives represented by Chemical Formula 2, and methods for synthesizing them, represented by Reaction Formulas 1 to 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides an imaging agent for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease using derivatives of Chemical Formula 1, which bind strongly to beta-amyloid plaques as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease and are highly efficient in terms of cerebral uptake and elimination, and a diagnosis method thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the present invention, fluorine-labeled benzothiazole derivatives, which have been difficult to synthesize by conventional methods, may be obtained by simple processes and the thus-obtained benzothiazole derivatives may be useful in diagnosing the presence and severity of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe above and other objects, features and other advantages of the present invention will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n is a graph illustrating results of a normal mouse's in vivo cerebral uptake and release according to Experimental Example 1.3 on compounds of Examples 1, 2, and 3 as derivatives of Chemical Formula 1 of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 2\n, \n3\n, and \n4\n are a group of photographs including brain images captured over 2 hours according to Experimental Example 1.4 on compounds of Examples 1, 2, and 3 as derivatives of Chemical Formula 1 of the present invention.\n\n\n \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\n\n \n \n \nFeatures and advantages of the present invention will be more clearly understood by the following detailed description of the present preferred embodiments by reference to the accompanying drawings.

Then, the lipophilicity of the compound is a significantly important factor, and it is possible to determine the cerebral uptake and release degree initially with the factor. For this purpose, the distribution ratio of octanol to water buffer of the compound to be measured may be measured to determine the relative lipophilicity of each compound. The experimental method is as follows: A mixture of 5 ml of 1-octanol and 5 ml of 1 M PBS buffer was prepared, each compound (0.37 MBq) in Examples 1 to 3 was dissolved in ethanol (0.1 ml), and the resulting solution was introduced into the mixture. The mixture was vortexed at room temperature for 5 minutes and then was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. 4 ml was withdrawn from the octanol layer of the solution, introduced into a new tube, and another 4 ml of 1 M PBS buffer was introduced into the tube. The mixture was vortexed at room temperature for 5 minutes and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. 50 μl was withdrawn from the octanol layer and introduced into a test tube, and 500 μl was withdrawn from the 1 M PBS buffer and introduced into the test tube. 3 ml was withdrawn from the octanol layer and introduced into another test tube, and another 3 ml of 1 M PBS buffer was added into the test tube. The mixture was vortexed at room temperature for 5 minutes and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. 50 μl was withdrawn from the octanol layer and introduced into a test tube, and 500 μl was withdrawn from the 1 M PBS buffer and introduced into the test tube. 2 ml was withdrawn from the octanol layer and introduced into another test tube, and another 2 ml of the PBS buffer. The mixture was vortexed at room temperature for 5 minutes and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. 50 μl was withdrawn from the octanol layer and introduced into a test tube, and 500 μl was withdrawn from the 1 M PBS buffer and introduced into the test tube. The process was repeated three times as in the above way. Each of the octanol and 1 M PBS buffer in the test tube was measured using a gamma counter, and the results were substituted into the following \nFormula\n 1 to obtain a log P value.\n\n\n \n \n \nlog \nP\n=[octanol]/[buffer]  <\nFormula\n 1>\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe log P vales of three compounds (Examples 1, 2, and 3) among the [\n18\nF]fluorine benzothiazole derivatives were measured and the values are as follows.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound in Examples\n\n\nLog P value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n3.93\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n3.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n4.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReferring to Table 2, a log P value (partition coefficient) in Example 1 where a methyl was not substituted into an amine group was smaller than that in Example 3 where two methyl groups were substituted, and it was determined that the value was similar to a value expected from the structure the derivative. In addition, the log P value in Example 2 was 3.11, from which it may be deduced that the compound in Example 2 was probably the fastest in release after cerebral uptake from among the three compounds.\n\n\n \nExperimental Example\n\n\nMeasurement of Binding Affinity to Beta-Amyloid Plaques\n\n\n \n \n \n1.1. Preparation of Beta-Amyloid Fibrils\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to measure a binding force to the beta-amyloid plaques of the fluorinated benzothiazole derivatives according to the present invention, fibrils were prepared through the following experiment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fibril solution, in which 1 mg of each of beta-amyloid plaque peptides (Aβ\n1-40 \nand Aβ\n1-42\n) to be used for analysis was dissolved in 1.155 ml of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (Na\n2\nEDTA) solution, was introduced into 20 mM PBS buffer (pH 7.4), a sonication was performed for 30 minutes, and then the mixture was incubated with stirring for 3 days at 30° C. The thus-obtained solution was high speed centrifuged (28,000 g for 15 minutes) at 4° C., and the supernatant was collected. The precipitate was washed twice with 100 μl of a mixture solution of 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt and 10 mM PBS buffer. The precipitate was resuspended in 2.310 ml of 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt and 10 mM PBS buffer, and the suspended sold produced was divided into equal aliquots of 30 μl and kept at −80° C. The concentration of fibrils in the aliquots of 30 μl was 100 μM, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1.2. Measurement of Binding Affinity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe radioactive ligand to be used for binding analysis was 2-(3-[125I]iodo-4′-N-methylaminophenyl)benzothiazole with the specific radioactivity of 8.05×10\n16 \nBq/mol, and K\nd \nvalues for the known Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-40 were 2.30±0.33 nM and 0.44±0.25 nM. Each tube to be used in measurement was filled with 860 μl of 10% ethanol physiological saline solution, and the compounds at 10\n−4 \nto 10\n−9 \nM were dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 10% ethanol to form solutions. Each of 40 μl of the solutions was introduced into the tube, respectively. 50 μl of [\n125\nI]TZDM (32 kBq/ml) and 50 μl of beta-amyloid fibrils dissolved in the prepared PBS (30 μl of aliquots prepared was diluted 200-fold with PBS solution and the final concentration was 20 nM when 50 μl was used) were introduced into the tube. A mixed solution with a total volume of 1000 μl was incubated at room temperature for 3 hours, and then a Whatman GF/B filter was used to separate the solution into unbound radioactive materials and bound radioactive materials. Then, each tube was washed three times with 3 μl of 10% ethanol. The radioactivity was measured using an automatic gamma counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinity (Ki) to beta-amyloid fibrils of the compounds of the present invention was measured, and the results were shown in the following Table 3.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAβ1-40\n\n\nAβ1-42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n52.4\n\n\n22.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n13.3\n\n\n7.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n7.9\n\n\n1.86\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs indicated in Table 3, the compounds obtained in Examples 4, 5, and 6 of the present invention showed binding affinities similar to that of [\n11\nC]PIB(Aβ\n1-40\n, 4.3), a representative benzothiazole-series beta-amyloid plaque-imaging radiopharmaceutical, and particularly, the compounds in Example 6 showed the best binding affinity among compounds so far developed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1.3 Evaluation of In Vivo Cerebral Uptake and Release Degree in a Normal Mouse\n\n\n \n \n \n \n6 week-old ICR mice were used for experiments on cerebral uptake and release degree of three 6-[18F]fluorine-2-allylbenzothiazole derivatives (compounds in Examples 1 to 3) in a mouse over time. Each of the compounds in Examples 1 to 3 was dissolved in physiological saline solution containing 5% ethanol, and each of 200 μl (100 μCi) of the solutions was injected through the tail vein of the mouse. 2, 30, and 60 minutes were selected as in-vivo retention time periods, and 4 to 7 mice were used in each time period. After the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation in each time period, the brains were quickly removed, they were separated into three parts of cortex, cerebellum, and remnant on filter paper kept on ice, respectively, and blood was collected.

From the values into which the radioactivity remaining in the in vivo cortex per hour was calculated as a percentage, it was confirmed that the compounds were very quickly released. From the pre-clinical results, it can be known that the derivatives of the present invention are quickly released in a normal mouse brain without beta-amyloid plaques in 1 hour and are a promising compound which enhances the quality of background imaging and provides an accuracy of diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. It was shown that the compound in Example 3, which had high binding affinity to ex vivo beta-amyloid fibrils, had a relatively lower initial cerebral uptake and a slower 60-minute removal rate than those of the other compounds, due to the lipophilicity of the compound itself.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1.4. Evaluation of the Brain Imaging of Normal Male Volunteers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the compounds (196 MBq) in Examples 2 and 3 of the present invention was dissolved in 6 ml of physiological saline solution including 5% ethanol, the resulting solution was intravenously injected into a normal volunteer (male, 37 years old, 78 kg), and Static Images of the brain from the injection to 2 hours were obtained through a Phillips Allegro PET scanner. The protocol of the brain imaging repeated emission and transmission as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n[2 minute emission+transmission]×four times\n\n\n\n \n \n \n[5 minute emission+transmission]×four times\n\n\n\n \n \n \n[10 minute emission+transmission]×three times\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor attenuation correction, a Cs-137 radiation source prior to the administration was used to obtain a one-and-a half minute transmission scan per bed (18 cm). The transmission image and a 3D Row-Action Maximum-Likelihood (RAMLA) algorithm were used to reconstruct an attenuation corrected image. The 3D voxel size was 2.0×2.0×2.0 mm and the matrix size was 128×128×90 (\nFIGS. 2 and 3\n).

From these, it can be known that the wash-out of the cortices in Examples 2 and 3 of the present invention decreased similarly to that of the cerebellum. However, it can be known that the cinerea showed a slow wash-out. It can be known that this was the same result as the PIB images developed in the prior art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the \nFIGS. 2 to 4\n showing release images from administration to 2 hours, it can be known that the derivatives according to the present invention were quickly released in 2 hours, and that these effects are even better especially in the compound in Example 2 than in the others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims."

No. 60/719,477, filed Sep. 21, 2005, all incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nCholinergic muscarinic receptors are members of the G-protein coupled receptor super-family and are further divided into 5 subtypes, M\n1 \nto M\n5\n. Muscarinic receptor sub-types are widely and differentially expressed in the body. Genes have been cloned for all 5 sub-types and of these, M\n1\n, M\n2 \nand M\n3 \nreceptors have been extensively pharmacologically characterized in animal and human tissue. M\n1 \nreceptors are expressed in the brain (cortex and hippocampus), glands and in the ganglia of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. M\n2 \nreceptors are expressed in the heart, hindbrain, smooth muscle and in the synapses of the autonomic nervous system. M\n3 \nreceptors are expressed in the brain, glands and smooth muscle. In the airways, stimulation of M\n3 \nreceptors evokes contraction of airway smooth muscle leading to bronchoconstriction, while in the salivary gland M\n3 \nreceptor stimulation increases fluid and mucus secretion leading to increased salivation. M\n2 \nreceptors expressed on smooth muscle are understood to be pro-contractile while pre-synaptic M\n2 \nreceptors modulate acetylcholine release from parasympathetic nerves. Stimulation of M\n2 \nreceptors expressed in the heart produces bradycardia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nShort and long-acting muscarinic antagonists are used in the management of asthma and COPD; these include the short acting agents Atrovent® (ipratropium bromide) and Oxivent® (oxitropium bromide) and the long acting agent Spiriva® (tiotropium bromide). These compounds produce bronchodilation following inhaled administration. In addition to improvements in spirometric values, anti-muscarinic use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with improvements in health status and quality of life scores. As a consequence of the wide distribution of muscarinic receptors in the body, significant systemic exposure to muscarinic antagonists is associated with effects such as dry mouth, constipation, mydriasis, urinary retention (all predominantly mediated via blockade of M\n3 \nreceptors) and tachycardia (mediated by blockade of M\n2 \nreceptors). A commonly reported side-effect following inhaled administration of therapeutic dose of the current, clinically used non-selective muscarinic antagonists is dry-mouth and while this is reported as only mild in intensity it does limit the dose of inhaled agent given.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, there is still a need for improved M\n3 \nreceptor antagonists that would have an appropriate pharmacological profile, for example in term of potency, pharmacokinetics or duration of action. In this context, the present invention relates to novel M\n3 \nreceptor antagonists. In particular, there is a need for M\n3 \nreceptor antagonists that would have a pharmacological profile suitable for an administration by the inhalation route.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe scientific literature discloses many compounds having a muscarinic receptor antagonist activity.

The resulting salt may precipitate out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionisation in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may exist in a continuum of solid states ranging from fully amorphous to fully crystalline. The term ‘amorphous’ refers to a state in which the material lacks long range order at the molecular level and, depending upon temperature, may exhibit the physical properties of a solid or a liquid. Typically such materials do not give distinctive X-ray diffraction patterns and, while exhibiting the properties of a solid, are more formally described as a liquid. Upon heating, a change from solid to liquid properties occurs which is characterised by a change of state, typically second order (‘glass transition’). The term ‘crystalline’ refers to a solid phase in which the material has a regular ordered internal structure at the molecular level and gives a distinctive X-ray diffraction pattern with defined peaks. Such materials when heated sufficiently will also exhibit the properties of a liquid, but the change from solid to liquid is characterised by a phase change, typically first order (‘melting point’).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. The term ‘solvate’ is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term ‘hydrate’ is employed when said solvent is water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA currently accepted classification system for organic hydrates is one that defines isolated site, channel, or metal-ion coordinated hydrates—see \nPolymorphism in Pharmaceutical Solids \nby K. R. Morris (Ed. H. G. Brittain, Marcel Dekker, 1995). Isolated site hydrates are ones in which the water molecules are isolated from direct contact with each other by intervening organic molecules. In channel hydrates, the water molecules lie in lattice channels where they are next to other water molecules. In metal-ion coordinated hydrates, the water molecules are bonded to the metal ion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water/solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included within the scope of the invention are multi-component complexes (other than salts and solvates) wherein the drug and at least one other component are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Complexes of this type include clathrates (drug-host inclusion complexes) and co-crystals. The latter are typically defined as crystalline complexes of neutral molecular constituents which are bound together through non-covalent interactions, but could also be a complex of a neutral molecule with a salt. Co-crystals may be prepared by melt crystallisation, by recrystallisation from solvents, or by physically grinding the components together—see Chem Commun, 17, 1889-1896, by O. Almarsson and M. J. Zaworotko (2004). For a general review of multi-component complexes, see J Pharm Sci, 64 (8), 1269-1288, by Haleblian (August 1975).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also exist in a mesomorphic state (mesophase or liquid crystal) when subjected to suitable conditions. The mesomorphic state is intermediate between the true crystalline state and the true liquid state (either melt or solution). Mesomorphism arising as the result of a change in temperature is described as ‘thermotropic’ and that resulting from the addition of a second component, such as water or another solvent, is described as ‘lyotropic’. Compounds that have the potential to form lyotropic mesophases are described as ‘amphiphilic’ and consist of molecules which possess an ionic (such as —COO\n−\nNa\n+\n, —COO\n−\nK\n+\n, or —SO\n3\n \n−\nNa\n+\n) or non-ionic (such as —N\n−\nN\n+\n(CH\n3\n)\n3\n) polar head group.

Stuart, 4\nth \nEdition (Edward Arnold, 1970).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHereinafter all references to compounds of formula (I) include references to salts, solvates, multi-component complexes and liquid crystals thereof and to solvates, multi-component complexes and liquid crystals of salts thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention include compounds of formula (I) as hereinbefore defined, including all polymorphs and crystal habits thereof, prodrugs and isomers thereof (including optical, geometric and tautomeric isomers) as hereinafter defined and isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs indicated, so-called ‘prodrugs’ of the compounds of formula (I) are also within the scope of the invention. Thus certain derivatives of compounds of formula (I) which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into compounds of formula (I) having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as ‘prodrugs’. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in \nPro\n-\ndrugs as Novel Delivery Systems\n, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T. Higuchi and W. Stella) and \nBioreversible Carriers in Drug Design\n, Pergamon Press, 1987 (Ed. E. B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of formula (I) with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as ‘pro-moieties’ as described, for example, in \nDesign of Prodrugs \nby H. Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include\n\n \n \n \n(i) where the compound of formula (I) contains a carboxylic acid functionality (—COOH), an ester thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid functionality of the compound of formula (I) is replaced by (C\n1\n-C\n8\n)alkyl;\n \n(ii) where the compound of formula (I) contains an alcohol functionality (—OH), an ether thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the alcohol functionality of the compound of formula (I) is replaced by (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyloxymethyl; and\n \n(iii) where the compound of formula (I) contains a primary or secondary amino functionality (—NH\n2 \nor —NHR where R≠H), an amide thereof, for example, a compound wherein, as the case may be, one or both hydrogens of the amino functionality of the compound of formula (I) is/are replaced by (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkanoyl.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nFurther examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, certain compounds of formula (I) may themselves act as prodrugs of other compounds of formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included within the scope of the invention are metabolites of compounds of formula that is, compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug. Some examples of metabolites in accordance with the invention include\n\n \n \n \n(i) where the compound of formula (I) contains a methyl group, an hydroxymethyl derivative thereof (—CH\n3\n—>—CH\n2\nOH):\n \n(ii) where the compound of formula (I) contains an alkoxy group, an hydroxy derivative thereof (—OR—>—OH);\n \n(iii) where the compound of formula (I) contains a tertiary amino group, a secondary amino derivative thereof (—NR\n1\nR\n2\n—>—NHR\n1 \nor —NHR\n2\n);\n \n(iv) where the compound of formula (I) contains a secondary amino group, a primary derivative thereof (—NHR\n1\n—>—NH\n2\n);\n \n(v) where the compound of formula (I) contains a phenyl moiety, a phenol derivative thereof (—Ph—>—PhOH); and\n \n(vi) where the compound of formula (I) contains an amide group, a carboxylic acid derivative thereof (—CONH\n2\n—>COOH).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (I) containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound of formula (I) contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cis/trans (or Z/E) isomers are possible. Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier, tautomeric isomerism (‘tautomerism’) can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds of formula (I) containing, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group, or so-called valence tautomerism in compounds which contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncluded within the scope of the present invention are all stereoisomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the compounds of formula I, including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, and mixtures of one or more thereof. Also included are acid addition or base salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, d-lactate or l-lysine, or racemic, for example, dl-tartrate or dl-arginine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCis/trans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallisation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound of formula (I) contains an acidic or basic moiety, a base or acid such as 1-phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% by volume of isopropanol, typically from 2% to 20%, and from 0 to 5% by volume of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen any racemate crystallises, crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound (true racemate) referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile both of the crystal forms present in a racemic mixture have identical physical properties, they may have different physical properties compared to the true racemate. Racemic mixtures may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art—see, for example, \nStereochemistry of Organic Compounds \nby E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen (Wiley, 1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I) wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number which predominates in nature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, such as \n2\nH and \n3\nH, carbon, such as \n11\nC, \n13\nC and \n14\nC, chlorine, such as \n36\nCl, fluorine, such as \n18\nF, iodine, such as \n123\nI and \n125\nI, nitrogen, such as \n13\nN and \n15\nN, oxygen, such as \n15\nO, \n17\nO and \n18\nO, phosphorus, such as \n32\nP, and sulphur, such as \n35\nS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain isotopically-labelled compounds of formula I, for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. \n3\nH, and carbon-14, i.e. \n14\nC, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. \n2\nH, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n15\nO and \n13\nN, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D\n2\nO, d\n6\n-acetone, d\n6\n-DMSO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso within the scope of the invention are intermediate compounds of formula II as hereinbefore defined, all salts, solvates and complexes thereof and all solvates and complexes of salts thereof as defined hereinbefore for compounds of formula I. The invention includes all polymorphs of the aforementioned species and crystal habits thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen preparing compounds of formula (I) in accordance with the invention, it is open to a person skilled in the art to routinely select the form of compound of formula II which provides the best combination of features for this purpose. Such features include the melting point, solubility, processability and yield of the intermediate form and the resulting ease with which the product may be purified on isolation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) should be assessed for their biopharmaceutical properties, such as solubility and solution stability (across pH), permeability, etc., in order to select the most appropriate dosage form and route of administration for treatment of the proposed indication.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention intended for pharmaceutical use may be administered as crystalline or amorphous products. They may be obtained, for example, as solid plugs, powders, or films by methods such as precipitation, crystallization, freeze drying, spray drying, or evaporative drying. Microwave or radio frequency drying may be used for this purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThey may be administered alone or in combination with one or more other compounds of the invention or in combination with one or more other drugs (or as any combination thereof).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, they will be administered as a formulation in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The term ‘excipient’ is used herein to describe any ingredient other than the compound(s) of the invention. The choice of excipient will to a large extent depend on factors such as the particular mode of administration, the effect of the excipient on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosage form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for the delivery of compounds of the present invention and methods for their preparation will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Such compositions and methods for their preparation may be found, for example, in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n19th Edition (Mack Publishing Company, 1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be administered orally. Oral administration may involve swallowing, so that the compound enters the gastrointestinal tract, and/or buccal, lingual, or sublingual administration by which the compound enters the blood stream directly from the mouth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations suitable for oral administration include solid, semi-solid and liquid systems such as tablets; soft or hard capsules containing multi- or nano-particulates, liquids, or powders; lozenges (including liquid-filled); chews; gels; fast dispersing dosage forms; films; ovules; sprays; and buccal/mucoadhesive patches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid formulations include suspensions, solutions, syrups and elixirs. Such formulations may be employed as fillers in soft or hard capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) and typically comprise a carrier, for example, water, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, methylcellulose, or a suitable oil, and one or more emulsifying agents and/or suspending agents. Liquid formulations may also be prepared by the reconstitution of a solid, for example, from a sachet.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also be used in fast-dissolving, fast-disintegrating dosage forms such as those described in Expert Opinion in Therapeutic Patents, 11 (6), 981-986, by Liang and Chen (2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor tablet dosage forms, depending on dose, the drug may make up from 1 weight % to 80 weight % of the dosage form, more typically from 5 weight % to 60 weight % of the dosage form. In addition to the drug, tablets generally contain a disintegrant. Examples of disintegrants include sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polyvinylpyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, lower alkyl-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, starch, pregelatinised starch and sodium alginate. Generally, the disintegrant will comprise from 1 weight % to 25 weight %, preferably from 5 weight % to 20 weight % of the dosage form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinders are generally used to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet formulation. Suitable binders include microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, sugars, polyethylene glycol, natural and synthetic gums, polyvinylpyrrolidone, pregelatinised starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Tablets may also contain diluents, such as lactose (monohydrate, spray-dried monohydrate, anhydrous and the like), mannitol, xylitol, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, starch and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTablets may also optionally comprise surface active agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate 80, and glidants such as silicon dioxide and talc. When present, surface active agents may comprise from 0.2 weight % to 5 weight % of the tablet, and glidants may comprise from 0.2 weight % to 1 weight % of the tablet.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTablets also generally contain lubricants such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate, and mixtures of magnesium stearate with sodium lauryl sulphate. Lubricants generally comprise from 0.25 weight % to 10 weight %, preferably from 0.5 weight % to 3 weight % of the tablet.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther possible ingredients include anti-oxidants, colourants, flavouring agents, preservatives and taste-masking agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary tablets contain up to about 80% drug, from about 10 weight % to about 90 weight % binder, from about 0 weight % to about 85 weight % diluent, from about 2 weight % to about 10 weight % disintegrant, and from about 0.25 weight % to about 10 weight % lubricant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTablet blends may be compressed directly or by roller to form tablets. Tablet blends or portions of blends may alternatively be wet-, dry-, or melt-granulated, melt congealed, or extruded before tabletting. The final formulation may comprise one or more layers and may be coated or uncoated; it may even be encapsulated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulation of tablets is discussed in \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets\n, Vol. 1, by H. Lieberman and L. Lachman (Marcel Dekker, New York, 1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsumable oral films for human or veterinary use are typically pliable water-soluble or water-swellable thin film dosage forms which may be rapidly dissolving or mucoadhesive and typically comprise a compound of formula I, a film-forming polymer, a binder, a solvent, a humectant, a plasticiser, a stabiliser or emulsifier, a viscosity-modifying agent and a solvent. Some components of the formulation may perform more than one function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of formula (I) may be water-soluble or insoluble. A water-soluble compound typically comprises from 1 weight % to 80 weight %, more typically from 20 weight % to 50 weight %, of the solutes. Less soluble compounds may comprise a greater proportion of the composition, typically up to 88 weight % of the solutes. Alternatively, the compound of formula (I) may be in the form of multiparticulate beads.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe film-forming polymer may be selected from natural polysaccharides, proteins, or synthetic hydrocolloids and is typically present in the range 0.01 to 99 weight %, more typically in the range 30 to 80 weight %.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther possible ingredients include anti-oxidants, colorants, flavourings and flavour enhancers, preservatives, salivary stimulating agents, cooling agents, co-solvents (including oils), emollients, bulking agents, anti-foaming agents, surfactants and taste-masking agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFilms in accordance with the invention are typically prepared by evaporative drying of thin aqueous films coated onto a peelable backing support or paper. This may be done in a drying oven or tunnel, typically a combined coater dryer, or by freeze-drying or vacuuming.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid formulations for oral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable modified release formulations for the purposes of the invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,106,864. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles are to be found in \nPharmaceutical Technology On\n-\nline \n25(2), 1-14, by Verma et al (2001). The use of chewing gum to achieve controlled release is described in WO 00/35298.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered directly into the blood stream, into muscle, or into an internal organ. Suitable means for parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular, intrasynovial and subcutaneous. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a sterile non-aqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions, for example, by lyophilisation, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solubility of compounds of formula (I) used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Thus compounds of the invention may be formulated as a suspension or as a solid, semi-solid, or thixotropic liquid for administration as an implanted depot providing modified release of the active compound. Examples of such formulations include drug-coated stents and semi-solids and suspensions comprising drug-loaded poly(dl-lactic-coglycolic)acid (PGLA) microspheres.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered topically, (intra)dermally, or transdermally to the skin or mucosa. Typical formulations for this purpose include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, wafers, implants, sponges, fibres, bandages and microemulsions. Liposomes may also be used. Typical carriers include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Penetration enhancers may be incorporated—see, for example, J Pharm Sci, 88 (10), 955-958, by Finnin and Morgan (October 1999).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther means of topical administration include delivery by electroporation, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, sonophoresis and microneedle or needle-free (e.g. Powderject™, Bioject™ etc.) injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for topical administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler, as an aerosol spray from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane, or as nasal drops. For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pressurised container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebuliser contains a solution or suspension of the compound(s) of the invention comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilising, or extending release of the active, a propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisation, or spray drying.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCapsules (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as l-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable solution formulation for use in an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1 μg to 20 mg of the compound of the invention per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1 μl to 100 μl. A typical formulation may comprise a compound of formula I, propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable flavours, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for inhaled/intranasal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for inhaled/intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release using, for example, PGLA. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve which delivers a metered amount. Units in accordance with the invention are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or “puff” containing from 0.001 mg to 10 mg of the compound of formula (I). The overall daily dose will typically be in the range 0.001 mg to 40 mg which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) are particularly suitable for an administration by inhalation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be administered rectally or vaginally, for example, in the form of a suppository, pessary, or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, but various alternatives may be used as appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for rectal/vaginal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronised suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, gels, biodegradable (e.g. absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (e.g. silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis. Formulations for ocular/aural administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted, or programmed release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubiliser. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in International Patent Applications Nos. WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInasmuch as it may desirable to administer a combination of active compounds, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound in accordance with the invention, may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus the kit of the invention comprises two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of formula (I) in accordance with the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically comprises directions for administration and may be provided with a so-called memory aid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor administration to human patients, the total daily dose of the compounds of the invention is typically in the range 0.001 mg to 5000 mg depending, of course, on the mode of administration. For example, oral administration may require a total daily dose of from 0.1 mg to 1000 mg, while an intravenous dose may only require from 0.001 mg to 100 mg.

Tracheas are dissected from the larynx to the entry point into the chest cavity and then placed in fresh, oxygenated, modified Krebs buffer solution (Krebs containing 10 μM propranolol, 10 μM guanethidine and 3 μM indomethacin) at room temperature. The tracheas are opened by cutting through the cartilage opposite the trachealis muscle. Strips approximately 3-5 cartilage rings wide are cut. A cotton thread is attached to the cartilage at one end of the strip for attachment to the force transducer and a cotton loop made at the other end to anchor the tissue in the organ bath. The strips are mounted in 5 ml organ baths filled with warm (37° C.) aerated modified Krebs. The pump flow rate is set to 1.0 ml/min and the tissues washed continuously. Tissues are placed under an initial tension of 1000 mg. Tissues are re-tensioned after 15 and 30 minutes, then allowed to equilibrate for a further 30-45 minutes. Tissues are subjected to electrical field stimulation (EFS) of the following parameters: 10 s trains every 2 minutes, 0.1 ms pulse width, 10 Hz and 10-30V. The voltage is raised 5V every 10 min within the stated range until a maximum contractile response for each tissue is observed. This just maximum voltage for each tissue is then used throughout the remainder of the experiment. Following equilibration to EFS for 20 min, the pump is stopped, and after 15 min control readings are taken over a 8-10 min period (4-5 responses). Compound is then added to each tissue as a bolus dose at 30 xKi (determined at the human M\n3 \nreceptor expressed in CHO cells in a filtration binding assay), and left to incubate for 2 h. Compound is then washed from tissues using a rapid wash with modified Krebs for 1 min and flow is restored to 1 ml/min for the remainder of the experiment. At the end of the experiment tissues are challenged with histamine (10/1) to determine viability. Readings taken during the experiment are automatically collected using Notocord® software. The raw data are converted into percent response taking into account measurements of inhibition of the EFS response. After starting washout, the times taken for the tissue to recover by 25% from the inhibition induced are recorded and used as a measure of compound duration of action. Tissue viability limits the duration of the experiment to 16 h post-compound washout. Compounds are typically tested at n=2 to 5 to estimate duration of action.\n\n\n \nAlternatively the Following Guinea Pig Trachea Assay can Also be Used:\n\n\n \n \n \nTrachea were removed from male Dunkin-Hartley guinea-pigs (wt 350-450 g) and following removal of adherent connective tissue, an incision was made through the cartilage opposite the trachealis muscle and tracheal strips 3-5 cartilage rings wide prepared. The tracheal strips were suspended between an isometric strain gauge and a fixed tissue hook with the muscle in the horizontal plane in 5 ml tissue baths under an initial tension of 1 g and bathed in warmed (37° C.) aerated (95% O\n2\n15% CO\n2\n) Krebs solution containing 3 μM indomethacin and 10 μM guanethidine. The tissues were positioned between parallel platinum wire electrodes (˜1 cm gap). A constant 1 ml/min flow of fresh Krebs solution (of the above composition) was maintained through the tissue baths using peristaltic pumps. The tissues were allowed to equilibrate for an hour with re-tensioning to 1 g at 15 min and 30 min from the start of the equilibration period. At the end of the equilibration, tissues were electrically field stimulated (EFS) using the following parameters: 10 y, 10 Hz 0.1 ms pulse width with 10 sec trains every 2 min. In each tissue a voltage response curve was constructed over the range 10 v-30V (keeping all other stimulation parameters constant) to determine a just maximal stimulation. Using these stimulation parameters EFS responses were 100% nerve mediated and 100% cholinergic as confirmed by blockade by 1 μM tetrodotoxin or 1 μM atropine. Tissues were then repeatedly stimulated at 2 min intervals until the responses were reproducible. The peristaltic pump was stopped 20 min prior to the addition of the study compound and the average twitch contraction over the last 10 min recorded as the control response. The study compound was added to the tissue baths, with each tissue receiving a single concentration of compound and allowed to equilibrate for 2 h. At 2 h post addition the inhibition of the EFS response was recorded and IC\n50 \ncurves generated using a range of compound concentrations over tracheal strips from the same animal. The tissues were then rapidly washed and the 1 ml/min perfusion with Krebs solution re-established. Tissues were stimulated for a further 16 h and recovery of the EFS response recorded. At the end of the 16 h, 10 μM histamine was added to the baths to confirm tissue viability. The just max concentration (tested concentration giving a response >70% inhibition but less than 100%) of antagonist was identified from the IC\n50 \ncurve and the time to 25% recovery of the induced inhibition (T\n25\n) calculated in tissues receiving this concentration. Compounds are typically tested at n=2 to 5 to estimate duration of action."

Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to an aptamer for NGF, a method of utilizing the same, and the like.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nNerve growth factor (NGF) is the first neurotrophin identified in 1951, and is an important secretory protein involved in the development and survival of peripheral and central neurons. It consists of 118 amino acids, has a molecular weight of 13 kDa, and has S—S bonds at 3 positions in a molecule. BDNF, NT-3 and NT-4/5 are present in the family protein, which are structurally well conserved and form a homodimer by a noncovalent bond. It has a β sheet structure facing 3 different directions, and is considered to be dimerized in this part. It also has four loop structures with low homology among families, and these parts are considered to define specificity to receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs NGF receptors, tyrosine kinase-type receptor TrkA with high affinity and p75 with low affinity which belongs to a tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily are known. These receptors act as a homodimer or heterodimer and are deeply involved in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. TrkA is a single-pass transmembrane receptor and has a tyrosine kinase structure in the intracellular domain. When NGF is bound, tyrosine phosphorylation occurs, the signal is transmitted to the downstream, and promotion of differentiation and survival maintenance of the cell occur.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs family receptors of TrkA, TrkB and TrkC are known. TrkB is bound to BDNF and NT-4/5, and TrkC is bound to NT-3. p75 shows lower ligand specificity as compared to TrkA and is also bound to BDNF, NT-3 and NT-4/5 besides NGF. While p75 is a single-pass transmembrane receptor, it does not have a tyrosine kinase domain on the cytoplasmic side. Like TrkA, it is expressed not only in nerve cells but also in non-nerve cells. This receptor is known to be involved in the promotion of differentiation and survival maintenance of the cell, as well as related to the induction of apoptosis and cell migration. The results of crystal structure analysis have suggested that an NGF homodimer binds to TrkA at 2:2 and to p75 at 2:1. An NGF homodimer sometimes binds to a heterodimer of TrkA and p75.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNGF is produced by Schwann cell, keratinized cell, bronchial epithelial cell, fibroblast, T lymphocyte, macrophage, mast cell, B lymphocyte, keratinocyte, smooth muscle cell, renal glomerular cell, skeletal muscle cell and the like. On the other hand, TrkA is known to be expressed in nerve cell, as well as monocyte, T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte and mast cell other than nerve cell. Similarly, p75 is expressed in nerve cell as well as non-nerve cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well known that NGF plays a key role in the nervous system. It has been clarified that NGF has an action to maintain survival of cholinergic neuron and is considered to be related in some way to Alzheimer's disease. In addition, since intracerebral administration of NGF improves memory disorders of old rats, it is also expected as a therapeutic drug for senile dementia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been found that NGF also acts on the tissues and cells other than the nervous system, and involved in the body's defense and tissue repair process. For example, it is known that administration of NGF to an animal increases blood vessel permeability, enhances immune responses of T cell and B cell, induces differentiation of lymphocytes, induces growth of mast cells, induces release of various cytokines from mast cells and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNGF is related to inflammation, and increased expression of NGF has been observed in patients with inflammatory diseases and inflammatory animal models. Systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, arthritis, interstitial cystitis, asthma and the like are the examples thereof. It has been reported that the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis shows higher NGF concentration. In addition, increased NGF expression in rheumatoid arthritis model rats, and increase in mast cells and increased NGF expression in arthritis model mouse have been reported.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNGF is deeply involved in pain. When NGF is subcutaneously administered to human, a deep pain such as muscular pain continues for several days, and hyperalgesia of the injection site occurs. NGF knockout mouse and TrkA knockout mouse lacks unmyelinated nerve and do not feel pain. When NGF is intraperitoneally administered at 1 mg/kg to a mature rat, hyperalgesia against noxious heat and mechanical stimuli occurs. NGF transgenic mouse shows hyperalgesia unaccompanied by inflammatory conditions. In addition, it is known that the TrkA gene of patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) has abnormality, and pain sensation decreases when NGF gene has abnormality.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the above, an NGF inhibitor can be used as a therapeutic drug for pain such as nociceptive pain, inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain, carcinomatous pain, fibromyalgia pain and the like. A combination therapy of NGF antibody and NSAID (WO04/073653), a combination therapy of NGF antibody and opioid analgesic (WO04/096122), a treatment method of postsurgical pain using an NGF antibody (WO04/032870, WO05/000194), a treatment method of pain of bone cancer using an NGF antibody (WO05/111077), and a treatment method of pain of osteoarthritis using an NGF antibody (WO06/110883) have been reported.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTanezumab (PF-4383119 or RN624) is an antibody against NGF, shows effect in pain model experiment using an osteoarthritis animal model, and is currently under clinical trial. While the presence or absence of inhibitory activity of NGF and NGF receptor is unknown, there is a report relating to natural RNA that binds to NGF (non-patent document 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn recent years, applications of RNA aptamers to medicaments, diagnostic agents, and test drugs have been drawing attention; some RNA aptamers have already been in clinical study stage or in practical use. In December 2004, the world's first RNA aptamer drug, Macugen, was approved as a therapeutic drug for age-related macular degeneration in the US. An RNA aptamer refers to an RNA that binds specifically to a target molecule such as a protein, and can be prepared using the SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) method (Patent references 1-3). In the SELEX method, an RNA that binds specifically to a target molecule is selected from an RNA pool with about 10\n14 \ndifferent nucleotide sequences. The RNA structure used has a random sequence of about 40 residues, which is flanked by primer sequences. This RNA pool is allowed to be assembled with a target substance, and only the RNA that has bound to the target substance is collected using a filter and the like. The RNA collected is amplified by RT-PCR, and this is used as a template for the next round. By repeating this operation about 10 times, an RNA aptamer that binds specifically to the target substance can be acquired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAptamer drugs, like antibody drugs, can target extracellular factors. With reference to many scientific papers and other reference materials in the public domain, aptamer drugs are judged to potentially surpass antibody drugs in some aspects. For example, aptamers often show higher binding force and higher specificity than do antibodies. Aptamers are unlikely to undergo immune elimination, and adverse reactions characteristic of antibodies, such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), are unlikely to occur with the use of aptamers. From the aspect of delivery, since aptamers are about 1/10 of antibody in size, delivery of a drug to the object site is easier. Since aptamers are produced by chemical synthesis, various modifications can be made easily, reduction of cost by large-scale production is possible. Meanwhile, the blood half-lives of aptamers are generally shorter than those of antibodies; however, this property is sometimes advantageous in view of toxicity. These facts lead to the conclusion that even when the same molecule is targeted, aptamer drugs potentially surpass antibody drugs.\n\n\n \nDOCUMENT LIST\n\n\nPatent Documents\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\npatent document 1: WO91/19813\n\n\npatent document 2: WO94/08050\n\n\npatent document 3: WO95/07364\n\n\n\n\nNon-Patent Document\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nnon-patent document 1: Binkley J et al., (1995) Nucleic Acids Res, 23, 3198-3205\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nProblems to be Solved by the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to providing an aptamer for NGF and a method of utilizing the same, and the like.\n\n\n \nMeans of Solving the Problems\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present inventors investigated diligently to solve the problem described above and succeeded in preparing an aptamer of good quality for NGF, which resulted in the completion of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention provides the following:\n\n\n \n \n[1] An aptamer that binds to NGF and inhibits binding of NGF and an NGF receptor;\n\n\n[2] An aptamer that binds to NGF and inhibits a neurite outgrowth activity of NGF;\n\n\n[3] The aptamer according to [2], having a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of not more than 100 nM;\n\n\n[4] The aptamer according to [2], having a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of not more than 10 nM;\n\n\n[5] The aptamer according to any one of [1] to [4], wherein at least one nucleotide is modified;\n\n\n[6] The aptamer according to any one of [1] to [4], comprising a sequence shown by HGAANNNANCY (SEQ ID NO: 106), wherein N is any nucleotide, H is a nucleotide excluding G, Y is a pyrimidine nucleotide, and at least one nucleotide of the aforementioned sequence is modified;\n\n\n[7] The aptamer according to any one of [1] to [4], comprising a sequence shown by UGAAANNANCY (SEQ ID NO: 107), CGAANNAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 108) or AGAANNAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 109), wherein N is any nucleotide, Y is a pyrimidine nucleotide and at least one nucleotide of the aforementioned sequence is modified;\n\n\n[8] The aptamer according to any one of [1] to [4], comprising a sequence shown by UGAAAAAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 110), UGAAAGAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 111), CGAACAAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 112) or CGAAAGAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 113), wherein Y is a pyrimidine nucleotide and at least one nucleotide of the aforementioned sequence is modified;\n\n\n[9] The aptamer according to any one of [5] to [8], wherein the hydroxyl groups at the 2′-position of a ribose of respective pyrimidine nucleotides are the same or different and unreplaced or replaced by an atom or group selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a fluorine atom and a methoxy group;\n\n\n[10] The aptamer according to any one of [5] to [8], wherein the hydroxyl groups at the 2′-position of a ribose of respective purine nucleotides are the same or different and unreplaced or replaced by an atom or group selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a fluorine atom and a methoxy group;\n\n\n[11] The aptamer according to [1], comprising any one of the nucleotide sequences (a), (b) and (c) below:\n\n\n(a) an aptamer comprising a nucleotide sequence selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 1-9, 12, 24-55 and 57-90 (wherein uracil may be thymine);\n\n\n(b) an aptamer comprising a nucleotide sequence selected from among SEQ ID NOs: 1-9, 12, 24-55 and 57-90 (wherein uracil may be thymine), wherein 1 or several nucleotides are replaced, deleted, inserted or added;

The aptamer of the present invention can also be in a linear or circular form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNGF is a known neurotrophin, and is an important secretory protein involved in the development and survival of peripheral and central neurons. NGF is an abbreviation of Nerve Growth Factor. In the present invention, NGF particularly means a β type NGF. The amino acid sequences of human β-NGF are those shown by Accession Numbers NP002497, P01138, AAI26151, AAI26149 and CAB75625, which may also be one with mutation, its domain or peptide. It may be not only a monomer but also a dimer or multimer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer of the present invention binds to NGF in a physiological buffer (for example, solution A: see Example 1). The aptamer of the present invention binds to NGF at an intensity detectable by the following test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the measurement, BIAcore2000 manufactured by BIAcore is used. An aptamer is immobilized on a sensorchip. The amount to be immobilized is set to 1000 RU. A physiological buffer containing 0.3M NaCl (solution A: see Example 1) is used to prepare NGF solution (0.5 μM). This NGF solution (20 μL) is injected and the binding of NGF to the aptamer is detected. Using RNA containing a random nucleotide sequence consisting of 40 nucleotides as a negative control, when NGF significantly strongly binds to the aptamer as compared to the control RNA, the aptamer is evaluated to have bindability to NGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer of the present invention inhibits the activity of NGF by binding to NGF and inhibiting the binding of NGF and NGF receptor. In the present specification, the “inhibitory activity against NGF” means an inhibitory ability on any activity NGF has. For example, it means an activity to inhibit NGF from binding to NGF receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, examples of other “inhibitory activity against NGF” include inhibition of signal transduction in the downstream of NGF receptor (Ras-MAP kinase pathway, PI3 kinase pathway), inhibition of increased expression of TRPV1, SP, BDNF and the like, inhibitory activity of expression of HA, BK, PG, NGF and other cytokine released from mast cells etc. and the like, which result from the binding of NGF to NGF receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, differentiation of nerve cell induced by NGF, increase of survival, neurite outgrowth and blood vessel permeability, enhancement of immune response of T cells and B cells, differentiation of lymphocytes, inhibition of growth and the like of various cells such as mast cells, erythroleukemic cells, cancer cells and the like, relief of pain, hyperalgesia and the like can be mentioned.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferable “inhibitory activity against NGF” that the aptamer of the present invention has is an activity to inhibit the binding of NGF to NGF receptor, and an activity to inhibit neurite outgrowth activity induced by NGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present specification, the “NGF receptor” means a cell surface protein to which NGF binds. As the NGF receptor, TrkA and p75 are known. The NGF receptor referred to in the present invention may be a protein containing a natural amino acid sequence or a variant thereof. Here, the “variant thereof” means a protein or peptide wherein several amino acids of an amino acid sequence of “NGF receptor” have been replaced or a partial amino acid sequence thereof, which has a binding activity to NGF and inhibits the binding of NGF and NGF receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer of the present invention binds to NGF and inhibits the binding of NGF and NGF receptor. Whether or not the aptamer inhibits the binding of NGF to NGF receptor can be evaluated by the following test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the measurement, BIAcore2000 manufactured by BIAcore is used. On a CM5 sensorchip is immobilized a fusion protein of NGF receptor and Fc (e.g., Trk A-Fc (175-TK, R&D systems)) or p75-Fc (R&D systems)). The amount to be immobilized is 1100 RU. NGF (0.1 μM) and an aptamer (0.33 μM) are mixed in a physiological buffer (solution A: see Example 1), and the mixture is prepared for 30 min. This mixture (20 μL) is injected, and the binding of NGF to NGF receptor is detected. When the inhibitory activity (%) is not less than 60%, the aptamer is evaluated to inhibit the binding of NGF to NGF receptor. The inhibitory activity (%) is calculated with the binding amount of NGF free of an aptamer and NGF receptor as 0, and a binding amount by injection of an NGF-free solution as 100. Here, the binding amount means RU value at a peak top of the sensorgram of BIAcore (RU value immediately after completion of NGF injection).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the aptamer of the present invention can inhibit both the binding of NGF and TrkA, and that of NGF and p75.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer of the present invention can exhibit inhibitory activity against NGF derived from any mammals. Such mammals include primates (e.g., human, monkey), rodents (e.g., mouse, rat and guinea pig), and companion animals, domestic animals and working animals (e.g., dog, cat, horse, bovine, goat, sheep, swine).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it binds to any portion of NGF and can inhibit the binding of NGF and NGF receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferable embodiment, the aptamer of the present invention contains a sequence shown by HGAANNNANCY (SEQ ID NO: 106) wherein N is any nucleotide, H is a nucleotide excluding G, and Y is a pyrimidine nucleotide, binds to NGF, and inhibits the binding of NGF and NGF receptor. The nucleotide sequence shown by SEQ ID NO: 106 is included in the aptamer that binds to NGF and inhibits the binding of NGF and NGF receptor, which is obtained by the below-mentioned SELEX method. At least one nucleotide of the aforementioned sequence is preferably modified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferable embodiment, the aptamer of the present invention contains a consensus sequence shown by UGAAANNANCY (SEQ ID NO: 107), CGAANNAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 108) or AGAANNAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 109) wherein N is any nucleotide, and Y is a pyrimidine nucleotide, binds to NGF, and inhibits the binding of NGF and NGF receptor. The nucleotide sequences shown by SEQ ID NO: 107, SEQ ID NO: 108 and SEQ ID NO: 109 are included in the aptamer that binds to NGF and inhibits the binding of NGF and NGF receptor, which is obtained by the below-mentioned SELEX method. At least one nucleotide of these sequences is preferably modified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferable embodiment, the aptamer of the present invention contains a consensus sequence shown by UGAAAAAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 110), UGAAAGAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 111), CGAACAAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 112) or CGAAAGAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 113) wherein Y is a pyrimidine nucleotide, binds to NGF, and inhibits the binding of NGF and NGF receptor. The nucleotide sequences shown by SEQ ID NO: 110, SEQ ID NO: 111, SEQ ID NO: 112 and SEQ ID NO: 113 are included in the aptamer that binds to NGF and inhibits the binding of NGF and NGF receptor, which is obtained by the below-mentioned SELEX method. At least one nucleotide of these sequences is preferably modified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the aptamer of the present invention can be an aptamer that binds to NGF and inhibits a neurite outgrowth activity of NGF. Whether or not the aptamer inhibits the neurite outgrowth activity of NGF can be evaluated by the test described in Example 7 or Example 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the aptamer concentration (IC50) to afford a neurite outgrowth activity of 50% can also be determined by performing the test described in Example 8 with different aptamer concentrations. The IC50 of the aptamer of the present invention is preferably not more than 100 nM, more preferably not more than 10 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe length of the aptamer of the present invention is not limited, and can usually be about 10 to about 200 nucleotides, and can be, for example, not more than about 100 nucleotides, preferably not more than about 60 nucleotides, more preferably not more than about 50 nucleotides, most preferably not more than about 45 nucleotides. When the total number of nucleotides is smaller, chemical synthesis and mass-production will be easier, and there is a major advantage in terms of cost. It is also thought that chemical modification is easier, stability in the body is higher, and toxicity is lower.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach nucleotide contained in the aptamer of the present invention is the same or different and can be a nucleotide comprising a hydroxyl group at the 2′ position of ribose (e.g., ribose of pyrimidine nucleotide, ribose of purine nucleotide) (i.e., an unreplaced nucleotide) or a nucleotide replaced by any atom or group at the 2′ position of ribose. As examples of any such atom or group, a nucleotide replaced by a hydrogen atom, a fluorine atom or an —O-alkyl group (e.g., —O-Me group), an —O-acyl group (e.g., —O—CHO group), or an amino group (e.g., —NH\n2 \ngroup) can be mentioned.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer of the present invention can also be the nucleotide wherein at least one kind (e.g., 1, 2, 3 or 4% kinds) of nucleotide comprises a hydroxyl group, or the above-described any atom or group, for example, at least two kinds (e.g., 2, 3 or 4 kinds) of groups selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a fluorine atom, a hydroxyl group and a —O-Me group, at the 2′ position of ribose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, in the aptamer of the present invention, all pyrimidine nucleotides are the same or different and each can be a nucleotide replaced by a fluorine atom, or a nucleotide replaced by any atom or group mentioned above, preferably an atom or group selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group and a methoxy group at the 2′ position of ribose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the aptamers of the present invention, moreover, all purine nucleotides are the same or different and each can be a nucleotide replaced by a hydroxyl group at the 2′-position of ribose, or a nucleotide replaced by any atom or group mentioned above, preferably an atom or a group selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a methoxy group, and a fluorine atom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer of the present invention can also be one wherein all nucleotides comprise a hydroxyl group, or any atom or group mentioned above, for example, the identical group selected by the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a fluorine atom, a hydroxyl group and a —O-Me group, at the 2′ position of ribose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this specification, the nucleotides constituting the aptamer are assumed to be RNAs (i.e., the sugar groups are assumed to be ribose) in describing how the sugar groups are modified in the nucleotides. However, this does not mean that DNA is exempted from the aptamer-constituting nucleotides, and a modification of RNA should read as a modification of DNA as appropriate. When the nucleotide constituting the aptamer is DNA, for example, substitution of the hydroxyl group at the 2′ position of ribose by X should read as a substitution of one hydrogen atom at the 2′ position of deoxyribose by X.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer of the present invention can also be:\n\n\n \n \n(a) an aptamer comprising a nucleotide sequence selected from among SEQ ID NO:1-9, 12, 24-55 and 57-90 (with the provision that the uracil may be thymine);\n\n\n(b) an aptamer comprising a nucleotide sequence selected from among SEQ ID NO:1-9, 12, 24-55 and 57-90 (with the provision that the uracil may be thymine), wherein one to several nucleotides are replaced, deleted, inserted or added;\n\n\n(c) an aptamer comprising a nucleotide sequence having an identity of 70% or more (preferably 80% or more, more preferably 90% or more, most preferably 95% or more) to a nucleotide sequence selected from among SEQ ID NO: 1-9, 12, 24-55 and 57-90 (with the provision that the uracil may be thymine); or\n\n\n(d) a conjugate selected from the group consisting of a conjugate of a plurality of aptamers (a) above, a conjugate of a plurality of aptamers (b) above, a conjugate of a plurality of aptamers (c) above, and a conjugate of a plurality of aptamers (a), (b) and (c) above.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamers of the above-mentioned (b)-(d) can bind to NGF and/or inhibit the activity of NGF (NGF receptor binding activity etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, preferably, the aptamers of the above-mentioned (b)-(d) bind to NGF and inhibit the binding of NGF and NGF receptor, and/or bind to NGF, and inhibit the neurite outgrowth activity of NGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore preferably, the aptamers of the above-mentioned (b)-(d) show an NGF neurite outgrowth inhibitory concentration of not more than 100 nM, more preferably not more than 10 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn (b) above, the number of nucleotides replaced, deleted, inserted or added is not particularly limited as long as the aptamer binds to NGF, and can inhibit the activity of NGF (NGF receptor binding activity etc.). It can be, for example, not more than about 30, preferably not more than about 20, more preferably not more than about 10, still more preferably not more than 5, most preferably 4, 3, 2 or 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith respect to (c) above, “an identity” means a ratio (%) of identical nucleotide residues to all overlapping nucleotide residues in the optimal alignment where two nucleotide sequences are aligned using a mathematical algorithm known in the technical field (preferably, the algorithm considers introduction of gaps on one or both of the sequences for the best alignment).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleotide sequence identity in the present specification can be calculated by, for example, aligning the two nucleotide sequences using the homology calculation algorithm NCBI BLAST-2 (National Center for Biotechnology Information Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) under the following conditions (gap open=5 penalties; gap extension=2 penalties; x_dropoff=50; expectation value=10; filtering=ON).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn (d) above, conjugation can be achieved by tandem binding. In the conjugation, a linker may be utilized. As the linker, nucleotide chains (e.g., 1 to about 20 nucleotides) and non-nucleotide chains (e.g., —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n— linker, —(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n— linker, hexaethylene glycol linker, TEG linker, peptide-containing linker, —S—S— bond-containing linker, —CONH— bond-containing linker, —OPO\n3\n— bond-containing linker) can be mentioned. The plurality as mentioned in the above-described plural conjugates is not particularly limited, as long as it is two or more, and the plurality can be, for example, 2, 3 or 4. Each of the nucleotides in (a) to (d) above, whether the same or different, can be a nucleotide comprising a hydroxyl group at the 2′ position of ribose, or a nucleotide replaced by any groups (e.g., a hydrogen atom, fluorine atom or —O-Me group) at the 2′ position of ribose (e.g., ribose of pyrimidine nucleotide).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer of the present invention may be one wherein a sugar residue (e.g., ribose) of each nucleotide has been modified to increase the NGF binding activity, NGF-NGF receptor binding inhibitory activity, NGF neurite outgrowth inhibitory activity, stability of aptamer, drug deliverability and the like. As examples of the modification in a sugar residue, replacement of oxygen atom at the 2′-position, 3′-position and/or 4′-position of the sugar residue with another atom, and the like can be mentioned. As the kind of the modification, fluorination, O-alkylation (e.g., O-methylation, O-ethylation), O-arylation, S-alkylation (e.g., S-methylation, S-ethylation), S-arylation, and amination (e.g., —NH\n2\n) can be mentioned. Such alterations in the sugar residue can be performed by a method known per se (see, for example, Sproat et al., (1991) Nucl. Acid. Res. 19, 733-738; Cotton et al., (1991) Nucl. Acid. Res. 19, 2629-2635; Hobbs et al., (1973) Biochemistry 12, 5138-5145).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer of the present invention may also have a nucleic acid base (e.g., purine or pyrimidine) altered (e.g., chemical substitution) to increase the NGF binding activity, NGF-NGF receptor binding inhibitory activity, NGF neurite outgrowth inhibitory activity and the like. As examples of such alterations, pyrimidine alteration at 5-position, purine alteration at 6- and/or 8-position(s), alteration with an extracyclic amine, substitution with 4-thiouridine, and substitution with 5-bromo or 5-iodo-uracil can be mentioned. The phosphate group contained in the aptamer of the present invention may be altered to confer resistance to nuclease and hydrolysis. For example, the P(O)O group may be replaced with P(O)S (thioate), P(S)S (dithioate), P(O)NR\n2 \n(amidate), P(O)R, R(O)OR′, CO or CH\n2 \n(formacetal) or 3′-amine (—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—) [wherein each unit of R or R′ is independently H or a replaced or unreplaced alkyl (e.g., methyl, ethyl)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe joining group is, for example, —O—, —N— or —S—, and nucleotides can bind to an adjoining nucleotide via these joining groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alterations may also include alterations such as capping at 3′ and 5′.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alteration can further be performed by adding to an end a polyethyleneglycol, amino acid, peptide, inverted dT, nucleic acid, nucleosides, Myristoyl, Lithocolic-oleyl, Docosanyl, Lauroyl, Stearoyl, Palmitoyl, Oleoyl, Linoleoyl, other lipids, steroids, cholesterol, caffeine, vitamins, pigments, fluorescent substances, anticancer agent, toxin, enzymes, radioactive substance, biotin and the like. For such alterations, see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,660,985 and 5,756,703.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer of the present invention can be chemically synthesized as disclosed herein and by a method known per se in the art. An aptamer binds to the target molecule in a wide variety of binding modes, such as ionic bonds based on the negative charge of the phosphate group, hydrophobic bonds and hydrogen bonds based on ribose, and hydrogen bonds and stacking interaction based on nucleic acid bases. In particular, ionic bonds based on the negative charge of the phosphate group, which are present in the same number as the number of constituent nucleotides, are strong, and bind to lysine and arginine being present on the surface of the positive charge of protein. For this reason, nucleic acid bases not involved in the direct binding to the target molecule can be substituted. In particular, because the region of stem structure has already formed base pairs and faces the inside of the double helical structure, nucleic acid bases are unlikely to bind directly to the target molecule. Therefore, even when a base pair is replaced with another base pair, the activity of the aptamer often does not decrease. In structures wherein no base pairs are formed, such as loop structures, provided that the nucleic acid base is not involved in the direct binding to the target molecule, base substitution is possible. Regarding modifications of the 2′-position of ribose, the functional group at the 2′-position of ribose infrequently interacts directly with the target molecule, but in many cases, it is of no relevance, and can be substituted by another modified molecule. Hence, an aptamer, unless the functional group involved in the direct binding to the target molecule is substituted or deleted, often retains the activity thereof. It is also important that the overall three-dimensional structure does not change substantially.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aptamer can be prepared by utilizing the SELEX method or an improved version thereof (e.g., Ellington et al., (1990) Nature, 346, 818-822; Tuerk et al., (1990) Science, 249, 505-510). In the SELEX method, by increasing the number of rounds or using a competing substance, an aptamer exhibiting a stronger binding potential for the target molecule is concentrated and selected. Hence, by adjusting the number of rounds of SELEX and/or changing the competitive condition, aptamers with different binding forces, aptamers with different binding modes, and aptamers with the same binding force or binding mode but different base sequences can be obtained in some cases. The SELEX method comprises a process of amplification by PCR; by causing a mutation by using manganese ions and the like in the process, it is possible to perform SELEX with higher diversity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamers obtained by SELEX are nucleic acids that exhibit high affinity for the target substance, but this does not mean binding to an active site of the target substance. Therefore, the aptamers obtained by SELEX do not necessarily act on the function of the target substance. NGF is a basic protein, and is thought to be likely to allow nucleic acids to bind thereto nonspecifically. An aptamer that does not bind to an active site does not influence the activity of the target substance. In fact, the RNA used for control did not inhibit the binding of NGF and NGF receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on an active aptamer thus selected, SELEX can be performed by further changing a primer to acquire an aptamer possessing higher activity. Specifically, after preparing a template wherein an aptamer with a determined sequence is partially randomized or a template doped with about 10 to 30% of random sequences, SELEX is performed again.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aptamer obtained by SELEX has a length of about 80 nucleotides, and this is difficult to prepare as a pharmaceutical as it is. Hence, it is necessary to repeat try-and-error efforts to shorten the aptamer to a length of about 50 nucleotides or less enabling easy chemical synthesis. Depending on the primer design for an aptamer obtained by SELEX, the ease of the subsequent minimization operation changes. Unless the primer is designed successfully, subsequent development will be impossible even if an aptamer with activity is selected by SELEX. In the present invention, an aptamer retaining activity even with 38 nucleotides was obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAptamers are modified easily since they permit chemical synthesis. For aptamers, by predicting the secondary structure using the MFOLD program, or by predicting the steric structure by X-ray analysis or NMR analysis, it is possible to predict to some extent which nucleotide can be substituted or deleted, and where to insert a new nucleotide. A predicted aptamer with the new sequence can easily be chemically synthesized, and it can be determined whether or not the aptamer retains the activity using an existing assay system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a region important to the binding of the obtained aptamer with the target molecule is identified by repeated try-and-error efforts as described above, the activity remains unchanged in many cases even when a new sequence is added to both ends of the sequence. The length of the new sequence is not particularly limited. Particularly, the aforementioned sequences shown by HGAANNNANCY (SEQ ID NO: 106), UGAAANNANCY (SEQ ID NO: 107), CGAANNAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 108), AGAANNAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 109), UGAAAAAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 110), UGAAAGAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 111), CGAACAAAAC (SEQ ID NO: 112) and CGAAAGAAAC (SEQ ID NO: 113) are important portions for binding of the aptamer of the present invention to NGF and inhibition of the binding of NGF and NGF receptor. Even when a new sequence is added to both ends of these sequences, the activity remains unchanged in many cases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications, like sequences, afford a wide range of design or alterations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs stated above, aptamers permit a wide range of design or alterations of modifications. The present invention also provides a production method of aptamer that enables a wide range of design or alteration of an aptamer comprising a specified sequence (e.g., a sequence corresponding to a portion selected from among stem regions, internal loop regions, hairpin loop regions and single-strand regions: hereinafter, abbreviated as fixed sequence as required).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the production method of such aptamer includes production of an aptamer comprising a fixed sequence by using a single kind of nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence shown by:\n\n\n \n \n \nPrimer sequence (i)-(N)a-fixed sequence-(N)b-Primer sequence (ii)\n\n\n \n \n[wherein (N)a represents a nucleotide chain consisting of “a” units of N; (N)\nb \nrepresents a nucleotide chain consisting of “b” units of N; each of the units of N, whether identical or different, is a nucleotide selected from the group consisting of A, G, C, U and T (preferably, A, G, C and U). Each of “a” and “b”, whether identical or different, can be any numbers, and can be, for example, 1 to about 100, preferably 1 to about 50, more preferably 1 to about 30, still more preferably 1 to about 20 or 1 to about 10], or plural kinds of nucleic acid molecules (e.g., library of nucleic acid molecule different in the number of a, b etc.) and primer pairs corresponding to the primer sequences (i) and (ii), respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a complex comprising the aptamer of the present invention and a functional substance bound thereto. The bond between the aptamer and the functional substance in the complex of the present invention can be a covalent bond or a non-covalent bond. The complex of the present invention can be one wherein the aptamer of the present invention and one or more (e.g., 2 or 3) of functional substances of the same kind or different kinds are bound together. The functional substance is not particularly limited, as far as it newly confers a certain function to an aptamer of the present invention, or is capable of changing (e.g., improving) a certain characteristic which an aptamer of the present invention can possess. As examples of the functional substance, proteins, peptides, amino acids, lipids, sugars, monosaccharides, polynucleotides, and nucleotides can be mentioned. As examples of the functional substance, affinity substances (e.g., biotin, streptavidin, polynucleotides possessing affinity for target complementary sequence, antibodies, glutathione Sepharose, histidine), substances for labeling (e.g., fluorescent substances, luminescent substances, radioisotopes), enzymes (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase), drug delivery vehicles (e.g., liposome, microspheres, peptides, polyethyleneglycols), drugs (e.g., those used in missile therapy such as calicheamycin and duocarmycin; nitrogen mustard analogues such as cyclophosphamide, melphalan, ifosfamide or trofosfamide; ethylenimines such as thiotepa; nitrosoureas such as carmustine; alkylating agents such as temozolomide or dacarbazine; folate-like metabolic antagonists such as methotrexate or raltitrexed; purine analogues such as thioguanine, cladribine or fludarabine; pyrimidine analogues such as fluorouracil, tegafur or gemcitabine; vinca alkaloids such as vinblastine, vincristine or vinorelbine and analogues thereof; podophyllotoxin derivatives such as etoposide, taxans, docetaxel or paclitaxel; anthracyclines such as doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin and mitoxantrone, and analogues thereof; other cytotoxic antibiotics such as bleomycin and mitomycin; platinum compounds such as cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin; pentostatin, miltefosine, estramustine, topotecan, irinotecan and bicalutamide), and toxins (e.g., ricin toxin, liatoxin and Vero toxin) can be mentioned. These functional molecules are finally removed in some cases. Furthermore, the molecules may be peptides that can be recognized and cleaved by enzymes such as thrombin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), and Factor X, and may be polynucleotides that can be cleaved by nucleases or restriction endonuclease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer or the complex of the present invention can be used as, for example, a medicament or a diagnostic agent, a test drug, a reagent, an additive for drinking water and food, an enhancer and a mitigator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer and complex of the present invention can have an activity to inhibit the function of NGF by binding to NGF and inhibiting the binding of NGF and NGF receptor. As mentioned above, NGF is deeply involved in the pain and inflammation. Therefore, the aptamer and complex of the present invention are useful as medicaments for the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases accompanying pain or inflammation (anti-pain agent, anti-inflammatory agent etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHere, examples of the pain include nociceptive pain (muscular pain, back pain, upper limb pain, whiplash injury, arthralgia, osteoarthritis, gout, chronic rheumatoid arthritis, headache, migraine headache, catatonic headache, cluster headache, secondary headache, orofacial pain, toothache, causalgia after tooth extraction, phantom tooth pain, visceral pain, cardiac pain, abdominal pain, mittelschmerz, dysmenorrhea, labor pain, nephralgia, ureteralgia, ostalgia and the like), inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain (diabetic neuropathy, toxic neuropathy, pain after operation, phantom limb pain, fragment pain, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, causalgia, postherpetic pain, trigeminal neuralgia, central pain), carcinomatous pain (pain due to cancer infiltration into visceral organ, pain caused by blood vessel obstruction due to blood vessel infiltration of cancer tissue, pain of bone metastasis, pain associated with intracerebral metastasis, pain caused by peripheral nerve infiltration of cancer tissue), fibromyalgia pain and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the disease associated with inflammation here is not particularly limited, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, osteoarthritis, chronic rheumatoid arthritis, interstitial cystitis, asthma and the like can be mentioned.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the above-mentioned cancer is not particularly limited, esophagus cancer, thyroid cancer, urinary bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, thoracic cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, neuroblastoma, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, Wilms' tumor, prostate cancer and the like can be mentioned.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen NGF binds to a receptor thereof, TrkA, it activates tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA and Ras-MAPK, PLC-γ, PI3K and the like at the downstream of TrkA, and exhibits physiological actions such as survival and differentiation of nerve cells.

The method of detecting and quantifying NGF can be performed in the same manner as an immunological method, except that the aptamer of the present invention is used in place of an antibody. Therefore, by using the aptamer of the present invention as a probe in place of an antibody, in the same manner as such methods as enzymeimmunoassay (EIA) (e.g., direct competitive ELISA, indirect competitive ELISA, sandwich ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), fluorescent immunoassay (FIA), Western blot technique, immunohistochemical staining method, and cell sorting method, detection and quantitation can be performed. The aptamer of the present invention can also be used as a molecular probe for PET and the like.

The measurements were taken using BIAcore 2000 (manufactured by BIAcore). The SA chip was used as the sensor chip, which had streptavidin immobilized thereon. Bound thereto was about 1500 RU of a 16-nucleotide Poly dT with biotin bound to the 5′ end thereof. The ligand nucleic acid had a 16-nucleotide Poly A added to the 3′ end thereof, and was immobilized on the SA chip via a bond between T and A. The amount immobilized was about 1000 RU. 20 μL of NGF for analyte, prepared at 0.5 μM, was injected, with the addition of a final concentration of 0.3M NaCl to lessen nonspecific adsorption. Solution A was used as a running buffer. Here, solution A is a mixed solution of 145 mM sodium chloride, 5.4 mM potassium chloride, 1.8 mM calcium chloride, 0.8 mM magnesium chloride, 20 mM Tris (pH 7.6), and 0.05\n% Tween\n 20. As a result of the measurement, it was found that all of the nucleic acids shown by SEQ ID NOs:1-9 and 12 bind to NGF significantly more than the \ncontrol\n 40N. Here, 40N refers to the nucleic acid pool used for the first round, comprising a 40-nucleotide random sequence. As an example, a sensorgram showing a status of the binding of the aptamer shown by SEQ ID NO:6 and NGF is shown in \nFIG. 11\n. From the above, it was shown that these nucleic acids are aptamers that bind to NGF.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nPreparation of RNA Aptamers that Bind Specifically to NGF 2\n\n\n \n \n \nSELEX was performed in the same manner as in Example 1 except that a template having a 30 nucleotide random sequence and primer sequences different from those used in Example 1 were used.

The SELEX method used was an improved method of the method of Fitzwater, Polisky et al. (Fitzwater and Polisky, Methods Enzymol. 267, 275-301, 1996). As a target substance, human NGF used in Example 1 was used. The pool for the first round was DNA with length 71 (40N-DNA) obtained by adding primer sequences to both ends of 40 nucleotide random sequence. To obtain single strand DNA, biotin(bio) was added to the 5′ terminal of primer Rev.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ntemplate:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 126)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-GGGATCGACAGGGCT-40N-CCGAGTCGTGCCATCT-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nprimer Fwd:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 127)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-GGGATCGACAGGGCT-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nprimer Rev:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 128)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nbio-AGATGGCACGACTCGG-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the completion of 7 rounds, the sequences of 46 clones were sequenced in the same manner as in Example 1.

As directed in BIAcore Company's protocol, Protein A (21181, PIERCE) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip. About 1100 RU of human Trk A-Fc fused with the Fc portion of IgG (175-TK, R&D systems) was immobilized thereon. As the analyte, a mixture of NGF (0.1 μM) and each aptamer (0.33 μM) was injected after being allowed to stand for 30 minutes. If the aptamer inhibits the binding of NGF and TrkA, the signal on the sensorgram is expected to not rise; if the aptamer does not inhibit the binding, a triple complex will be formed and the signal is expected to rise. When NGF binds stronger to a receptor than an aptamer, the aptamer may be removed and NGF may bind to the receptor. Before starting the inhibition experiment, binding of TrkA and NGF was confirmed. Using the binding amount of NGF and NGF receptor without an aptamer as 100, the binding amount of NGF and NGF receptor added with an aptamer was determined as a correction value. Here, the binding amount is the RU value at the peak top of the sensorgram of BIAcore (RU value immediately after completion of NGF injection). The correction value was subtracted from 100 to give an inhibitory activity %, where not less than 60% shows the presence of inhibitory activity. As a result of the experiment, all the aptamers shown by SEQ ID NOs: 1-9, 12, 37-55, 57-87 were found to inhibit the binding of NGF and TrkA (Table 1). As one example, inhibition of binding of NGF and TrkA by the aptamer shown by SEQ ID NO: 6 is shown in \nFIG. 12\n. A similar experiment was performed for another receptor P75 (p75-Fc; R&D systems). As a result, all the aptamers shown by SEQ ID NOs: 1-9, 12, 37-55, 57-87 were found to inhibit the binding of NGF and P75 by not less than 60% (Table 1). As one example, inhibition of binding of NGF and P75 by the aptamer shown by SEQ ID NO: 6 is shown in \nFIG. 13\n.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n

60%, and “−” shows that of less than 60%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs to the aptamer shown by SEQ ID NO: 87, an inhibitory experiment similar to the above-mentioned was performed under conditions of NGF-aptamer molar ratio of 1:1 (0.1 μM). The same, prepared mixed solution of NGF and aptamer was used for the experiments of TrkA and P75, and the experiment was performed under no influence of variation in the sample preparation. As a result, the aptamer shown by SEQ ID NO: 87 inhibited the binding of NGF and TrkA by 93%, but inhibited the binding of NGF and p75 only by 29%.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nEvaluation of Physiological Activity of Aptamer by Using PC-12 Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nThe physiological activity of aptamer was evaluated by a neurite outgrowth suppressive experiment using PC-12 cells. PC-12 cell, which is a cell line derived from rat adrenal gland pheochromocytoma, is a model cell of the nervous system, elongates neurite by NGF stimulation, and differentiates like nerve cells. Whether or not an aptamer inhibits the neurite outgrowth was evaluated. PC-12 cells were seeded on a 96 well flat-bottom plate coated with collagen, and a mixed solution of NGF (final concentration 25 ng/ml, or 1.9 nM) prereacted for 1 hr at 37° C. and an aptamer (\nfinal concentration\n 500 nM) was added to start the cell culture. Thereafter, the same amount of the aptamer was added twice every 24 hr and the level of neurite outgrowth was observed and evaluated on \nday\n 3 with a microscope. For evaluation, scores 0-3 were used, where \nscore\n 0 is no neurite outgrowth, \nscore\n 1 is slight neurite outgrowth, score 2 is neurite outgrowth to the nearby cell, and score 3 is markedly reticulated neurite outgrowth. The system wherein PC-12 cells were cultivated for 3 days with the addition of NGF alone was taken as a negative control, and system capable wherein the cells for 3 days without addition of NGF was taken as a positive control. To confirm suppression of neurite outgrowth by an NGF inhibitor, 133 nM anti-NGF antibody (MAB2561, R&D Systems) as a control NGF inhibitor was added with NGF, the cells were cultured for 3 days and suppression of neurite outgrowth was confirmed. Setting the score of the negative control as \ninhibitory activity\n 0%, and the score of the positive control as \ninhibitory activity\n 100%, the inhibitory activity (%) of the aptamer was calculated. The results are shown in Table 2. An inhibitory activity of not less than 50% is shown with +, and that of less than 50% is shown with −. It was clarified that the aptamers shown by SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3-9 and 12 remarkably inhibit the neurite outgrowth (Table 2). The aptamer shown by SEQ ID NO: 2 free of a consensus sequence did not show an inhibitory activity. On the other hand, the aptamers shown by SEQ ID NOs: 5, 6 and the like containing a consensus sequence showed an inhibitory activity. The aptamer shown by SEQ ID NO: 8 showed an inhibitory activity, even though it was free of a consensus sequence. The foregoing shows that the aptamers shown by SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3-9 and 12 can be NGF inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ninhibitory activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:2\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:3\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:4\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:5\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:6\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:7\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:8\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:9\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:12\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:24\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:25\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:26\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:27\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:28\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:29\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO:30\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 30(1)\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 30(2)\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 30(3)\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 31\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 32\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 32(1)\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 32(2)\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 32(3)\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 33\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 34\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 35\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 35(1)\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 35(2)\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 35(3)\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 36\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 88\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 89\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 90\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nanti-NGF\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nantibody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 2 shows aptamers capable of inhibiting neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells.

A mixed solution of NGF (final concentration 15 ng/ml or 1.1 nM) prereacted in a serum-free RPMI-1640 medium at room temperature or 37° C. for 30 min to 1 hr and an aptamer (final concentration 500-3 nM) was added. Two or three days later, the cytoplasm and nuclei were stained using Cellomics Neurite Outgrowth Kits (manufactured by Thermo Scientific), and neurite length per cell was measured by Cellomics ArrayScan VTI (manufactured by Thermo Scientific). With the neurite length per cell obtained by culturing the cell for 2 days with the addition of NGF alone as \ninhibitory activity\n 0%, and that of the cell obtained by NGF free culture as \ninhibitory activity\n 100%, the inhibitory activity of the aptamer was calculated from the neurite length per cell obtained by culturing with the addition of NGF and the aptamer in mixture. The inhibitory activity when the aptamer concentrations were 100 n14 and 10 nM, and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) are shown in Table 3. When the inhibitory activity was 0% or below, ‘0%’ is indicated. When it was not less than 100%, ‘100%’ is indicated. The 50% inhibitory concentration was determined from the concentrations at two, above and below points sandwiching the 50% inhibitory activity. An IC50 value indicated as < means an inhibitory activity of not less than 50% even at the lowest measurement concentration, and the indicated number shows the lowest measurement concentration. As a result of the experiment, the presence of aptamers having a high activity showing an IC50 of 10 nM or below was confirmed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch aptamers contained consensus sequences of UGAAAAAAACC (SEQ ID NO: 91), UGAAAGAAACC (SEQ ID NO: 92), UGAAAGAAACU (SEQ ID NO: 93), UGAAAAGAACC (SEQ ID NO: 95), UGAAAAAACCC (SEQ ID NO: 96), UGAAAGGAACC (SEQ ID NO: 105), CGAACAAAACU (SEQ ID NO: 103), CGAAAGAAACU (SEQ ID NO: 104) and AGAAUGAAACU (SEQ ID NO: 102).

When the consensus sequence is an NGF binding site, the results should be that enzyme digestion occurs in the absence of NGF; nuclease cannot bind to a consensus sequence in the presence of NGF and enzyme digestion does not occur. Using an aptamer wherein a fluorescent substance (FAM6) was conjugated with the 5′ terminal or 3′ terminal of the aptamer shown by SEQ ID NO: 62, the experiment was performed. The aptamer shown by SEQ ID NO: 62 contains a consensus sequence of UGAAAGAAACC (SEQ ID NO: 92). As the nuclease, 3 kinds of S1 nuclease (manufactured by TAKARA BIO) that selectively cleaves single strands, V1 nuclease (manufactured by Ambion) that selectively cleaves double strands, and T1 nuclease (manufactured by Ambion) that selectively cleaves G of single strands were used. Each enzyme reaction was performed under the conditions of Table 4 in reference to the attached specification document. To the reaction solution of S1 nuclease was added 0.833 mM ZnCl\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nenzyme\n\n\naptamer\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\namount\n\n\namount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nnuclease\n\n\n(U/μL)\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\ntime\n\n\ntemperature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS1\n\n\n8.33\n\n\n8\n\n\n3 min, 10 min\n\n\nroom temperature\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV1\n\n\n0.009\n\n\n9\n\n\n1 min, 3 min\n\n\nroom temperature\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT1\n\n\n0.91\n\n\n9\n\n\n1 min, 3 min\n\n\nroom temperature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the experiment with addition of NGF, the molar ratio of aptamer and NGF was set to 1:2, and they were dissolved in solution B, a binding buffer. Here, solution B is a mixed solution of 145 mM sodium chloride, 5.4 mM potassium chloride, 1.8 mM calcium chloride, 0.8 mM magnesium chloride, and 20 mM Tris (pH 7.6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter an enzyme reaction, the reaction was discontinued by a phenol.chloroform treatment, and a water-soluble fraction was recovered and concentrated. Then, the terminal phosphoric acid was removed by alkaline phosphatase (manufactured by TAKARA BIO). The enzyme treatment with alkaline phosphatase was performed at 37° C. for 1.5 hr by reference to the attached specification document. These samples were analyzed by 20% denatured polyacrylamide electrophoresis. For fluorescence detection, Storm850 (manufactured by GE Healthcare) was used. As a result of the experiment, GAAAGA of UGAAAGAAACC (SEQ ID NO: 92) was cleaved by S1 and T1 nucleases in the absence of NGF. On the other hand, the cleavage was remarkably suppressed in the presence of NGF. Here, pyrimidine nucleotide is a fluoro-modified form. The above reveals that the consensus sequence part is an NGF binding site.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nChanges in Activity by Introduction of Mutation into Consensus Sequence Part\n\n\n \n \n \nMutation was introduced into the consensus sequence part, and changes in the activity were evaluated using Neuroscreen-1 cells in the same manner as in Example 8. As an aptamer containing a consensus sequence UGAAAAAAACC (SEQ ID NO: 91), a 38 nucleotide long sequence shown by SEQ ID NO: 35 was used. The results thereof are shown in Table 5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen an aptamer free of mutation introduction was added at 300 nM, inhibition of neurite outgrowth by 92% was seen. On the other hand, the activity disappeared completely by the introduction of a mutation of one nucleotide. When A at the 3rd to 5th of UGAAAAAAACC (SEQ ID NO: 91) was substituted by DNA type, the activity disappeared completely. From the above, it was shown that the consensus sequence is important for inhibition of NGF activity.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n300 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nconsensus sequence\n\n\n(% Inhibition)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUGAAAAAAACC\n\n\n92\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nU\nC\nAAAAAAACC\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nUgAAAAAAACC\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nUG\nG\nAAAAAACC\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nUG\na\nAAAAAACC\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nUGA\na\nAAAAACC\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nUGAA\na\nAAAACC\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 5 shows the results of the neurite outgrowth inhibitory experiment using Neuroscreen-1 cells.

The mutation was introduced into the underlined parts.\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nConsideration Relating to Consensus Sequences\n\n\n \n \n \nIn this experiment, consensus sequences appeared at high frequency in SELEX under different conditions such as different pools, primer sequences and the like (Examples 1-4). Of the 74 sequences obtained by SELEX, 59 sequences contained aptamers having a consensus sequence of UGAAANNANCY (SEQ ID NO: 107), wherein N is any nucleotide of A, G, C and U, and U may be T. Y is a pyrimidine nucleotide. Of these, 29 sequences contained UGAAAGAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 110) and 13 sequences contained UGAAAGAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 111).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, consensus sequences shown by the formulas CGAANNAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 108) and AGAANNAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 109) were found in 3 sequences and 2 sequences, respectively. Of these, one sequence contained CGAACAAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 112), and one sequence contained CGAAAGAAACY (SEQ ID NO: 113). They can be shown by the formula HGAANNNANCY (SEQ ID NO: 106).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince these consensus sequences are necessary for 38 nucleotide chain-shortened form (Example 9), protected by the addition of NGF in an enzyme digestion experiment (Example 11), and physiological activity markedly decreases by the introduction of a mutation (Example 12), it is clear that they are important for inhibiting NGF function.\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\nIntroduction of Mutation into Chain-Shortened Aptamer\n\n\n \n \n \nWhether the activity can be maintained after introduction of a mutation into a chain-shortened aptamer was confirmed. The aptamer of SEQ ID NO: 30(6) has a length of 41 nucleotides and does not contain a consensus sequence. Inverted dT is added to the 5′ and 3′ terminals. The activity was evaluated using Neuroscreen-1 cells in the same manner as in Example 8. The results are shown in Table 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the G1:C41, A10:U33, A12:U31 base pairs in the stem part predicted by the MFOLD program were substituted by C1:G41, U10:A33, U12:A31, the activity did not decrease markedly. When G20 and G23 in the loop part were substituted by A20 and A23, the activity did not decrease markedly, either. From the above, it was shown that the activity of the aptamer shown by SEQ ID NO: 30(6) was maintained even after introduction of several mutations.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(% Inhibition)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n300 \nnM\n \n\n\n100 \nnM\n \n\n\n30 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nG1:C41→C:G\n\n\n98.1\n\n\n92.0\n\n\n19.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nA10:U33→U:A\n\n\n98.3\n\n\n80.8\n\n\n12.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nA12:U31→U:A\n\n\n96.0\n\n\n93.1\n\n\n35.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nG20→A\n\n\n98.1\n\n\n96.1\n\n\n47.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nG23→A\n\n\n98.0\n\n\n91.2\n\n\n31.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 30\n\n\n98.6\n\n\n92.7\n\n\n28.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\nComparison with NGF Aptamer Described in Prior Art Reference\n\n\n \n \n \nThe aptamers shown by SEQ ID NOs: 30, 32, 35 and NGF aptamers described in prior art reference (Binkley J et al., (1995) Nucleic Acids Res. 23, 3198) were compared for NGF binding activity, NGF-NGF receptor binding inhibitory activity and neurite outgrowth inhibitory activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamers described in the prior art reference were all unmodified RNAs, and the sequences thereof do not match with the sequences described in the present specification. As the aptamers described in the prior art reference, H1, L2 and L6 showing high binding activity were selected, and transcribed with T7 polymerase. The binding activity was evaluated by a method similar to that in Example 1, NGF-NGF receptor binding inhibitory activity was evaluated by a method similar to that in Example 6, and the neurite outgrowth inhibitory activity was evaluated by a method similar to that in Example 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result, it was found that H1, L2 and L6 bind to NGF but the activity is lower than the aptamers shown by SEQ ID NOs: 30, 32, 35 (Table 7). Moreover, H1, L2 and L6 did not inhibit binding of NGF and NGF receptor, and did not show an inhibitory activity even when added at 500 nM in the neurite outgrowth inhibitory experiment (Table 7). From the above, it was shown that the aptamers described in the present specification have higher activity than the aptamers described in the prior art reference.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNGF neurite\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNGF-NGF\n\n\n \n\n\noutgrowth\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nreceptor\n\n\n \n\n\ninhibitory\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nbinding\n\n\nbinding\n\n\n \n\n\nactivity\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nwith NGF\n\n\ninhibition\n\n\n \n\n\n(%)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(BIACore)\n\n\nTrkA\n\n\nP75\n\n\n500 nM\n\n\n250 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNO: 30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n97.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNO: 32\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n94.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNO: 35\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1\n\n\n+\n\n\n−\n\n\n−\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL2\n\n\n−\n\n\n−\n\n\n−\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL6\n\n\n−\n\n\n−\n\n\n−\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 7 shows NGF binding activity, NGF-NGF receptor binding inhibition, and NGF neurite outgrowth inhibitory activity of the aptamers shown by SEQ ID NOs: 30, 32, 35 and the aptamers H1, L2, L6 described in \nnon-patent document\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe NGF binding activity was evaluated based on the maximum RU value obtained by the binding of NGF and SEQ ID NO: 35 as 100%. When it is not less than 80%, “++” is indicated, when it is not less than 50%, “+” is indicated, and when it is 50% or below, “−” is indicated. As for NGF-NGF receptor binding inhibition, “+” means an inhibitory activity (%) of not less than 60%, and “−” means an inhibitory activity (%) of less than 60%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe NGF neurite outgrowth inhibitory activity is the inhibitory activity (%) when the final concentration of the aptamer is 500 nM or 250 nM.\n\n\n \nINDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY\n\n\n \n \n \nThe aptamer and the complex of the present invention can be useful as medicaments, diagnostic agents or reagents for diseases such as pain, inflammatory disease and the like. The aptamer and the complex of the present invention can also be useful for the purification and concentration of NGF, as well as detection and quantification of NGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis application is based on a patent application No. 2008-244982 filed in Japan (filing date: Sep. 24, 2008), the contents of which are incorporated in full herein."
