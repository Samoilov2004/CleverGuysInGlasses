    "text": "RNAi Modulation of RSV, PIV and Other Respiratory Viruses and Uses Thereof AbstractThe present invention is based on the in vivo demonstration that RSV and PIV can be inhibited through intranasal administration of RNAi agents as well as by parenteral administration of such agents. Further, it is shown that effective viral reduction can be achieved with more than one virus being treated concurrently.

The sequence listing is incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to the field of respiratory viral therapy and compositions and methods for modulating viral replication, and more particularly to the down-regulation of a gene(s) of a respiratory virus by oligonucleotides via RNA interference which are administered locally to the lungs and nasal passage via inhalation/intranasally or systemically via injection/intravenous.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nBy virtue of its natural function the respiratory tract is exposed to a slew of airborne pathogens that cause a variety of respiratory ailments. Viral infection of the respiratory tract is the most common cause of infantile hospitalization in the developed world with an estimated 91,000 annual admissions in the US at a cost of $300 M. Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) are two major agents of respiratory illness; together, they infect the upper and lower respiratory tracts, leading to croup, pneumonia and bronchiolitis (Openshaw, P. J. M. Respir. Res. 3 (Suppl 1), S15-S20 (2002), Easton, A. J., et al., \nClin. Microbiol. Rev. \n17, 390-412 (2004)). RSV alone infects up to 65% of all babies within the first year of life, and essentially all within the first 2 years. It is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly as well. Immunity after RSV infection is neither complete nor lasting, and therefore, repeated infections occur in all age groups. Infants experiencing RSV bronchiolitis are more likely to develop wheezing and asthma later in life. Research for effective treatment and vaccine against RSV has been ongoing for nearly four decades with few successes (Openshaw, P. J. M. Respir. Res. 3 (Suppl 1), S15-S20 (2002), Maggon, K. et al, \nRev. Med. Virol. \n14, 149-168 (2004)). Currently, no vaccine is clinically approved for either RSV or PIV. Strains of both viruses also exist for nonhuman animals such as the cattle, goat, pig and sheep, causing loss to agriculture and the dairy and meat industry (Easton, A. J., et al., \nClin. Microbiol. Rev. \n17, 390-412 (2004)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth RSV and PIV contain nonsegmented negative-strand RNA genomes and belong to the Paramyxoviridae family. A number of features of these viruses have contributed to the difficulties of prevention and therapy. The viral genomes mutate at a high rate due to the lack of a replicational proof-reading mechanism of the RNA genomes, presenting a significant challenge in designing a reliable vaccine or antiviral (Sullender, W. M. \nClin. Microbiol. Rev. \n13, 1-15 (2000)). Promising inhibitors of the RSV fusion protein (F) were abandoned partly because the virus developed resistant mutations that were mapped to the F gene (Razinkov, V., et. al., \nAntivir. Res. \n55, 189-200 (2002), Morton, C. J. et al. \nVirology \n311, 275-288 (2003)). Both viruses associate with cellular proteins, adding to the difficulty of obtaining cell-free viral material for vaccination (Burke, E., et al., \nVirology \n252, 137-148 (1998), Burke, E., et al., \nJ. Virol. \n74, 669-675 (2000), Gupta, S., et al., \nJ. Virol. \n72, 2655-2662 (1998)). Finally, the immunology of both, and especially that of RSV, is exquisitely complex (Peebles, R. S., Jr., et al., \nViral. Immunol. \n16, 25-34 (2003), Haynes, L. M., et al., \nJ. Virol. \n77, 9831-9844 (2003)). Use of denatured RSV proteins as vaccines leads to “immunopotentiation” or vaccine-enhanced disease (Polack, F. P. et al. \nJ. Exp. Med. \n196, 859-865 (2002)), and this phenomenon has been neither tested nor ruled out for PIV. The overall problem is underscored by the recent closure of a number of anti-RSV biopharma programs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe RSV genome comprises a single strand of negative sense RNA that is 15,222 nucleotides in length and yields eleven major proteins. (Falsey, A. R., and E. E. Walsh, 2000, Clinical Microbiological Reviews 13:371-84.) Two of these proteins, the F (fusion) and G (attachment) glycoproteins, are the major surface proteins and the most important for inducing protective immunity. The SH (small hydrophobic) protein, the M (matrix) protein, and the M2 (22 kDa) protein are associated with the viral envelope but do not induce a protective immune response. The N (major nucleocapsid associated protein), P (phosphoprotein), and L (major polymerase protein) proteins are found associated with virion RNA. The two non-structural proteins, NS1 and NS2, presumably participate in host-virus interaction but are not present in infectious virions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman RSV strains have been classified into two major groups, A and B. The G glycoprotein has been shown to be the most divergent among RSV proteins. Variability of the RSV G glycoprotein between and within the two RSV groups is believed to be important to the ability of RSV to cause yearly outbreaks of disease. The G glycoprotein comprises 289-299 amino acids (depending on RSV strain), and has an intracellular, transmembrane, and highly glycosylated stalk structure of 90 kDa, as well as heparin-binding domains. The glycoprotein exists in secreted and membrane-bound forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuccessful methods of treating RSV infection are currently unavailable (Maggon and Bark 2004, \nReviews in Medical Virology \n14:149-68). Infection of the lower respiratory tract with RSV is a self-limiting condition in most cases. No definitive guidelines or criteria exist on how to treat or when to admit or discharge infants and children with the disease. Hypoxia, which can occur in association with RSV infection, can be treated with oxygen via a nasal cannula. Mechanical ventilation for children with respiratory failure, shock, or recurrent apnea can lower mortality. Some physicians prescribe steroids. However, several studies have shown that steroid therapy does not affect the clinical course of infants and children admitted to the hospital with bronchiolitis. Thus corticosteroids, alone or in combination with bronchodilators, may be useless in the management of bronchiolitis in otherwise healthy unventilated patients. In infants and children with underlying cardiopulmonary diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysphasia and asthma, steroids have also been used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRibavirin, a guanosine analogue with antiviral activity, has been used to treat infants and children with RSV bronchiolitis since the mid 1980s, but many studies evaluating its use have shown conflicting results. In most centers, the use of ribavirin is now restricted to immunocompromised patients and to those who are severely ill.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe severity of RSV bronchiolitis has been associated with low serum retinol concentrations, but trials in hospitalized children with RSV bronchiolitis have shown that vitamin A supplementation provides no beneficial effect. Therapeutic trials of 1500 mg/kg intravenous RSV immune globulin or 100 mg/kg inhaled immune globulin for RSV lower-respiratory-tract infection have also failed to show substantial beneficial effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn developed countries, the treatment of RSV lower-respiratory-tract infection is generally limited to symptomatic therapy. Antiviral therapy is usually limited to life-threatening situations due to its high cost and to the lack of consensus on efficacy. In developing countries, oxygen is the main therapy (when available), and the only way to lower mortality is through prevention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA interference or “RNAi” is a term initially coined by Fire and co-workers to describe the observation that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can block gene expression when it is introduced into worms (Fire et al., \nNature \n391:806-811, 1998). Short dsRNA directs gene-specific, post-transcriptional silencing in many organisms, including vertebrates, and has provided a new tool for studying gene function. RNAi has been suggested as a method of developing a new class of therapeutic agents. However, to date, these have remained mostly as suggestions with no demonstrate proof that RNAi can be used therapeutically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, there is a need for safe and effective vaccines against RSV, especially for infants and children. There is also a need for therapeutic agents and methods for treating RSV infection at all ages and in immuno-compromised individuals. There is also a need for scientific methods to characterize the protective immune response to RSV so that the pathogenesis of the disease can be studied, and screening for therapeutic agents and vaccines can be facilitated. The present invention overcomes previous shortcomings in the art by providing methods and compositions effective for modulating or preventing RSV and PIV infection, which be expanded to other respiratory viruses. Specifically, the present invention advances the art by providing iRNA agents that have been shown to reduce RSV and PIV levels in vivo and a showing of therapeutic activity of this class of molecules. It is further demonstrated that more than one virus can be treated concurrently.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is based on the in vivo demonstration that RSV and PIV can be inhibited through intranasal administration of RNAi agents, as well as by parenteral administration of such agents. Further, it is shown that effective viral titer reduction can be achieved with more than one virus being treated concurrently using two different iRNA agents. Based on these findings, the present invention provides general and specific compositions and methods that are useful in reducing RSV or PIV mRNA levels, RSV or PIV protein levels and RSV and PIV viral titers in a subject, e.g., a mammal, such as a human. These findings can be applied to other respiratory viruses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention specifically provides iRNA agents consisting of or comprising at least 15 contiguous nucleotides of one of the genes of RSV, PIV or other respiratory virus, particularly the P gene of RSV or PIV and the N G, F, SH, M, and L genes of RSV. The iRNA agent preferably comprises less than 30 nucleotides per strand, e.g., 21-23 nucleotides. The double stranded iRNA agent can either have blunt ends or more preferably have overhangs of 1-4 nucleotides from one or both 3′ ends of the agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the iRNA agent can either contain only naturally occurring ribonucleotide subunits, or can be synthesized so as to contain one or more modifications to the sugar or base of one or more of the ribonucleotide subunits that is included in the agent. The iRNA agent can be further modified so as to be attached to a ligand that is selected to improve stability, distribution or cellular uptake of the agent, e.g. cholesterol. The iRNA agents can further be in isolated form or can be part of a pharmaceutical composition used for the methods described herein, particularly as a pharmaceutical composition formulated for delivery to the lungs or nasal passage or formulated for parental administration. The pharmaceutical compositions can contain one or more iRNA agents, and in some embodiments, will contain two or more iRNA agents, each one directed to a different respiratory virus, such as RSV and PIV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides methods for reducing the level of RSV, PIV or other respiratory viral mRNA in a cell. The present methods utilize the cellular mechanisms involved in RNA interference to selectively degrade the viral mRNA in a cell and are comprised of the step of contacting a cell with one of the antiviral iRNA agents of the present invention. Such methods can be preformed directly on a cell or can be performed on a mammalian subject by administering to a subject one of the iRNA agents/pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention. Reduction of viral mRNA in a cells results in a reduction in the amount of viral protein produced, and in an organism, results in a decrease in replicating viral titer. The Examples demonstrate this with PIV and RSV and this can be extended to other respiratory viruses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides methods for reducing the level of two or more respiratory viral mRNA in a cell, each one coming from a different virus. The present methods utilize the cellular mechanisms involved in RNA interference to selectively degrade the viral mRNA from two different viruses in a cell and are comprised of the step of contacting a cell with two of the antiviral iRNA agents of the present invention. Such methods can be preformed directly on a cell or can be performed on a mammalian subject by administering to a subject two of the iRNA agents of the present invention. Reduction of viral mRNA from two different viruses in a cells results in a reduction in the amount of both viral protein produced, and in an organism, results in a decrease in replicating viral titer of both viruses. The Examples demonstrate this with PIV and RSV and concurrent administration of iRNA agents. This embodiment of the present invention can be applied to any two respiratory viruses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods and compositions of the invention, e.g., the methods and iRNA compositions can be used with any dosage and/or formulation described herein, as well as with any route of administration described herein. Particularly important is the showing herein of intranasal administration of an iRNA agent and its ability to inhibit viral replication in respiratory tissues. This finding can be applied to other respiratory virus, such as PIV as shown in the Examples and to other routes of local delivery to the lungs, e.g. via inhalation/nebulization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from this description, the drawings, and from the claims. This application incorporates all cited references, patents, and patent applications by references in their entirety for all purposes.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n.

It will be understood that the usage of the term “ribonucleotide” or “nucleotide” herein can, in the case of a modified RNA or nucleotide surrogate, also refer to a modified nucleotide, or surrogate replacement moiety, as further described below, at one or more positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “RNA agent” as used herein, is an unmodified RNA, modified RNA, or nucleoside surrogates, all of which are described herein or are well known in the RNA synthetic art. While numerous modified RNAs and nucleoside surrogates are described, preferred examples include those which have greater resistance to nuclease degradation than do unmodified RNAs. Preferred examples include those that have a 2′ sugar modification, a modification in a single strand overhang, preferably a 3′ single strand overhang, or, particularly if single stranded, a 5′-modification which includes one or more phosphate groups or one or more analogs of a phosphate group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “iRNA agent” sometimes referred to as an “RNAi agent” (abbreviation for “interfering RNA agent”) as used herein, is an RNA agent, which can down-regulate the expression of a target gene, e.g., RSV. While not wishing to be bound by theory, an iRNA agent may act by one or more of a number of mechanisms, including post-transcriptional cleavage of a target mRNA sometimes referred to in the art as RNAi, or pre-transcriptional or pre-translational mechanisms. An iRNA agent can include a single strand or can include more than one strands, e.g., it can be a double stranded (ds) iRNA agent. If the iRNA agent is a single strand it is particularly preferred that it include a 5′ modification which includes one or more phosphate groups or one or more analogs of a phosphate group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “single strand iRNA agent” as used herein, is an iRNA agent which is made up of a single molecule. It may include a duplexed region, formed by intra-strand pairing, e.g., it may be, or include, a hairpin or panhandle structure. Single strand iRNA agents are preferably antisense with regard to the target molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “ds iRNA agent” (abbreviation for “double stranded iRNA agent”), as used herein, is an iRNA agent which includes more than one, and preferably two, strands in which interchain hybridization can form a region of duplex structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe isolated iRNA agents described herein, including ds iRNA agents and siRNA agents, can mediate silencing of a target gene, e.g., by RNA degradation. For convenience, such RNA is also referred to herein as the RNA to be silenced. Such a gene is also referred to as a target gene. Preferably, the RNA to be silenced is a gene product of an endogenous RSV gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrase “mediates RNAi” refers to the ability of an agent to silence, in a sequence specific manner, a target gene. “Silencing a target gene” means the process whereby a cell containing and/or secreting a certain product of the target gene when not in contact with the agent, will contain and/or secret at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% less of such gene product when contacted with the agent, as compared to a similar cell which has not been contacted with the agent. Such product of the target gene can, for example, be a messenger RNA (mRNA), a protein, or a regulatory element.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the anti viral uses of the present invention, silencing of a target gene will result in a reduction in “viral titer” in the cell. As used herein, “reduction in viral titer” refers to a decrease in the number of viable virus produced by a cell or found in an organism undergoing the silencing of a viral target gene. Reduction in the cellular amount of virus produced will preferably lead to a decrease in the amount of measurable virus produced in the tissues of a subject undergoing treatment and a reduction in the severity of the symptoms of the viral infection. iRNA agents of the present invention are also referred to as “antiviral iRNA agents”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “RSV gene” refers to any one of the genes identified in the RSV virus genome (See Falsey, A. R., and E. E. Walsh, 2000, Clinical Microbiological Reviews 13:371-84). These genes are readily known in the art and include the F, G, SH, M, N, P and L genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “PIV gene” refers to any one of the genes identified in the PIV virus genome (See GenBank Accession #NC\n—\n001796). These genes are readily known in the art and include the N, P, C, D, V, M, F, FIN, and L genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “respiratory virus” refers to viruses that replicate in cells of the respiratory system. Such viruses include, but are not limited to RSV, PIV, influenza, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and coronavirus (such as SARS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “complementary” is used to indicate a sufficient degree of complementarity such that stable and specific binding occurs between a compound of the invention and a target RNA molecule, e.g. an RSV, PIV or other respiratory viral mRNA molecule. Specific binding requires a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the oligomeric compound to non-target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, or in the case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the assays are performed. The non-target sequences typically differ by at least 4 nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an iRNA agent is “sufficiently complementary” to a target RNA, e.g., a target mRNA (e.g., a target RSV or PIV mRNA) if the iRNA agent reduces the production of a protein encoded by the target RNA in a cell. The iRNA agent may also be “exactly complementary” (excluding the SRMS containing subunit(s)) to the target RNA, e.g., the target RNA and the iRNA agent anneal, preferably to form a hybrid made exclusively of Watson-Crick base pairs in the region of exact complementarity. A “sufficiently complementary” iRNA agent can include an internal region (e.g., of at least 10 nucleotides) that is exactly complementary to a target viral RNA. Moreover, in some embodiments, the iRNA agent specifically discriminates a single-nucleotide difference. In this case, the iRNA agent only mediates RNAi if exact complementary is found in the region (e.g., within 7 nucleotides of) the single-nucleotide difference. Preferred iRNA agents will be based on or consist or comprise the sense and antisense sequences provided in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “essentially identical” when used referring to a first nucleotide sequence in comparison to a second nucleotide sequence means that the first nucleotide sequence is identical to the second nucleotide sequence except for up to one, two or three nucleotide substitutions (e.g. adenosine replaced by uracil).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “subject” refers to a mammalian organism undergoing treatment for a disorder mediated by viral expression, such as RSV or PIV infection or undergoing treatment prophylactically to prevent viral infection. The subject can be any mammal, such as a primate, cow, horse, mouse, rat, dog, pig, goat. In the preferred embodiment, the subject is a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, treating RSV infection, PIV infection, or other respiratory virus infection, refers to the amelioration of any biological or pathological endpoints that 1) is mediated in part by the presence of the virus in the subject and 2) whose outcome can be affected by reducing the level of viral protein present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “co-administration” refers to administering to a subject two or more agents, and in particular two or more iRNA agents. The agents can be contained in a single pharmaceutical composition and be administered at the same time, or the agents can be contained in separate formulation and administered serially to a subject. So long as the two agents can be detected in the subject at the same time, the two agents are said to be co-administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause iRNA agent mediated silencing can persist for several days after administering the iRNA agent composition, in many instances, it is possible to administer the composition with a frequency of less than once per day, or, for some instances, only once for the entire therapeutic regimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDesign and Selection of iRNA Agents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is based on the demonstration of target gene silencing of a respiratory viral gene in vivo following local administration to the lungs and nasal passage of an iRNA agent either via intranasal administration/inhalation or systemically/parenterally via injection and the resulting treatment of viral infection. The present invention is further extended to the use of iRNA agents to more than one respiratory virus and the treatment of both virus infections with co-administration of two or more iRNA agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on these results, the invention specifically provides an iRNA agent that can be used in treating viral infection, particularly respiratory viruses and in particular RSV or PIV infection, in isolated form and as a pharmaceutical composition described below. Such agents will include a sense strand having at least 15 contiguous nucleotides that are complementary to a viral gene and an antisense strand having at least 15 contiguous nucleotides that is complementary to the sense strand sequences. Particularly useful are iRNA agents that comprise a nucleotide sequence from the P protein gene of RSV or PIV. Other target genes in RSV include the F, G, SH, M, N and L. Other genes in PIV include N, P, C, D, V, M, F, FIN, and L genes. Exemplified agents are provided in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCandidate iRNA agents can be designed by performing, for example, a gene walk analysis of the viral genes that will serve as the iRNA target. Overlapping, adjacent, or closely spaced candidate agents corresponding to all or some of the transcribed region can be generated and tested. Each of the iRNA agents can be tested and evaluated for the ability to down regulate the target gene expression (see below, “Evaluation of Candidate iRNA agents”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn iRNA agent can be rationally designed based on sequence information and desired characteristics. For example, an iRNA agent can be designed according to the relative melting temperature of the candidate duplex. Generally, the duplex should have a lower melting temperature at the 5′ end of the antisense strand than at the 3′ end of the antisense strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention provides iRNA agents comprising a sense strand and antisense strand each comprising a sequence of at least 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 or 23 nucleotides which is essentially identical to, as defined above, to a portion of a gene from a respiratory virus, particularly the P protein genes of RSV or PIV. Exemplified iRNA agents include those that comprise 15 contiguous nucleotides from one of the agents provided in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antisense strand of an iRNA agent should be equal to or at least, 15, 16 17, 18, 19, 25, 29, 40, or 50 nucleotides in length. It should be equal to or less than 50, 40, or 30, nucleotides in length. Preferred ranges are 15-30, 17 to 25, 19 to 23, and 19 to 21 nucleotides in length. In several embodiments, the agent will comprise 15 nucleotides from one of the agents in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sense strand of an iRNA agent should be equal to or at least 15, 16 17, 18, 19, 25, 29, 40, or 50 nucleotides in length. It should be equal to or less than 50, 40, or 30 nucleotides in length. Preferred ranges are 15-30, 17 to 25, 19 to 23, and 19 to 21 nucleotides in length. In several embodiments, the agent will comprise 15 nucleotides from one of the agents in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe double stranded portion of an iRNA agent should be equal to or at least, 15, 16 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 29, 40, or 50 nucleotide pairs in length. It should be equal to or less than 50, 40, or 30 nucleotides pairs in length. Preferred ranges are 15-30, 17 to 25, 19 to 23, and 19 to 21 nucleotides pairs in length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe agents provided in Table 1 are 21 nucleotide in length for each strand. The iRNA agents contain a 19 nucleotide double stranded region with a 2 nucleotide overhang on each of the 3′ ends of the agent. These agents can be modified as described herein to obtain equivalent agents comprising at least a portion of these sequences and or modifications to the oligonucleotide bases and linkages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the iRNA agents of the instant invention include a region of sufficient complementarity to the viral gene, e.g. the P protein of RSV or PIV, and are of sufficient length in terms of nucleotides, that the iRNA agent, or a fragment thereof, can mediate down regulation of the specific viral gene. The antisense strands of the iRNA agents of the present invention are preferably fully complementary to the mRNA sequences of viral gene, as is herein for the P proteins of RSV and PIV. However, it is not necessary that there be perfect complementarity between the iRNA agent and the target, but the correspondence must be sufficient to enable the iRNA agent, or a cleavage product thereof, to direct sequence specific silencing, e.g., by RNAi cleavage of an RSV mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, the iRNA agents of the instant invention include agents comprising a sense strand and antisense strand each comprising a sequence of at least 16, 17 or 18 nucleotides which is essentially identical, as defined below, to one of the sequences of a viral gene, particularly the P protein of RSV or PIV, except that not more than 1, 2 or 3 nucleotides per strand, respectively, have been substituted by other nucleotides (e.g. adenosine replaced by uracil), while essentially retaining the ability to inhibit RSV expression in cultured human cells, as defined below. These agents will therefore possess at least 15 nucleotides identical to one of the sequences of a viral gene, particularly the P protein gene of RSV or PIV, but 1, 2 or 3 base mismatches with respect to either the target viral mRNA sequence or between the sense and antisense strand are introduced. Mismatches to the target viral mRNA sequence, particularly in the antisense strand, are most tolerated in the terminal regions and if present are preferably in a terminal region or regions, e.g., within 6, 5, 4, or 3 nucleotides of a 5′ and/or 3′ terminus, most preferably within 6, 5, 4, or 3 nucleotides of the 5′-terminus of the sense strand or the 3′-terminus of the antisense strand. The sense strand need only be sufficiently complementary with the antisense strand to maintain the overall double stranded character of the molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is preferred that the sense and antisense strands be chosen such that the iRNA agent includes a single strand or unpaired region at one or both ends of the molecule, such as those exemplified in Table 1. Thus, an iRNA agent contains sense and antisense strands, preferably paired to contain an overhang, e.g., one or two 5′ or 3′ overhangs but preferably a 3′ overhang of 2-3 nucleotides. Most embodiments will have a 3′ overhang. Preferred siRNA agents will have single-stranded overhangs, preferably 3′ overhangs, of 1 to 4, or preferably 2 or 3 nucleotides, in length one or both ends of the iRNA agent. The overhangs can be the result of one strand being longer than the other, or the result of two strands of the same length being staggered. 5′-ends are preferably phosphorylated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred lengths for the duplexed region is between 15 and 30, most preferably 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 nucleotides in length, e.g., in the siRNA agent range discussed above. Embodiments in which the two strands of the siRNA agent are linked, e.g., covalently linked are also included. Hairpin, or other single strand structures which provide the required double stranded region, and preferably a 3′ overhang are also within the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEvaluation of Candidate iRNA Agents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA candidate iRNA agent can be evaluated for its ability to down regulate target gene expression. For example, a candidate iRNA agent can be provided, and contacted with a cell, e.g. a human cell, that has been infected with or will be infected with the virus of interest, e.g., a virus containing the target gene. Alternatively, the cell can transfected with a construct from which target viral gene is expressed, thus preventing the need for a viral infectivity model. The level of target gene expression prior to and following contact with the candidate iRNA agent can be compared, e.g. on an mRNA, protein level or viral titer. If it is determined that the amount of RNA, protein or virus expressed from the target gene is lower following contact with the iRNA agent, then it can be concluded that the iRNA agent down regulates target gene expression. The level of target viral RNA or viral protein in the cell or viral titer in a cell or tissue can be determined by any method desired. For example, the level of target RNA can be determined by Northern blot analysis, reverse transcription coupled with polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), bDNA analysis, or RNAse protection assay. The level of protein can be determined, for example, by Western blot analysis or immuno-flouresence. Viral titer can be detected through a plaque formation assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStability Testing, Modification, and Retesting of iRNA Agents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA candidate iRNA agent can be evaluated with respect to stability, e.g., its susceptibility to cleavage by an endonuclease or exonuclease, such as when the iRNA agent is introduced into the body of a subject. Methods can be employed to identify sites that are susceptible to modification, particularly cleavage, e.g., cleavage by a component found in the body of a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen sites susceptible to cleavage are identified, a further iRNA agent can be designed and/or synthesized wherein the potential cleavage site is made resistant to cleavage, e.g. by introduction of a 2′-modification on the site of cleavage, e.g. a 2′-O-mathyl group. This further iRNA agent can be retested for stability, and this process may be iterated until an iRNA agent is found exhibiting the desired stability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Vivo Testing\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn iRNA agent identified as being capable of inhibiting RSV gene expression can be tested for functionality in vivo in an animal model (e.g., in a mammal, such as in mouse or rat) as shown in the examples. For example, the iRNA agent can be administered to an animal, and the iRNA agent evaluated with respect to its biodistribution, stability, and its ability to inhibit viral, e.g. RSV or PIV, gene expression or reduce viral titer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe iRNA agent can be administered directly to the target tissue, such as by injection, or the iRNA agent can be administered to the animal model in the same manner that it would be administered to a human. As shown herein, the agent can be preferably administered via inhalation as a means of treating viral infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe iRNA agent can also be evaluated for its intracellular distribution. The evaluation can include determining whether the iRNA agent was taken up into the cell. The evaluation can also include determining the stability (e.g., the half-life) of the iRNA agent. Evaluation of an iRNA agent in vivo can be facilitated by use of an iRNA agent conjugated to a traceable marker (e.g., a fluorescent marker such as fluorescein; a radioactive label, such as \n35\nS, \n32\nP, \n33\nP, or \n3\nH; gold particles; or antigen particles for immunohistochemistry).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn iRNA agent useful for monitoring biodistribution can lack gene silencing activity in vivo. For example, the iRNA agent can target a gene not present in the animal (e.g., an iRNA agent injected into mouse can target luciferase), or an iRNA agent can have a non-sense sequence, which does not target any gene, e.g., any endogenous gene). Localization/biodistribution of the iRNA can be monitored, e.g. by a traceable label attached to the iRNA agent, such as a traceable agent described above\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe iRNA agent can be evaluated with respect to its ability to down regulate viral gene expression. Levels of viral gene expression in vivo can be measured, for example, by in situ hybridization, or by the isolation of RNA from tissue prior to and following exposure to the iRNA agent. Where the animal needs to be sacrificed in order to harvest the tissue, an untreated control animal will serve for comparison. Target viral mRNA can be detected by any desired method, including but not limited to RT-PCR, Northern blot, branched-DNA assay, or RNAase protection assay. Alternatively, or additionally, viral gene expression can be monitored by performing Western blot analysis on tissue extracts treated with the iRNA agent. Viral titer can be determined using a pfu assy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \niRNA Chemistry\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDescribed herein are isolated iRNA agents, e.g., RNA molecules, (double-stranded; single-stranded) that mediate RNAi to inhibit expression of a viral gene, e.g. the P protein of RSV or PIV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA agents discussed herein include otherwise unmodified RNA as well as RNA which have been modified, e.g., to improve efficacy, and polymers of nucleoside surrogates. Unmodified RNA refers to a molecule in which the components of the nucleic acid, namely sugars, bases, and phosphate moieties, are the same or essentially the same as that which occur in nature, preferably as occur naturally in the human body. The art has referred to rare or unusual, but naturally occurring, RNAs as modified RNAs, see, e.g., Limbach et al., (1994) \nNucleic Acids Res. \n22: 2183-2196. Such rare or unusual RNAs, often termed modified RNAs (apparently because these are typically the result of a post-transcriptional modification) are within the term unmodified RNA, as used herein. Modified RNA as used herein refers to a molecule in which one or more of the components of the nucleic acid, namely sugars, bases, and phosphate moieties, are different from that which occurs in nature, preferably different from that which occurs in the human body. While they are referred to as modified “RNAs,” they will of course, because of the modification, include molecules which are not RNAs. Nucleoside surrogates are molecules in which the ribophosphate backbone is replaced with a non-ribophosphate construct that allows the bases to the presented in the correct spatial relationship such that hybridization is substantially similar to what is seen with a ribophosphate backbone, e.g., non-charged mimics of the ribophosphate backbone. Examples of each of the above are discussed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications described herein can be incorporated into any double-stranded RNA and RNA-like molecule described herein, e.g., an iRNA agent. It may be desirable to modify one or both of the antisense and sense strands of an iRNA agent. As nucleic acids are polymers of subunits or monomers, many of the modifications described below occur at a position which is repeated within a nucleic acid, e.g., a modification of a base, or a phosphate moiety, or the non-linking O of a phosphate moiety. In some cases the modification will occur at all of the subject positions in the nucleic acid but in many, and in fact in most, cases it will not. By way of example, a modification may only occur at a 3′ or 5′ terminal position, may only occur in a terminal region, e.g. at a position on a terminal nucleotide or in the last 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 nucleotides of a strand. A modification may occur in a double strand region, a single strand region, or in both. E.g., a phosphorothioate modification at a non-linking O position may only occur at one or both termini, may only occur in a terminal regions, e.g., at a position on a terminal nucleotide or in the last 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 nucleotides of a strand, or may occur in double strand and single strand regions, particularly at termini. Similarly, a modification may occur on the sense strand, antisense strand, or both. In some cases, the sense and antisense strand will have the same modifications or the same class of modifications, but in other cases the sense and antisense strand will have different modifications, e.g., in some cases it may be desirable to modify only one strand, e.g. the sense strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo prime objectives for the introduction of modifications into iRNA agents is their stabilization towards degradation in biological environments and the improvement of pharmacological properties, e.g. pharmacodynamic properties, which are further discussed below. Other suitable modifications to a sugar, base, or backbone of an iRNA agent are described in co-owned PCT Application No. PCT/US2004/01193, filed Jan. 16, 2004. An iRNA agent can include a non-naturally occurring base, such as the bases described in co-owned PCT Application No. PCT/US2004/011822, filed Apr. 16, 2004. An iRNA agent can include a non-naturally occurring sugar, such as a non-carbohydrate cyclic carrier molecule. Exemplary features of non-naturally occurring sugars for use in iRNA agents are described in co-owned PCT Application No. PCT/US2004/11829 filed Apr. 16, 2003.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn iRNA agent can include an internucleotide linkage (e.g., the chiral phosphorothioate linkage) useful for increasing nuclease resistance. In addition, or in the alternative, an iRNA agent can include a ribose mimic for increased nuclease resistance. Exemplary internucleotide linkages and ribose mimics for increased nuclease resistance are described in co-owned PCT Application No. PCT/US2004/07070 filed on Mar. 8, 2004.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn iRNA agent can include ligand-conjugated monomer subunits and monomers for oligonucleotide synthesis. Exemplary monomers are described in co-owned U.S. application Ser. No. 10/916,185, filed on Aug. 10, 2004.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn iRNA agent can have a ZXY structure, such as is described in co-owned PCT Application No. PCT/US2004/07070 filed on Mar. 8, 2004.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn iRNA agent can be complexed with an amphipathic moiety. Exemplary amphipathic moieties for use with iRNA agents are described in co-owned PCT Application No. PCT/US2004/07070 filed on Mar. 8, 2004.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the iRNA agent can be complexed to a delivery agent that features a modular complex. The complex can include a carrier agent linked to one or more of (preferably two or more, more preferably all three of): (a) a condensing agent (e.g., an agent capable of attracting, e.g., binding, a nucleic acid, e.g., through ionic or electrostatic interactions); (b) a fusogenic agent (e.g., an agent capable of fusing and/or being transported through a cell membrane); and (c) a targeting group, e.g., a cell or tissue targeting agent, e.g., a lectin, glycoprotein, lipid or protein, e.g., an antibody, that binds to a specified cell type. iRNA agents complexed to a delivery agent are described in co-owned PCT Application No. PCT/US2004/07070 filed on Mar. 8, 2004.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn iRNA agent can have non-canonical pairings, such as between the sense and antisense sequences of the iRNA duplex. Exemplary features of non-canonical iRNA agents are described in co-owned PCT Application No. PCT/US2004/07070 filed on Mar. 8, 2004.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced Nuclease Resistance\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn iRNA agent, e.g., an iRNA agent that targets RSV can have enhanced resistance to nucleases. One way to increase resistance is to identify cleavage sites and modify such sites to inhibit cleavage. For example, the \ndinucleotides\n 5′-UA-3′, 5′-UG-3′, 5′-CA-3′, 5′-UU-3′, or 5′-CC-3′ can serve as cleavage sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor increased nuclease resistance and/or binding affinity to the target, an iRNA agent, e.g., the sense and/or antisense strands of the iRNA agent, can include, for example, 2′-modified ribose units and/or phosphorothioate linkages. E.g., the 2′ hydroxyl group (OH) can be modified or replaced with a number of different “oxy” or “deoxy” substituents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of “oxy”-2′ hydroxyl group modifications include alkoxy or aryloxy (OR, e.g., R═H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl or sugar); polyethyleneglycols (PEG), O(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nOR; “locked” nucleic acids (LNA) in which the 2′ hydroxyl is connected, e.g., by a methylene bridge, to the 4′ carbon of the same ribose sugar; O-AMINE (AMINE=NH\n2\n; alkylamino, dialkylamino, heterocyclyl, arylamino, diaryl amino, heteroaryl amino, or diheteroaryl amino, ethylene diamine, polyamino) and aminoalkoxy, O(CH\n2\n)\nn\nAMINE, (e.g., AMINE=NH\n2\n; alkylamino, dialkylamino, heterocyclyl, arylamino, diaryl amino, heteroaryl amino, or diheteroaryl amino, ethylene diamine, polyamino). It is noteworthy that oligonucleotides containing only the methoxyethyl group (MOE), (OCH\n2\nCH\n2\nOCH\n3\n, a PEG derivative), exhibit nuclease stabilities comparable to those modified with the robust phosphorothioate modification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Deoxy” modifications include hydrogen (i.e. deoxyribose sugars, which are of particular relevance to the overhang portions of partially ds RNA); halo (e.g., fluoro); amino (e.g. NH\n2\n; alkylamino, dialkylamino, heterocyclyl, arylamino, diaryl amino, heteroaryl amino, diheteroaryl amino, or amino acid); NH(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nNH)\nn\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n-AMINE (AMINE=NH\n2\n; alkylamino, dialkylamino, heterocyclyl, arylamino, diaryl amino, heteroaryl amino, or diheteroaryl amino), —NHC(O)R (R=alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl or sugar), cyano; mercapto; alkyl-thio-alkyl; thioalkoxy; and alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkenyl and alkynyl, which may be optionally substituted with e.g., an amino functionality. Preferred substitutents are 2′-methoxyethyl, 2′-OCH3, 2′-O-allyl, 2′-C-allyl, and 2′-fluoro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo maximize nuclease resistance, the 2′ modifications can be used in combination with one or more phosphate linker modifications (e.g., phosphorothioate). The so-called “chimeric” oligonucleotides are those that contain two or more different modifications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, all the pyrimidines of an iRNA agent carry a 2′-modification, and the iRNA agent therefore has enhanced resistance to endonucleases. Enhanced nuclease resistance can also be achieved by modifying the 5′ nucleotide, resulting, for example, in at least one 5′-uridine-adenine-3′ (5′-UA-3′) dinucleotide wherein the uridine is a 2′-modified nucleotide; at least one 5′-uridine-guanine-3′ (5′-UG-3′) dinucleotide, wherein the 5′-uridine is a 2′-modified nucleotide; at least one 5′-cytidine-adenine-3′ (5′-CA-3′) dinucleotide, wherein the 5′-cytidine is a 2′-modified nucleotide; at least one 5′-uridine-uridine-3′ (5′-UU-3′) dinucleotide, wherein the 5′-uridine is a 2′-modified nucleotide; or at least one 5′-cytidine-cytidine-3′ (5′-CC-3′) dinucleo wherein the 5′-cytidine is a 2′-modified nucleotide. The iRNA agent can include at least 2, at least 3, at least 4 or at least 5 of such dinucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inclusion of furanose sugars in the oligonucleotide backbone can also decrease endonucleolytic cleavage. An iRNA agent can be further modified by including a 3′ cationic group, or by inverting the nucleoside at the 3′-terminus with a 3′-3′ linkage. In another alternative, the 3′-terminus can be blocked with an aminoalkyl group, e.g., a 3′ C5-aminoalkyl dT. Other 3′ conjugates can inhibit 3′-5′ exonucleolytic cleavage. While not being bound by theory, a 3′ conjugate, such as naproxen or ibuprofen, may inhibit exonucleolytic cleavage by sterically blocking the exonuclease from binding to the 3′-end of oligonucleotide. Even small alkyl chains, aryl groups, or heterocyclic conjugates or modified sugars (D-ribose, deoxyribose, glucose etc.) can block 3′-5′-exonucleases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, 5′ conjugates can inhibit 5′-3′ exonucleolytic cleavage. While not being bound by theory, a 5′ conjugate, such as naproxen or ibuprofen, may inhibit exonucleolytic cleavage by sterically blocking the exonuclease from binding to the 5′-end of oligonucleotide. Even small alkyl chains, aryl groups, or heterocyclic conjugates or modified sugars (D-ribose, deoxyribose, glucose etc.) can block 3′-5′-exonucleases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn iRNA agent can have increased resistance to nucleases when a duplexed iRNA agent includes a single-stranded nucleotide overhang on at least one end. In preferred embodiments, the nucleotide overhang includes 1 to 4, preferably 2 to 3, unpaired nucleotides. In a preferred embodiment, the unpaired nucleotide of the single-stranded overhang that is directly adjacent to the terminal nucleotide pair contains a purine base, and the terminal nucleotide pair is a G-C pair, or at least two of the last four complementary nucleotide pairs are G-C pairs. In further embodiments, the nucleotide overhang may have 1 or 2 unpaired nucleotides, and in an exemplary embodiment the nucleotide overhang is 5′-GC-3′. In preferred embodiments, the nucleotide overhang is on the 3′-end of the antisense strand. In one embodiment, the iRNA agent includes the \nmotif\n 5′-CGC-3′ on the 3′-end of the antisense strand, such that a 2-\nnt overhang\n 5′-GC-3′ is formed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, an iRNA agent can include monomers which have been modified so as to inhibit degradation, e.g., by nucleases, e.g., endonucleases or exonucleases, found in the body of a subject. These monomers are referred to herein as NRMs, or Nuclease Resistance promoting Monomers or modifications. In many cases these modifications will modulate other properties of the iRNA agent as well, e.g., the ability to interact with a protein, e.g., a transport protein, e.g., serum albumin, or a member of the RISC, or the ability of the first and second sequences to form a duplex with one another or to form a duplex with another sequence, e.g., a target molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications that can be useful for producing iRNA agents that meet the preferred nuclease resistance criteria delineated above can include one or more of the following chemical and/or stereochemical modifications of the sugar, base, and/or phosphate backbone:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) chiral (S\np\n) thioates. Thus, preferred NRMs include nucleotide dimers with an enriched or pure for a particular chiral form of a modified phosphate group containing a heteroatom at the nonbridging position, e.g., Sp or Rp, at the position X, where this is the position normally occupied by the oxygen. The atom at X can also be S, Se, Nr\n2\n, or Br\n3\n. When X is S, enriched or chirally pure Sp linkage is preferred. Enriched means at least 70, 80, 90, 95, or 99% of the preferred form. Such NRMs are discussed in more detail below;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) attachment of one or more cationic groups to the sugar, base, and/or the phosphorus atom of a phosphate or modified phosphate backbone moiety. Thus, preferred NRMs include monomers at the terminal position derivatized at a cationic group. As the 5′-end of an antisense sequence should have a terminal —OH or phosphate group this NRM is preferably not used at the 5′-end of an anti-sense sequence. The group should be attached at a position on the base which minimizes interference with H bond formation and hybridization, e.g., away form the face which interacts with the complementary base on the other strand, e.g, at the 5′ position of a pyrimidine or a 7-position of a purine. These are discussed in more detail below;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(iii) nonphosphate linkages at the termini. Thus, preferred NRMs include Non-phosphate linkages, e.g., a linkage of 4 atoms which confers greater resistance to cleavage than does a phosphate bond. Examples include 3′ CH2-NCH\n3\n—O—CH\n2\n-5′ and 3′ CH\n2\n—NH—(O═)—CH\n2\n-5′;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(iv) 3′-bridging thiophosphates and 5′-bridging thiophosphates. Thus, preferred NRM's can included these structures;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(v) L-RNA, 2′-5′ linkages, inverted linkages, a-nucleosides. Thus, other preferred NRM's include: L nucleosides and dimeric nucleotides derived from L-nucleosides; 2′-5′ phosphate, non-phosphate and modified phosphate linkages (e.g., thiophosphates, phosphoramidates and boronophosphates); dimers having inverted linkages, e.g., 3′-3′ or 5′-5′ linkages; monomers having an alpha linkage at the 1′ site on the sugar, e.g., the structures described herein having an alpha linkage;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(vi) conjugate groups. Thus, preferred NRM's can include, e.g., a targeting moiety or a conjugated ligand described herein conjugated with the monomer, e.g., through the sugar, base, or backbone;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(vi) abasic linkages. Thus, preferred NRM's can include an abasic monomer, e.g., an abasic monomer as described herein (e.g., a nucleobaseless monomer); an aromatic or heterocyclic or polyheterocyclic aromatic monomer as described herein; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(vii) 5′-phosphonates and 5′-phosphate prodrugs. Thus, preferred NRM's include monomers, preferably at the terminal position, e.g., the 5′ position, in which one or more atoms of the phosphate group is derivatized with a protecting group, which protecting group or groups, are removed as a result of the action of a component in the subject's body, e.g, a carboxyesterase or an enzyme present in the subject's body. E.g., a phosphate prodrug in which a carboxy esterase cleaves the protected molecule resulting in the production of a thioate anion which attacks a carbon adjacent to the O of a phosphate and resulting in the production of an unprotected phosphate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more different NRM modifications can be introduced into an iRNA agent or into a sequence of an iRNA agent. An NRM modification can be used more than once in a sequence or in an iRNA agent. As some NRMs interfere with hybridization, the total number incorporated should be such that acceptable levels of iRNA agent duplex formation are maintained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments NRM modifications are introduced into the terminal cleavage site or in the cleavage region of a sequence (a sense strand or sequence) which does not target a desired sequence or gene in the subject. This can reduce off-target silencing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNuclease resistant modifications include some which can be placed only at the terminus and others which can go at any position. Generally, modifications that can inhibit hybridization are used only in terminal regions, and preferably not at the cleavage site or in the cleavage region of a sequence which targets a subject sequence or gene. They can be used anywhere in a sense sequence, provided that sufficient hybridization between the two sequences of the iRNA agent is maintained. In some embodiments it is desirable to put the NRM at the cleavage site or in the cleavage region of a sequence which does not target a subject sequence or gene, as it can minimize off-target silencing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn most cases, the nuclease-resistance promoting modifications will be distributed differently depending on whether the sequence will target a sequence in the subject (often referred to as an anti-sense sequence) or will not target a sequence in the subject (often referred to as a sense sequence). If a sequence is to target a sequence in the subject, modifications which interfere with or inhibit endonuclease cleavage should not be inserted in the region which is subject to RISC mediated cleavage, e.g., the cleavage site or the cleavage region (As described in Elbashir et al., 2001, Genes and Dev. 15: 188, hereby incorporated by reference). Cleavage of the target occurs about in the middle of a 20 or 21 nt guide RNA, or about 10 or 11 nucleotides upstream of the first nucleotide which is complementary to the guide sequence. As used herein cleavage site refers to the nucleotide on either side of the cleavage site, on the target or on the iRNA agent strand which hybridizes to it. Cleavage region means a nucleotide with 1, 2, or 3 nucleotides of the cleave site, in either direction.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch modifications can be introduced into the terminal regions, e.g., at the terminal position or with 2, 3, 4, or 5 positions of the terminus, of a sequence which targets or a sequence which does not target a sequence in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTethered Ligands\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe properties of an iRNA agent, including its pharmacological properties, can be influenced and tailored, for example, by the introduction of ligands, e.g. tethered ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of entities, e.g., ligands, can be tethered to an iRNA agent, e.g., to the carrier of a ligand-conjugated monomer subunit. Examples are described below in the context of a ligand-conjugated monomer subunit but that is only preferred, entities can be coupled at other points to an iRNA agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred moieties are ligands, which are coupled, preferably covalently, either directly or indirectly via an intervening tether, to the carrier. In preferred embodiments, the ligand is attached to the carrier via an intervening tether. The ligand or tethered ligand may be present on the ligand-conjugated monomer\\when the ligand-conjugated monomer is incorporated into the growing strand. In some embodiments, the ligand may be incorporated into a “precursor” ligand-conjugated monomer subunit after a “precursor” ligand-conjugated monomer subunit has been incorporated into the growing strand. For example, a monomer having, e.g., an amino-terminated tether, e.g., TAP-(CH\n2\n)\nn\nNH\n2 \nmay be incorporated into a growing sense or antisense strand. In a subsequent operation, i.e., after incorporation of the precursor monomer subunit into the strand, a ligand having an electrophilic group, e.g., a pentafluorophenyl ester or aldehyde group, can subsequently be attached to the precursor ligand-conjugated monomer by coupling the electrophilic group of the ligand with the terminal nucleophilic group of the precursor ligand-conjugated monomer subunit tether.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, a ligand alters the distribution, targeting or lifetime of an iRNA agent into which it is incorporated. In preferred embodiments a ligand provides an enhanced affinity for a selected target, e.g., molecule, cell or cell type, compartment, e.g., a cellular or organ compartment, tissue, organ or region of the body, as, e.g., compared to a species absent such a ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred ligands can improve transport, hybridization, and specificity properties and may also improve nuclease resistance of the resultant natural or modified oligoribonucleotide, or a polymeric molecule comprising any combination of monomers described herein and/or natural or modified ribonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigands in general can include therapeutic modifiers, e.g., for enhancing uptake; diagnostic compounds or reporter groups e.g., for monitoring distribution; cross-linking agents; nuclease-resistance conferring moieties; and natural or unusual nucleobases. General examples include lipophiles, lipids, steroids (e.g.,uvaol, hecigenin, diosgenin), terpenes (e.g., triterpenes, e.g., sarsasapogenin, Friedelin, epifriedelanol derivatized lithocholic acid), vitamins (e.g., folic acid, vitamin A, biotin, pyridoxal), carbohydrates, proteins, protein binding agents, integrin targeting molecules,polycationics, peptides, polyamines, and peptide mimics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigands can include a naturally occurring substance, (e.g., human serum albumin (HSA), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or globulin); carbohydrate (e.g., a dextran, pullulan, chitin, chitosan, inulin, cyclodextrin or hyaluronic acid); amino acid, or a lipid. The ligand may also be a recombinant or synthetic molecule, such as a synthetic polymer, e.g., a synthetic polyamino acid. Examples of polyamino acids include polyamino acid is a polylysine (PLL), poly L-aspartic acid, poly L-glutamic acid, styrene-maleic acid anhydride copolymer, poly(L-lactide-co-glycolied) copolymer, divinyl ether-maleic anhydride copolymer, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer (HMPA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyurethane, poly(2-ethylacryllic acid), N-isopropylacrylamide polymers, or polyphosphazine. Example of polyamines include: polyethylenimine, polylysine (PLL), spermine, spermidine, polyamine, pseudopeptide-polyamine, peptidomimetic polyamine, dendrimer polyamine, arginine, amidine, protamine, cationic moieties, e.g., cationic lipid, cationic porphyrin, quaternary salt of a polyamine, or an alpha helical peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigands can also include targeting groups, e.g., a cell or tissue targeting agent, e.g., a lectin, glycoprotein, lipid or protein, e.g., an antibody, that binds to a specified cell type such as a liver cell or a cell of the jejunum. A targeting group can be a thyrotropin, melanotropin, lectin, glycoprotein, surfactant protein A, Mucin carbohydrate, multivalent lactose, multivalent galactose, N-acetyl-galactosamine, N-acetyl-gulucosamine multivalent mannose, multivalent fucose, glycosylated polyaminoacids, multivalent galactose, transferrin, bisphosphonate, polyglutamate, polyaspartate, a lipid, cholesterol, a steroid, bile acid, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, or an RGD peptide or RGD peptide mimetic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigands can be proteins, e.g., glycoproteins, or peptides, e.g., molecules having a specific affinity for a co-ligand, or antibodies e.g., an antibody, that binds to a specified cell type such as a cancer cell, endothelial cell, or bone cell. Ligands may also include hormones and hormone receptors. They can also include non-peptidic species, such as lipids, lectins, carbohydrates, vitamins, cofactors, multivalent lactose, multivalent galactose, N-acetyl-galactosamine, N-acetyl-gulucosamine multivalent mannose, or multivalent fucose. The ligand can be, for example, a lipopolysaccharide, an activator of p38 MAP kinase, or an activator of NF-κB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligand can be a substance, e.g, a drug, which can increase the uptake of the iRNA agent into the cell, for example, by disrupting the cell's cytoskeleton, e.g., by disrupting the cell's microtubules, microfilaments, and/or intermediate filaments. The drug can be, for example, taxon, vincristine, vinblastine, cytochalasin, nocodazole, japlakinolide, latrunculin A, phalloidin, swinholide A, indanocine, or myoservin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the ligand is a lipid or lipid-based molecule. Such a lipid or lipid-based molecule preferably binds a serum protein, e.g., human serum albumin (HSA). An HSA binding ligand allows for distribution of the conjugate to a target tissue, e.g., liver tissue, including parenchymal cells of the liver. Other molecules that can bind HSA can also be used as ligands. For example, neproxin or aspirin can be used. A lipid or lipid-based ligand can (a) increase resistance to degradation of the conjugate, (b) increase targeting or transport into a target cell or cell membrane, and/or (c) can be used to adjust binding to a serum protein, e.g., HSA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA lipid based ligand can be used to modulate, e.g., control the binding of the conjugate to a target tissue. For example, a lipid or lipid-based ligand that binds to HSA more strongly will be less likely to be targeted to the kidney and therefore less likely to be cleared from the body. A lipid or lipid-based ligand that binds to HSA less strongly can be used to target the conjugate to the kidney.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the lipid based ligand binds HSA. Preferably, it binds HSA with a sufficient affinity such that the conjugate will be preferably distributed to a non-kidney tissue. However, it is preferred that the affinity not be so strong that the HSA-ligand binding cannot be reversed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the ligand is a moiety, e.g., a vitamin, which is taken up by a target cell, e.g., a proliferating cell. These are particularly useful for treating disorders characterized by unwanted cell proliferation, e.g., of the malignant or non-malignant type, e.g., cancer cells. Exemplary vitamins include vitamin A, E, and K. Other exemplary vitamins include are B vitamin, e.g., folic acid, B12, riboflavin, biotin, pyridoxal or other vitamins or nutrients taken up by cancer cells. Also included are HSA and low density lipoprotein (LDL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the ligand is a cell-permeation agent, preferably a helical cell-permeation agent. Preferably, the agent is amphipathic. An exemplary agent is a peptide such as tat or antennopedia. If the agent is a peptide, it can be modified, including a peptidylmimetic, invertomers, non-peptide or pseudo-peptide linkages, and use of D-amino acids. The helical agent is preferably an alpha-helical agent, which preferably has a lipophilic and a lipophobic phase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5′-Phosphate Modifications\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, iRNA agents are 5′ phosphorylated or include a phosphoryl analog at the 5′ prime terminus. 5′-phosphate modifications of the antisense strand include those which are compatible with RISC mediated gene silencing. Suitable modifications include: 5′-monophosphate ((HO)2(O)P—O-5′); 5′-diphosphate ((HO)2(O)P—O—P(HO)(O)—O-5′); 5′-triphosphate ((HO)2(O)P—O—(HO)(O)P—O—P(HO)(O)—O-5′); 5′-guanosine cap (7-methykated or non-methylated) (7m-G-O-5′-(HO)(O)P—O—(HO)(O)P—O—P(HO)(O)—O-5′); 5′-adenosine cap (Appp), and any modified or unmodified nucleotide cap structure (N—O-5′-(HO)(O)P—O—(HO)(O)P—O—P(HO)(O)—O-5′); 5′-monothiophosphate (phosphorothioate; (HO)2(S)P—O-5′); 5′-monodithiophosphate (phosphorodithioate; (HO)(HS)(S)P—O-5′), 5′-phosphorothiolate ((HO)2(O)P—S-5′); any additional combination of oxygen/sulfur replaced monophosphate, diphosphate and triphosphates (e.g. 5′-alpha-thiotriphosphate, 5′-gamma-thiotriphosphate, etc.), 5′-phosphoramidates ((HO)2(O)P—NH-5′, (HO)(NH2)(O)P—O-5′), 5′-alkylphosphonates (R=alkyl=methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, propyl, etc., e.g. RP(OH)(O)—O-5′-, (OH)2(O)P-5′-CH2-), 5′-alkyletherphosphonates (R=alkylether=methoxymethyl (MeOCH2-), ethoxymethyl, etc., e.g. RP(OH)(O)—O-5′-).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sense strand can be modified in order to inactivate the sense strand and prevent formation of an active RISC, thereby potentially reducing off-target effects. This can be accomplished by a modification which prevents 5′-phosphorylation of the sense strand, e.g., by modification with a 5′-O-methyl ribonucleotide (see Nykänen et al., (2001) ATP requirements and small interfering RNA structure in the RNA interference pathway. Cell 107, 309-321.) Other modifications which prevent phosphorylation can also be used, e.g., simply substituting the 5′-OH by H rather than O-Me. Alternatively, a large bulky group may be added to the 5′-phosphate turning it into a phosphodiester linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery of iRNA Agents to Tissues and Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe iRNA agents described herein can be formulated for administration to a subject, preferably for administration locally to the lungs and nasal passage (respiratory tissues) via inhalation or intranasally administration, or parenterally, e.g. via injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor ease of exposition, the formulations, compositions, and methods in this section are discussed largely with regard to unmodified iRNA agents. It should be understood, however, that these formulations, compositions, and methods can be practiced with other iRNA agents, e.g., modified iRNA agents, and such practice is within the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA formulated iRNA composition can assume a variety of states. In some examples, the composition is at least partially crystalline, uniformly crystalline, and/or anhydrous (e.g., less than 80, 50, 30, 20, or 10% water). In another example, the iRNA is in an aqueous phase, e.g., in a solution that includes water, this form being the preferred form for administration via inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aqueous phase or the crystalline compositions can be incorporated into a delivery vehicle, e.g., a liposome (particularly for the aqueous phase), or a particle (e.g., a microparticle as can be appropriate for a crystalline composition). Generally, the iRNA composition is formulated in a manner that is compatible with the intended method of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn iRNA preparation can be formulated in combination with another agent, e.g., another therapeutic agent or an agent that stabilizes an iRNA, e.g., a protein that complexes with iRNA to form an iRNP. Still other agents include chelators, e.g., EDTA (e.g., to remove divalent cations such as Mg\n21\n), salts, RNAse inhibitors (e.g., a broad specificity RNAse inhibitor such as RNAsin) and so forth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the iRNA preparation includes another iRNA agent, e.g., a second iRNA agent that can mediate RNAi with respect to a second gene. Still other preparations can include at least three, five, ten, twenty, fifty, or a hundred or more different iRNA species. In some embodiments, the agents are directed to the same virus but different target sequences. In another embodiment, each iRNA agents is directed to a different virus. As demonstrated in the Example, more than one virus can be inhibited by co-administering two iRNA agents simultaneously, or at closely time intervals, each one directed to one of the viruses being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment Methods and Routes of Delivery\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition that includes an iRNA agent of the present invention, e.g., an iRNA agent that targets RSV or PIV, can be delivered to a subject by a variety of routes. Exemplary routes include inhalation, intrathecal, parenchymal, intravenous, nasal, oral, and ocular delivery. The preferred means of administering the iRNA agents of the present invention is through direct administration to the lungs and nasal passage or systemically through parental administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn iRNA agent can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. For example, compositions can include one or more iRNA agents and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in a number of ways depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including ophthalmic, intranasal, transdermal, intrapulmonary), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous drip, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection, or intrathecal or intraventricular administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the delivery of the iRNA agents of the present invention is done to achieve delivery into the subject to the site of infection. The preferred means of achieving this is through either a local administration to the lungs or nasal passage, e.g. into the respiratory tissues via inhalation or intranasal administration, or via systemic administration, e.g. parental administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for inhalation or parenteral administration are well known in the art. Such formulation may include sterile aqueous solutions which may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives. For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled to render the preparation isotonic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compounds disclosed herein are preferably administered to the lung(s) or nasal passage of a subject by any suitable means. Active compounds may be administered by administering an aerosol suspension of respirable particles comprised of the active compound or active compounds, which the subject inhales. The active compound can be aerosolized in a variety of forms, such as, but not limited to, dry powder inhalants, metered dose inhalants, or liquid/liquid suspensions. The respirable particles may be liquid or solid. The particles may optionally contain other therapeutic ingredients such as amiloride, benzamil or phenamil, with the selected compound included in an amount effective to inhibit the reabsorption of water from airway mucous secretions, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,501,729.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particulate pharmaceutical composition may optionally be combined with a carrier to aid in dispersion or transport. A suitable carrier such as a sugar (i.e., lactose, sucrose, trehalose, mannitol) may be blended with the active compound or compounds in any suitable ratio (e.g., a 1 to 1 ratio by weight).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticles comprised of the active compound for practicing the present invention should include particles of respirable size, that is, particles of a size sufficiently small to pass through the mouth or nose and larynx upon inhalation and into the bronchi and alveoli of the lungs. In general, particles ranging from about 1 to 10 microns in size (more particularly, less than about 5 microns in size) are respirable. Particles of non-respirable size which are included in the aerosol tend to deposit in the throat and be swallowed, and the quantity of non-respirable particles in the aerosol is preferably minimized. For nasal administration, a particle size in the range of 10-500 uM is preferred to ensure retention in the nasal cavity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid pharmaceutical compositions of active compound for producing an aerosol may be prepared by combining the active compound with a suitable vehicle, such as sterile pyrogen free water. The hypertonic saline solutions used to carry out the present invention are preferably sterile, pyrogen-free solutions, comprising from one to fifteen percent (by weight) of the physiologically acceptable salt, and more preferably from three to seven percent by weight of the physiologically acceptable salt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAerosols of liquid particles comprising the active compound may be produced by any suitable means, such as with a pressure-driven jet nebulizer or an ultrasonic nebulizer. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,501,729. Nebulizers are commercially available devices which transform solutions or suspensions of the active ingredient into a therapeutic aerosol mist either by means of acceleration of compressed gas, typically air or oxygen, through a narrow venturi orifice or by means of ultrasonic agitation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable formulations for use in nebulizers consist of the active ingredient in a liquid carrier, the active ingredient comprising up to 40% w/w of the formulation, but preferably less than 20% w/w. The carrier is typically water (and most preferably sterile, pyrogen-free water) or a dilute aqueous alcoholic solution, preferably made isotonic, but may be hypertonic with body fluids by the addition of, for example, sodium chloride. Optional additives include preservatives if the formulation is not made sterile, for example, methyl hydroxybenzoate, antioxidants, flavoring agents, volatile oils, buffering agents and surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAerosols of solid particles comprising the active compound may likewise be produced with any solid particulate therapeutic aerosol generator. Aerosol generators for administering solid particulate therapeutics to a subject produce particles which are respirable and generate a volume of aerosol containing a predetermined metered dose of a therapeutic at a rate suitable for human administration. One illustrative type of solid particulate aerosol generator is an insufflator. Suitable formulations for administration by insufflation include finely comminuted powders which may be delivered by means of an insufflator or taken into the nasal cavity in the manner of a snuff. In the insufflator, the powder (e.g., a metered dose thereof effective to carry out the treatments described herein) is contained in capsules or cartridges, typically made of gelatin or plastic, which are either pierced or opened in situ and the powder delivered by air drawn through the device upon inhalation or by means of a manually-operated pump. The powder employed in the insufflator consists either solely of the active ingredient or of a powder blend comprising the active ingredient, a suitable powder diluent, such as lactose, and an optional surfactant. The active ingredient typically comprises from 0.1 to 100 w/w of the formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA second type of illustrative aerosol generator comprises a metered dose inhaler. Metered dose inhalers are pressurized aerosol dispensers, typically containing a suspension or solution formulation of the active ingredient in a liquefied propellant. During use these devices discharge the formulation through a valve adapted to deliver a metered volume, typically from 10 to 200 ul, to produce a fine particle spray containing the active ingredient. Suitable propellants include certain chlorofluorocarbon compounds, for example, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane and mixtures thereof. The formulation may additionally contain one or more co-solvents, for example, ethanol, surfactants, such as oleic acid or sorbitan trioleate, antioxidant and suitable flavoring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration can be provided by the subject or by another person, e.g., a caregiver. A caregiver can be any entity involved with providing care to the human: for example, a hospital, hospice, doctor's office, outpatient clinic; a healthcare worker such as a doctor, nurse, or other practitioner; or a spouse or guardian, such as a parent. The medication can be provided in measured doses or in a dispenser which delivers a metered dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “therapeutically effective amount” is the amount present in the composition that is needed to provide the desired level of drug in the subject to be treated to give the anticipated physiological response. In one embodiment, therapeutically effective amounts of two or more iRNA agents, each one directed to a different respiratory virus, e.g. RSV and PIV, are administered concurrently to a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “physiologically effective amount” is that amount delivered to a subject to give the desired palliative or curative effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” means that the carrier can be taken into the lungs with no significant adverse toxicological effects on the lungs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe types of pharmaceutical excipients that are useful as carrier include stabilizers such as human serum albumin (HSA), bulking agents such as carbohydrates, amino acids and polypeptides; pH adjusters or buffers; salts such as sodium chloride; and the like. These carriers may be in a crystalline or amorphous form or may be a mixture of the two.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBulking agents that are particularly valuable include compatible carbohydrates, polypeptides, amino acids or combinations thereof. Suitable carbohydrates include monosaccharides such as galactose, D-mannose, sorbose, and the like; disaccharides, such as lactose, trehalose, and the like; cyclodextrins, such as 2-hydroxypropyl-.beta.-cyclodextrin; and polysaccharides, such as raffinose, maltodextrins, dextrans, and the like; alditols, such as mannitol, xylitol, and the like. A preferred group of carbohydrates includes lactose, threhalose, raffinose maltodextrins, and mannitol. Suitable polypeptides include aspartame. Amino acids include alanine and glycine, with glycine being preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pH adjusters or buffers include organic salts prepared from organic acids and bases, such as sodium citrate, sodium ascorbate, and the like; sodium citrate is preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage. An iRNA agent can be administered at a unit dose less than about 75 mg per kg of bodyweight, or less than about 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, or 0.0005 mg per kg of bodyweight, and less than 200 nmole of RNA agent (e.g., about 4.4×1016 copies) per kg of bodyweight, or less than 1500, 750, 300, 150, 75, 15, 7.5, 1.5, 0.75, 0.15, 0.075, 0.015, 0.0075, 0.0015, 0.00075, 0.00015 nmole of RNA agent per kg of bodyweight. The unit dose, for example, can be administered by injection (e.g., intravenous or intramuscular, intrathecally, or directly into an organ), an inhaled dose, or a topical application.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery of an iRNA agent directly to an organ (e.g., directly to the liver) can be at a dosage on the order of about 0.00001 mg to about 3 mg per organ, or preferably about 0.0001-0.001 mg per organ, about 0.03-3.0 mg per organ, about 0.1-3.0 mg per eye or about 0.3-3.0 mg per organ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage can be an amount effective to treat or prevent a disease or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the unit dose is administered less frequently than once a day, e.g., less than every 2, 4, 8 or 30 days. In another embodiment, the unit dose is not administered with a frequency (e.g., not a regular frequency). For example, the unit dose may be administered a single time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the effective dose is administered with other traditional therapeutic modalities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a subject is administered an initial dose, and one or more maintenance doses of an iRNA agent, e.g., a double-stranded iRNA agent, or siRNA agent, (e.g., a precursor, e.g., a larger iRNA agent which can be processed into an siRNA agent, or a DNA which encodes an iRNA agent, e.g., a double-stranded iRNA agent, or siRNA agent, or precursor thereof). The maintenance dose or doses are generally lower than the initial dose, e.g., one-half less of the initial dose. A maintenance regimen can include treating the subject with a dose or doses ranging from 0.01 μg to 75 mg/kg of body weight per day, e.g., 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, or 0.0005 mg per kg of bodyweight per day. The maintenance doses are preferably administered no more than once every 5, 10, or 30 days. Further, the treatment regimen may last for a period of time which will vary depending upon the nature of the particular disease, its severity and the overall condition of the patient. In preferred embodiments the dosage may be delivered no more than once per day, e.g., no more than once per 24, 36, 48, or more hours, e.g., no more than once every 5 or 8 days. Following treatment, the patient can be monitored for changes in his condition and for alleviation of the symptoms of the disease state. The dosage of the compound may either be increased in the event the patient does not respond significantly to current dosage levels, or the dose may be decreased if an alleviation of the symptoms of the disease state is observed, if the disease state has been ablated, or if undesired side-effects are observed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective dose can be administered in a single dose or in two or more doses, as desired or considered appropriate under the specific circumstances. If desired to facilitate repeated or frequent infusions, implantation of a delivery device, e.g., a pump, semi-permanent stent (e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracisternal or intracapsular), or reservoir may be advisable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the iRNA agent pharmaceutical composition includes a plurality of iRNA agent species. The iRNA agent species can have sequences that are non-overlapping and non-adjacent with respect to a naturally occurring target sequence, e.g., a target sequence of the RSV gene. In another embodiment, the plurality of iRNA agent species is specific for different naturally occurring target genes. For example, an iRNA agent that targets the P protein gene of RSV can be present in the same pharmaceutical composition as an iRNA agent that targets a different gene, for example the N protein gene. In another embodiment, the iRNA agents are specific for different viruses, e.g. RSV and PIV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing successful treatment, it may be desirable to have the patient undergo maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the disease state, wherein the compound of the invention is administered in maintenance doses, ranging from 0.01 μg to 100 g per kg of body weight (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,107,094).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concentration of the iRNA agent composition is an amount sufficient to be effective in treating or preventing a disorder or to regulate a physiological condition in humans. The concentration or amount of iRNA agent administered will depend on the parameters determined for the agent and the method of administration, e.g. nasal, buccal, or pulmonary. For example, nasal formulations tend to require much lower concentrations of some ingredients in order to avoid irritation or burning of the nasal passages. It is sometimes desirable to dilute an oral formulation up to 10-100 times in order to provide a suitable nasal formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain factors may influence the dosage required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of an iRNA agent, e.g., a double-stranded iRNA agent, or siRNA agent (e.g., a precursor, e.g., a larger iRNA agent which can be processed into an siRNA agent, or a DNA which encodes an iRNA agent, e.g., a double-stranded iRNA agent, or siRNA agent, or precursor thereof) can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of an iRNA agent such as an siRNA agent used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment. Changes in dosage may result and become apparent from the results of diagnostic assays as described herein. For example, the subject can be monitored after administering an iRNA agent composition. Based on information from the monitoring, an additional amount of the iRNA agent composition can be administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the disease condition to be treated, with the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient. Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies and repetition rates. Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of individual compounds, and can generally be estimated based on EC50s found to be effective in in vitro and in vivo animal models. In some embodiments, the animal models include transgenic animals that express a human gene, e.g., a gene that produces a target RSV RNA. The transgenic animal can be deficient for the corresponding endogenous RNA. In another embodiment, the composition for testing includes an iRNA agent that is complementary, at least in an internal region, to a sequence that is conserved between the target RSV RNA in the animal model and the target RSV RNA in a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which should not be construed as further limiting.\n\n\n \nExamples \n\n\n \n \n \nDesigning Antiviral siRNAs Against RSV and HPIV3 Phosphoprotein mRNA\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA against RSV P and siRNAs against HPIV3 P mRNA were synthesized chemically (Bitko, V. & Barik, S. \nBMC Microbiol. \n1, 34 (2001)) and their IC50 (concentration of siRNA producing 50% reduction of target) ex vivo was determined (\nFIG. 1\n \na\n). The siRNA sequences and IC50 values are listed (Table 1). Two siRNAs against RSV-P (#1, #2) and one against HPIV3 (#4) showed appreciable inhibitory activities, and were selected for further study. The correlation of target mRNA with protein, as exemplified for siRNA #1 (\nFIG. 1\n \na\n), agreed with an RNAi mechanism, and as we shown below, the knockdown activity of a siRNA ex vivo also matched with its activity in the animal (in vivo). Thus, the ex vivo assay provides a reliable, inexpensive, quick and convenient initial screening for an antiviral siRNA drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntranasal (IN) siRNAs Inhibit RSV and HPIV3 Replication in Mouse Lung\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine if the siRNAs that are active ex vivo would be effective during an actual infection, an animal model was used. The BALB/c mouse is a well-established laboratory model for RSV infection to study the progression, pathology, and immunology of the disease (Graham, B. S., et al., \nJ. Med. Virol. \n26, 153-162 (1988), van Schaik, S. M., et al., \nJ. Infect. Dis. \n177, 269-276 (1998), Haeberle, H. A. et al. \nJ. Virol. \n75, 878-890 (2001)). Mice were treated with siRNA complexed with TranslT-TKO® reagent intranasally, and 4 hr later challenged each animal with 10\n7 \npfu of RSV or HPIV3, also intranasally. Maximal RSV growth in murine lung could be observed around 5-6 days p.i and this time point was used in further studies. siRNAs that were effective ex vivo (\nFIG. 1\n \na\n) were highly antiviral in the animal (\nFIGS. 1\n \nb,c\n). At a dose of 5 nmole IN siRNA (averaging ˜70 ug for double-stranded siRNAs) per mouse, \nsiRNA #\n1 and \nsiRNA #\n4 respectively reduced pulmonary RSV and HPIV3 titer by about 5,000- and 100-fold in individual infections (\nFIGS. 1\n \nb,c\n). Importantly, siRNAs, free of transfection reagents, also significantly inhibited pulmonary viral titers (\nFIG. 1\n \nd\n). This demonstrates that inhalation based anti-viral therapy is possible with simple pharmaceutical compositions comprising an iRNA agent. It is to be noted that HPIV3 does not infect the mouse as readily as RSV (Durbin, A. P., Elkins, W. R. & Murphy, B. R. \nVaccine \n18, 2462-2469 (2000)), which is the reason for the relatively lower HPIV3 replication in the mouse lung (\nFIG. 1\n \nc\n). Use of sucrose-purified high-titer HPIV3 as inoculum enabled the model to achieve measurable infections in the mouse lung.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral additional features of the Example are applicable to various embodiments of the present invention. First, the results demonstrate the virus-specific effect of the siRNAs (\nFIG. 1\n). Even the most potent anti-RSV siRNA (#1) only inhibited RSV but not HPIV3, and vice versa, which alone argues against a nonspecific antiviral effect of the IN siRNA. Second, anti-luciferase siRNA (Elbashir, S. M. et al. \nNature \n411, 494-498 (2001)), even at the highest dose tested (50 nmole or 700 μg/mouse) did not inhibit either virus (\nFIGS. 1\n \nb\n-\nd\n). Finally, IN siRNAs with or without the Transit-TKO reagent in uninfected mice caused no obvious discomfort (as judged by normal coat, activity, appetite and weight gain, and lack of any respiratory distress), suggesting a favorable pharmacology for potential drug development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be noted that in all experiments described herein, the results of viral protein immunoblot always matched with viral titer, and therefore, for a given experiment each can serve as a redundant marker of the other and all complementary data is not presented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific Antiviral Effects of IN siRNA Prevent Lung Infection\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the results presented above documented inhibition of viral replication, they did not directly prove abrogation of infection of the lung tissue. We, therefore, probed various sections of both lungs at 5 days p.i. using antibodies specific for the appropriate virus. With 10\n7 \npfu instilled per mouse, both viruses produced robust pulmonary infection. In representative results (\nFIG. 2\n \na\n), infection was strongly abolished in mice pre-treated with 5 nmole (70 ug) of \nanti-RSV siRNA #\n1 complexed with TranslT-TKO. Similar reduction of HPIV3 infection was also seen with 5 nmole \nanti-HPIV3 siRNA #\n4. As with viral titer, siRNA without transfection reagent showed significant reduction of infection, as represented for RSV. For the same amount of siRNA, we estimate that the reagent-free siRNA was roughly 70-80% as effective as siRNA complexed with TranslT-TKO. Although we have only presented data for TranslT-TKO-complexed siRNA in the rest the paper, these results point to the exciting prospect that IN delivery of pure naked siRNA, free of other chemicals, may offer substantial protection against respiratory pathogens. This is particularly important as transfection reagents themselves may have side-effects. We note here that polyethyleneimine (PEI) has been successfully used as a carrier for intravenous (IV) as well as intratracheal (IT) delivery of siRNA and DNA against influenza virus (Ge, Q., et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n101, 8676-8681 (2004)). However, in our experience, direct IN administration of PEI, with or without siRNA, often resulted in overt sickness and/or death of the mouse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIN siRNAs Locate to the Lung and Do Not Activate Interferon\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo provide further evidence that the viral inhibition observed in the lung was a direct and specific effect of the nasally applied siRNA, two kinds of experiments were performed. First, we were able to detect the antisense strand of the siRNA in the lung tissue (\nFIG. 2\n \nb\n) by specific Northern analyses. Second, the possibility that the antiviral effect of siRNAs was due to activation of interferons (IFNs) was ruled out by the following. Paramyxoviruses in general encode diverse mechanisms to counteract IFNs; RSV, in particular, is largely resistant to type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) although sensitive to type II IFN (IFN-γ) (Schlender, J., et al., \nJ. Virol. \n74, 8234-8242 (2000), Ramaswamy, M., et al., \nAm. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. \n30, 893-900 (2004)). Our early studies showed that the siRNAs were active against RSV and HPIV3 in Vero cells that contain deletions of type I IFN genes (data not shown). Nonetheless, we measured the levels of IFN-α and IFN-γ in murine lung tissues at different days following treatment with various siRNAs, and found no activation of either type of IFN (\nFIG. 2\n \nc\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNAs Competitively Protect Against RSV and HPIV3 in Mixed Infection\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCo-infection of the respiratory tract by multiple agents is always a possibility, and in some studies joint infection by RSV and HPIV3 has been diagnosed (Coiras, M. T., et al, \nJ. Med. Virol. \n72, 484-495 (2004)). In fact, chimeric viruses and recombinant vaccines incorporating RSV as well HPIV3 antigens have been constructed with the hope that they would offer simultaneous protection against both viruses (Schmidt, A. C., et al., \nJ. Virol. \n75, 4594-4603 (2001), Bernhard, W. et al. \nAm. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. \n25, 725-731 (2001)). The specific antiviral effect of \nsiRNA #\n1 and \nsiRNA #\n4 against RSV and HPIV3, respectively, prompted us to test them together (5 nmole or 70 ug of each) in mixed infection of the mice by both viruses. Control mice were treated with a single kind of siRNA (either #1 or #4). As there is no easy way to determine the pfu of each virus in a mixture of the two, we resorted to immunofluorescence microscopy as described above, and subjected the lung tissue sections to dual staining using a mixture of anti-RSV and anti-HPIV3 antibodies. Mixed infection of the lung tissue was indeed achieved by this criterion (\nFIG. 2\n \nd\n). In mice pre-treated with either \nsiRNA #\n1 or \nsiRNA #\n4, RSV and HPIV3 infection respectively was prevented, as seen by the loss of either green or red fluorescence, but not both (\nFIG. 2\n \nd\n). Using a combination of the two siRNAs (5 nmole, i.e., 70 ug of each) both types of fluorescence disappeared, documenting the inhibition of both viruses (\nFIG. 2\n \nd\n). As before, the same siRNA mix without any transfection reagent was also highly active (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterestingly, when excessively high amounts of one siRNA were used, the activity of the other siRNA was inhibited in a dual infection assay (\nFIG. 3\n). By quantitative real-time RT-PCR, the IC50 of siRNA #4 (against HPIV3 P) ex vivo increased through 15, 35 and 100 nM as the concentration of siRNA #1 (against RSVP) was raised from 0 to 20 to 200 nM (\nFIG. 3\n \na\n). These results were validated by measurement of HPIV3 P protein in immunoblot (\nFIG. 3\n \nb\n). In dual infection of mice, immunoblot quantitation of N protein of each virus produced an essentially identical conclusion: whereas 5 nmole (70 ug) of each siRNA effectively inhibited both viruses, 50 nmole of one siRNA reduced the effect of 5 nmole of the other in a mutual manner (\nFIG. 3\n \nc\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIN siRNAs Prevent Pulmonary Pathology\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the siRNAs prevented infection a logical query was whether they prevented the development of pathological features as well. Upon visual inspection the siRNA-treated RSV-exposed mice acted and appeared essentially like uninfected mice with normal activity, shiny coat and general well-being. We then measured the respiratory rate, induction of leukotriene, and pulmonary inflammation. Respiratory rate of BALB/c mice is known to increase in response to RSV infection (Haeberle, H. A. et al. \nJ. Virol. \n75, 878-890 (2001), Volovitz, B., et al., \nPediatr. Res. \n24, 504-507 (1988)). Leukotrienes, a product of the lipoxygenase pathway, bind to the leukotriene receptors present in bronchial smooth muscle and are elevated in the respiratory secretions of asthmatic patients, human infants with RSV infection, and mice infected with RSV (Volovitz, B., et al., \nPediatr. Res. \n24, 504-507 (1988), Welliver, R. C., 2nd, et al., \nJ. Infect. Dis. \n187, 1773-1779 (2003)). These compounds provoke airway mucus secretion, bronchoconstriction and airway infiltration by inflammatory cells, which are important hallmarks of severe RSV disease. When we administered \nanti-RSV siRNA #\n1 at the same time as (or prior to) RSV, a significant reduction in respiratory rate, pulmonary histopathology and leukotriene accumulation in bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) was observed (\nFIG. 4\n). These values remained near baseline and were essentially comparable to those in sham-infected mice. All parameters remained low at least 14 days post-infection, demonstrating that the siRNA truly prevented illness and not just postponed it. In fact, siRNA-treated mice showed no visible signs of respiratory distress up to 6 weeks of observation. Negative control RNA or luc-siRNA (Table 1) offered no relief in all experiments (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIN siRNAs are Effective Antivirals Post-Infection\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHaving shown that siRNAs can prevent respiratory viral disease if administered prior to infection, we asked the question whether they may have a curative effect once infection has established, as this is an important goal in pediatric medicine. In this series of experiments, we administered \nsiRNA #\n1 at various days after RSV infection and the mice were weighed daily. Mice are known to lose weight up to about 8-10 days following RSV infection, after which they either die or slowly regain weight depending on whether the starting inoculum is too high or moderate-to-low (Haeberle, H. A. et al. \nJ. Virol. \n75, 878-890 (2001)). In a similar cohort of mice, the lungs were sampled on pre-determined days to assay for infectious virus. As expected, the siRNA-untreated mice maintained their body weight for about 4 days p.i., followed by a gradual loss that continued at least up to 9 days (\nFIG. 5\n \na\n). Mice treated with siRNA prior to (data not shown) or at the same time as RSV (Day 0) essentially appeared uninfected and continued to gain weight without interruption. Most mice receiving siRNA on \nDay\n 1 were also quite hard to distinguish from the sham-infected controls. Those receiving siRNA at subsequent days (Day 1-4) showed gradually less and less protection, although significant improvement of weight was observed at all days for all treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar picture emerged when pulmonary RSV titer was determined in these mice on \n \n \n \n \nDay\n \n \n \n \n 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 16 (\nFIG. 5\n \nb\n). In the siRNA-untreated mice, the titer rose till Day 4-5, and then slowly dropped to undetectable levels by \nDay\n 16. siRNA treatment before or concomitant to RSV infection held the titer 5,000-fold down at all days tested. Administration of siRNA at later times in infection was progressively less effective, but the viral titer was always lower than the untreated controls on any day tested. It appeared that the siRNA, no matter when it was administered, slowed down the rate of virus replication, resulting in a lower peak titer. Subsequently, the titer fell below detectable levels at earlier and earlier times the sooner the siRNA was administered. For example, whereas in the untreated infected mice pulmonary RSV could be detected up to about 16 days p.i., it could not be detected in the \nDay\n 1 siRNA-treated mice after 10 days p.i. As before, negative control siRNA or luciferase siRNA (Table 1) had no effect in all experiments (data not shown). Together, these results showed that the RSV P siRNA had a curative effect even when administered post-infection and that the mice were always less sick and recovered quicker than their untreated cohorts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiscussion\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe principal finding of this paper is that appropriately designed siRNAs, applied intranasally, offer protection from respiratory infection as well as provide significant therapy when applied post-infection. siRNAs, delivered by small particle aerosols in a simple hand-held inhaler, can be used to prevent or treat pulmonary infections. While our manuscript was in preparation, two reports appeared in which siRNAs inhibited influenza virus, another major respiratory pathogen, in a murine model (Ge, Q., et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n101, 8676-8681 (2004), Tompkins, S. M., et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n101, 8682-8686 (2004)). In one study (Ge, Q., et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n101, 8676-8681 (2004)), synthetic siRNA or plasmid DNA expressing siRNA was administered via a combination of IV and IT routes. In the other study (Tompkins, S. M., et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n101, 8682-8686 (2004)), siRNA was first delivered by hydrodynamic IV delivery; 16-24 hr later mice were infected with influenza virus and given a second dose of siRNA in a lipid carrier, both via IN route. Presence of pulmonary virus was tested 2 days later and a 10-50 fold inhibition was observed with different strains of influenza virus. Our studies against RSV and PIV offer the following improvement and simplification over the previous ones: (i) The delivery is solely intranasal and therefore, relatively noninvasive and painless, making it amenable to an inhaler or mist-based therapy. (ii) siRNA without any carrier is significantly effective, thus reducing the potential risk of side effects of the carrier. (iii) A single dose of about 5 nanomole siRNA (70 ug of double-stranded RNA) appears to provide benefit over the full duration of infection. A more comprehensive screening of the target sequence (e.g., RSV P) and use of newer chemistry may lead to siRNAs with significantly lower IC50 and better pharmacokinetics, resulting in a lower dosage. siRNAs exhibit various degrees of non-specific, off-target effects, especially at high concentrations (Jackson, A. L. et al. \nNat. Biotechnol. \n21, 635-637 (2003), Sledz, C. A., et al., \nNat. Cell Biol. \n5, 834-839 (2003), Persengiev, S. P., et al., \n \nRNA\n \n10, 12-18 (2004), Bridge, A. J., et al., \nNat. Genet. \n34, 263-264 (2003)). This is an obvious concern in therapy, and IV administration of siRNA may result in systemic side-effects. In contrast, the intranasally delivered siRNA is more likely to be concentrated—if not exclusively localized—in the respiratory tissues, thus minimizing the side effects. Lack of IFN activation by intranasally delivered synthetic siRNA supports and extends previous finding that chemically synthesized siRNAs, devoid of 5′ phosphates, do not activate the IFN pathway in cell culture (Kim, D. H. et al. \nNat. Biotechnol. \n22, 321-325 (2004)). Together, correlation of antiviral activity with specific mRNA knockdown (\nFIG. 1\n), detection of the siRNA in the target tissue (lung) (\nFIG. 2\n \nb\n), lack of IFN activation (\nFIG. 2\n \nc\n), and virus-specific effect of the siRNAs (FIGS. \n1\n-\n3\n)—all provide evidence that the antiviral effect is specific, directed and is RNAi-mediated. (iii) Respiratory viruses, such as RSV and PIV, exhibit high selectivity in tissue tropism in infecting the respiratory tissues. Thus, IN delivery ensures that the siRNA is targeted to the site of infection—an ideal condition for pharmacology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough RSV and HPIV sometimes co-infect, their interactions have remained largely ignored. The exact reason behind the observed inhibition of one siRNA by another needs further study. The fact that it also happens ex vivo (cell culture) argues against, although does not rule out, humoral factors and cytokines in the animal, such as interferon. RSV actually inhibits interferon activation (Schlender, J., et al., \nJ. Virol. \n74, 8234-8242 (2000), Ramaswamy, M., et al., \nAm. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. \n30, 893-900 (2004)), and thus, should facilitate rather than inhibit PIV growth. Another possibility is that growth of one virus inhibits the other through other mechanisms, such as competition for intracellular resources. On the other hand, it is known that the RNAi machinery in a cell is saturable and thus two siRNAs could potentially compete for a fixed pool of this machinery (Batik, S. \nVirus Res. \n102, 27-35 (2004), (Hutvagner, G., et al., \nPLoS Biol. \n2, E98 (2004)). It is to be noted that such competition was only appreciable at relatively high doses of the siRNAs, i.e., with tens or hundreds of nanomoles (\nFIG. 3\n). In contrast, only a few nanomoles of our siRNAs offered nearly complete protection in mice. Thus, the observed competition is not a matter of practical concern with siRNAs of IC50 in the low nanomolar range.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen used as a prophylactic, the siRNA not only prevented the infection but also inhibited the appearance of various aspects of the disease process as measured by body weight, pulmonary pathology, respiratory parameters and allergy markers (\nFIG. 4\n). The kinetics of the disease process in mice and men are relatively similar and in both species immunopathological changes occur rapidly following RSV infection. When used as a treatment drug after infection ensued, the siRNAs are not expected to correct the pathology that has already occurred. Even then, however, inhibition of further growth of the virus resulted in a quicker cure and recovery (\nFIG. 5\n). Thus, it seems that the “window of opportunity” of treatment exists at all times in the RSV-infected patient although, as in any disease, earlier treatments should produce better prognosis. The effectiveness of the naked siRNA remains to be explained. It is possible that the respiratory tissue, especially the lung, is naturally more receptive to the exchange of small molecules, or perhaps becomes so when infected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLastly, depending on the stringency of siRNA-target pairing, exposure to siRNA may cause selection of siRNA-resistant viruses, and this has been demonstrated in HIV (Das, A. T. et al. \nJ. Virol. \n78, 2601-2605 (2004)). We have not faced this problem so far with the siRNAs tested here. The viruses that could be recovered from the siRNA-treated murine lung were grown in A549 cell culture and found to exhibit the same IC50 for the siRNA as the original inoculum (data not shown). Moreover, sequencing of the siRNA region of the P gene in six such independent plaque-purified RSV isolates revealed the wild type parental sequence (data not shown). Even if occasional resistance is encountered in the future, a second siRNA with a low IC50 and targeting a different region of the P mRNA or a different viral mRNA can be used in a multidrug regimen, thereby reducing the odds of viral resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVirus, siRNA and other reagents. RSV Long strain and human PIV type 3 (HPIV3) JS strain were grown on HEp-2 monolayers as described for RSV (Burke, E., et al., \nVirology \n252, 137-148 (1998), Burke, E., et al., \nJ. Virol. \n74, 669-675 (2000), Gupta, S., et al., \nJ. Virol. \n72, 2655-2662 (1998)). The extracellular media containing liberated progeny virus was collected at about 70 h for RSV and 50 h for HPIV3. The viruses were purified and concentrated by precipitation with polyethylene glycol (MW 8,000) and sucrose gradient centrifugation essentially as described for RSV (Ueba, \nO. Acta. Med. Okayama \n32, 265-272 (1978)). The final preparations had infectious titers in the range of 10\n8\n-10\n9 \npfu/ml and were stored frozen at −80° C. in small portions. All infectious viral titers (pfu) were determined by agarose plaque assay on HEp-2 monolayers with neutral red staining (Burke, E., et al., \nVirology \n252, 137-148 (1998), Burke, E., et al., \nJ. Virol. \n74, 669-675 (2000), Gupta, S., et al., \nJ. Virol. \n72, 2655-2662 (1998)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon and processed as recommended by the manufacturer (Bitko, V. & Barik, S. \nBMC Microbiol. \n1, 34 (2001). The TranslT-TKO® reagent was from Mims Bio Corp (Madison, Wis.). RSV-P antibody, raised in rabbit, was used in all immunohistological staining (Bitko, V. & Barik, S. \nBMC Microbiol. \n1, 34 (2001). Polyclonal RSV and HPIV3 antibodies were raised against purified virions in goat and purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, Calif.) and BiosPacific (Emeryville, Calif.), respectively; the nucleocapsid protein (N) is the major viral band detected by these antibodies in immunoblot. Profilin antibody has been described (Burke, E., et al., \nJ. Virol. \n74, 669-675 (2000), Gupta, S., et al., \nJ. Virol. \n72, 2655-2662 (1998)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVirus infection and siRNA treatment. Infection and siRNA treatment of A549 cells grown in monolayers were carried out as described (Bitko, V. & Barik, S. \nBMC Microbiol. \n1, 34 (2001)). Intranasal application of RSV in mice is an established procedure and causes bronchiolitis. Pathogen-free 8-10 week old female BALB/c mice, weighing between 16 and 20 g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Anesthesia for infection or siRNA administration was achieved with intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 ml of nembutal (5 mg/ml). Euthanasia was carried out by cervical dislocation following anesthesia with 0.3 ml nembutal. The siRNA was appropriately diluted in the dilution buffer provided by the manufacturer so that the desired amount is contained in 1 ul. This was mixed with 5 ul of the TranslT-TKO® reagent and 35 ul of Opti-MEM (Gibco Life Technologies, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) immediately before experiment to produce a total volume of 41 ul. When siRNA was used without carrier, the 5 ul transfection reagent was substituted with 5 ul of Opti-MEM. The sucrose-purified virus was appropriately diluted in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) immediately prior to infection such that 10\n7 \npfu virus was contained in 30 μl. Sham infection was performed with the same volume of virus-free PBS. Both the siRNA mix and the virus were equally divided into the two nostrils and applied with a micropipette (i.e., each nostril received 35 ug siRNA in 20.5 ul and 0.5×10\n7 \npfu virus in 15 ul). No special equipment was needed as the mice inhaled all fluid through natural breathing. For dual infection, RSV and HPIV3 stocks were diluted such that each mouse was given a mixture of 10\n7 \npfu of each virus and a mixture of 5 nmole (70 ug) each of \nsiRNA #\n1 and \nsiRNA #\n4 in the same volumes as before. Animal experiments obeyed all prescribed guidelines and were approved by the IACUC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPulmonary viral assay and clinical measurements. The animals were checked daily and weighed. Standard RSV symptoms were noted, including nasal mucus, increased respiratory rate due to congestion and bronchiolitis, a dull coat, ruffled fur and/or loss of fur, and a general lethargy and malaise. Respiratory rates (breaths per min) were determined by video recording (Volovitz, B., et al., \nPediatr. Res. \n24, 504-507 (1988)). Sneezing, sniffing and sighing were excluded from counting. At various days post-infection (p.i.), lungs were removed for RSV detection by infectious virus assay, immunoblot analysis, or immunostaining, as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine viral titer, the lung was homogenized in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS (2 ml DMEM per 100 mg tissue) in cold. The extract was centrifuged at 2,000×g for 10 min, and serial dilutions of the supernatant were assayed for pfu. For immunoblot of viral proteins (Burke, E., et al., \nVirology \n252, 137-148 (1998)), 10 ul of the homogenized sample (before centrifugation) was added to 10 ul of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, the mixture heated at 98° C. for 5 min, clarified by centrifugation in a microfuge at room temperature, and 10 ul of the clear supernatant analyzed by immunoblot using goat anti-RSV and anti-HPIV3 antibodies. To measure IFN (Durbin, J. E. et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n168, 2944-2952 (2002)), the lungs were homogenized in PBS, processed as above, and serial dilutions were assayed by ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) having detection limits of 10 pg/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor pulmonary histopathology, lungs were perfused and fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Multiple, 4 μm thick sections were stained with haematoxylin & eosin and scored for cellular inflammation under light microscopy by two independent researchers. Inflammatory infiltrates were scored by enumerating the layers of inflammatory cells surrounding the vessels and bronchioles. Zero to three layers of inflammatory cells were considered normal, whereas more than three layers of inflammatory cells surrounding 50% or more of the circumference of the vessel or bronchioles were considered abnormal. The number of abnormal perivascular and peribronchial spaces divided by total such spaces was the percentage reported as the pathology score. A total of about 20 spaces per lung were counted for each animal. With 10\n7 \nRSV (and no siRNA) (Haeberle, H. A. et al. \nJ. Virol. \n75, 878-890 (2001)), about 30-35% of perivascular and peribronchial spaces could be found abnormal as early as \nDay\n 1 and peaked at around \nDay\n 5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor immunohistology (Haeberle, H. A. et al. \nJ. Virol. \n75, 878-890 (2001)), the lung tissue was embedded in 100% OCT compound, and frozen at −80° C. Sections were cut onto slides, air-dried, fixed in acetone, were washed in PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked for 20 min with 10% goat serum in PBS at room temperature. After multiple washes in PBS the tissue was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either anti-RSV-P or anti-HPIV3 antibody diluted in PBS containing 1.5% goat serum. The slides were again washed multiple times in PBS, and the two antibodies were detected with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit and TRITC-conjugated anti-goat immunoglobulin G antibody. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, the slides were given a final wash in PBS, mounted with the DABCO-DAPI mounting media and viewed by fluorescence microscopy (Bitko, V. & Barik, S. \nBMC Microbiol. \n1, 34 (2001)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), was collected by perfusing the bronchi and the lungs with 5×1.0 ml normal saline (containing 10 ug indomethacin per ml) (Bernhard, W. et al. \nAm. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. \n25, 725-731 (2001)); total recovery of BALF per mouse was 4.2-4.4 ml. Samples containing visible signs of blood contamination were discarded. Cells were removed from BALF by centrifugation at 5,000×g for 15 min at 4° C., and samples stored at −80° C. until further analyses. The concentration of cysteinyl leukotrienes conjugates in the BALF was determined by an ELISA kit following the manufacturer's protocol (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.). According to the product insert, the cross-reactivity of the kit to the various leukotrienes was: \nLTC4\n 100%, LTD4 115%, LTE4 63% and LTB4 1.2%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor Real Time PCR experiments, RNA was isolated from HPIV3-infected cells and the first-strand cDNA made using the GeneAmp RNA PCR Core kit (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). Primers are designed by the Beacon Designer software v 2.13 from Premier Biosoft. The following primers were used to amplify HPIV3 P mRNA: 5′-GGTCATCACACGAATGTACAAC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 1) and 5′-CTTGGAACATCTGCAGATTGTC-3′ (SEQ ID NO:2). Real-time PCR was performed on the iCycler iQ Quantitative PCR system from BioRad Laboratories (Hercules, Calif.) using the iQ Sybr Green SuperMix. Gene expression measurements were calculated using the manufacturer's software and GAPDH as the internal control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antisense strand of siRNA in the lung was extracted and detected by Northern hybridization essentially as described (Reinhart, B. J., et al., \nGenes \n& \nDev. \n16, 1616-1626 (2002)) using complementary synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide terminally labeled with \n32\nP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStatistical analysis. Changes between treatment groups or between sets of in vitro experiments were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and then by Student's t test with Bonferroni correction. Increases in leukotriene concentrations were determined by the Mann-Whitney test. All numerical data were collected from at least 3 separate experiments. Results were expressed as mean±SEM (error bars in graphs). Differences were considered to be significant at P<0.05.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsiRNA sequences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nTarget\n\n\nsiRNA sequence\n\n\nSEQ ID NO:\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsiRNA #1\n\n\nRSV-P\n\n\n5′-CGAUAAUAUAACUGCAAGAdTdT-3′\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 3)\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3′-dTdTGCUAUUAUAUUGACGUUCU-5′\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 4)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsiRNA #2\n\n\nRSV-P\n\n\n5′-CCCUACACCAAGUGAUAAUdTdT-3′\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 5)\n\n\n80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3′-dTdTGGGAUGUGGUUCACUAUUA-5′\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 6)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsiRNA #3\n\n\nRSV-P\n\n\n5′-GAUGCCAUGAUUGGUUUAAdTdT-3′\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 7)\n\n\n>300\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3′-dTdTCUACGGUACUAACCAAAUU-5′\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 8)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsiRNA #4\n\n\nHPIV3-P\n\n\n5′-CGAGUUGUAUGUGUAGCAAdTdT-3′\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 9)\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3′-dTdTGCUCAACAUACACAUCGUU-5′\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 10)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsiRNA #5\n\n\nHPIV3-P\n\n\n5′-GAUAGACUUCCUAGCAGGAdTdT-3′\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 11)\n\n\n >300\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3′-dTdTCUAUCUGAAGGAUCGUCCU-5′\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 12)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuc-siRNA\n\n\nLuciferase\n\n\n5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAdTdT-3′\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 13)\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3′-dTdTGCAUGCGCCUUAUGAAGCU-5′\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 14)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3′\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 15)\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3′-dTdTAAGAGGCUUGCACAGUGCA-5′\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 16)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe GenBank accession numbers for RSV-P, HPIV3-P and luciferase sequences are M22644, Z11575 and X65324 respectively.

Nos. 61/184,386, filed Jun. 5, 2009, and 61/295,023, filed Jan. 14, 2010, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nA variety of disorders are associated with abnormal protein folding and/or aggregation. For example, several neurodegenerative diseases and/or conditions associated with cognitive impairment are often characterized by intracellular and/or extracellular accumulation of specific proteins. To give but a couple of examples, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease both involve abnormal protein folding and/or aggregation of specific proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacologic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and AD specifically, and of cognitive impairment and dementia more generally may be divided into three main areas: pharmacologic interventions targeting the specific underlying pathophysiology; pharmacological agents that ameliorate specific symptoms; and behavioral interventions.

The term tauopathy, was first used to describe a family with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and abundant tau deposits. This term is now used to identify a group of diseases with widespread tau pathology in which tau accumulation appears to be directly associated with pathogenesis. Major neurodegenerative taupathies includes sporadic and hereditary diseases characterized by filamentous tau deposits in brain and spinal cord.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the majority of taupathies, glial and neuronal tau inclusions are the sole or predominant CNS lesions. Exemplary such taupathies include amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), parkinsonism, argyrophilic grain dementia, diffuse neurofibrillary tangles with calcification, frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 17, corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, progressive subcortical gliosis, and tangle only dementia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the taupathy is selected from the group consisting of atherosclerosis, stroke, cerebrovascular disease, vascular dementia, multi-infarct dementia, Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia, Lewy body disease, Pick's disease, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, Huntington's disease, AIDS and AIDS-related dementia, brain neoplasms, brain lesions, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Down's syndrome, Rett's syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, frontal lobe syndrome, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, post coronary artery by-pass graft surgery, cognitive impairment due to electroconvulsive shock therapy, cognitive impairment due to chemotherapy, cognitive impairment due to a history of drug abuse, attention deficit disorder (ADD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, dyslexia, depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, apathy, myasthenia gravis, cognitive impairment during waking hours due to sleep apnea, Tourette's syndrome, autoimmune vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyalgia rheumatica, hepatic conditions, metabolic diseases, Kufs' disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, storage diseases, infectious vasculitis, syphillis, neurosyphillis, Lyme disease, complications from intracerebral hemorrhage, hypothyroidism, B12 deficiency, folic acid deficiency, niacin deficiency, thiamine deficiency, hydrocephalus, complications post anoxia, prion disease (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), Fragile X syndrome, phenylketonuria, malnutrition, neurofibromatosis, maple syrup urine disease, hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, and hypoglycemia. In some embodiments, the taupathy is Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, a “small molecule” is understood in the art to be an organic molecule that is less than about 2000 g/mol in size. In some embodiments, the small molecule is less than about 1500 g/mol or less than about 1000 g/mol. In some embodiments, the small molecule is less than about 800 g/mol or less than about 500 g/mol. In some embodiments, small molecules are non-polymeric and/or non-oligomeric. In some embodiments, small molecules are not proteins, peptides, or amino acids. In some embodiments, small molecules are not nucleic acids or nucleotides. In some embodiments, small molecules are not saccharides or polysaccharides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “substantially” refers to the qualitative condition of exhibiting total or near-total extent or degree of a characteristic or property of interest. One of ordinary skill in the biological arts will understand that biological and chemical phenomena rarely, if ever, go to completion and/or proceed to completeness or achieve or avoid an absolute result. The term “substantially” is therefore used herein to capture the potential lack of completeness inherent in many biological and chemical phenomena.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn individual who is “suffering from” a disease, disorder, and/or condition has been diagnosed with and/or displays one or more symptoms of a disease, disorder, and/or condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn individual who is “susceptible to” a disease, disorder, and/or condition typically has not been diagnosed with a disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, an individual who is susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition may exhibit symptoms of the disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, an individual who is susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition may not exhibit symptoms of the disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, an individual who is susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition will develop the disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, an individual who is susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition will not develop the disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, an individual is considered to be susceptible to a particular disease, disorder, and/or condition because that individual is determined to have an increased risk of developing the disease, disorder, or condition than is observed in the general population.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrase “therapeutic agent” refers to any agent that, when administered to a subject, has a therapeutic effect and/or elicits a desired biological and/or pharmacological effect. In some embodiments, a therapeutic agent is any substance that can be used to alleviate, ameliorate, relieve, inhibit, prevent, delay onset of, reduce severity of, and/or reduce incidence of one or more symptoms or features of a disease, disorder, and/or condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “therapeutically effective amount” means an amount of a substance (e.g., a therapeutic agent, composition, and/or formulation) that elicits a desired biological response. In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of a substance is an amount that is sufficient, when administered to a subject suffering from or susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition, to treat, diagnose, prevent, and/or delay and/or alleviate one or more symptoms of the disease, disorder, and/or condition. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in this art, the effective amount of a substance may vary depending on such factors as the desired biological endpoint, the substance to be delivered, the target cell or tissue, etc. For example, the effective amount of a formulation to treat a disease, disorder, and/or condition is the amount that alleviates, ameliorates, relieves, inhibits, prevents, delays onset of; reduces severity of and/or reduces incidence of one or more symptoms or features of the disease, disorder, and/or condition. Furthermore, an effective amount may be administered via a single dose or via multiple doses within a treatment regimen. In some embodiments, individual doses or compositions are considered to contain a “therapeutically effective amount” when they contain an amount effective as a dose in the context of a treatment regimen. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a dose or amount may be considered to be effective if it is or has been demonstrated to show statistically significant effectiveness when administered to a population of patients; a particular result need not be achieved in a particular individual patient in order for an amount to be considered to be therapeutically effective as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “treat,” “treatment,” or “treating” refers to any method used to partially or completely alleviate, ameliorate, relieve, inhibit, delay onset of, reduce severity of and/or reduce incidence of one or more symptoms or features of a disease, disorder, and/or condition. Treatment may be administered to a subject who does not exhibit signs of a disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, treatment may be administered to a subject who exhibits only early signs of the disease, disorder, and/or condition for the purpose of decreasing the risk of developing pathology associated with the disease, disorder, and/or condition. As used herein, “preventing” means causing the clinical symptoms of the disease state not to develop i.e., inhibiting the onset of disease, in a subject that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease state, but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “stereochemically isomeric forms” of compounds, as used herein, include all possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded by the same sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not interchangeable, which the compounds may possess. The present invention encompasses each and every stereochemically isomeric form of a designated compound. Furthermore, the present invention encompasses all such stereochemically isomeric forms (e.g., all diastereomers and/or enantiomers) in pure form and/or in any combination with one another, including in racemic mixtures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the compounds provided herein may exist in tautomeric forms. Such forms are encompassed by the present invention, whether or not explicitly depicted in displayed chemical formulas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention may be provided in the form of “prodrugs”, as is known in the art.

are characterized by an ability to inhibit farnesylation of one or more farnesylated target proteins. Such provided compounds and/or compositions are considered to be “farnesyl transferase inhibitors”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be appreciated that the term “farnesyl transferase inhibitor” has commonly been used in the art to describe compounds that inhibit farnesylation of a particular target protein. Most commonly, the term “farnesyl transferase inhibitor” has been used to apply to agents that inhibit farnesylation of Ras and/or of proteins that contain “CaaX-box” sequence element, in which a is an amino acid with an aliphatic side chain, at their C-terminus (farnesylation occurs on the cysteine residue). More recently, the term “farnesyl transferase inhibitor” has been used to apply to agents that inhibit farnesylation of other targets (e.g., UCH-L1) (see, for example, 60/555,092 Filed Mar. 18, 2004; Ser.

No. 11/354,896; Filed: Feb. 16, 2006; 60/894,086 Filed: Mar. 9, 2007; PCT/US08/56162; Filed: Mar. 7, 2008; 60/915,828; Filed: May 3, 2007; PCT/US08/62437 Filed: May 2, 2008; 61/121,373; Filed: Dec. 10, 2008). Typically, a compound is considered to be a “farnesyl transferase inhibitor” whether it directly targets (e.g., binds to) the farnesyl transferase enzyme, or whether it otherwise achieves a reduction in farnesylation of one or more targets of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe modification of a protein by a farnesyl group can have an important effect on function for a number of proteins. Farnesylated proteins typically undergo further C-terminal modification events that include a proteolytic removal of three C-terminal amino acids and carboxymethylation of C-terminal cystines. These C-terminal modifications facilitate protein-membrane association as well as protein-protein interactions. Farnesylation is catalyzed by a protein farnesyltransferase (FTase), a heterodimeric enzyme that recognizes the a cysteine-containing motif present at the C-terminus of the substrate protein. FTase transfers a farnesyl group from farnesyl pyrophosphate and forms a thioether linkage between the farnesyl and the relevant cystine residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, inhibitory activity of a provided compound with respect to farnesylation of a particular target may be assayed by in vivo and/or in vitro assays. In certain embodiments, the IC\n50 \nas measured in an in vitro assay using recombinant farnesyl transferase is less than about 100 nM. In certain embodiments, the IC\n50 \nis less than about 50 nM. In certain embodiments, the IC\n50 \nis less than about 10 nM. In certain embodiments, the IC\n50 \nis less than about 5 nM. In certain embodiments, the IC\n50 \nis less than about 1 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the present invention, provided compounds that act as farnesyl transferase inhibitors characterized by and/or are administered under conditions and/or according to a regimen that achieves differential effects on farnesylation of different target proteins (i.e., at least one favored target and at least one disfavored target). In many embodiments, the disfavored target is Ras. In some embodiments, the disfavored target contains a CaaX sequence element; in some such embodiments, X is any amino acid; in some such embodiments, X is serine, methionine, gutamine, alanin, or threonine. In some embodiments, the favored target is a non-Ras target. In some embodiments, the favored target does not contain a CaaX-COOH sequence element (as described herein). In some embodiments, the favored target contains a CKaa-COOH sequence element (where K is lysine). In some embodiments, the favored target contains a CKAA-COOH sequence element (where A is alanine). In some embodiments, the favored target is UCH-L1. It has recently been discovered that UCH-L1 is farnesylated in vivo. UCH-L1 is associated with the membrane and this membrane association is mediated by farnesylation. Farnesylated UCH-L1 also stabilizes the accumulation of α-synuclein. The invention relates to the prevention or inhibition of UCH-L1 farnesylation which would result in UCH-L1 membrane disassociation and acceleration of the degradation of α-synuclein. Since α-synuclein accumulation is pathogenic in PD, DLBD, and MSA, an increased degradation of α-synuclein and/or inhibition of α-synuclein accumulation ameliorates the toxicity associated with a pathogenic accumulation of α-synuclein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, where compounds provided herein are characterized by and/or are administered under conditions and/or according to a regimen that achieves differential effects on farnesylation of different target proteins (i.e., at least one favored target and at least one disfavored target), the effect on the favored target is at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100, 500, or 1000 times, or more greater than the effect on the disfavored target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, farnesyl transferase inhibitors utilized in accordance with the present invention are characterized by and/or are administered under conditions and/or according to a regimen that achieves a less than 50% reduction in Ras farnesylation. In some embodiments, Ras farnesylation is reduced less than 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5% or less. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that studies have illustrated that Ras farnesylation must be reduced by more than 50%, and often much more than 50%, in order to achieve beneficial effects in the treatment of cancer. In some embodiments of the present invention, farnesyl transferase inhibitors are utilized at doses that are at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100, 500, 1000 fold or more lower than doses required for effects in the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, compounds utilized in accordance with the present invention are characterized by and/or are administered under conditions and/or according to a regimen that achieves a reduction in levels of aggregates of one or more proteins of interest. In some embodiments, rates of aggregation and/or of disaggregation and/or protein destruction are altered. In some such embodiments, administration of a compound provided herein to an organism reduces levels of aggregates in one or more particular tissues of interest.

General Methods of Providing the Present Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nProvided compounds are prepared by methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art and including methods illustrated in Schemes 1-4, below. Unless otherwise noted, all variables are as defined above and in classes and subclasses herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the Schemes below, where a particular protecting group, leaving group, or transformation condition is depicted, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other protecting groups, leaving groups, and transformation conditions are also suitable and are contemplated. Such groups and transformations are described in detail in \nMarch's Advanced Organic Chemistry Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure\n, M. B. Smith and J. March, 5\nth \nEdition, John Wiley & Sons, 2001\n, Comprehensive Organic Transformations\n, R. C. Larock, 2\nnd \nEdition, John Wiley & Sons, 1999, and \nProtecting Groups in Organic Synthesis\n, T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, 3\nrd \nedition, John Wiley & Sons, 1999, the entirety of each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCoupling partner 7 for use in Scheme 3, below, is synthesized from (1H-imidazol-4-yl)methanol 1. In some embodiments, aldehyde 7 is prepared in a manner substantially similar to that described by Bell et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n2001, 44, 2933-2949; Williams et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n1999, 42, 3779.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs depicted in Scheme 1 above, S-1 illustrates the protection of (1H-imidazol-4-yl)methanol 1 to afford compound 2. In some embodiments, selective protection of the nitrogen moiety occurs with an appropriate protecting group (e.g., trityl chloride) under basic conditions (e.g., triethylamine) in a suitable solvent (e.g., dimethylformamide (DMF)). In some embodiments, subsequent protection of the hydroxyl moiety comprises acylation. In certain embodiments, the hydroxyl moiety is acylated under basic conditions (e.g., in the presence of pyridine) with a suitable acylating agent (e.g., acetic anhydride) to provide compound 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn step S-2 above, alkylation of the remaining nitrogen of the imidazole ring under standard conditions using alkylating agent 3 furnishes alkylated imidazolium 4. In some embodiments, alkylating agent 3 is prepared so as to contain a suitably reactive leaving group capable of being displaced upon exposure to compound 2 under suitable conditions. In certain embodiments, the suitably reactive leaving group is a halide (e.g., a bromide) and suitable conditions comprise a suitable solvent (e.g., acetonitrile), reaction time (e.g., 3 h), and reaction temperature (e.g., 80° C.) to facilitate conversion to alkylated imidazolium 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn step S-3 above, imidazolium 4 is selectively deprotected at nitrogen to afford compound 5. In some embodiments, deprotection occurs using a protic solvent at elevated temperatures. In certain embodiments, the protecting group is trityl and deprotection occurs using refluxing methanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in step S-4 above, deprotection of compound 5 provides free alcohol 6. In some embodiments, deprotection of compound 5 occurs under basic conditions. In certain embodiments, the protecting group is an acyl group and deprotection occurs using an alkoxide salt in the corresponding alcoholic solvent (e.g., sodium methoxide in methanol).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in step S-5 above, the free alcohol moiety is then oxidized using a suitable oxidant to furnish aldehyde 7. In some embodiments, oxidation occurs under basic conditions. In certain embodiments, the oxidant is a sulfur oxide-amine complex (e.g., SO\n3\n-pyridine) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and oxidation occurs in the presence of an additional amine base (e.g., triethylamine).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCoupling partner 13 for use in Scheme 3, below, is synthesized from primary amine 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn step S-6 shown above, amine 8 is coupled to N-protected (S)-2-amino-4-(methylthio)\nbutanoic acid\n 9 using standard coupling reagents to form amide 10. In some embodiments, coupling of the amine to the carboxylic acid moiety of the amino acid occurs in the presence of one or more coupling reagents under basic conditions to provide the corresponding amide. In certain embodiments, the coupling reagent is a peptide coupling reagent (e.g., 2-(1H-7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium hexafluorophosphate methanaminium (HATU)), the base is an amine base (e.g., diisopropylethylamine) and the reaction takes place in a chlorinated solvent (e.g., methylene chloride).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn step S-7 shown above, alkylation of the sulfide moiety of 10 furnishes sulfonium salt 11. In some embodiments, alkylation occurs using an alkylating agent containing a suitably reactive leaving group. In some embodiments, the alkylating agent is an alkyl halide. In certain embodiments, the alkylating agent is a methylating agent (e.g., methyl iodide).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs illustrated in step S-8, subsequent cyclization of sulfonium salt 11 provides substituted lactam 12. In some embodiments, cyclization occurs in an anhydrous solvent under basic conditions. In certain embodiments, the anhydrous solvent is an ethereal solvent (e.g., tetrahydrofuran (THF)) and the base is a lithium amide salt (e.g., lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn step S-9 shown above, the protected amino moiety of lactam 12 is deprotected and the free amine is reacted with an appropriate acid to form the corresponding amine salt coupling partner 13. In some embodiments, the reagent used to deprotect the amine of compound 12 is also the same reagent used to form the corresponding amine salt 13. In certain embodiments, the protecting group is an acid labile protecting group (e.g., a BOC) group) such that deprotection and salt formation are completed in one step in the presence of a strong acid (e.g., TFA).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs depicted in Scheme 3, coupling partner 13 is coupled to aldehyde 7 using any of the appropriate techniques known in the chemical arts to afford product I-a1. In some embodiments, coupling occurs via reductive amination. In certain embodiments, the reductive amination is performed using a suitable reducing agent such as, for instance, a hydride reducing agent (e.g., NaCNBH\n3\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor each of the aforementioned Schemes, it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that a variety of suitable reagents and reaction conditions may be employed to carry out the described syntheses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough preparation of formula I-a1 is depicted above, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that 1-b1 can be prepared by the same methods using the appropriate chiral amino acid.\n\n\n \n5.

In certain embodiments, a composition of this invention is formulated for administration to a patient in need of such composition. In some embodiments, a composition of this invention is formulated for oral administration to a patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. The term “parenteral” as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques. Preferably, the compositions are administered orally, intraperitoneally or intravenously. Sterile injectable forms of the compositions of this invention may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension. These suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents that are commonly used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried cornstarch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents may also be added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These can be prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may also be administered topically, especially when the target of treatment includes areas or organs readily accessible by topical application, including diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTopical application for the lower intestinal tract can be effected in a rectal suppository formulation (see above) or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical applications, provided pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one or more carriers. Carriers for topical administration of compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, provided pharmaceutically acceptable compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or cream containing the active components suspended or dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, \npolysorbate\n 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor ophthalmic use, provided pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be formulated as micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with or without a preservative such as benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic uses, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or dispersing agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of compounds of the present invention that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a composition in a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated, the particular mode of administration. Preferably, provided compositions should be formulated so that a dosage of between 0.01-100 mg/kg body weight/day of the inhibitor can be administered to a patient receiving these compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should also be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the judgment of the treating physician and the severity of the particular disease being treated. The amount of a compound of the present invention in the composition will also depend upon the particular compound in the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of the present invention include those suitable for oral, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal and/or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated, and the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient that can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, this amount will range from about 1% to about 99% of active ingredient, preferably from about 5% to about 70%, most preferably from about 10% to about 30%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a formulation of the present invention comprises an excipient selected from the group consisting of cyclodextrins, liposomes, micelle forming agents, e.g., bile acids, and polymeric carriers, e.g., polyesters and polyanhydrides; and a provided compound. In certain embodiments, an aforementioned formulation renders orally bioavailable a provided compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of preparing a provided formulation or composition can include a step of bringing into association a provided compound with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a provided compound with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of the invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of a provided compound, or composition thereof, as an active ingredient. A provided compound may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn solid dosage forms of the invention for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees, powders, granules and the like), a provided compound, or composition thereof, is mixed with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any of the following: fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; humectants, such as glycerol; disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; wetting agents, such as, for example, cetyl alcohol, glycerol monostearate, and non-ionic surfactants; absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof; and coloring agents. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-shelled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made in a suitable machine in which a mixture of the powdered compound is moistened with an inert liquid diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTablets, and other solid dosage forms of pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, such as dragces, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be formulated for rapid release, e.g., freeze-dried. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions that can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration of a provided compound, or composition thereof, include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBesides inert diluents, oral formulations can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuspensions, in addition to a provided compound, or composition thereof, may contain one or more suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one or more compounds of the invention with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate, and which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPowders and sprays can contain, in addition to a compound, or composition thereof; of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a provided compound, or composition thereof, to the body. Dissolving or dispersing a compound, or composition thereof, in the proper medium can make such dosage forms. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of compound, or composition thereof, across the skin. Either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing compound, or composition thereof, in a polymer matrix or gel can control the rate of such flux.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOphthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more compounds, or composition thereof, of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain sugars, alcohols, antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof; vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese formulations may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms upon the subject compounds may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInjectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions, which are compatible with body tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a compound or pharmaceutical preparation is administered orally. In other embodiments, the compound or pharmaceutical preparation is administered intravenously. Alternative routs of administration include sublingual, intramuscular, and transdermal administrations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the provided compounds are administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1% to 99.5% (more preferably, 0.5% to 90%) of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparations of the present invention may be given orally, parenterally, topically, or rectally. They are of course given in forms suitable for each administration route. For example, they are administered in tablets or capsule form, by injection, inhalation, eye lotion, ointment, suppository, etc. administration by injection, infusion or inhalation; topical by lotion or ointment; and rectal by suppositories. Oral administrations are preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese compounds may be administered to humans and other animals for therapy by any suitable route of administration, including orally, nasally, as by, for example, a spray, rectally, intravaginally, parenterally, intracisternally and topically, as by powders, ointments or drops, including buccally and sublingually.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegardless of the route of administration selected, provided compounds, which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically-acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient that is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the particular provided compound employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion or metabolism of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and then gradually increasing the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the invention is provided to a subject chronically. Chronic treatments include any form of repeated administration for an extended period of time, such as repeated administrations for one or more months, between a month and a year, one or more years, or longer. In many embodiments, a chronic treatment involves administering a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the invention repeatedly over the life of the subject. Preferred chronic treatments involve regular administrations, for example one or more times a day, one or more times a week, or one or more times a month. In general, a suitable dose such as a daily dose of a compound of the invention will be that amount of the compound that is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, doses of the compounds of this invention for a patient, when used for the indicated effects, will range from about 0.0001 to about 100 mg per kg of body weight per day. Preferably the daily dosage will range from 0.001 to 50 mg of compound per kg of body weight, and even more preferably from 0.01 to 10 mg of compound per kg of body weight. However, lower or higher doses can be used. In some embodiments, an effective amount comprises about 10 ng/kg of body weight to about 1000 mg/kg of body weight. In some embodiments, the dose administered to a subject may be modified as the physiology of the subject changes due to age, disease progression, weight, or other factors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf desired, the effective daily dose of the active compound may be administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day, optionally, in unit dosage forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile it is possible for a provided compound to be administered alone, it is preferable to administer the compound as a pharmaceutical formulation (composition) as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds according to the invention may be formulated for administration in any convenient way for use in human or veterinary medicine, by analogy with other pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, compounds for treating neurodegenerative diseases, disorders, and/or conditions can be formulated or administered using methods that help the compounds cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). The vertebrate brain (and CNS) has a unique capillary system unlike that in any other organ in the body. The unique capillary system has morphologic characteristics which make up the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The blood-brain barrier acts as a system-wide cellular membrane that separates the brain interstitial space from the blood.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe unique morphologic characteristics of the brain capillaries that make up the BBB are: (a) epithelial-like high resistance tight junctions which literally cement all endothelia of brain capillaries together, and (b) scanty pinocytosis or transendothelial channels, which are abundant in endothelia of peripheral organs. Due to the unique characteristics of the blood-brain barrier, hydrophilic drugs and peptides that readily gain access to other tissues in the body are barred from entry into the brain or their rates of entry and/or accumulation in the brain are very low.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious strategies have been developed for introducing those drugs into the brain which otherwise would not cross the blood-brain barrier. Widely used strategies involve invasive procedures where the drug is delivered directly into the brain. One such procedure is the implantation of a catheter into the ventricular system to bypass the blood-brain barrier and deliver the drug directly to the brain. These procedures have been used in the treatment of brain diseases which have a predilection for the meninges, e.g., leukemic involvement of the brain (U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,505, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough invasive procedures for the direct delivery of drugs to the brain ventricles have experienced some success, they are limited in that they may only distribute the drug to superficial areas of the brain tissues, and not to the structures deep within the brain. Further, the invasive procedures are potentially harmful to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther approaches to circumventing the blood-brain barrier utilize pharmacologic-based procedures involving drug latentiation or the conversion of hydrophilic drugs into lipid-soluble drugs. The majority of the latentiation approaches involve blocking the hydroxyl, carboxyl and primary amine groups on the drug to make it more lipid-soluble and therefore more easily able to cross the blood-brain barrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother approach to increasing the permeability of the BBB to drugs involves the intra-arterial infusion of hypertonic substances which transiently open the blood-brain barrier to allow passage of hydrophilic drugs. However, hypertonic substances are potentially toxic and may damage the blood-brain barrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide compositions of the invention may be administered using chimeric peptides wherein the hydrophilic peptide drug is conjugated to a transportable peptide, capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier by transcytosis at a much higher rate than the hydrophilic peptides alone. Suitable transportable peptides include, but are not limited to, histone, insulin, transferrin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), basic albumin and prolactin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies are another method for delivery of compositions of the invention. For example, an antibody that is reactive with a transferrin receptor present on a brain capillary endothelial cell, can be conjugated to a neuropharmaceutical agent to produce an antibody-neuropharmaceutical agent conjugate (U.S. Pat. No. 5,004,697, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference). The method is conducted under conditions whereby the antibody binds to the transferrin receptor on the brain capillary endothelial cell and the neuropharmaceutical agent is transferred across the blood brain barrier in a pharmaceutically active form. The uptake or transport of antibodies into the brain can also be greatly increased by cationizing the antibodies to form cationized antibodies having an isoelectric point of between about 8.0 to 11.0 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,527,527, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA ligand-neuropharmaceutical agent fusion protein is another method useful for delivery of compositions to a host (U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,307, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference). The ligand is reactive with a brain capillary endothelial cell receptor. The method is conducted under conditions whereby the ligand binds to the receptor on a brain capillary endothelial cell and the neuropharmaceutical agent is transferred across the blood brain barrier in a pharmaceutically active form. In some embodiments, a ligand-neuropharmaceutical agent fusion protein, which has both ligand binding and neuropharmaceutical characteristics, can be produced as a contiguous protein by using genetic engineering techniques. Gene constructs can be prepared comprising DNA encoding the ligand fused to DNA encoding the protein, polypeptide or peptide to be delivered across the blood brain barrier. The ligand coding sequence and the agent coding sequence are inserted in the expression vectors in a suitable manner for proper expression of the desired fusion protein. The gene fusion is expressed as a contiguous protein molecule containing both a ligand portion and a neuropharmaceutical agent portion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPermeability of the blood brain barrier can often be increased by administering a blood brain barrier agonist, for example bradykinin (U.S. Pat. No. 5,112,596, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference), or polypeptides called receptor mediated permeabilizers (RMP) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,268,164, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference). Exogenous molecules can be administered to the host's bloodstream parenterally by subcutaneous, intravenous or intramuscular injection or by absorption through a bodily tissue, such as the digestive tract, the respiratory system or the skin. The form in which the molecule is administered (e.g., capsule, tablet, solution, emulsion) depends, at least in part, on the route by which it is administered. Administration of the exogenous molecule to the host's bloodstream and the intravenous injection of the agonist of blood-brain barrier permeability can occur simultaneously or sequentially in time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a therapeutic drug can be administered orally in tablet form while the intravenous administration of an agonist of blood-brain barrier permeability is given later (e.g., between 30 minutes later and several hours later). This allows time for the drug to be absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and taken up by the bloodstream before the agonist is given to increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to the drug. On the other hand, an agonist of blood-brain barrier permeability (e.g., bradykinin) can be administered before or at the same time as an intravenous injection of a drug. Thus, the term “co-administration” is used herein to mean that the agonist of blood-brain barrier and the exogenous molecule will be administered at times that will achieve significant concentrations in the blood for producing the simultaneous effects of increasing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and allowing the maximum passage of the exogenous molecule from the blood to the cells of the central nervous system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, compounds of the invention can be formulated as a prodrug with a fatty acid carrier (and optionally with another neuroactive drug). The prodrug is stable in the environment of both the stomach and the bloodstream and may be delivered by ingestion. The prodrug passes readily through the blood brain barrier. The prodrug preferably has a brain penetration index of at least two times the brain penetration index of the drug alone. Once in the central nervous system, the prodrug, which preferably is inactive, is hydrolyzed into the fatty acid carrier and the farnesyl transferase inhibitor (and optionally another drug). The carrier preferably is a normal component of the central nervous system and is inactive and harmless. The compound and/or drug, once released from the fatty acid carrier, is active. Preferably, the fatty acid carrier is a partially-saturated straight chain molecule having between about 16 and 26 carbon atoms, and more preferably 20 and 24 carbon atoms. Examples of fatty acid carriers are provided in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,939,174; 4,933,324; 5,994,932; 6,107,499; 6,258,836; and 6,407,137.\n\n\n \n6. Combination Therapy\n\n\n \n \n \nDepending upon the particular condition, or disease, to be treated, additional therapeutic agents, which are normally administered to treat that condition, may also be present in the compositions of this invention. As used herein, additional therapeutic agents that are normally administered to treat a particular disease, or condition, are known as “appropriate for the disease, or condition, being treated.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the present invention, compounds provided herein may be administered in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents. Such additional therapeutic agents may be administered separately from an inventive compound-containing composition, as part of a multiple dosage regimen. Alternatively or additionally, those agents may be part of a single dosage form, mixed together with a compound of this invention in a single composition. If administered as part of a multiple dosage regime, the two active agents may be submitted simultaneously, sequentially or within a period of time from one another normally within five hours from one another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “combination,” “combined,” and related terms refers to the simultaneous or sequential administration of therapeutic agents in accordance with this invention. For example, a compound of the present invention may be administered with another therapeutic agent simultaneously or sequentially in separate unit dosage forms or together in a single unit dosage form. Accordingly, the present invention provides a single unit dosage form comprising a provided compound, an additional therapeutic agent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle. Two or more agents are typically considered to be administered “in combination” when a patient or individual is simultaneously exposed to both agents. In many embodiments, two or more agents are considered to be administered “in combination” when a patient or individual simultaneously shows therapeutically relevant levels of the agents in a particular target tissue or sample (e.g., in brain, in serum, etc).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of both a provided compound and additional therapeutic agent (in those compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent as described above)) that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Preferably, compositions of this invention should be formulated so that a dosage of between 0.01-100 mg/kg body weight/day of an inventive can be administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention, agents that are utilized in combination may act synergistically. Therefore, the amount of either agent utilized in such situations may be less than that typically utilized or required in a monotherapy involving only that therapeutic agent. Commonly, a dosage of between 0.01-1,000 μg/kg body weight/day of the additional therapeutic agent can be administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of additional therapeutic agent present utilized in combination therapy according to the present invention typically will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent. Preferably the amount of additional therapeutic agent utilized will range from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally utilized in therapies involving that agent as the only therapeutically active agent. Established dosing regimens for known therapeutic agents are known in the art and incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, compounds of the present invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof, can be administered in combination with treatments for Alzheimer's disease such as Aricept® and Excelon®.

Surgical treatment is presently recommended for those who have failed medical management of PD. Unilateral thallamotomy can be used to reduce tremor. It is occasionally considered for patients with unilateral tremor not responding to medication. Bilateral procedures are not advised. Unilateral deep brain stimulation of the thalamus for tremor may also be a benefit for tremor. Unilateral pallidotomy is an effective technique for reducing contralateral drug-induced dyskinesias. Gamma knife surgery—thalamotomy or pallidotomy—can be performed as a radiological alternative to conventional surgery. The currently preferred neurosurgical intervention is, however, bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation. Neurotransplantation strategies remain experimental.

It will be appreciated that in some embodiments, misfolded proteins, and/or protein aggregates may be considered to cause one or more symptoms or attributes of a particular disease, disorder or condition. So long as presence of misfolded proteins and/or protein aggregates correlates with presence of symptoms, the disease, disorder, or condition is considered to be associated with misfolded proteins and/or protein aggregates. Diseases, disorders or conditions associated with misfolded and/or aggregated proteins are referred to as “proteinopathies” herein. Proteinopathies of particular relevance include those associated with protein aggregates, and particularly with aggregataes of one or more proteins selected from the group consisting of α-synuclein (synucleinopathies), tau (tauopathies), amyloid (amyloidopathies), SOD1 (SOD1 proteinopathies), TDP-43 (TDP-43 proteinopathies), huntingtin, subunit c of ATP synthase, etc. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that certain diseases, disorders and conditions may be associated with misfolding and/or aggregation of more than one different protein and therefore may fall into more than one disease category as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynucleins are small proteins (123 to 143 amino acids) characterized by repetitive imperfect repeats KTKEGV (SEQ ID NO: 1) distributed throughout most of the amino terminal half of the polypeptide in the acidic carboxy-terminal region. There are three human synuclein proteins termed α, β, and γ, and they are encoded by separate genes mapped to chromosomes 4221.3-q22, 5q23, and 10q23.2-q23.3, respectively. The most recently cloned synuclein protein synoretin, has a close homology to γ-synuclein and is predominantly expressed within the retina. α-Synuclein, also referred to as non-amyloid component of senile plaques precursor protein (NACP), SYN1 or synelfin, is a heat-stable, “natively unfolded” protein of poorly defined function. It is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) neurons where it is localized to presynaptic terminals. Electron microscopy studies have localized α-synuclein in close proximity to synaptic vesicles at axonal termini, suggesting a role for α-synuclein in neurotransmission or synaptic organization, and biochemical analysis has revealed that a small fraction of α-synuclein may be associated with vesicular membranes but most α-synuclein is cytosolic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenetic and histopathological evidence supports the idea that α-synuclein is the major component of several proteinaceous inclusions characteristic of specific neurodegenerative diseases. Pathological synuclein aggregations are restricted to the α-synuclein isoforms, as β- and γ-synucieins have not been detected in these inclusions. The presence of α-synuclein positive aggregates is disease specific. Lewy bodies, neuronal fibrous cytoplasmic inclusions that are histopathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD) and diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) are strongly labeled with antibodies to α-synuclein. Dystrophic ubiquitin-positive neurites associated with PD pathology, termed Lewy neurites (LN) and CA2/CA3 ubiquitin neurites are also α-synuclein positive. Furthermore, pale bodies, putative precursors of LBs, thread-like structures in the perikarya of slightly swollen neurons and glial silver positive inclusions in the midbrains of patients with LB diseases are also immunoreactive for α-synuclein. α-Synuclein is likely the major component of glial cell inclusions (GCIs) and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in MSA and brain iron accumulation type 1 (PANK1). α-Synuclein immunoreactivity is present in some dystrophic neurites in senile plaques in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and in the cord and cortex in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). α-Synuclein immunoreactivity is prominent in transgenic and toxin-induced mouse models of PD, AD, ALS, and HD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther evidence supports the notion that α-synuclein is the actual building block of the fibrillary components of LBs, LNs, and GCIs. Immunoelectron microscopic studies have demonstrated that these fibrils are intensely labeled with α-synuclein antibodies in situ. Sarcosyl-insoluble α-synuclein filaments with straight and twisted morphologies can also be observed in extracts of DLBD and MSA brains. Moreover, α-synuclein can assemble in vitro into elongated homopolymers with similar widths as sarcosyl-insoluble fibrils or filaments visualized in situ. Polymerization is associated with a concomitant change in secondary structure from random coil to anti-parallel β-sheet structure consistent with the Thioflavine-S reactivity of these filaments. Furthermore, the PD-association with α-synuclein mutation, A53T, may accelerate this process, as recombinant A53T α-synuclein has a greater propensity to polymerize than wild-type α-synuclein. This mutation also affects the ultrastructure of the polymers; the filaments are slightly wider and are more twisted in appearance, as if assembled from two protofilaments. The A30P mutation may also modestly increase the propensity of α-synuclein to polymerize, but the pathological effects of this mutation also may be related to its reduced binding to vesicles. Interestingly, carboxyl-terminally truncated α-synuclein may be more prone to form filaments than the full-length protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynucleinopathies are a diverse set of disorders that share a common association with lesions containing abnormal aggregates of insolution α-synuclein protein. Typically such lesions are found in selectively vulnerable populations of neurons and glia. Certain evidence links the formation of abnormal filamentous aggregates to the onset and progression of clinical symptoms and the degeneration of affected brain regions in neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and disorders of brain iron concentration including pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (e.g., PANK1). The current treatment options for these diseases include symptomatic medications such as carbidopa-levodopa, anticholinergics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, with widely variable benefit. Even for the best responders, i.e., patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, an initial good response to levodopa is typically overshadowed by drug-induced complications such as motor fluctuations and debilitating dyskinesia, following the first five to seven years of therapy. For the rest of the disorders, the current medications offer marginal symptomatic benefit. Given the severe debilitating nature of these disorders and their prevalence, there is a clear need in the art for novel approaches towards treating and managing synucleinopathies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods relevant to synucleinopathies. For example, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of reducing α-synuclein toxicity in a cell, the method comprising administering to a cell a therapeutically effective amount of a provided compound. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of reducing the accumulation of α-synuclein in a cell, the method comprising administering to a cell a therapeutically effective amount of a provided compound. In some embodiments, the cell is a neuronal cell. In some embodiments, the cell expresses α-synuclein. In certain embodiments, the synucleinopathy is Parkinson's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, and/or multiple system atrophy disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods relevant to amyloidopathies. For example, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of reducing amyloid beta toxicity in a cell, the method comprising administering to a cell a therapeutically effective amount of a provided compound. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of reducing the accumulation of amyloid beta proteins in a cell, the method comprising administering to a cell a therapeutically effective amount of a provided compound. In some embodiments, the cell is a neuronal cell. In some embodiments, the cell expresses amyloid beta proteins. In certain embodiments, the amyloidopathy is Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and/or cognitive impairment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaupathies are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the presence of filamentous deposits, consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, in neurons and glia. Abnormal tau phosphorylation and deposition in neurons and glial cells is one of the major features in taupathies. The term tauopathy, was first used to describe a family with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and abundant tau deposits. This term is now used to identify a group of diseases with widespread tau pathology in which tau accumulation appears to be directly associated with pathogenesis. Major neurodegenerative taupathies includes sporadic and hereditary diseases characterized by filamentous tau deposits in brain and spinal cord.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the majority of taupathies, glial and neuronal tau inclusions are the sole or predominant CNS lesions. Exemplary such taupathies include amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), parkinsonism, argyrophilic grain dementia, diffuse neurofibrillary tangles with calcification, frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 17, corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, progressive subcortical gliosis, and tangle only dementia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, taupathies characterize a large group of diseases, disorders and conditions in which significant filaments and aggregates of tau protein are found. Exemplary such diseases, disorders, and conditions include sporadic and/or familial Alzheimer's Disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS-FTDP), argyrophilic grain dementia, dementia pugilistica, diffuse neurofibrillary tangles with calcification, Down syndrome, frontotemporal dementia, parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, Hallervorden-Spatz disease, inclusion body myositis, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD), multiple system atrophy, Niemann-Pick disease (NPC), Pick's disease, prion protein cerebral amyloid angiopathy, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, tangle-predominant Alzheimer's disease, corticobasal degeneration, (CBD), myotonic dystrophy, non-guanamian motor neuron disease with neurofibrillary tangles, postencephalitic parkinsonism, prion protein cerebral amyloid angiopathy, progressive subcortical gliosis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, and tangle-only dementia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeurodegenerative diseases where tau pathology is found in conjunction with other abnormal protein lesions may be considered secondary taupathies. Examples include Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and certain diseases where prion protein, Bri, or α-synuclein are aggregated. Although tau is probably not the initial pathological factor, tau aggregates contribute to the final degeneration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTau deposits can also be found in several other neurodegenerative diseases in which tau pathology is evident in conjunction with other abnormal protein lesions protein. Abundant cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of aggregated hyperphosphorylated protein tau are a characteristic pathological observation in several neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, frontotemporal dementia, cortico-basal degeneration, and progressive supranuclear palsy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods relevant to tauopathies. For example, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of reducing tau toxicity in a cell, the method comprising administering to a cell a therapeutically effective amount of a provided compound. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of reducing the accumulation of tau proteins in a cell, the method comprising administering to a cell a therapeutically effective amount of a provided compound. In some embodiments, the cell is a neuronal cell. In some embodiments, the cell expresses tau proteins. In certain embodiments, the taupathy is Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain particular diseases, disorders and conditions of interest are highlighted below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeurodegenerative Disease, Cognitive Impairment, and Dementia\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides methods of treating neurodegenerative disease, cognitive impairment and dementia, wherein the methods comprise administering a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a subject. Many neurodegenerative diseases are linked to intracellular and/or extracellular accumulation of specific protein aggregates. In many cases, it is thought that these aggregates exert toxic effects on the brain, and contribute to disease pathology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides methods for treating a subject with a neurodegenerative diseases by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a provided compound or a composition thereof. In certain embodiments, the subject has a synucleinopathy, amyloidopathy, taupathy or other proteinopathy. In some embodiments the neurodegenerative disease is selected from the group consisting of Parkinson's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, and multiple system atrophy disorder. In some embodiments, the subject suffers from one or more disorders of brain iron concentration including pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (e.g., PANK1). In some embodiments, other neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's Disease (HD), Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) may be treated with provided compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlzheimer's Disease\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides methods of treating Alzheimer's disease, wherein the methods comprise administering a compound of the invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a subject. Alzheimer's is the leading cause of dementia and cognitive impairment in the elderly and a leading cause of death in developing nations after cardiovascular disease, cancer, and stroke. Up to 70% of cases of dementia are due to Alzheimer's disease, with vascular disease being the second most common cause. The frequency of AD among 60-year-olds is approximately 1%. The incidence of AD doubles approximately every 5 years. Forsyth, \nPhys. Ther. \n78:1325-1331, 1998; Evans et al., \nJAMA \n262:2551-2556, 1989. AD afflicts an estimated four million people in the U.S. alone at a cost of $100 billion per year. Schumock, \nJ. Health Syst. Pharm. \n55(52):17-21, 1998; Hay & Ernst, \nAm. J. Public Health \n77:1169-1175, 1987.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlzheimer's Disease is characterized by the deterioration of mental faculties (e.g., memory loss, confusion, loss of visual/spatial comprehension) and associated with both amyloidopathies and taupathies. The central role of the long form of amyloid beta-peptide, in particular Aβ(1-42), in Alzheimer's disease has been established through a variety of histopathological, genetic and biochemical studies. Specifically, it has been found that deposition in the brain of Aβ(1-42) is an early and invariant feature of all forms of Alzheimer's disease. This occurs before a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is possible and before the deposition of the shorter primary form of A-beta, Aβ(1-40). Further implication of Aβ(1-42) in disease etiology comes from the observation that mutations in presenilin (gamma secretase) genes associated with early onset familial forms of Alzheimer's disease uniformly result in increased levels of Aβ(1-42). Additional mutations in the amyloid precursor protein APP raise total Aβ and in some cases raise Aβ(1-42) alone. Although the various APP mutations may influence the type, quantity, and location of Aβ deposited, it has been found that the predominant and initial species deposited in the brain parenchyma is long Aβ. In early deposits of Aβ, when most deposited protein is in the form of amorphous or diffuse plaques, virtually all of the Aβ is of the long form. These initial deposits of Aβ(1-42) then are able to seed the further deposition of both long and short forms of A. In transgenic animals expressing Aβ, deposits were associated with elevated levels of Aβ(1-42), and the pattern of deposition is similar to that seen in human disease with Aβ(1-42) being deposited early followed by deposition of Aβ(1-40). Similar patterns and timing of deposition are seen in Down's Syndrome patients in which Aβ expression is elevated and deposition is accelerated. The association of Alzheimer's Diseases with amyloid plaques means that Alzheimer's Diseases is considered to be an amyloidopathy. Alzheimer's Disease is also associated with accumulation of tau aggregates and therefore is a tauopathy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParkinson's Disease\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides methods of treating Parkinson's disease, wherein the methods comprise administering a compound of the invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a subject. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability. The pathologic hallmark of PD is loss of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the appearance of Lewy bodies in remaining neurons. It appears that more than about 50% of the cells in the SNpc need to be lost before motor symptoms appear. Associated symptoms often include small handwriting (micrographia), seborrhea, orthostatic hypotension, urinary difficulties, constipation and other gastrointestinal dysfunction, sleep disorders, depression and other neuropsychiatric phenomena, dementia, and smelling disturbances (occurs early). Patients with Parkinsonism have greater mortality, about two times compared to general population without PD. This is attributed to greater frailty or reduced mobility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiagnosis of PD is mainly clinical and is based on the clinical findings listed above. Parkinsonism, refers to any combination of two of bradykinesia, rigidity, and/or tremor. PD is the most common cause of parkinsonism. Other causes of parkinsonism are side effects of drugs, mainly the major tranquilizers, such as Haldol, strokes involving the basal ganglia, and other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Diffuse Lewy Body Disease (DLBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), MSA, and Huntington's disease. The pathological hallmark of PD is the Lewy body, an intracytoplasmatic inclusion body typically seen in affected neurons of the substantia nigra and to a variable extent, in the cortex. Recently, α-synuclein has been identified as the main component of Lewy bodies in sporadic Parkinsonism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough parkinsonism can be clearly traced to viruses, stroke, or toxins in a few individuals, for the most part, the etiology of Parkinson's disease in any particular case is unknown. Environmental influences which may contribute to PD may include drinking well water, farming and industrial exposure to heavy metals (e.g., iron, zinc, copper, mercury, magnesium and manganese), alkylated phosphates, and orthonal chlorines. Paraquat (a herbicide) has also been associated with increased prevalence of Parkinsonism including PD. Cigarette smoking is associated with a decreased incidence of PD. The current consensus is that PD may either be caused by an uncommon toxin combined with high genetic susceptibility or a common toxin combined with relatively low genetic susceptibility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA small percentage of subjects that are at risk of developing PD can be identified for example by genetic analysis. There is good evidence for certain genetic factors being associated with PD. Large pedigrees of autosomal dominantly inherited PDs have been reported. For example, a mutation in α-synuclein is responsible for one pedigree and triplication of the SNCA gene (the gene coding for α-synuclein) is associated with PD in others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMultiple System Atrophy\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides methods of treating multiple system atrophy, wherein the methods comprise administering a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a subject. Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is a neurodegenerative disease marked by a combination of symptoms; affecting movement, cognition, autonomic and other body functions, hence the label “multiple system atrophy”. The cause of MSA is unknown. Symptoms of MSA vary in distribution of onset and severity from person to person. Because of this, the nomenclature initially included three distinct terms: Shy-Drager syndrome, striatonigral degeneration (SD), and olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Shy-Drager syndrome, the most prominent symptoms are those involving the autonomic system; blood pressure, urinary function, and other functions not involving conscious control. Striatonigral degeneration causes Parkinsonism symptoms, such as slowed movements and rigidity, while OPCA principally affects balance, coordination and speech. The symptoms for MSA can also include orthostatic hypertension, male impotence, urinary difficulties, constipation, speech and swallowing difficulties, and blurred vision.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe initial diagnosis of MSA is usually made by carefully interviewing the patient and performing a physical examination. Several types of brain imaging, including computer tomography, scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET), can be used as corroborative studies. An incomplete and relatively poor response to dopamine replacement therapy, such as Sinemet, may be a clue that the presentation of bradykinesia and rigidity (parkinsonism) is not due to PD. A characteristic involvement of multiple brain systems with prominent autonomic dysfunction is a defining feature of MSA and one that at autopsy confirms the diagnosis. Patients with MSA can have the presence of glial cytoplasmic inclusions in certain types of brain cells, as well. Prototypic Lewy bodies are not present in MSA. However, α-synuclein staining by immunohistochemistry is prominent. In comparison to Parkinson's, in addition to the poor response to Sinemet, there are a few other observations that are strongly suggested for MSA, such as postural instability, low blood pressure on standing (orthostatic hypotension) and high blood pressure when lying down, urinary difficulties, impotence, constipation, speech and swallowing difficulties out of proportion to slowness and rigidity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of the present invention can be used in combination with one or more alternative medications for treating MSA. Typically, the drugs that can be used to treat various symptoms of MSA become less effective as the disease progresses. Levodopa and dopamine agonists used to treat PD are sometimes effective for the slowness and rigidity of MSA. Orthostatic hypertension can be improved with cortisone, midodrine, or other drugs that raise blood pressure. Male impotence may be treated with penile implants or drugs. Incontinence may be treated with medication or catheterization. Constipation may improve with increased dietary fiber or laxatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCognitive Impairment, Dementia, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes methods of treating cognitive impairment and dementia, wherein the methods comprise administering a compound of the invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a subject. Cognitive impairment and dementia are highly prevalent neurological conditions associated with any of a variety of diseases, disorders, and conditions. Dementia is commonly defined as a progressive decline in cognitive function due to damage or disease in the body beyond what is expected from normal aging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is proposed that one toxic effect of accumulated protein aggregates in the brain may be the development of cognitive impairment and/or dementia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating a cognitive impairment in a subject suffering therefrom, the method comprising administering to a subject a provided compound in a therapeutically effective amount. The cognitive impairment may be due to any of a variety of etiologies, including, but not limited to, atherosclerosis, stroke, cerebrovascular disease, vascular dementia, multi-infarct dementia, Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia, Lewy body disease, Pick's disease, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, Huntington's disease, AIDS and AIDS-related dementia, brain neoplasms, brain lesions, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Down's syndrome, Rett's syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, frontal lobe syndrome, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, post coronary artery by-pass graft surgery, cognitive impairment due to electroconvulsive shock therapy, cognitive impairment due to chemotherapy, cognitive impairment due to a history of drug abuse, attention deficit disorder (ADD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, dyslexia, depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, apathy, myasthenia gravis, cognitive impairment during waking hours due to sleep apnea, Tourette's syndrome, autoimmune vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyalgia rheumatica, hepatic conditions, metabolic diseases, Kufs' disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, storage diseases, infectious vasculitis, syphillis, neurosyphillis, Lyme disease, complications from intracerebral hemorrhage, hypothyroidism, B12 deficiency, folic acid deficiency, niacin deficiency, thiamine deficiency, hydrocephalus, complications post anoxia, prion disease (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), Fragile X syndrome, phenylketonuria, malnutrition, neurofibromatosis, maple syrup urine disease, hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, and hypoglycemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the cognitive impairment being treated is associated with DLBD. DLBD is the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia in older people, it effects 7% of the general population older than 65 years and 30% of those aged over 80 years. It is part of a range of clinical presentations that share a neurotic pathology based on normal aggregation of the synaptic protein α-synuclein. DLBD has many of the clinical and pathological characteristics of the dementia that occurs during the course of Parkinson's disease. A “one year rule” can been used to separate DLBD from PD. According to this rule, onset of dementia within 12 months of Parkinsonism qualifies as DLBD, whereas more than 12 months of Parkinsonism before onset of dementia qualifies as PD. The central features of DLBD include progressive cognitive decline of sufficient magnitude to interfere with normal social and occupational function. Prominent or persistent memory impairment does not necessarily occur in the early stages, but it is evident with progression in most cases. Deficits on tests of attention and of frontal cortical skills and visual spatial ability can be especially prominent. According to the present invention, the term “synucleinopathic subject” also encompasses a subject that is affected by, or is at risk of developing DLBD. These subjects can be readily identified by persons of ordinary skill in the art by symptomatic diagnosis or by genetic screening, brain scans, SPECT, PET imaging etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCore diagnostic features, two of which are essential for diagnosis of probable and one for possible DLBD are fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness, recurrent visual hallucinations that are typically well-formed and detailed, and spontaneous features of Parkinsonism. In addition, there can be some supportive features, such as repeated falls, syncope, transient loss of consciousness, neuroleptic sensitivity, systematized delusions, hallucinations and other modalities, REM sleep behavior disorder, and depression. Patients with DLBD do better than those with Alzheimer's Disease in tests of verbal memory, but worse on visual performance tests. This profile can be maintained across the range of severity of the disease, but can be harder to recognize in the later stages owing to global difficulties. DLBD typically presents with recurring episodes of confusion on a background of progressive deterioration. Patients with DLBD show a combination of cortical and subcortical neuropsychological impairments with substantial attention deficits and prominent frontal subcortical and visual spatial dysfunction. These help differentiate this disorder from Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRapid eye movement (REM), sleep behavior disorder is a parasomnia manifested by vivid and frightening dreams associated with simple or complex motor behavior during REM sleep. This disorder is frequently associated with the synucleinopathies, DLBD, PD, and MSA, but it rarely occurs in amyloidopathies and taupathies. The neuropsychological pattern of impairment in REM sleep behavior disorder/dementia is similar to that reported in DLBD and qualitatively different from that reported in Alzheimer's disease. Neuropathological studies of REM sleep behavior disorder associated with neurodegenerative disorder have shown Lewy body disease or multiple system atrophy. REM sleep wakefulness disassociations (REM sleep behavior disorder, daytime hypersomnolence, hallucinations, cataplexy) characteristic of narcolepsy can explain several features of DLBD, as well as PD. Sleep disorders could contribute to the fluctuations typical of DLBD, and their treatment can improve fluctuations and quality of life. Subjects at risk of developing DLBD can be identified. Repeated falls, syncope, transient loss of consciousness, and depression are common in older people with cognitive impairment and can serve as (a red flag) to a possible diagnosis of DLBD. By contrast, narcoleptic sensitivity in REM sleep behavior disorder can be highly predictive of DLBD. Their detection depends on the clinicians having a high index of suspicion and asking appropriate screening questions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClinical diagnosis of synucleinopathic subjects that are affected by or at risk of developing LBD can be supported by neuroimaging investigations. Changes associated with DLBD include preservation of hippocampal, and medialtemporal lobe volume on MRI and occipital hypoperfusion on SPECT. Other features, such as generalized atrophy, white matter changes, and rates of progression of whole brain atrophy are not helpful in differential diagnosis. Dopamine transporter loss in the caudate and putamen, a marker of nigrostriatal degeneration, can be detected by dopamenergic SPECT and can prove helpful in clinical differential diagnosis. A sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 100% has been reported for an abnormal scan with an autopsy diagnosis of DLBD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsensus criteria for diagnosing DLBD include ubiquitin immunohistochemistry for Lewy body identification and staging into three categories; brain stem predominant, limbic, or neocortical, depending on the numbers and distribution of Lewy bodies. The recently-developed α-synuclein immunohistochemistry can visualize more Lewy bodies and is also better at indicating previously under recognized neurotic pathology, termed Lewy neurites. Use of antibodies to α-synuclein moves the diagnostic rating for many DLBD cases from brain stem and limbic groups into the neocortical group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn most patients with DLBD, there are no genetic mutations in the α-synuclein or other Parkinson's disease-associated genes. Pathological up-regulation of normal, wild-type α-synuclein due to increased mRNA expression is a possible mechanism, or Lewy bodies may form because α-synuclein becomes insoluble or more able to aggregate. Another possibility is that α-synuclein is abnormally processed, for example, by a dysfunctional proteasome system and that toxic “proto fibrils” are therefore produced. Sequestering of these toxic fibrils into Lewy bodies could reflect an effort by the neurons to combat biological stress inside the cell, rather than their simply being neurodegenerative debris.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTarget symptoms for the accurate diagnosis of DLBD can include extrapyramidal motor features, cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric features (including hallucinations, depression, sleep disorder, and associated behavioral disturbances), or autonomic dysfunction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of the invention can be used in combination with one or more other medications for treating DLBD. For example, the lowest acceptable doses of levodopa can be used to treat DLBD. D2-receptor antagonists, particularly traditional neuroleptic agents, can provoke severe sensitivity reactions in DLBD subjects with an increase in mortality of two to three times. Cholinsterase inhibitors discussed above are also used in the treatment of DLBD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the cognitive impairment being treated is associated with Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the cognitive impairment is associated with a psychiatric disorder (e.g., schizophrenia).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the cognitive impairment being treated is associated with a genetic disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the cognitive impairment being treated is associated with an infectious disease (e.g., HIV, syphillis). In certain embodiments, the cognitive impairment is due to a proteinopathy. In certain embodiments, the proteinopathy is a neurodegenerative, proliferative, inflammatory, or cardiovascular disease, condition, or disorder. Exemplary proteinopathies include, for instance, α-synucleinopathy, amyloidopathy, and/or taupathies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods for treating a subject with cognitive impariment, including a step of administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a provided compound or composition thereof. In certain embodiments, the subject is a mammal. In certain specific embodiments, the subject is a human. The human may be male or female, and the human may be at any stage of development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides methods for treating a cognitive impairment in a subject suffering therefrom, the method comprising administering to a subject a provided compound in a therapeutically effective amount.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides methods for treating depression in a subject suffering therefrom, the method comprising administering to a subject a provided compound in a therapeutically effective amount.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides methods for treating anxiety in a subject suffering therefrom, the method comprising administering to a subject a provided compound in a therapeutically effective amount.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods for treating cognitive impairment, depression, and anxiety using a provided compound. In some embodiments, said compound is an inhibitor of farnesyl transferase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDementia is commonly defined as a progressive decline in cognitive function due to damage or disease in the body beyond what is expected from normal aging. Dementia is described as a loss of mental function, involving problems with memory, reasoning, attention, language, and problem solving. Higher level functions are typically affected first. Dementia interferes with a person's ability to function in normal daily life. The present invention includes a method of treating vascular dementia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepression\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods of treating depression, wherein the methods comprises administering a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a subject. Depression refers to a subject that is diagnosed with, affected by, or at risk of developing depression. Based on the treatment of a transgenic mouse overexpressing Tau with a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, reduced Tau transgene-induced depression was seen in the treated mice indicated by an increase in struggling and decreased floating in the forced swim test as compared to control animals. In addition, FTI-treated mice overexpressing TAU displayed behavior similar to non-transgenic animals. The treated mice also showed reduced phosphorylated TAU in the amygdala.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnxiety\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods of treating anxiety, wherein the method comprises administering a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a subject. Anxiety refers to a subject that is diagnosed with, affected by, or at risk of developing a state of apprehension and psychic tension occurring in some forms of mental disorder/s. The anxiety state may stem from a variety of causes. Based on mouse studies, farnesyl transferase inhibitors may be used as anxiolytics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInflammatory Disease\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides methods of treating inflammatory disease, wherein the method comprises administering a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The mammalian immune system provides a means for the recognition and elimination of foreign pathogens. While the immune system normally provides a line of defense against foreign pathogens, there are many instances where the immune response itself is involved in the progression of disease. Exemplary of diseases caused or worsened by the host's own immune response are autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, pulmonary fibrosis, and rheumatoid arthritis and diseases in which the immune response contributes to pathogenesis such as atherosclerosis, inflammatory diseases, osteomyelitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and graft versus host disease (GVHD) often resulting in organ transplant rejection. Additional exemplary inflammatory disease states include fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, sarcoidosis, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, inflammations of the skin (e.g., psoriasis), glomerulonephritis, proliferative retinopathy, restenosis, and chronic inflammations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, inflammatory diseases, disorders, and conditions may include one or more of inflammatory pelvic disease, urethritis, skin sunburn, sinusitis, pneumonitis, encephalitis, meningitis, myocarditis, nephritis, osteomyelitis, myositis, hepatitis, gastritis, enteritis, dermatitis, gingivitis, appendictitis, pancreatitis, cholocystitus, irrtiable bowel syndrome (IBD), ulcerative colitis, glomerulonephritis, dermatomyositis, scleroderma, vasculitis, allergic disorders including asthma such as bronchial, allergic, intrinsic, extrinsic and dust asthma, particularly chronic or inveterate asthma (e.g. late asthma airways hyper-responsiveness) and bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, including, without limitation, Coeliac disease, proctitis, eosinophilic gastro-enteritis, mastocytosis, pancreatitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, food-related allergies which have effects remote from the gut, e.g. migraine, rhinitis and eczema. Conditions characterised by inflammation of the nasal mucus membrane, including acute rhinitis, allergic, atrophic thinitis and chronic rhinitis including rhinitis caseosa, hypertrophic rhinitis, rhinitis purulenta, rhinitis sicca and rhinitis medicamentosa; membranous rhinitis including croupous, fibrinous and pseudomembranous rhinitis and scrofoulous rhinitis, seasonal rhinitis including rhinitis nervosa (hay fever) and vasomotor rhinitis, sarcoidosis, farmer's lung and related diseases, fibroid lung and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and adult respiratory distress syndrome, and/or acute inflammatory responses (such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and ischemia/reperfusion injury).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCardiovascular Disease\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides methods of treating cardiovascular disease, wherein the methods comprise administering a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a subject. Cardiovascular disease is the leading killer in America today. Over 50 million Americans have heart and cardiovascular related problems. By the time that cardiovascular heart problems are usually detected, the disease is usually quite advanced, having progressed for decades, and often too advanced to allow successful prevention of major permanent disability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, cardiovascular disease may be a disease which involves the heart and/or blood vessels, arteries, and occasionally veins. In some embodiments, the disease is a vascular disease. These problems are most commonly due to consequences of arterial disease, atherosclerosis, atheroma, but also can be related to infection, valvular and clotting problems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary particular cardiovascular diseases, disorders and conditions may include one or more of myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, vascular hyperplasia, cardiac hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, cardiomegaly, restenosis, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and/or angina pectoris.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the cardiovascular disease, disorder or condition is atherosclerosis, a coronary heart disease, an acute coronary symptom, unstable angina pectoris or acute myocardial infarction, stable angina pectoris, stroke, ischemic stroke, inflammation or autoimmune disease associated artheriosclerosis or restenosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTraumatic Brain Injury\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods of treating traumatic brain injury, wherein the methods comprise administering a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Traumatic brain injury (TBI, also called intracranial injury) occurs when an external force traumatically injures the brain. TBI can be classified based on severity, mechanism (closed or penetrating head injury), or other features (e.g. occurring in a specific location or over a widespread area). Head injury usually refers to TBI, but is a broader category because it can involve damage to structures other than the brain, such as the scalp and skull.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTBI is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, especially in children and young adults. Causes include falls, vehicle accidents, and violence. Brain trauma can be caused by a direct impact or by acceleration alone. In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, brain trauma causes secondary injury, a variety of events that take place in the minutes and days following the injury. These processes, which include alterations in cerebral blood flow and the pressure within the skull, contribute substantially to the damage from the initial injury.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe physical forces resulting in a TBI may cause their effects by inducing three types of injury: skull fracture, parenchymal injury, and vascular injury. Parenchymal injuries include concussion, direct parenchymal injury and diffuse axonal injury. Concussions are characterized as a clinical syndrome of alteration of consciousness secondary to head injury typically resulting from a change in the momentum of the head (movement of the head arrested against a ridged surface). The pathogenesis of sudden disruption of nervous activity is unknown, but the biochemical and physiological abnormalities that occur include, for example, depolarization due to excitatory amino acid-mediated ionic fluxes across cell membranes, depletion of mitochondria (adenosine triphosphate, and alteration in vascular permeability. Postconcussive syndrome may show evidence of direct parenchymal injury, but in some cases there is no evidence of damage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nContusion and lacerations are conditions in which direct parenchymal injury of the brain has occurred, either through transmission of kinetic energy to the brain and bruising analogous to what is seen in soft tissue (contusion) or by penetration of an object and tearing of tissue (laceration). A blow to the surface of the brain leads to rapid tissue displacement, disruption of vascular channels, and subsequent hemorrhage, tissue injury and edema. Morphological evidence of injury in the neuronal cell body includes pyknosis of nucleus, eosinophilia of the cytoplasm, and disintegration of the cell. Furthermore, axonal swelling can develop in the vicinity of damage neurons and also at great distances away from the site of impact. The inflammatory response to the injured tissue follows its usual course with neutrophiles preceding the appearance of macrophages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described herein, autophagy is a homeostatic process for recycling of proteins and organelles that increases during times of nutrient deprivation and is regulated by reactive oxygen species. Autophagy has been shown to be induced after traumatic brain injury in mice (Clark, R S, Autophagy, 2008 Jan. 1; 4(1):88-90). Zhang et al. has shown that autophagy was still increased in surviving cells at the injury site one month after traumatic brain injury (Zhang Y B, Neurosci Bull 2008, 24:143-149). Without wishing to be bound by theory, one hypothesis is that autophagy is activated upon injury to the brain and might protect neurons from degeneration after traumatic brain injury while cells undergoing necrotic or apoptotic death (and possibly involving autophagy in its detrimental role) would likely have disappeared. The timing of inhibition of autophagy—early or late after a traumatic brain injury may have different outcomes. In one aspect of the invention, autophagy is inhibited early after a traumatic brain injury e.g., within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48 hours after traumatic brain injury. In another aspect of the invention, autophagy is inhibited late after a traumatic brain injury e.g., after a month; after several days; after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 14, 21, 30 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of compound for the treatment of traumatic brain injury may be performed by many methods known in the art. The present invention comprises all forms of dose administration including, but not limited to, systemic injection, parenteral administration, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, transdermal, buccal, subcutaneous and intracerebroventricular administration. Alternatively, a compound of the invention may be administered directly into the brain or cerebrospinal fluid by any intracerebroventricular technique including, for example, lateral cerebro ventricular injection, lumbar puncture or a surgically inserted shunt into the cerebro ventricle of a patient. Methods of administering may be by dose or by control release vehicles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe treatment of a traumatic brain injury can be monitored by employing a variety of neurological measurements. For example, a partial therapeutic responses can be monitored by determining if, for example, there is an improvement in the subjects a) maximum daily Glasgow Coma Score; b) duration of coma; 3) daily intracranial pressure—therapeutic intensity levels; 4) extent of cerebral edema/mass effect measured on serial CT scans; and, 5) duration of ventilator support.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes a method of treating a traumatic brain injury, wherein the method comprises administering a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to a subject. In one aspect, the compound is administered in amount sufficient to improve mitochondrial health in said subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProliferative Disease\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides methods of treating proliferative disease, wherein the proliferative disease comprises administering a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a subject. In general, cell proliferative disorders, diseases or conditions encompass a variety of conditions characterized by aberrant cell growth, preferably abnormally increased cellular proliferation. For example, cell proliferative disorders, diseases, or conditions include, but are not limited to, cancer, immune-mediated responses and diseases (e.g., transplant rejection, graft vs host disease, immune reaction to gene therapy, autoimmune diseases, pathogen-induced immune dysregulation, etc.), certain circulatory diseases, and certain neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the invention relates to methods of treating cancer. In general, cancer is a group of diseases which are characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells.

Lysosomal Storage diseases are a group of disorders which are characterized by a defect in any aspect of lysosomal biology, which in turn prevents the degradation of lipids, proteins or organelles by the lysosome, or which prevents the proper trafficking of molecules into or out of the lysosome, or which prevents lysosome-mediated signalling. These diseases typically include neurological involvement which can be (though not always) progressive and degenerative; symptoms may include developmental delay, ataxia, visual problems, seizures etc. The lysosome, when healthy, processes unwanted material into substances that can be utilized by cells. Lysosomal storage diseases typically result when one or more of the enzymes involved in this processing is or becomes defective or absent. Defect or absence of such an enzyme results in accumulation of unwanted material in cells, eventually damaging the cells. Most lysosomal storage diseases are genetic diseases that show autosomal recessive inheritance; some (e.g., Fabry disease and Hunter syndrome) are X-linked.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative lysosomal storage diseases include, for example, Activator Deficiency/GM2 Gangliosidosis, Alpha-mannosidosis, Aspartylglucosaminuria, Cholesteryl ester storage disease, Chronic Hexosarnimidase A Deficiency, Cystinosis, Danon disease, Fabry disease, Farber disease, Fucosidosis, Galactosialidosis, Gaucher Disease (e.g., Type I, Type II, Type III), GM1 gangliosidosis (e.g., Infantile, Late infantile/Juvenile, Adult/Chronic), I-Cell disease/Mucolipidosis II, Infantile Free Sialic Acid Storage Disease/ISSD, Juvenile Hexosaminidase A Deficiency, Krabbe disease (e.g., Infantile Onset, Late Onset), Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, Mucopolysaccharidoses disorders, Pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy/Mucolipidosis IIIA (e.g., MPSI Hurler Syndrome, MPSI Scheie Syndrome, MPS I Hurler-Scheie Syndrome, MPS II Hunter syndrome, Sanfilippo syndrome Type A/MPS III A, Sanfilippo syndrome Type B/MPS III B, Sanfilippo syndrome Type C/MPS III C, Sanfilippo syndrome Type D/MPS III D, Morquio Type A/MPS IVA, Morquio Type B/MPS IVB, MPS IX Hyaluronidase Deficiency, MPS VI Maroteaux-Lamy, MPS VII Sly Syndrome, Mucolipidosis I/Sialidosis, Mucolipidosis IIIC, Mucolipidosis type IV), Multiple sulfatase deficiency, Niemann-Pick Disease (e.g., Type A, Type B, Type C), Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (e.g., CLN6 disease—Atypical Late Infantile, Late Onset variant, Early Juvenile, Batten-Spielmeyer-Vogt/Juvenile NCL/CLN3 disease, Finnish Variant Late Infantile CLN5, Jansky-Bielschowsky disease/Late infantile CLN2/TPP1 Disease, Kufs/Adult-onset NCL/CLN4 disease, Northern Epilepsy/variant late infantile CLN8, Santavuori-Haltia/Infantile CLN1/PPT disease, Beta-mannosidosis), Pompe disease/Glycogen storage disease type II, Pycnodysostosis, Sandhoff disease/GM2 Gangliosidosis (e.g., Adult Onset, Infantile, Juvenile), Schindler disease, Salla disease/Sialic Acid Storage Disease, Tay-Sachs/GM2 gangliosidosis, Wolman disease, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLysosomal Storage diseases can result from a number of defects, including a primary defect in a lysosomal enzyme's activity, eg as in Gaucher disease or Fabry disease, or a defect the post-translational processing of a lysosomal enzyme eg as in Mucosuphatidosis, or a defect in the trafficking of a lysosomal enzyme eg as in Mucolipidosis type IIIA, or a defect in a lysosomal protein that is not an enzyme eg as in Danon disease, or a defect in a non-lysosomal protein eg as in a variant of Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis. In Lysosomal Storage disorders, there is often an accumulation of certain lipids e.g. glucosylceramide or cholesterol, or of certain proteins eg subunit c of ATP synthase, or of certain damaged organelles or organelle fragments eg fragmented mitochondria. Drug-induced stimulation of a cellular phagic response may be of therapeutic benefit in Lysosomal Storage disorders; such phagic responses may include microautophagy, macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, mitophagy, and pexophagy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative lysosomal storage diseases include, for example, Activator Deficiency/GM2 Gangliosidosis, Alpha-mannosidosis, Aspartylglucosaminuria, beta-mannosidosis, carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome, Cholesteryl ester storage disease, Chronic Hexosaminidase A Deficiency, cobalamin definiciency type F, Cystinosis, Danon disease, Fabry disease, Farber disease, Fucosidosis, Galactosialidosis, Gaucher Disease (e.g., Type I, Type II, Type III), GM1 gangliosidosis (e.g., Infantile, Late infantile/Juvenile, Adult/Chronic), GM\n1 \ngangliosidosis, GM\n2 \ngangliosidosis, GM\n3 \ngangliosidosis, glycogen storage disease type II, I-Cell disease/Mucolipidosis II, Infantile Free Sialic Acid Storage Disease/ISSD, Juvenile Hexosaminidase A Deficiency, Kanzaki disease, Krabbe disease (e.g., Infantile Onset, Late Onset), lactosylceramidosis, Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, Mucopolysaccharidoses disorders, Pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy/Mucolipidosis IIIA (e.g., MPSI Hurler Syndrome, MPSI Scheie Syndrome, MPS I Hurler-Scheie Syndrome, MPS II Hunter syndrome, Sanfilippo syndrome Type A/MPS III A, Sanfilippo syndrome Type B/MPS III B, Sanfilippo syndrome Type C/MPS III C, Sanfilippo syndrome Type D/MPS III D, Morquio Type A/MPS IVA, Morquio Type B/MPS IVB, MPS IX Hyaluronidase Deficiency, MPS VI Maroteaux-Lamy, MPS VII Sly Syndrome, Mucolipidosis I/Sialidosis, Mucolipidosis IIIC, Mucolipidosis type IV), Multiple sulfatase deficiency, Niemann-Pick Disease (e.g., Type A, Type B, Type C), Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (e.g., CLN6 disease—Atypical Late Infantile, Late Onset variant, Early Juvenile, Batten-Spielmeyer-Vogt/Juvenile NCL/CLN3 disease, Finnish Variant Late Infantile CLN5, Jansky-Bielschowsky disease/Late infantile CLN2/TPP1 Disease, Kufs/Adult-onset NCL/CLN4 disease, Northern Epilepsy/variant late infantile CLN8, Santavuori-Haltia/Infantile CLN1/PPT disease, Beta-mannosidosis), Pompe disease/Glycogen storage disease type II, Pompe disease, Pycnodysostosis, Sandhoff disease/GM2 Gangliosidosis (e.g., Adult Onset, Infantile, Juvenile), Schindler disease, Salla disease/Sialic Acid Storage Disease, sialic acid storage disease, sialidosis, Tay-Sachs/GM2 gangliosidosis, or Wolman disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMyopathy\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides methods of treating myopathy, wherein the methods comprise administering a compound or the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a subject. The term autophagy is derived from the Greek words “autos” and “phago” meaning “self eating”. Autophagy takes place in the lysosomes and it refers to a process of metabolic degradation of cellular components and expulsion of the by-products to the cytoplasm. Autophagy takes place at basal levels in all eukaryotic cells turning over long-lived macromolecules and large supramolecular structures including whole organelles to rejuvenant their function. In addition, autophagy can be upregulated during metabolic, genotoxic or hypoxic stress conditions and acts as an adaptive mechanism essential for cell survival. Regulation and modulation of autophagy has recently attracted attention as this process has been implicated in diseases and disorders that may be considered a proteinopathy including: aging, cancer, infection, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, muscular disorders (myopathies), diabetes mellitus, obesity, and others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe three muscle types found in mammals, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and smooth muscle, together make up the major sites of metabolic activity. Skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in the human body and the major reservoir of protein as a source of amino acids to be utilized as energy by various other organs during catabolic periods. Protein degradation in muscle tissue is controlled by two major proteolytic systems: the ubiquitin proteosome and the autophagy lysosome. Both of these degradation pathways are activated during catabolic disease states, for example cancer, AIDS, diabetes, and organ failure and may contribute to muscular atrophy, both muscle loss and weakness. The role of autophagy in regulating muscle mass is clear, but the exact mechanism/s is/are yet to be revealed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDysfunctional autophagy has been linked to several different muscle disorders, or generally described as myopathies. For example, it is believed that the pathology observed in muscle disorders such as Danons disease and Pompes disease is at least partly a result of impaired autophagosome fusion with lysosomes thereby inhibiting lysosome dependent degradation. Another example is inclusion body myopathy Paget's frontotemporal lobe dementia (IBMPFD), which is characterized by mutations in p97/VCP gene. Patients with IBMPFD have degenerating muscle fibres, rimmed vacuoles, and sarcoplasmic inclusions containing ubiquitin and TDP-43. In addition, IBMPFD muscle accumulates autophagosome-associated proteins such as LC3 and p62.90% of these patients win develop disabling weakness by the fourth to fifth decade. Autophagy has also been recently shown to be required to maintain muscle mass. Genetic deletion of autophagic genes in muscle of mice resulted in profound muscle atrophy and age-dependent decrease in force. As used herein, the term “myopathy” refers to a disease, disorder, and/or condition of skeletal muscle that is not caused by nerve disorders. Myopathies cause the skeletal or voluntary muscles to become weak or shrunken (atrophied).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAutophagic vacuolar myopathies can be considered a group of diseases that could be classified in either lysosomal storage disease or neuromuscular disorders. Autophagic vacuolar myopathies are characterized by the abnormal accumulation of lysosomes in muscle fibers resulting in clinical signs and symptoms of myopathy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAutophagic mediated myopathy includes myopathies associated with rimmed vacuoles. Rimmed vacuoles are aggregates of autophagosomes found predominantly in atrophic muscle fibers. The aggregates may contain amyloid and cathepsins as well as other proteins. Rimmed vacuole myopathy includes: Nonake myopathy or distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DRMV), inclusion body myopathy 2 (IBM2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSkeletal Muscle Myopathy\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMyopathies, generally, refer to a class of degenerative skeletal muscle disease that is not caused by nerve dysfunction. Myopathies cause progressive weakness and wasting away of skeletal muscles. The causes, symptoms and severity of myopathies vary. Etiologically, myopathy includes neurogenic muscular disease, hereditary forms, an inflammatory response, the result of an endocrine or metabolic disorder, drug or toxin induced, and infection induced. The different types of myopathies are classified according to their causes. Symptoms common among myopathies include weakness of the voluntary muscles of the arms, legs, and trunk, drooping upper eyelids, foot drop, facial weakness and lack of reflexes in the affected muscles. Some symptoms may be transitory. There is no effective cure or treatment for myopathies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDue to the varying forms and causes of myopathies, determining the form of myopathy the individual patient has is crucial in providing the proper treatment. Diagnosis includes a thorough physical examination, measurement of potassium in the blood, muscle biopsies and an electromyogram (EMG). In genetically based Myopathies, the affected families are strongly advised to consult a genetic counselor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenetic myopathies include central core disease, centronuclear (myotubular) myopathy, myotonia congenita, nemaline myopathy, paramyotonia congenita, periodic paralysis and mitochondrial myopathies. Danon disease is a rare genetic condition causing muscle weakness (muscular dystrophy), heart disease (cardiomyopathy), and mental retardation (or learning problems). Infantile onset autophagic vacuolar myopathy (MAVIO) has been reported in infants abnormal muscle glycogen storage and severe cardiomyopathy. Genetic myopathies vary by symptoms, severity and genetic mutation. Both dominant and recessive modes of inheritance are also present. Certain forms of centronuclear myopathy, also known as myotubular myopathy, have been found to be X-linked and primarily affects males.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeurogenic muscle disease includes neurogenic atrophy due to peripheral nerve pathology and spinal muscular atrophies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMyopathy includes disorders of neuromuscular transmission and include non-paraneoplastic neuromuscular disease including myasthenia gravis and paraneoplastic neuromuscular disease including stiff-man syndrome, other paraneoplastic neuromuscular disorders and some forms of myasthenia gravis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMyopathies include channelopathies and defects in ion transportation. For example, channelopathies and defects on ion transportation include inherited conditions including: hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (sodium channel), hypokalemic periodic paralysis (uncommon) (calcium channel, dihydropyridine receptor), paramyotonica congenita (sodium channel)-pure type, potassium sensitive type, myotonia congenita (including potassium sensitive type (autosomal dominant, sodium channel), Becker's generalized type (autosomal recessive, chloride channel), Thomsen's type (autosomal dominant, chloride channel), Schwartz-Jampel syndrome), malignant hyperthermia (ryanodine receptor), and myotonic dystrophy (protein kinase of sodium channel). Sporadic channelopathies and defects in ion transportation include Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDystrophies (or muscular dystrophies) are a subgroup of myopathies characterized by muscle degeneration and regeneration. Clinically, muscular dystrophies are typically progressive, because the muscles' ability to regenerate is eventually lost, leading to progressive weakness, often leading to use of a wheelchair, and eventually death, usually related to respiratory weakness. Examples of dystrophies include: myotonia and neuromyotonia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe congenital myopathies do not show evidence for either a progressive dystrophic process (i.e., muscle death) or inflammation, but instead characteristic microscopic changes are seen in association with reduced contractile ability of the muscles\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther examples of specific myopathies include: myotonic dystrophy (congenital type), minimal change myopathy (non-specific congenital myopathies), central core disease, multicore (minicore) myopathy, nemaline myopathy, congenital fiber type disproportion myopathy, myotubular myopathy (centronuclear myopathy), integrin-alpha-7/beta-1 deficiency muscular dystrophy, zebra-body myopathy, hyaline body myopathy, fingerprint body myopathy, reducing body myopathy, cytoplasmic body (spheroid body) myopathy, sarcotubular myopathy, trilaminar myopathy, specific type 1 hypertrophy, cylindrical spiral myopathy, uniform type 1 fibers myopathy, vacuolar myopathy with excessive autophagic vacuoles myopathy, X-linked vacuolar myopathy with cardiomyopathy and mental retardation, mixed myopathy, and familial periodic paralysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscular dystrophies (dystrophic myopathy) can be categorized as congenital (neonatal onset) and non-congenital (non-neonatal onset). Congenital (neonatal onset) muscular dystrophy includes congenital muscular dystrophy-merosin deficient type, congenital muscular dystrophy-merosin-positive type, congenital muscular dystrophy-non-specific, facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (Landouzy-Déjerine Dystrophy), Walker-Warberg syndrome, muscle-eye-brain disease of Santavuori, Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome, Bethlehem dystrophy, Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. Non-congenital (non-neonatal onset) muscular dystrophies include: Duchene muscular dystrophy, Becker's muscular dystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (Landouzy-Dejerine) and facio-scapulo-humeral syndromes, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, distal muscular dystrophies, late adult type 1 (Welander)-Autosomal dominant, late adult type 2 (Marksberry)-Autosomal dominant, early adult type 1 (Nonaka)-Autosomal recessive, early adult type 2 (Miyoshi)-Autosomal recessive, and ocular muscular dystrophy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRhabdomyolysis and myoglobinurias may result in myopathy. Rhabdomyolysis/necrotizing myopathy includes idiopathic recurrent myoglobinuria and hyperthermic conditions such as malignant hyperthermia and exertional heat strokes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMyopathy may be non-drug/toxin induced, drug induced, or the result of intoxication or poisoning. For example, non-drug or toxin induced myopathy includes crush injury and torture, ischemia, physical exhaustion and overexertion, subacute riecrotizing carcinomatous myopathy. Drug induced myopathy includes high-dose corticosteroids, clofibrate, gemfibrozil, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, statin therapy, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, mevacor, and/or zidovudine (AZT). Intoxication and poisoning may induce myopathy and includes: acute alcoholic rhabdomyolysis (acute alcoholic myopathy), chronic alcoholic myopathy, colchicines associated vacuolar myopathy, cocaine, mushroom poisoning (amanita phalloides), snake venoms, vitamin E intoxication, and organophosphates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolic myopathies result from defects in biochemical metabolism that primarily affect muscle. Metabolic myopathy includes for example, hypokalemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, nonketotic hyperglycemic/hyperosmolar states, hypo-/hypernatremia, hypophosphatemia, hythyroidism, near drowning, renal tubular acidosis, pancreatitis, and Crohn's disease with elemental diet.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMyopathy may be the result of an infection for example: \nlegionella\n, streptococci, influenza A and B, HIV among others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPredisposing conditions that may lead to a myopathy include Duchenne's muscular distrophy, mitochondrial myopathy, and McArdle's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInflammatory myopathies are caused by problems with the immune system attacking components of the muscle, leading to signs of inflammation in the muscle. Inflammatory myopathy includes primary inflammatory myopathies (the inflammation is primarily against fibers) and includes polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis, localized nodular myositis (focal myositis), myositis ossificans (familial cardioneuromyopathy with hyaline masses and nemaline masses and congenital myopathy with excess of thin myofilaments), myositis associated with connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, mixed connective tissue disease, eosinophilic polymyositis, benign acute childhood myositis (BACM), (myalgia cruris epidemica). Secondary inflammatory myopathy (the inflammation is primarily not against fibers) includes non-granulomatous infection, granulomatous infection, vasculitis, and polymyositis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInfection of the muscle may lead to myopathy and includes virus infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection, and parasitic infections including: trichinosis, cysticerosis, toxoplasmosis, sarcosporidiosis, and microsporidiosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisorders of lipid metabolism may lead to myopathy and includes: carnitine deficiency, primary muscle carnitine deficiency, and deficits in carnitine-palmitoyl transferase activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLysosomal storage disease may lead to myopathy and includes acid maltase deficiency myopathies (glycogen storage disease type II), Batten's disease, Fabry's disease, fucosidosis, mannosidosis, and Samdhoff's disease. Non-glycogen non-lysosomal storage disease may lead to myopathy and includes Lafora's disease. Glycogen storage disease (GSD) may lead to myopathy and includes acid maltase deficiency (Pompe's disease or GSD type II), debranching enzyme deficiency (Cori's disease, Forbe's disease or GSD type III), branching enzyme deficiency (GSD type IV), myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle's disease or GSD type V), phosphofructokinase deficiency (Tarui's disease or GSD type VII), phosphorylase b kinase deficiency (GSD type VIII), phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency (GSD type IX), phosphogylcerate mutase deficiency (GSD type X), lactate dehydrogenase deficiency (GSD type XI), and myoadenylate (AMPD) deaminase deficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMyopathy due to systemic disorders includes polymyalgia rheumatic, and carcinoma associated muscle disease (cachetic atrophy, chronic carcinomatosis myopathy, subacute necrotizing carcinomatous myopathy, and dermatomyositis associated with carcinoma).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMyopathy due to endocrine disorders includes hyper- and hypothryodism, parathyroid diseases, pituitaty disorders, Cushing's syndrome, and carcinoid myopathy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMitochondrial myopathies are due to defects in mitochondria, which provide a critical source of energy for muscle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSkeletal muscle atrophy can also be categorized as a myopathy. Muscle atrophy is the decrease in the mass of muscle. The loss of muscle mass can be partial or complete and includes: disuse atrophy (a cast placed on a finger, toe or limb; or extended bed rest); sarcopenia; frailty syndrome; cachexia; Dejerine Sottas syndrome, and age-associated weakness. Muscular atrophy can also be a co-morbidity with a primary disease, for example cancer, HIV-AIDS, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, severe burns, cachexia, and liver failure. Others include: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, injury, long-term corticosteroid therapy, motor neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, muscular dystrophy, osteoarthritis, polio, rheumatoid arthritis, spinal cord injury, starvation, and cerebrovascular incident (e.g. stroke).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCardiomyopathy\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCardiomyopathy, heart muscle disease, is the deterioration of the function of the myocardium. Indiviuduals diagnosed with cardiomyopathy are often at risk for arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death or both. Broadly, cardiomyopathy can be categorized into extrinsic and ischemic disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExtrinsic cardiomyopathy are cardiomyopathies where the primary pathology is outside the myocardium itself. Extrinsic cardiomyopathy includes: congenital heart disease, nutritional diseases, ischemic (or non-ischaemic) cardiomyopathy, hypertensive cardiomyopathy, valvular cardiomyopathy, inflammatory cardiomyopathy, cardiomyopathy secondary to a systemic metabolic disease, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. In some parts of the world, endemic disease can be an extrinsic cause of cardiomyopathy, for example, Chagas disease, which is a prevalent cause of cardiomyopathy in Central and South America.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIschemic cardiomyopathy, generally refers to myocardial ischemia and infarction. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is a weakness in the muscle of the heart due to inadequate oxygen delivery to the myocardium with coronary artery disease being the most common cause. Anemia and sleep apnea are relatively common conditions that can contribute to ischemic myocardium and hyperthyroidism can cause a ‘relative’ ischemia secondary to high output heart failure. Individuals with ischemic cardiomyopathy typically have a history of myocardial infarction, although longstanding ischemia can cause enough damage to the myocardium to precipitate a clinically significant cardiomyopathy even in the absence of myocardial infarction. In a typical presentation, the area of the heart affected by a myocardial infarction will initially become necrotic as it dies, and will then be replaced by myocardial scarring (fibrosis). This fibrotic tissue is akinetic and cannot contribute to the heart's function as a pump. If the akinetic region of the heart is substantial enough, the affected side of the heart will go into failure, and this failure is the functional result of an ischemic cardiomyopathy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn intrinsic cardiomyopathy is weakness in the muscle of the heart that is not due to an identifiable external cause. To make a diagnosis of an intrinsic cardiomyopathy, significant coronary artery disease should be ruled out. The term intrinsic cardiomyopathy does not describe the specific etiology of weakened heart muscle. The intrinsic cardiomyopathies consist of a variety of disease states, each with their own causes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntrinsic cardiomyopathy has a number of causes including drug and alcohol toxicity, certain infections (including Hepatitis C), and various genetic and idiopathic (i.e., unknown) causes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntrinsic cardiomyopathies include dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), perpartum cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), obliterative card iomyopathy (hypereosinophilic syndrome), and noncompaction cardiomyopathy. Many diseases can result in cardiomyopathy. These include diseases such as hemochromatosis, amyloidosis, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, lysosomal storage diseases and the muscular dystrophies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSmooth Muscle Myopathy\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSmooth muscle is an involuntary non-striated muscle, found within the tunica media layer of large and small arteries and veins, the bladder, uterus, male and female reproductive tracts, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, arrector pili of skin, the ciliary muscle, and iris of the eye. The glomeruli of the kidneys contain a smooth muscle-like cell called the mesangial cell. Smooth muscle is fundamentally different from skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle in terms of structure, function, excitation-contraction coupling, and mechanism of contraction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) can be a symptom of an auto-immune disorder, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, or lupus and may lead to smooth muscle myopathy. Vascular smooth muscle tumors include intravascular leiomyomatosis, angioleiomyoma, vascular leiomyosarcomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSmooth muscle myopathy includes mitochondrial-neuro-gastro-intestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) (or pseudo-obstruction-leukoencephalopathy-intestinal-pseudoobstruction syndrome (POLIP), lipofuscinosis of the gastrointestinal tract (brown bowel syndrome).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabetes/Obesity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides methods of treating diabetetes or obesity, wherein the methods comprise administering a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a subject. Autophagy is essential for maintaining both survival and health of cells. Autophagy is normally suppressed by amino acids and insulin. Autophagy activity and expression of some key autophagy genes were suppressed in the presence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, two possible symptoms of diabetes. Insulin-mediated suppression of autophagy appears to involve FoxO1-mediated transcription of key autophagy genes. Accordingly, stimulation of autophagy is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA recent study has shown that disruption of the process that controls the amount of fat that cells store for use as a back-up energy source is a key factor in age-related metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (Cuervo et al., “Autophagy regulates lipid metabolism” published in the Apr. 1, 2009 online version of Nature).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll cells store lipids, a type of fat, in the form of small droplets that can be broken down for energy when needed. In situations of excessive food intake or in certain diseases such as diabetes or obesity, these lipid droplets become so large that they interfere with normal cell function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis study showed that the amount of fat stored in these intracellular lipid droplets was controlled through autophagy. Specifically, the lysosomes continuously removed portions of lipid droplets and processed them for energy production. When food is scarce, autophagy becomes a main source of energy for the cells and this process of digesting lipid droplets is accelerated. If autophagy slows down, as occurs in aging, the lipid droplets stored in cells keep growing and eventually become so big that they can no longer be degraded. This slowdown in fat control appears to trigger a vicious cycle in which the enlarging fat droplets impair autophagy, allowing even more fat to accumulate, and so on, which could eventually contribute to diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Thus, therapies aimed at helping autophagy operate more efficiently might prevent disease by keeping fat droplets under control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabetes\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral pathogenic processes are involved in the development of diabetes. These range from autoimmune destruction of the β-cells of the pancreas with consequent insulin deficiency to abnormalities that result in resistance to insulin action. The basis of the abnormalities in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism in diabetes is deficient action of insulin on target tissues. Deficient insulin action results from inadequate insulin secretion and/or diminished tissue responses to insulin at one or more points in the complex pathways of hormone action. Impairment of insulin secretion and defects in insulin action frequently coexist in the same patient, and it is often unclear which abnormality, if either alone, is the primary cause of the hyperglycemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSymptoms of marked hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, sometimes with polyphagia, and blurred vision. Impairment of growth and susceptibility to certain infections may also accompany chronic hyperglycemia. Acute, life-threatening consequences of uncontrolled diabetes are hyperglycemia with ketoacidosis or the nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLong-term complications of diabetes include retinopathy with potential loss of vision; nephropathy leading to renal failure; peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot ulcers, amputations, and Charcot joints; and autonomic neuropathy causing gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cardiovascular symptoms and sexual dysfunction. Patients with diabetes have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular, peripheral arterial, and cerebrovascular disease. Hypertension and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism are often found in indiviudals with diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe vast majority of cases of diabetes fall into two broad etiopathogenetic categories. In one category, type 1 diabetes, the cause is an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion. Individuals at increased risk of developing this type of diabetes can often be identified by serological evidence of an autoimmune pathologic process occurring in the pancreatic islets and by genetic markers. In the other, much more prevalent category, type 2 diabetes, the cause is a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. In the latter category, a degree of hyperglycemia sufficient to cause pathologic and functional changes in various target tissues, but without clinical symptoms, may be present for a long period of time before diabetes is detected. During this asymptomatic period, it is possible to demonstrate an abnormality in carbohydrate metabolism by measurement of plasma glucose in the fasting state or after a challenge with an oral glucose load.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe degree of hyperglycemia (if any) may change over time, depending on the extent of the underlying disease process. A disease process may be present but may not have progressed far enough to cause hyperglycemia. The same disease process can cause impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) without fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes. In some individuals with diabetes, adequate glycemic control can be achieved with weight reduction, exercise, and/or oral glucose-lowering agents. These individuals therefore do not require insulin. Other individuals who have some residual insulin secretion but require exogenous insulin for adequate glycemic control can survive without it. Individuals with extensive β-cell destruction and therefore no residual insulin secretion require insulin for survival. The severity of the metabolic abnormality can progress, regress, or stay the same. Thus, the degree of hyperglycemia reflects the severity of the underlying metabolic process and its treatment more than the nature of the process itself.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssigning a type of diabetes to an individual often depends on the circumstances present at the time of diagnosis, and many diabetic individuals do not easily fit into a single class. For example, a person with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) may continue to be hyperglycemic after delivery and may be determined to have, in fact, type 2 diabetes. Alternatively, a person who acquires diabetes because of large doses of exogenous steroids may become normoglycemic once the glucocorticoids are discontinued, but then may develop diabetes many years later after recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. Another example would be a person treated with thiazides who develops diabetes years later. Because thiazides in themselves seldom cause severe hyperglycemia, such individuals probably have type 2 diabetes that is exacerbated by the drug. Thus, for the clinician and patient, it is less important to label the particular type of diabetes than it is to understand the pathogenesis of the hyperglycemia and to treat it effectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmune-mediated diabetes is a form of diabetes, which accounts for only 5-10% of those with diabetes, previously encompassed by the terms insulin-dependent diabetes, type I diabetes, or juvenile-onset diabetes, results from a cellular-mediated autoimmune destruction of the β-cells of the pancreas. Markers of the immune destruction of the β-cell include islet cell autoantibodies, autoantibodies to insulin, autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), and autoantibodies to the tyrosine phosphatases IA-2 and IA-2β. One and usually more of these autoantibodies are present in 85-90% of individuals when fasting hyperglycemia is initially detected. Also, the disease has strong HLA associations, with linkage to the DQA and DQB genes, and it is influenced by the DRB genes. These HLA-DR/DQ alleles can be either predisposing or protective.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this form of diabetes, the rate of β-cell destruction is quite variable, being rapid in some individuals (mainly infants and children) and slow in others (mainly adults). Some patients, particularly children and adolescents, may present ketoacidosis as the first manifestation of the disease. Others have modest fasting hyperglycemia that can rapidly change to severe hyperglycemia and/or ketoacidosis in the presence of infection or other stress. Still others, particularly adults, may retain residual β-cell function sufficient to prevent ketoacidosis for many years; such individuals eventually become dependent on insulin for survival and are at risk for ketoacidosis. At this latter stage of the disease, there is little or no insulin secretion, as manifested by low or undetectable levels of plasma C-peptide. Immune-mediated diabetes commonly occurs in childhood and adolescence, but it can occur at any age, even in the 8th and 9th decades of life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAutoimmune destruction of β-cells has multiple genetic predispositions and is also related to environmental factors that are still poorly defined. Although patients are rarely obese when they present with this type of diabetes, the presence of obesity is not incompatible with the diagnosis. These patients are also prone to other autoimmune disorders such as Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Addison's disease, vitiligo, celiac sprue, autoimmune hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, and pernicious anemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome forms of type 1 diabetes have no known etiologies (idiopathic diabetes). Some of these patients have permanent insulinopenia and are prone to ketoacidosis, but have no evidence of autoimmunity. Although only a minority of patients with type 1 diabetes fall into this category, of those who do, most are of African or Asian ancestry. Individuals with this form of diabetes suffer from episodic ketoacidosis and exhibit varying degrees of insulin deficiency between episodes. This form of diabetes is strongly inherited, lacks immunological evidence for β-cell autoimmunity, and is not HLA associated. An absolute requirement for insulin replacement therapy in affected patients may not be consistent over the course of the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nType 2 diabetes (ranging from predominantly insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency to predominantly an insulin secretory defect with insulin resistance). This form of diabetes, which accounts for about 90-95% of those with diabetes, previously referred to as non-insulin-dependent diabetes, type II diabetes, or adult-onset diabetes, encompasses individuals who have insulin resistance and usually have relative (rather than absolute) insulin deficiency, at least initially, and often throughout their lifetime, these individuals do not need insulin treatment to survive. There are probably many different causes of this form of diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the specific etiologies are not known, autoimmune destruction of β-cells does not occur, and patients do not have any of the other causes of diabetes listed above or below. Most patients with this form of diabetes are obese, and obesity itself causes some degree of insulin resistance. Patients who are not obese by traditional weight criteria may have an increased percentage of body fat distributed predominantly in the abdominal region. Ketoacidosis seldom occurs spontaneously in this type of diabetes; when seen, it usually arises in association with the stress of another illness such as infection. This form of diabetes frequently goes undiagnosed for many years because the hyperglycemia develops gradually and at earlier stages is often not severe enough for the patient to notice any of the classic symptoms of diabetes. Nevertheless, such patients are at increased risk of developing macrovascular and microvascular complications. Whereas patients with this form of diabetes may have insulin levels that appear normal or elevated, the higher blood glucose levels in these diabetic patients would be expected to result in even higher insulin values had their β-cell function been normal. Thus, insulin secretion is defective in these patients and insufficient to compensate for insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may improve with weight reduction and/or pharmacological treatment of hyperglycemia, but is seldom restored to normal. The risk of developing this form of diabetes increases with age, obesity (see below), and lack of physical activity. It occurs more frequently in women with prior GDM and in individuals with hypertension or dyslipidemia, and its frequency varies in different racial/ethnic subgroups. It is often associated with a strong genetic predisposition, more so than is the autoimmune form of type 1 diabetes. However, the genetics of this form of diabetes are complex and not clearly defined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral forms of diabetes are associated with monogenetic defects in β-cell function (genetic forms of the β-cell). These forms of diabetes are frequently characterized by onset of hyperglycemia at an early age (generally before age 25 years). They are referred to as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and are characterized by impaired insulin secretion with minimal or no defects in insulin action. They are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Abnormalities at six genetic loci on different chromosomes have been identified to date. The most common form is associated with mutations on chromosome 12 in a hepatic transcription factor referred to as hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1α. A second form is associated with mutations in the glucokinase gene on chromosome 7p and results in a defective glucokinase molecule. Glucokinase converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, the metabolism of which, in turn, stimulates insulin secretion by the β-cell. Thus, glucokinase serves as the “glucose sensor” for the β-cell. Because of defects in the glucokinase gene, increased plasma levels of glucose are necessary to elicit normal levels of insulin secretion. The less common forms result from mutations in other transcription factors, including HNF-4α, HNF-1β, insulin promoter factor (IPF)-1, and NeuroD1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPoint mutations in mitochondrial DNA have been found to be associated with diabetes mellitus and deafness. The most common mutation occurs at position 3243 in the tRNA leucine gene, leading to an A-to-G transition. An identical lesion occurs in the MELAS syndrome (mitochondria myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like syndrome); however, diabetes is not part of this syndrome, suggesting different phenotypic expressions of this genetic lesion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenetic abnormalities that result in the inability to convert proinsulin to insulin have been identified in a few families, and such traits are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The resultant glucose intolerance is mild. Similarly, the production of mutant insulin molecules with resultant impaired receptor binding has also been identified in a few families and is associated with an autosomal inheritance and only mildly impaired or even normal glucose metabolism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are unusual causes of diabetes that result from genetically determined abnormalities of insulin action (genetic defects in insulin action). The metabolic abnormalities associated with mutations of the insulin receptor may range from hyperinsulinemia and modest hyperglycemia to severe diabetes. Some individuals with these mutations may have acanthosis nigricans. Women may be virilized and have enlarged, cystic ovaries. In the past, this syndrome was termed type A insulin resistance. Leprechaunism and the Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome are two pediatric syndromes that have mutations in the insulin receptor gene with subsequent alterations in insulin receptor function and extreme insulin resistance. The former has characteristic facial features and is usually fatal in infancy, while the latter is associated with abnormalities of teeth and nails and pineal gland hyperplasia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlterations in the structure and function of the insulin receptor cannot be demonstrated in patients with insulin-resistant lipoatrophic diabetes. Therefore, it is assumed that the lesion(s) must reside in the postreceptor signal transduction pathways.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny process that diffusely injures the pancreas can cause diabetes (diseases of the exocrine pancreas). Acquired processes include pancreatitis, trauma, infection, pancreatectomy, and pancreatic carcinoma. With the exception of that caused by cancer, damage to the pancreas must be extensive for diabetes to occur; adrenocarcinomas that involve only a small portion of the pancreas have been associated with diabetes. This implies a mechanism other than simple reduction in β-cell mass. If extensive enough, cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis will also damage β-cells and impair insulin secretion. Fibrocalculous pancreatopathy may be accompanied by abdominal pain radiating to the back and pancreatic calcifications identified on X-ray examination. Pancreatic fibrosis and calcium stones in the exocrine ducts have been found at autopsy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral hormones (e.g., growth hormone, cortisol, glucagon, epinephrine) antagonize insulin action (endocrinopathies). Excess amounts of these hormones (e.g., acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, glucagonoma, pheochromocytoma, respectively) can cause diabetes. This generally occurs in individuals with preexisting defects in insulin secretion, and hyperglycemia typically resolves when the hormone excess is resolved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSomatostatinoma- and aldosteronoma-induced hypokalemia can cause diabetes, at least in part, by inhibiting insulin secretion. Hyperglycemia generally resolves after successful removal of the tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany drugs can impair insulin secretion (drug- or chemical-induced diabetes) These drugs may not cause diabetes by themselves, but they may precipitate diabetes in individuals with insulin resistance. In such cases, the classification is unclear because the sequence or relative importance of β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance is unknown. Certain toxins such as Vacor (a rat poison) and intravenous pentamidine can permanently destroy pancreatic β-cells. Such drug reactions fortunately are rare. There are also many drugs and hormones that can impair insulin action. Examples include nicotinic acid and glucocorticoids. Patients receiving α-interferon have been reported to develop diabetes as with islet cell antibodies and, in certain instances, severe insulin deficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain viruses have been associated with β-cell destruction. Diabetes occurs in patients with congenital rubella, although most of these patients have HLA and immune markers characteristic of type 1 diabetes. In addition, coxsackievirus B, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, and mumps have been implicated in inducing certain cases of the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the category of uncommon forms of immune-mediated diabetes, there are two known conditions, and others are likely to occur. The stiff-man syndrome is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system characterized by stiffness of the axial muscles with painful spasms. Patients usually have high titers of the GAD autoantibodies, and approximately one-third will develop diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-insulin receptor antibodies can cause diabetes by binding to the insulin receptor, thereby blocking the binding of insulin to its receptor in target tissues. However, in some cases, these antibodies can act as an insulin agonist after binding to the receptor and can thereby cause hypoglycemia. Anti-insulin receptor antibodies are occasionally found in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases. As in other states of extreme insulin resistance, patients with anti-insulin receptor antibodies often have acanthosis nigricans. In the past, this syndrome was termed type B insulin resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany other genetic syndromes are accompanied by an increased incidence of diabetes mellitus. These include the chromosomal abnormalities of Down's syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome, and Turner's syndrome. Wolfram's syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by insulin-deficient diabetes and the absence of β-cells at autopsy. Additional manifestations include diabetes insipidus, hypogonadism, optic atrophy, and neural deafness.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. The definition applies regardless of whether insulin or only diet modification is used for treatment or whether the condition persists after pregnancy. It does not exclude the possibility that unrecognized glucose intolerance may have antedated or begun concomitantly with the pregnancy. GDM complicates about 4% of all pregnancies in the U.S., resulting in about 135,000 cases annually. The prevalence may range from 1 to 14% of pregnancies, depending on the population studied. GDM represents nearly 90% of all pregnancies complicated by diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDeterioration of glucose tolerance occurs normally during pregnancy, particularly in the 3rd trimester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment of diabetes includes insulin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, biguanides, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors. Some common medications include Actos, Avandamet, avandaryl, avandia, byetta, cozaar, diabeta, diabinase, glucophage, glucotrol, glucovance, glynase, insulin, januvia, lantus, metaglip, micronase, orinase, prandin, precise, riomet, starlix, tolinase, xenical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObesity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObesity is the state of being well above one's normal weight. A person has been considered to be obese if they are more than 20 percent over their ideal weight. That ideal weight must take into account the person's height, age, sex, and build. Obesity has been more precisely defined by the National Institutes of Health (the NIH) as a BMI of 30 and above (a BMI of 30 is about 30 pounds overweight). The BMI (body mass index), a key index for relating body weight to height, is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by their height in meters (m) squared. Since the BMI describes the body weight relative to height, it correlates strongly (in adults) with the total body fat content. Some very muscular people may have a high BMI without undue health risks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObesity is often a multifactorial condition, based on both genetic and behavioral factors. Accordingly, treatment of obesity usually requires more than just dietary changes. Exercise, counseling and support, and sometimes medication can supplement diet to help patients conquer weight problems. Extreme diets, on the other hand, can actually contribute to increased obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverweight is a significant contributor to health problems. It increases the risk of developing a number of diseases including: type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes, hypertension, stroke (cerebrovascular accident or CVA), myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cancer (certain forms such as prostate cancer and cancer of the colon and rectum), gallstones and gall bladder disease (cholecystitis), gout and gouty arthritis, osteoarthritis of the knees, hips, and the lower back, sleep apnea, Pickwickian syndrome (obesity, red face, underventilation, and drowsiness).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolic Syndrome, also called insulin resistance syndrome or metabolic syndrome X, is a group of conditions that puts an individual at risk for heart disease and diabetes. Metabolic syndrome X is commonly found in individuals that are obese and seek medical assistance due to underlying dysfunction that leads to symptoms that affect their daily lives. These dysfunctions include hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, lower blood levels of HDL, and abnormal body fat distribution around the torso mid-section (waist). The cause of metabolic syndrome might be insulin resistance. Abnormally high amounts of blood sugar may set the stage for this multi-factorial disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunological Disease\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods related to an immune disease or disorder. Immune diseases or disorders are for example, rejection following transplantation of synthetic or organic grafting materials, cells, organs or tissue to replace all or part of the function of tissues, such as heart, kidney, liver, bone marrow, skin, cornea, vessels, lung, pancreas, intestine, limb, muscle, nerve tissue, duodenum, small-bowel, pancreatic-islet-cell, including xenotransplants, etc. The invention further may be related to treatment of immune disease including treatment or preventing of graft-versus-host disease, autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, type I diabetes uveitis, juvenile-onset or recent-onset diabetes mellitus, uveitis, Graves' disease, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, vasculitis, auto-antibody mediated diseases, aplastic anemia, Evan's syndrome, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and the like. The invention further relates to treatment or prevention of infectious diseases causing aberrant immune response and/or activation, such as traumatic or pathogen induced immune dysregulation, including for example, that which are caused by hepatitis B and C infections, HIV, \nStaphylococcus aureus \ninfection, viral encephalitis, sepsis, parasitic diseases wherein damage is induced by an inflammatory response (e.g., leprosy).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the invention relates to treatment or prevention of graft vs host disease (especially with allogenic cells), rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, other forms of inflammatory bowel disease (collagenous colitis, lymphocytic colitis, ischemic colitis, diversion colitis, Behcet's syndrome, infective colitis, indeterminate colitis) and/or multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively or additionally, in some embodiments, the invention relates to treatment or prevention of an immune response associated with a gene therapy treatment, such as the introduction of foreign genes into autologous cells and expression of the encoded product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary of diseases caused or worsened by the host's own immune response are autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, pulmonary fibrosis, and rheumatoid arthritis and diseases in which the immune response contributes to pathogenesis such as atherosclerosis, inflammatory diseases, osteomyelitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and graft versus host disease (GVHD) often resulting in organ transplant rejection. Additional exemplary inflammatory disease states include fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, sarcoidosis, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, inflammations of the skin (e.g., psoriasis), glomerulonephritis, proliferative retinopathy, restenosis, and chronic inflammations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMitochondrial Disease\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods of treating mitochondrial disease, wherein the methods comprise administering a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a subject. Mitochondrial diseases may be caused by mutations, acquired or inherited, in mitochondrial DNA or in nuclear genes that code for mitochondrial components. They may also be the result of acquired mitochondrial dysfunction due to adverse effects of drugs, infections, aging or other environmental causes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMitochondrial DNA inheritance behaves differently from autosomal and sex-linked inheritance. Mitochondrial DNA, unlike nuclear DNA, is strictly inherited from the mother and each mitochondrial organelle typically contains multiple mtDNA copies. During cell division, the mitochondrial DNA copies segregate randomly between the two new mitochondria, and then those new mitochondria make more copies. As a result, if only a few of the mtDNA copies inherited from the mother are defective, mitochondrial division may cause most of the defective copies to end up in just one of the new mitochondria. Mitochondrial disease may become clinically apparent once the number of affected mitochondria reaches a certain level; this phenomenon is called ‘threshold expression’. Mitochondrial DNA mutations occur frequently, due to the lack of the error checking capability that nuclear DNA has. This means that mitochondrial DNA disorders may occur spontaneously and relatively often. In addition, defects in enzymes that control mitochondrial DNA replication may cause mitochondrial DNA mutations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMitochondrial diseases include any clinically heterogeneous multisystem disease characterized by mutations of the brain-mitochondrial encephalopathies and/or muscule-mitochondrial myopathies due to alterations in the protein complexes of the electron transport chain of oxidative phosphorylation. In some embodiment, the invention relates to the treatment or prevention of mitochondrial diseases. For example, the invention provides methods for the treatment or prevention of Leber's hereditary optic atrophy, MERRF (Myoclonus Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers), MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes); Alper syndrome, Lowe syndrome, Lull syndrome, Menke's kinky hair syndrome, Zellweger syndrome, mitochondrial myopathy, and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile not intending to be bound to any particular theory, compounds of the invention protect against neuronal dysfunction and death that causes the neurologic symptoms (e.g., cognitive losses, muscle weakness, cardiac dysfunction) diseases that are characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. In these diseases, dysfunctional mitochondria accumulate. The normal mechanism of mitochondria recycling is unable to keep up with the increased demand. In one aspect of the invention, compounds of the invention stimulate the so-called mitophagy pathway, leading to regeneration of fully functional mitochondria.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMELAS, MERFF, LHON (leber hereditary optic neuropathy), CPEO (chronic progressive external opthalmoplegia), KSS (Kearns-Sayre syndrome), MNGIE (mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy), NARP (neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and ptosis), Leigh syndrome, Alpers-Huttenlocher disease, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Pearson syndrome, and Luft disease are examples of mitochondrial diseases treatable by this mechanism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMitochondrial function is critical for the generation of ATP, which is critical for all cellular processes. Mitochondrial function decreases with age, due, in part, to environmental toxins and mutations in mitochondrial DNA that occur over time. In addition, some mutations encoded in the mitochondrial genome (and passed exclusively through the mother) are known to predispose to age-related neurodegenerative disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to many, if not all, age-associated degenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, type 2 diabetes), therapeutic agents that prevented the decline in mitochondrial function could have wide therapeutic utility. There are two classes of agents that could accomplish this: (1) agents that act on single mitochondria and (2) agents that do not affect individual mitochondria, but act on the mitochondrial pool.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, compounds of the invention boost net mitochondrial function in INS-1 cells and in pancreatic islet cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout wishing to be bound by theory, in one aspect, the effect of compounds of the invention on net mitochondrial function is mediated by its optimization of the normal cellular surveillance system, whereby dysfunctional mitochondria are identified and degraded. This process is called mitophagy and is a branch of the broader autophagy pathway, which is involved in removing debris from the cytoplasm. New mitochondria can only be produced in conjunction with degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Therefore, stimulation of the mitochondrial clearance process (mitophagy) results in production of new fully functional mitochondria and an increase in net mitochondrial function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn increase in net mitochondrial function would be beneficial to any disease in which decreased mitochondrial function is thought to be responsible. In one aspect, a stimulation of mitophagy would be beneficial to any disease in which decreased mitochondrial function is thought to be responsible, wholly or in part, for symptoms. These diseases include for example: MELAS, Leber syndrome, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Crohn's disease, myopathies (e.g. inclusion body myositis), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), Lewy Body Disease (LBD), ALS (amyotophic lateral sclerosis/Lou Gehrig's disease), and Huntington's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional mitochondrial disorders include for example, Alpers Disease (Progressive Infantile Poliodystrophy) Barth Syndrome/LIC (Lethal Infantile Cardiomyopathy) Caritine-Acyl-Carnitine Deficiency, Carnitine Deficiency, Co-Enzyme Q10 Deficiency, Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Disorders, Complex I Deficiency, Complex II Deficiency, Complex III Deficiency, Complex IV/COX Deficiency, Complex V Deficiency, CPEO (Chronic Progressive External Opthalmoplegia Syndrome) CPT I Deficiency, CPT II Deficiency, KSS (Kearns-Sayre Syndrome), Lactic Acidosis, LCAD (Long-Chain Aycl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency) LCHAD, Leigh Disease or Syndrome (Subacute Necrotizing Encephalmyelopathy) LHON (Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy), Luft Disease, MAD/Glutaric Aciduria Type H (Multiple Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency), MACD (Medium Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency), MERRF (Myoclonic Epilepsy and Ragged Red Fibre Disease) Mitochondrial Cytopathy, Mitochondrial DNA Depletion, Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Mitochondrial Myopathy, MINGIE (Myoneurogastointestinal Disorder and Encephalopathy) NARP (Neuropathy, Ataxia and Retinitis Pigmentosa), Pearson Syndrome, Pyruvate Carboxylase Deficiency, Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Deficiency, SCAD (Short-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency) SCHAD, and VLCAD (Very Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency. The present invention includes a method of treating a proteinopathic subject, wherein the method comprises administering a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to the subject in an amount that is sufficient to improve mitochondrial health in said subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “mitochondrial health” refers to the ability of mitochondria to function normally in cells. To “improve mitochondrial health” means to assist in a return to normal mitochondrial function in cells. In one aspect, the phrase “to assist in a return to normal mitochondrial” means to assist in an increase in mitochondrial function. An increase in mitochondrial function includes for example, an increase in insulin secretion by cells under glucose stimulated conditions (not basal conditions), an increase in oxygen consumption of cells, prevention or a decrease in fragmentation and abnormal mitochondrial morphology, prevention- or a decrease in cell apoptosis, prevention or a decrease in mitochondrial mutation, an increase in production of new mitochondria, an increase in mitochondrial fusion and fission processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, to assist in a return to normal mitochondrial function in cells means at least one or more of the following: (1) to increase the efficiency of ATP conversion and distribution (i.e., actual energy release); (2) to speed up the rate of recycling of ADP back to ATP again (i.e., energy recovery times and energy reserve; (3) to provide the body with enough raw materials to produce new ATP (replenishing depleted energy reserves—having converted some of the ADP to non-recoverable AMP in lieu of any ATP being available. In another aspect, to assist in a return to normal mitochondrial function in cells means to decrease the amount of mitochondrial dysfunction in cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMitochondria are known as the “powerhouse” of cells. The primary function of mitochondria is to generate the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During cellular respiration, the mitochondria inside each cell take in oxygen, sugar and ADP (effectively spent energy) and produce ATP, which acts to distribute chemical energy inside of the cell for metabolism. The ATP moves outside of the mitochondrial membrane and floats around inside of the cell in the cytoplasm until it is used up in a variety of processes. Energy is released when ATP is converted to ADP. Virtually, every biochemical reaction in the body is driven by the conversion of ATP to ADP. The average person turns over approximately his or her own body weight in ATP each day. Mitochondria also function in other cellular processes, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, cell death, as well as the control of the cell cycle and cell growth. For example, mitochondria are responsible for the β-oxidation of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids as well as central to intermediary metabolism, ROS generation, and apoptosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “mitochondrial dysfunction” refers to when the ability of the mitochondria to function normally is reduced or decreased in cells. For example, one aspect of mitochondrial dysfunction includes when the mitochondria fail to produce adequate levels of ATP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, mitochondria dysfunction occurs as a result of aging. Studies show that as people age, the efficiency of the mitochondria to convert ADP to ATP diminishes and so does the quantity of mitochondria per cell. As a result, the amount of ATP turned over decreases. For example, a 68-year old person produces approximately half the amount of ATP compared to a 39-year old person. Cells die because mitochondria fail to produce adequate energy molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAging mitochondria are not only less efficient at converting ADP to ATP, but they can also produce harmful oxidants. For example, mitochondria can be poisoned by numerous substances, including environmental toxins, heavy metals, excess iron (haemocromatosis), pesticides, chronic bacteria, viral and fungal infections and neurotoxins. These agents can induce excess production of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, peroxynitrite, etc. which cause oxidation and thus damage of the mitochondria which in effect reduces their ability to produce energy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of mitochondrial dysfunction is inefficient recycling of ADP back to ATP and the undesired production of AMP. If a cell is not efficient at recycling ADP to ATP, then the cell runs out of energy very quickly. The cell must then go into a ‘rest’ period when no more ATP is available, and then the cell will use ADP instead and convert this into AMP. However, AMP cannot be recycled, which is why the body does not use normally use ADP to produce energy. ATP can only be recycled from ADP and the rest must be created from scratch, which requires the body to break down various proteins, triglycerides, fatty acids, and sugars into their constituent parts, and then the mitochondria must build up the ATP from these components. The ratio between ATP and AMP is a way to measure how much energy is available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of mitochondrial dysfunction involves anaerobic respiration, a mechanism used when insufficient ATP is available. If the body is very short of ATP, it can make a very small amount of ATP directly from glucose by converting it into lactic acid to produce two molecules of ATP for the body to use. However, this type of anaerobic metabolism results in problems—lactic acid quickly builds up and causes pain and the body's glucose is used up and unavailable to make D-ribose, which is needed to generate new ATP. When mitochondria function well, as a person rests following exertion, lactic acid is quickly converted back to glucose and the lactic burn disappears. This process requires six molecules of ATP. If there is no ATP available, e.g., when mitochondria fail, then the lactic acid may persist for several minutes or hours and cause a great deal of pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother potential factor explaining poor ATP availability is a lowered level of mitochondria in patients with mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria themselves have a very short half life. It is estimated that they have a half life of 5-12 days (meaning that half of the mitochondria in the body will have ‘died’ after 5-12 days if no more were produced). Mitochondria are recycled by the autophagy process. This recycling of mitochondrial to produce new mitochondria requires energy or ATP, which clearly if deficient to start with, may be delayed or postponed, meaning that the resulting remaining functioning mitochondria may be somewhat less than it should be in a healthy organism. Fewer mitochondria means those that remain are put under more pressure to produce ATP and are thus depleted quicker than they would normally be.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLow levels of mitochondrial regeneration may be explained by low basal nitric oxide (NO) levels. NO is a major regulator of ATP levels. Low NO levels cause low ATP levels, which thus disables autophagy, preventing recycling of mitochondria. There is more peroxynitrite damage observed because there is less recycling of mitochondria occurring (less autophagy) and hence less repair of peroxynitrite-damaged proteins. In other words, there is a resulting accumulation of peroxynitrite-damaged proteins and lipids. Because of low NO levels, there is less synchronization between cells in terms of their energy output, meaning some are overloaded and some are underloaded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the mitochondrial dysfunction is due to the actual integrity of the mitochondrial membranes rather than the actual number of mitochondria, which may or may not be normal. Several factors can affect mitochondrial membrane integrity and severely impact the body's ability to aerobically respire and force it to use anaerobic respiration more. Factors that affect the mitochondrial membrane can severely impact the body's ability to aerobically respire and force it to use anaerobic respiration more to produce energy. Factors affecting mitochondrial membrane integrity include fatty acid imbalances, excessive free radical (oxidative) damage to the mitochondrial membrane, compounds that clogg up the mitochondrial membranes thus reducing mitochondrial membrane permability and ATP production (e.g., toxins, partial detoxification products, foreign/unwanted compounds), elevated hydrogen sulphide levels, too low a pH at the membrane (too acidic), elevated intracellular calcium and reduced intracellular magnesium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSymptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction may include a lack of physical energy, lack of mental energy and ability to concentrate ('brain fog'), tendency to crash and burn, muscle and joint weakness, cardiac weakness/insufficiency, digestive insufficiency, and perhaps even muscle control. The exact effects vary according to the individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGetting sufficient oxygen to the mitochondria is key to enabling proper mitochondrial function. Low blood and body oxygen levels are frequently associated with excessive fat, insufficient cardiovascular exercise, slightly lowered blood/bodily pH (excessive acid producing food consumption), fatty acid imbalances and/or poor membrane permability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMitochondrial function can be assessed using a variety of methods for example, a Clark-type electrode probe is used for measuring oxygen consumption, luminescent ATP assays quantitatively measure total energy metabolism, and MTT or Alamar Blue to determine metabolic activity. Alternatively, label-free, assay systems e.g., extracellular flux (XF) assays are used measure the two major energy-producing pathways of the cell simultaneously—mitochondrial respiration (oxygen consumption) and glycolysis (extracellular acidification)—in a sensitive microplate format. XF assays work with adherent cells offering a physiologically relevant, real-time cellular bioenergetic assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an “improvement in mitochondrial health” is demonstrated, for example, by an increase in insulin secretion by cells under glucose stimulated conditions (not basal conditions), an increase in oxygen consumption of cells, prevention or a decrease in fragmentation and abnormal mitochondrial morphology, prevention or a decrease in cell apoptosis, prevention or a decrease in mitochondrial mutation, an increase in the production of new mitochondria, a promotion in mitochondrial fusion and fission processes. The invention includes a method, wherein administration of said compound promotes mitochondrial fusion and fission processes. In one aspect, the promotion of mitochondrial fusion and fission processes results in an improvement in mitochondrial health.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn healthy cells, mitochondrial morphology is maintained through a dynamic balance between fusion and fission processes, and this regulated balance seems to be required for maintaining normal mitochondrial and cellular function. Dysregulated mitochondrial fusion and fission processes are now be regarded as playing important pathogenic roles in neurodegeneration (Frank, S. Acta Neuropathol (2006) 111: 93-100). Age-dependent decreases in mitochondrial fusion and fission activity have been demonstrated (Jendrach et al. (2005) Mech Ageing Dev 126: 813-821), perhaps indicating that a decline in these important physiological functions could not only contribute to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, but also to the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. As such, there is a need for compounds that promote mitochondrial fusion and fission processes thereby improving mitochondrial health.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes a method, wherein administration of said compound stimulates mitophagy. In one aspect, a stimulation of mitophagy results in an improvement in mitochondrial health. As used herein, the term “stimulates mitophagy” means that the mitochondrial clearance process is stimulated resulting in the production of new fully functional mitochondria and/or an increase in net mitochondrial function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes a method, wherein administration of said compound increases autophagic flux in said subject. In one aspect, the increase in autophagic flux results in an improvement in mitochondrial health.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “increase in mitochondrial function” includes for example, an increase in insulin secretion by cells under glucose stimulated conditions (not basal conditions), an increase in oxygen consumption of cells, prevention or a decrease in fragmentation and abnormal mitochondrial morphology, prevention- or a decrease in cell apoptosis, prevention or a decrease in mitochondrial mutation, an increase in production of new mitochondria, an increase in mitochondrial fusion and fission processes. The invention includes a method, wherein administration of said compound promotes the identification and degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “autophagy” refers a catabolic process involving the degradation of a cell's own components through the lysosomal machinery. It is a tightly-regulated process that plays a normal part in cell growth, development, and homeostasis, helping to maintain a balance between the synthesis, degradation, and subsequent recycling of cellular products. It is a major mechanism by which a starving cell reallocates nutrients from unnecessary processes to more-essential processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of autophagic processes exist, all having in common the degradation of intracellular components via the lysosome. The most well-known mechanism of autophagy involves the formation of a membrane around a targeted region of the cell, separating the contents from the rest of the cytoplasm. The resultant vesicle then fuses with a lysosome and subsequently degrades the contents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes a method, wherein administration of a compound of the invention increases autophagy in said subject.

Deprotection of Boc-protected 18 using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) affords the corresponding TFA salt 19, which is then added to 4-((5-formyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl)benzonitrile 20 in the presence of NaCNBH\n3 \nin order to undergo a reductive amination to afford (S)-4-(5-((2-oxo-1-(3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl)pyrrolidin-3-ylamino)methyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl)benzonitrile 21.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProcedure: To a mixture of Boc-L-methionine (1.47 g, 5.9 mmol) in methylene chloride (10 mL) was added HATU (2.6 g, 6.8 mmol) and DIPEA (1.1 mL) and the solution was cooled to 0-5° C. with an ice bath.

Am. Chem. Soc. \n114:7945; U.S. Pat. No. 5,525,479, issued Jun. 11, 1996; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). In summary, a dansyl-pentapeptide (dGCVLS) was incubated at 4 μM with 5 μM farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and 25-50 nM FTase in 50 mM Tris-HCl/12 mM MgCl\n2\n/12 μM ZnCl\n2\n/6 mM DTT/0.2% octyl-D-β-glucopyranoside/pH 7.0 at room temperature while the increase in fluorescence of the peptide at Ex=340 nm, Em=485 nm upon farnesyl addition was monitored continuously by a spectrofluorometer. Test compounds were added to the reaction mixture and the final results were compared to negative control (with solvent only), to allow measurement of the degreee of inhibition at each concentration of compound tested. Serial dilution series of test compounds were used to allow measurement of the IC50s and calculation of the resultant K\ni\n. The linear portion of the reaction progress curve thus created was measured to yield an initial rate (Vo); a plot of Vo versus inhibitor concentration was fit by non-linear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism software) to calculate the \nIC %\n 0 and the K\ni\n. All reactions in the inhibitor experiments contain a final concentration of 1% DMSO. Results for some exemplary compounds are shown in the table below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nStructure\n\n\nFTase assay Ki (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.059\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nCellular Assay for Measurement of Farnesyl Transferase Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nRas is a small GTP binding protein whose farnesylation and condequent membrane association can be reduced by inhibition of farnesyl transferase (Appels et al., \nOncologist \n10:565-578, 2005; Basso et al., \nJ. Lipid Res. \n47:15-31, 2006; Tamanoi, \nTrends Biochem. Sci. \n18:349-353, 1993; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). Treatment with certain farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) reduces the farnesylation and membrane association of Ras, leading to accumulation of Ras in the cytosol of the cells. An assay was developed to monitor FTase activity, based on the amount of Ras present in the cytosolic fraction of COS-7 cells after FTI treatment. On \nday\n 0, COS-7 cells were passaged into 6-well plates at a density of 4×10\n5 \ncells/well. Beginning on day 1, cells were treated with test compounds (e.g. FTIs) in 0.2% DMSO for 24 hr. On day 2, cells were lysed by passage through a 25 gauge needle 10 times in 100 μl Buffer 1 (50 mM Tris, 140 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.4) and lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 30 min to isolate the cytosolic fraction (supernatant). The cytosolic fraction was analyzed by Western blot using anti-Ras antibody and anti-actin antibody for loaning control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWestern Blotting: Following transfer of SDS gels onto NC membrane, all membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with primary antibody overnight with 1% BSA in TBST, washed three times with TBST, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour (Promega). Bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminascence (NEM). Results were quantified based on densitometric analysis of Ras signal normalized to actin signal (Ras/actin ratio). Dose response curves were generated for serial dilutions of test compounds, which were then used to measure an IC50 for the test compound by curve fitting with Prism or equivalent software product.

(Masliah et al. “Dopaminergic loss and inclusion body formation in alpha-synuclein mice: implications for neurodegenerative disorders” \nScience \n287(5456):1265-69, 2000; incorporated herein by reference). This assay serves as a general model for multiple types of proteinopathies, although it is based on α-synuclein. Animals from the line referenced have α-synuclein neuronal inclusions in the cortex, hippocampus, and the olfactory bulb (Masliah et al. “Dopaminergic loss and inclusion body formation in alpha-synuclein mice: implications for neurodegenerative disorders” \nScience \n287(5456):1265-69, 2000). Transgenic mice are orally administered different doses of either test compound in vehicle or the same volume of vehicle alone once or twice a day for 30 or 90 days. In some cases, non-transgenic mice also receive the test compound in vehicle, or vehicle alone once or twice a day for 30 to 90 days. At the end of treatment, mice are sacrificed, and the brains are removed and hemisected. One hemisphere of each is fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (pH 7.4), cryoperserved, then sectioned for histology. The other hemisphere is subdivided into four brain regions, including the cortex and hippocampus, that are homogenized and processed into cytoplasmic and membrane fractions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormation of α-synuclein inclusions in the cortex and hippocampus is probed by immunostaining with an antibody for human α-synuclein. Cells positive for human α-synuclein are quantified. Brain sections were stained with a monoclonal human α-synuclein specific antibody (Alexis®; Cat# 804-258-L001; dilution 1:5), followed by a secondary Ab Cy 2-Goat Anti-Rat (Jackson ImmunoResearch®; dilution 1:200). IR positive cells were quantified using microscopy and specialized image analysis software (Image Pro Plus, version 4.5.1.29). Total α-synuclein levels in specific brain regions of treated animals are analyzed by a sandwich ELISA assay similar to one previously described (El-Agnaf et al. “Detection of oligomeric forms of alpha-synuclein protein in human plasma as a potential biomarker for Parkinson's disease” \nFASEB J. \n20(3):419-25, 2006; incorporated herein by reference). In the cortex of the vehicle treated animals, α-synuclein protein levels in both cytoplasmic and membrane fractions in the brains of test compound treated α-synuclein transgenic mice are measured and compared with vehicle treated mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBrain homogenate was centrifuged and the supernatant saved as fraction F1. The pellet was washed then resuspended and saved as fraction F2. Plates (Nunc, 464718) were coated with the anti <-synuclein antibody SYN-1 (1:1000, BD Transduction Labs, 610787). Monomeric recombinant <-synuclein was included as an internal standard. Biotinylated antibody FL-140 (1:300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-10717-B) and ExtrAvidin-Alkaline phosphatase (3:5000, Sigma, E2636) was added followed by pNPP substrate solution (Sigma, N1891). Raw absorbance (405 nm) was then normalized to the total protein concentration of each sample. Concentration of α-synuclein in test samples was determined by comparison with a standard curve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment with test compounds as above decreases levels of α-synuclein protein in either the cortex, or the hippocampus, or in both, as measured by immunohistochemistry or ELISA.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nMeasurement of Autophagy Stimulation In Vitro\n\n\n \n \n \nCell culture media and reagents were purchased from Gibco. SH-SY5Y cells were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% pen/strep at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. Cells were plated in either 12 well plates for qPCR or 8 well chamber slides for immunohistochemistry, and allowed to grow until 70% confluent. Cells were then differentiated with 10 μM retinoic acid for 72 hr. Differentiated cells were then treated with the either rapamycin (100 nM or 1 μM) as a positive control, or with test compounds for 48-72 hr. For immunohistochemistry, cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS or ice cold methanol. Cells were then stained for LC3 (Novus biological, NB100-2331, dilution1:800) followed by secondary Alexa-564 Anti-Rabbit (A-11011). Slides were then mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor Western analysis of LC3-I and LC3-II ratio changes as a measurement of autophagy, SH-SY5Y cells were differentiated with 10 uM retinoic acid for 2-4 days prior to treatment with either DMSO or a test substance for 48-72 hr. For the last 18 hr, cells were treated with 5 nM bafilomycin A1. Cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and LC3-II levels were analyzed by Western blot, normalized to actin, and plotted relative to control cells treated with DMSO only (no bafilomycin). Antibodies used were anti-LC3B (Cell Signaling #2775) and anti-actin (Chemicon MAB1501R).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAutophagy gene expression profiles were done by qPCR on series of known autophagy genes. For cells used for qPCR, total RNA was extracted using Tri-reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The targeted genes and primers used are listed below. The primers (18-22 mer) were designed using Primer3 (http://wwwgenome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi). These primer sets were designed to amplify small amplicons for candidate mRNAs ranging from 100-300 bp in size. First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out on total RNA extracted with Tri-reagent (Sigma), using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Biorad) according to the manufacturers specifications. qPCR analysis was carried out in a 96 well plate using an iCycler (BioRad, Hercules, Calif.), and iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Biorad) according to the manufacturer's specifications. A concentration curve with known concentrations of cDNA extracts from undifferentiated SH-SY5Y was used to calculate standard curves. The final concentration of each transcript was calculated using the myIQ2 software provided by Biorad followed by normalization to GAPDH (normalization to actin gave similar results).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPrimer sets\n\n\nGene name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAACGGATTTGGTCGTATTGG\n\n\nL-h-GAPDH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 2)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGCTCCTGGAAGATGGTGATG\n\n\nR-h-GAPDH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 3)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAAGCCATCAAGGTGATGAGG\n\n\nR-h-ATG1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 4)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGGTCACACGCCACATAACAG\n\n\nL-h-ATG1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 5)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nATCACCTAGTCCACCACTGTCC\n\n\nL-h-ATG3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 6)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGTATCTACCATCCGCCATC\n\n\nR-h-ATG3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 7)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTTATGTCATGTCGGGTGTGG\n\n\nL-h-ATG4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 8)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nACAGGTGTAGGGCTCTGTG\n\n\nR-h-ATG4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 9)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGAGGAAAGCAGAGGTGATGC\n\n\nR-h-ATG5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 10)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGAGGCAACCTGACCAGAAAC\n\n\nL-h-ATG5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 11)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGGTTGAGAAAGGCGAGACAC\n\n\nL-h-ATG(beclin 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 12)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTGAGGACACCCAAGCAAGAC\n\n\nR-h-ATG6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 13)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGAACATGGTGCTGGTTTCCT\n\n\nL-h-ATG7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 14)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCATCCAGGGTACTGGGCTAA\n\n\nR-h-ATG7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 15)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAGGGACAACCCTAACACGAC\n\n\nR-h-ATG8 (LC3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 16)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAGCAGGAGAAAGACGAGGAC\n\n\nL-h-ATG8 (LC3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 17)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGAAGCTGCAACACAGACTGC\n\n\nR-h-ATG12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 18)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTTGAATGACTAGCCGGGAAC\n\n\nL-hATG12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 19)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGCATGGCCATCTTCTCTTTC\n\n\nR-h-p62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 29)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTGGATGGGACTCCATAGCTC\n\n\nL-h-p62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO. 21)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHaving now described some illustrative embodiments of the invention, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the foregoing is merely illustrative and not limiting, having been presented by way of example only. Numerous modifications and other illustrative embodiments are within the scope of one of ordinary skill in the art and are contemplated as falling within the scope of the invention. In particular, although many of the examples presented herein involve specific combinations of method acts or system elements, it should be understood that those acts and those elements may be combined in other ways to accomplish the same objectives. Acts, elements, and features discussed only in connection with one embodiment are not intended to be excluded from a similar role in other embodiments. Use of ordinal terms such as “first”, “second”, “third”, etc., in the claims to modify a claim element does not by itself connote any priority, precedence, or order of one claim element over another or the temporal order in which acts of a method are performed, but are used merely as labels to distinguish one claim element having a certain name from another element having a same name (but for use of the ordinal term) to distinguish the claim elements. Similarly, use of a), b), etc., or i), ii), etc. does not by itself connote any priority, precedence, or order of steps in the claims. Similarly, the use of these terms in the specification does not by itself connote any required priority, precedence, or order.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing written specification is considered to be sufficient to enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention. The present invention is not to be limited in scope by examples provided, since the examples are intended as a single illustration of one aspect of the invention and other functionally equivalent embodiments are within the scope of the invention. Various modifications of the invention in addition to those shown and described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and fall within the scope of the appended claims. The advantages and objects of the invention are not necessarily encompassed by each embodiment of the invention.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nEffect on Oxygen Consumption\n\n\n \n \n \nImpaired mitochondrial function is shown by a decreased rate of oxygen consumption. For example, INS1 cells exposed to palmitate show a significant decrease in oxygen consumption rate, both under basal glucose and following stimulation with glucose. The effect of \ncompound\n 28 at 1 nM on oxygen consumption was determined at 2.5 and 3.5 day incubation time points. Oxygen consumption in INS1 was measured using a Seahorse XF24 bioenergetic assay.

The assay template is uploaded to the XF24 Analyzer before starting the assay. The XF sensor cartridge is prepared. The XF sensor is hydrated overnight in XF Calibration Buffer at 37 degrees C., without CO2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhole islets are prepared by standard laboratory procedure. For example ˜8 mice are sacrificed to obtain ˜1200 islets—enough for 20 wells at 70 islets/well. Whole islets are incubated in a petri dish overnight under standard conditions for islet culture (e.g., culture islets in RPMI media with 11 mM glucose, 10% FBS, and 1% pen/strep). Whole cell islets and capture screens are added to the wells according to the following procedure: Islets are aspirated from Petri dish and dispensed into a 50 ml tube, washed 1× in MA Media. The supernatant is removed and cells are re-suspended in 2 ml MA Media. While creating turbulence in the tube with a pipettor, 20 microliter aliquots are removed and drops placed on a culture dish—three drops total. The islets are counted under a dissecting microscope. This gives an average amount of islets per volume from which the total number of islets is estimated. The count of the islets is determined and the volume adjusted so that there are ˜70 islets for every 100 microliters of the islet suspension. The final volume should be 500 microliters per well. When the islets are seeded, a 20 microliter pipette is used to remove the islets into the depressed chamber at the bottom of the well. This is repeated so that each well gets a total of 100 microliters of media (700 islets/ml). 400 microliters of MA Media is added to each well of the XF24 islet plate. 50 microliters of the islet suspension is added to each well and repeated so that each well has a total of 100 microliters of the islet suspension. The final volume is 500 microliters per well. The islets are seeded using a 20 microliter pipette and all of the islets are moved into the depressed chamber in the bottom of the well. A dissecting microscope is used to be sure that all of the islets are in the depression at the bottom of the well. Screens are added by pre-wetting them in MA Media in a small petri dish to remove any air bubbles. A pair of sterile forceps is used to position the screens so that the ring is facing up. The islet capture screens are placed in the bottom of each well using a capture screen insert tool—being careful not to cause too much turbulence so as to keep the islets resting in the depression at the bottom of the well. The islet capture screen is released into the well by pulling up on the T-lever on the capture screen insert tool. The islet capture rings are stuck firmly at the bottom of the well. This is confirmed by gently pushing the screens down with a blunt tip pipette tip. The microplate is placed in an incubator set at 37 degrees Celsius, without CO2. The microplate is stored in the incubator for at least one hour to equilibrate temperature and to adjust islet metabolism to 3 mM glucose. While the plate is incubating, the XF sensor cartridge injection ports are prepared with the desired injections (see, table below) and calibrated.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInjection Ports\n\n\nVolume\n\n\nConcentration in\n\n\nFinal Concentration in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Glucose\n\n\n50 μl\n\n\n200 \n\n\nmM\n\n\n20 \n\n\nmM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB: \nOligomycin\n \n\n\n55 μl\n\n\n50 \n\n\nμM\n\n\n5 \n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC: \nFCCP\n \n\n\n60 μl\n\n\n10 \n\n\nμM\n\n\n1 \n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD: Rotenone\n\n\n65 μl\n\n\n50 \n\n\nμM\n\n\n5\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD: Myxothiazol\n\n\n65 μl\n\n\n50 \n\n\nμM\n\n\n5 \n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVigorous mixing of the stock 20 uM oligomycin is required to prevent precipitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotenone and Myxothiazol are mixed together in the appropriate concentrations for injection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the cartridge is filled with compounds for injection, the cartridge is loaded and the program and calibration started.

Compound 28 (1 nM) increases oxygen consumption by 50% in isolated islets.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nEffect on INS1 Cell Viability/Apoptosis in the Presence of Glucolipotoxicity (GLT)\n\n\n \n \n \nGlucolipotoxicity (GLT) refers to exposure to high concentrations of both high glucose and high lipids and is a standard condition that is known to injure insulin-secreting beta cells (INS1 cells). Fatty acids and glucose impair insulin secretion and induce beta-cell death by a mechanism that was recently reported to involve macroautophagy (also referred to as “autophagy”). Nutrient abundance, i.e., high glucose or high palmitate or oleate increase the number of autophagosomes (APs) in vitro and in vivo in beta-cells and in liver cells. For example, palmitate derivatives such as ceramide have been implicated in lipotoxicity acting to impair autophagic flux in different cell types. Induction of autophagic flux is associated with cellular quality control mechanism, while impaired autophagic flux is associated with the accumulation of damage that may lead to malfunction and death at the cellular level, and to various diseases at the level of the organism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are tested using a cell death assay to determine whether they have any effect on palmitate-induced cell death. For Example, one example of such an assay is as follows: INS1 cells are incubated in control medium or in medium containing palmitate for 18 hours and either rapamycin or a compound of the invention at 0.25 nM, 0.5 nM, 1 nM, 10 nM, and 100 nM is added for the last 12 hours of incubation. At the end of the incubation, the cells are washed with PBS and stained with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (e.g., Molecular Probes, P3566). FACS data analysis is performed and cell debris is excluded. Rapamycin has been shown to protect cells from the toxic effect of palmitate. Compounds of the invention protect INS1 cells from palmitate toxicity.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nEffect on Glucolipotoxicity-Induced Mitochondrial Fragmentation in INS1 Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nMitochondrial fragmentation is a hallmark of beta cell dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. It is well-known that INS1 cells, when treated with palmitate, reproduce the abnormal fragmented mitochondrial phenotype that is characteristic of diabetic islet cells (See also, for methods and procedures for culturing INS1 cells, Molina et. al. Diabetes, vol. 58, October 2009). Preventing fragmentation is sufficient to prevent apoptosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine the effect of the compounds of the invention on glucolipotoxicity-induced mitochondrial fragmentation, a compound of the invention at 1 nM and 100 nM concentrations is cultured with INS1 cells in media containing palmitate according to methods and procedures described in Molina et. al. 2009. Imaging analysis is used to determine to the extent to which the compound normalizes mitochondrial morphology.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nEffect on Insulin Secretion Under Glucose Stimulated Conditions\n\n\n \n \n \nAn insulin secretion assay is used to determine whether compounds of the invention have an effect on insulin secretion conditions. One example of such an assay is as follows: prior to glucose-induced insulin secretion, cells are cultured for two hours in RPMI containing 3 mM glucose without serum. Cells are then washed and preincubated for 30 min in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) containing (in mM): 119 NaCl, 4.6 KCl, 5 NaHCO\n3\n, 2 CaCl\n2\n, 1 MgSO\n4\n, 0.15 Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.4 KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 20 HEPES, 2 glucose, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.4. This is followed by 30 min incubation in media containing either 3 mM glucose (to simulate low glucose conditions) or 15 mM glucose (to simulate high glucose conditions). Media are treated with varying concentrations of compound (1 nM and 10 nM). Media was collected and stored at −20° C. for insulin measurement. Insulin is measured by ELISA. Compounds which stimulate insulin secretion at high glucose conditions but not at basal glucose levels provide an advantage over sulfonyl urea compounds, the current standard oral anti-diabetic drug, which increases insulin secretion under all conditions (not desired).\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nEnhancement of Mitochondrial Dynamics\n\n\n \n \n \nMitochondrial dynamics are necessary for the maintenance of bioenergetic functions and maintenance of homogenous population of mitochondria. Mutations in Mfn2 and Opa1 have been implicated in neuropathies. A whole cell fusion assay is used to evaluate the effect of compounds of the invention on the enhancement of mitochondrial fusion and fission events. Photo-activateable GFP is used to label and follow an individual mitochondrion. Photo-activatable GFP becomes fluorescent only after absorbing UV light. Mitochondria undergo frequent fusion and fission. During fusion, the labeled mitochondrion passes fluorescent GFP to a neighboring unlabeled mitochondrion (Molina and Shirihai, Medical Informatics Europe (MIE), 2009). A diffusion of dye indicates that bioenergetics are increased i.e., there is an increase in mitochondrial fission and fussion events. The following assay protocol is followed: paGFP expression is carried out using adenoviral transduction if INS-1 cells. The cells are treated for 48 hours with a compound of the invention. Mitochondria are labeled with TMRE to facilitate tagging. UV pulse is delivered by two-photon laser. Z-stacks of individual cells are taken every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. Three separate runs are performed over 3 weeks at imaging facilities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther detail regarding the assay protocol in general are noted below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTargeting PAGFP to the mitochondrial matrix delineates the borders of a mitochondrion. By photoconverting regions within a mitochondrion with a 2 photon laser, photoconverted GFP molecules in the matrix will trace the extent of luminal continuity as GFP molecules move freely through the matrix space. The movement of GFP within this space is not hindered despite protein density and high viscosity of the matrix. In addition to quantifying mitochondrion size, the diffusion ability of GFP molecules within the mitochondrial matrix can be used to observe mitochondrial fusion events in real time. PAGFPmt can be used alone or in combination with other probes for a number of different applications that can measure the following parameters; mitochondrial movement, membrane potential of individual mitochondria over time, fusion frequency, fusion site/localization, fusion rate of a cell's mitochondrial population, and the transfer and organization of proteins in fusing mitochondria. The methodologies described can be easily applied to the measurement of all these parameters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe photoactivateable form of green fluorescent protein increases fluorescence intensity 100 fold after irradiation with 413 nm light. The development of a photoactivatable GFP that is useful at physiological conditions has opened new doors in the study of temporal and spatial dynamic interactions within a cell. Combined with 2 photon laser stimulation, it is possible to specifically stimulate individual organelles within a living cell and to monitor its interactions with other organelles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWild type GFP is a mixed population of fluorophores with a major and minor absorbance peaks at 397 nm and 475 nm respectively. Intense illumination with ultraviolet light causes the fluorophore population to give rise to the anionic form which demonstrates an increase in the minor peak absorbance. This causes an increase in fluorescence with subsequent 488 nM excitation. PAGFPmt is a variant that possesses a minor absorbance peak (475 nM) that is significantly lower than wildtype. This further enlarges the increase in fluorescence emission detected following photoconversion if excitation is done with a 488 nm laser.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA mitochondrial targeting sequence to PAGFP cDNA was added. DNA coding for the mitochondrial targeting sequence of COXVIII was amplified by PCR and inserted 5′ to GFP thereby targeting it to the mitochondrial matrix. Transfection of this construct works well in many systems such as COS7 cells, primary human myocytes, hippocampal neurons, and MEF cells. Expression of PAGFPmt becomes evident after 48 hours. PAGFPmt expression can be visualized by eye with blue light excitation and green emission. Alternatively expression can be verified by western blot analysis with GFP antibody. Transfection is a stressful treatment and in some cells may lead to a change in mitochondrial architecture and dynamics. If cells are transfected with the PAGFPmt plasmid using lipofection, it is recommended that mitochondrial architecture of transfected and non transfected cells be compared. Some level of mitochondrial fragmentation has been observed to occur due to the stress of lipofection in the clonal beta cell line, INS1. To prevent lipofection induced stress, lentiviral and adenoviral vectors were generated. Although the initial infection may cause some degree of cell death (1-10%) after 48 hours, this becomes less evident over time and is not observed in subsequent passages of the cell line.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPAGFPmt for lentiviral and adenoviral delivery using pWPI (Trono) or pAdEasy (Adenoeasy) respectively have been packaged. Lentiviral transduction is highly efficient in cell lines such as INS1 while adenoviral transduction exhibits better efficiency in primary preparations such as beta cells from the islets of Langerhans. In addition, lentiviral transduction allows the PAGFPmt to integrate into the host genome. Expression is stable for as many as 10 passages. Freezing the cells and storing in liquid nitrogen leads to noticeably lower expression when the cells are thawed for use. This may be due to selection influences during the freeze thaw cycle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy tagging individual mitochondria with photoconverted PAGFPmt, individual fusion events are observed. These events occur under normal conditions and without stimulation or stress. By generating time lapse, these events and quantification of their occurrence is captured. A fusion event is characterized by the transfer of photoconverted PAGFPmt molecules from the tagged mitochondrion to another previously unlabeled unit. Fission events typically follow fusion events and are characterized by the loss of PAGFPmt continuity. The average duration of a fusion event is ˜1 minute. It is notable that fission can occur without a change in the apposition of the two daughter mitochondria, a process referred to as “hidden fission”. Fission events often generate daughter mitochondria with disparate membrane potential that can be appreciated when using a potential sensitive dye such as TMRE. Daughter mitochondria resulting from a fission event will appear more red when hyperpolarized and stained with TMRE or more green when depolarized due to the presence of PAGFPmt. Therefore, some “hidden fission” events can be identified by the two daughter mitochondria having disparate changes in membrane potential.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMitochondria were labeled with the mitochondrion-specific dye tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate (TMRE; Invitrogen). TMRE concentration should be adjusted for the cell type with a lower concentration being preferred. Keep in mind that laser toxicity is proportional to the dye concentration in the mitochondria. Typically, for freshly isolated primary cells 3-5 nM should be sufficient; immortalized cell lines may require higher concentrations, 7-15 nM. Freshly prepared TMRE was added to culture in DMSO to give a final concentration and incubated for 45 min in a 37C incubator before imaging. Cells loaded with TMRE should be kept in dark to avoid phototoxicity. At the end of the loading period, the dye is not removed from the media. TMRE can be used to dynamically monitor membrane potential in mitochondria. Increases in TMRE fluorescence indicate hyperpolarization while decreases report depolarization. Since membrane potential influences mitochondrial fusion, it is expected that mitochondria with reduced TMRE intensity will have reduced probability for a fusion event within the duration of the experiment. During a fission event the concentration of matrix targeted mtPAGFP in the two daughters is identical. It is therefore possible to use the ratio (R) of TMRE/mtPAGFP for ratio imaging and comparison of membrane potential between the two daughter mitochondria generated during the fission event. The membrane potential difference between daughter (a) and daughter (b) can be calculated in millivolts ΔΨ=61.5Log(Ra/Rb) in experiments performed at 37 C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther fluorophores such as the dsRED protein and Mitotracker Red dye (MTR, Invitrogen) can be used to identify and characterize non fusing mitochondria. In mitochondria, it has been observed that slight increase in the intensity of 2-photon laser (750 nm) will result in dsRED bleaching during the photoconversion of PAGFPmt. This characteristic can be used to identify non fusing mitochondria, because these will have very high dsRED fluorescence. In addition, cells expressing mitochondrial dsRED can be fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes while preserving fluorescence and mitochondrial architecture. This allows the user to further characterize the non-fusing mitochondrial subpopulation. For example, using an antibody to probe for the mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1 in fixed cells, it has been found that OPA1 expression is decreased in the non-fusing population. MTR loading into mitochondria is dependent on ΔΨ. Therefore, short pulses of MTR exposure can be used to identify polarized mitochondria versus those that are depolarized. Once the dye is loaded, it does not leave the mitochondria during fixation allowing further characterization of MTR stained mitochondria by immunofluorescence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells transfected or virally transduced with PA-GFPmt should be allowed to accumulate the protein in the mitochondrial matrix for 48 h. A transition to its active (fluorescent) form is achieved by photoisomerization with a two-photon laser (750 nm) to give a 375-nm photon equivalence at the focal plane. This allows for selective photoconversion of areas as small as 0.5 um2 with a thickness of less than 0.5 um. In the absence of photoconversion, PA-GFPmt protein molecules remained stable in their pre-converted form. The presence of pre-converted PA-GFPmt was detected with high-intensity excitation at 488 nm (25-μW laser set at 1%) in combination with a fully opened pinhole. Spatially precise laser excitation can be used to label individual segments of the mitochondrial network at a time. The extent that photoconverted PAGFPmt is able to travel within a mitochondrion can be measured in order to quantify the size distribution of mitochondrial populations (Molina et. al., in press).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConfocal microscopy was performed on live cells in glass slide-bottomed dishes (MatTek, Ashland, Mass.) with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta microscope with a plan apochromat 100× (numerical aperture 1.4) oil immersion objective. Three configurations were set using the multitrack mode. One for detection of the pre-converted PAGFP (higher 488 nm intensity), a second for photoconversion (750 nm with 2P laser), and a third for recording photoconverted PAGFP (low intensity 488 nm). Red-emitting TMRE was excited with a 1-mW, 543 nm helium/neon laser set at 0.3%, and emission was recorded through a BP 650 to 710 nm filter. Photoconverted PA-GFPmt protein was excited with a 25-mW, 488-nm argon laser set between 0.2%-0.5%. Emission was recorded through a BP 500 to 550 nm filter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPAGFPmt can be similarly used to monitor and quantify networking activity in a whole cell. By photoconverting PAGFPmt in a subpopulation of mitochondria, the spread of photo-converted mtPAGFP signal throughout a cell via fusion and fission events and by mitochondrial movement as well has been observed. Fusion events not only lead to the spread of the photoconverted mtPAGFP across the networking population; it also leads to a dilution in the concentration of photoconverted molecules. This is translated into a reduction in the average GFP fluorescent intensity in the mitochondria that carry the photoconverted form. Therefore, by monitoring the decrease in PAGFPmt fluorescence intensity over time, fusion events that result in the transfer of PAGFPmt between mitochondria can be distinguished from the spread of PAGFPmt due to mitochondrial movement alone. This type of analysis can be used to compare the rate of mitochondrial dynamics between cells and due to various treatments. For example, it has been reported that mitochondrial fusion is halted in pancreatic beta cells with exposure to toxic nutrient levels (Molina et. al., in press).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe size of the mitochondrial subpopulation to be photoconverted should be kept constant if the user wishes to compare the rate of fusion between different conditions or cells. Photoconverting larger subpopulations will lead to shorter equilibration times. Two numerical values can be used to quantify the rate of mitochondrial dynamics;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe extent of dilution after a specified period of time (30 minutes or 1 hour)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTime to steady state (Equilibration time), defined by time after which no further dilution is measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the size of the area of photoconversion can be kept constant by using the same zoom value for activation, the number of mitochondria and size of the photoconverted population can still vary. This is due to the ability of matrix targeted GFP molecules to diffuse freely through any mitochondria with interconnected lumen and variations in the density of mitochondria. It has been found that with INS1 cells, activating an area that is 20% of the total cell area with 2P laser will provide an average equilibration time of around 45 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe same laser settings used for the monitoring of single mitochondria can be used for activating subpopulations. However, it is important to ensure that the 2-photon laser intensity is sufficient to photoconvert GFP while leaving the TMRE signal intact. The loss of TMRE fluorescence is indicative of phototoxicity and mitochondrial depolarization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some experiments, a Coherent Mira 900 femto second laser (Santa Clara, Calif.) was used. It was determined the minimum intensity and duration of laser exposure that initiated changes in ΔΨμ and/or mitochondrial morphology in cells treated with TMRE. The parameters utilized in the reported experiments were well below these thresholds. To determine the safety limits of 2-Photon laser stimulation in INS1 cells, excitation was delivered over a wide range of intensities and durations. Excitation for 600 milliseconds/μm2 at 1 mW laser intensity at the objective was found to be the threshold dosage for INS1 and COST cells above which a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential can be observed. All subsequent experiments using 2-photon illumination were conducted with duration of 150 ms/μm2 and an intensity of 1 mW. Due to variability in laser output, it is suggested that the user determine these values for the particular system being used. These intensity values can be used as a starting point and fine tuned.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is sufficient to collect 6 images from different focal planes at each time point (this is compared to 20 images or more that would be required for 3D reconstruction) because the extent of fusion activity is derived from the dilution of the photoconverted PAGFP. After photoconversion, a z-stack of 6 images is collected every 5 minutes for 50 minutes. This can be adjusted to ensure that photobleaching or phototoxicity does not reduce the cellular PAGFP or TMRE fluorescent intensity. It is conceivable that PAGFPmt bleaching may contribute to a decrease in PAGFPmt signal over time. This would present an artifact in the analysis and quantification of PAGFPmt dilution. When fusion is inhibited, the PAGFPmt intensity/(pixel area) remains stable over 50 minutes. For this measurement pixel area is defined as the total area of photoconverted PAGFP. Without fusion and dilution of PAGFPmt, there is no bleaching due to repeated excitation and no loss of fluorescence intensity over a period of 50 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonitoring the dilution of photoconverted mtPAGFP is an efficient way of quantification the sharing of GFP between mitochondria. Theoretically, when one mitochondrion carrying a matrix targeted photoconverted mtPAGFP fuses with another, the number of photoconverted molecules equilibrates between the two units and each ends up with half, causing a decrease in fluorescence intensity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nQuantification of fusion was performed using Metamorph (Molecular Devices CA) by measuring the average fluorescence intensity (FI) of the mitochondria that became PAGFPmt positive. The procedure involved first the elimination of non-mitochondrial pixels from the green (mtPAGFP) image followed by the measurement of green FI from mitochondria that were mtPAGFP positive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to measuring FI, an “Integrated Morphometry Analysis” function was used designed for these experiments in order to extract TMRE (or dsRed) positive structures that were larger than 10 pixels. These areas were interpreted as mitochondria, and their mtPAGFP was recorded. This procedure enabled the selection of mitochondrial structures from which mtPAGFP was measured using very low threshold levels in the green channel (approximately 10% of the image average intensity) assuring that over 90% of the mitochondrial pixels were included for analysis. It was verified that all intensity measurements were below saturation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA low threshold (˜10%) was applied to the green channel to identify the mtPAGFP positive mitochondria. Average FI (mtPAGFP) was measured from thresholded areas using Region Measurement. To set the threshold level, a test-threshold function first measured the average green FI of the mitochondria. The lower (inclusive) threshold was set at two thirds of this average. An upper threshold was not necessary since saturated images were carefully avoided during collection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe FI values of PAGFPmt at each time point were normalized to the GFP FI value immediately after photoconversion and then fitted to a hyperbolic function:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nF\n(\nt\n)=1\n−F\nplateau*\nt\n/(\nt+T\n50)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nF and Fplateau denote fluorescent intensity (FI) at time t and in the plateau phase. T50 denote the time interval to a 50% decrease in normalized GFP FI ([1−Fplateau]/2). All fitting procedures and statistical tests were conducted using Kaleida-Graph software (Synergy Software, Reading, Pa.). Paired student's T-tests were performed to calculate statistical significance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing colocalization as a metric for quantification is problematic for a number of reasons. The decrease in GFP intensity with each fusion event is so prominent that it affects the perceived colocalization and confounds the results. It has been found that at later time points, the GFP intensity can become so weak that its colocalization with red pixels becomes unreliable. With photoconversion of 10-20% of the cell area, it is typically found that the GFP intensity at equilibrium is on average 60% lower compared to the beginning of the trial. In addition, in order to perform the colocalization analysis, it is necessary to scan an interlaced z-series through the cell. This is because fusion events can occur in any orientation. Higher rates of image acquisition should be avoided in order to prevent artifacts caused by photobleaching. GFP intensity dilution can report fusion events occurring outside of the focal plane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are a number of sources for potential artifacts that will lead to errors in the calculation of mitochondrial fusion measurements. This section will address these concerns and discuss ways to avoid these problems. It should be noted that any values for settings provided are for reference only and have only been tested on our system. The optimal settings may differ between systems, even from the same manufacturer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhotoconversion of PAGFPmt into its fluorescent form requires careful calibration of the 2-photon laser intensity. This potential problem has been addressed in detail in the photoconversion section earlier in this manuscript. It has been observed that high 2-photon laser intensity can damage mitochondria and cause instability of ΔΨ as well as permanent depolarization. This could confound measurements of mitochondrial fusion rates because depolarized mitochondria are unable to undergo fusion. By using TMRE to co-stain mitochondria in the PAGFPmt fusion assay, it is possible to monitor if the photoconversion event itself caused depolarization of mitochondria. In order to determine the correct laser parameters to use for PAGFPmt photoconversion, increasing doses of laser intensity must be tested in order to determine if the TMRE fluorescence intensity is affected. It is important to consider that in order to use such low photoconversion stimuli, it is necessary to have sufficient expression of mitochondrial PAGFPmt. With the described lentiviral delivery system, it has been found that increases in dosage of virus for transduction correlates with greater expression efficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring image acquisition, it is essential to carefully monitor the images for the effects of photobleaching or saturation. Photobleaching occurs when the 488 nM excitation laser is too strong. This can confound the measurements of PAGFPmt dilution and overestimate the level of mitochondrial fusion. To determine the laser intensity that does not cause bleaching, PAGFPmt intensity should be monitored over time in a system where mitochondrial fusion is blocked. It has been shown that MEF cells lacking MFN1 have mitochondria that are fragmented and unable to undergo fusion. These cells do not exhibit dilution of the mitochondrial PAGFPmt signal over time. It has been found that INS1 cells treated with high levels of fatty acid and glucose also exhibit mitochondrial fragmentation and generate a non-fusing mitochondrial sub-population (Molina et. al., in press). Using this system, it has been possible to show that the image acquisition protocol described herein does not cause photobleaching as reported by a photoconverted PAGFPmt signal that remains stable for the duration of the recording, up to 2 hours. Alternatively, if non-fusing condition can not be reached, the whole cell mtPAGFP FI should be monitored over time. When appropriate intensity is used in the 488 nm laser, spreading of mtPAGFP signal should not result in the reduction of whole cell mtPAGFP FI. This can be measured by dividing the GFP fluorescence by the entire pixel area of the cell. On a Zeiss LSM 510 system, it is found that using a 25 mW 488 nM argon laser set at 0.2%-0.5% does not cause photobleaching even when 6 image z-stacks are obtained every 5 minutes for a recording time of one hour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPAGFPmt fluorescence saturation is also problematic because it can significantly limit the dynamic range of the fluorescence intensity curve. This would cause some fusion events, especially early in the recording time frame to go unrecognized. In addition to exceedingly strong 488 nM excitation, high gain settings for the image collection CCD camera are a likely culprit for saturation issues. Using the image acquisition software, it is important to ensure that the PAGFPmt image is not saturated after photoconversion to its fluorescent form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor image analysis, it is necessary to set a lower inclusive threshold in order to define which pixels are to be included in the quantification of intensity over time. The parameters that have been chosen for the determination of this threshold have been described earlier. Careful consideration must be applied when choosing this threshold value because picking one that is too low will introduce noise from non mitochondrial fluorescence and one that is too high will limit the bottom end of the PAGFPmt intensity dynamic range. In order to prevent this issue, it is necessary to ensure that the chosen threshold value is suitable not only at \ntime\n 0, right after photoconversion, but also at the end time point. It is important to make sure that pixels are not lost towards the end of the recording time, when equilibrium has been reached."

The files on each CD-R are accessible using a text-based editor.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates generally to anti-VEGF selected polypeptide sequences and antibodies with beneficial properties for research, therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nAngiogenesis and VEGF\n\n\n \n \n \nAngiogenesis is an important cellular event in which vascular endothelial cells proliferate, prune and reorganize to form new vessels from preexisting vascular network. There are compelling evidences that the development of a vascular supply is essential for normal and pathological proliferative processes (Folkman and Klagsbrun (1987) \nScience \n235:442-447). Delivery of oxygen and nutrients, as well as the removal of catabolic products, represent rate-limiting steps in the majority of growth processes occurring in multicellular organisms. Thus, it has been generally assumed that the vascular compartment is necessary, albeit but not sufficient, not only for organ development and differentiation during embryogenesis, but also for wound healing and reproductive functions in the adult.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAngiogenesis is also implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders, including but not limited to, proliferative retinopathies, age-related macular degeneration, tumors, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and psoriasis. Angiogenesis is a cascade of process consisting of 1) degradation of the extracellular matrix of a local venue after the release of protease, 2) proliferation of capillary endothelial cells, and 3) migration of capillary tubules toward the angiogenic stimulus. Ferrara et al. (1992) Endocrine Rev. 13:18-32.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the remarkable physiological and pathological importance of angiogenesis, much work has been dedicated to the elucidation of the factors capable of regulating this process. It is suggested that the angiogenesis process is regulated by a balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules, and is derailed in various diseases, especially cancer. Carmeliet and Jain (2000) Nature 407:249-257.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), a potent mitogen for vascular endothelial cells, has been reported as a pivotal regulator of both normal and abnormal angiogenesis. Ferrara and Davis-Smyth (1997) \nEndocrine Rev. \n18:4-25; Ferrara (1999) J. Mol. Med. 77:527-543. Compared to other growth factors that contribute to the processes of vascular formation, VEGF is unique in its high specificity for endothelial cells within the vascular system. Recent evidence indicates that VEGF is essential for embryonic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Carmeliet et al. (1996) \nNature \n380:435-439; Ferrara et al. (1996) \nNature \n380:439-442. Furthermore, VEGF is required for the cyclical blood vessel proliferation in the female reproductive tract and for bone growth and cartilage formation. Ferrara et al. (1998) \nNature Med. \n4:336-340; Gerber et al. (1999) \nNature Med. \n5:623-628.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to being an angiogenic factor in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, VEGF, as a pleiotropic growth factor, exhibits multiple biological effects in other physiological processes, such as endothelial cell survival, vessel permeability and vasodilation, monocyte chemotaxis and calcium influx. Ferrara and Davis-Smyth (1997), supra. Moreover, recent studies have reported mitogenic effects of VEGF on a few non-endothelial cell types, such as retinal pigment epithelial cells, pancreatic duct cells and Schwann cells. Guerrin et al. (1995) J. Cell Physiol. 164:385-394; Oberg-Welsh et al. (1997) Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 126:125-132; Sondell et al. (1999) J. Neurosci. 19:5731-5740.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstantial evidence also implicates VEGF's critical role in the development of conditions or diseases that involve pathological angiogenesis. The VEGF mRNA is overexpressed by the majority of human tumors examined (Berkman et al. \nJ Clin Invest \n91:153-159 (1993); Brown et al. \nHuman Pathol. \n26:86-91 (1995); Brown et al. \nCancer Res. \n53:4727-4735 (1993); Mattern et al. \nBrit. J. Cancer. \n73:931-934 (1996); and Dvorak et al. \nAm J. Pathol. \n146:1029-1039 (1995)). Also, the concentration of VEGF in eye fluids are highly correlated to the presence of active proliferation of blood vessels in patients with diabetic and other ischemia-related retinopathies (Aiello et al. \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n331:1480-1487 (1994)). Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated the localization of VEGF in choroidal neovascular membranes in patients affected by AMD (Lopez et al. \nInvest. Ophtalmo. Vis. Sci. \n37:855-868 (1996)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recognition of VEGF as a primary regulator of angiogenesis in pathological conditions has led to numerous attempts to block VEGF activities. Inhibitory anti-VEGF receptor antibodies, soluble receptor constructs, antisense strategies, RNA aptamers against VEGF and low molecular weight VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors have all been proposed for use in interfering with VEGF signaling (Siemeister et al. \nCancer Metastasis Rev. \n17:241-248 (1998). Indeed, anti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies have been shown to suppress the growth of a variety of human tumor cell lines in nude mice (Kim et al. \nNature \n362:841-844 (1993); Warren et al. \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n95:1789-1797 (1995); Borgström et al. \nCancer Res. \n56:4032-4039 (1996); and Melnyk et al. \nCancer Res. \n56:921-924 (1996)) and also inhibit intraocular angiogenesis in models of ischemic retinal disorders (Adamis et al. \nArch. Opthalmol. \n114:66-71 (1996)). Therefore, anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies or other inhibitors of VEGF action are promising candidates for the treatment of solid tumors and various intraocular neovascular disorders. Although the VEGF molecule is upregulated in tumor cells, and its receptors are upregulated in tumor infiltrated vascular endothelial cells, the expression of VEGF and its receptors remain low in normal cells that are not associated with angiogenesis.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies can be manufactured using recombinant DNA technology. Widespread use has been made of monoclonal antibodies, particularly those derived from rodents, however nonhuman antibodies are frequently antigenic in humans. The art has attempted to overcome this problem by constructing “chimeric” antibodies in which a nonhuman antigen-binding domain is coupled to a human constant domain (Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The isotype of the human constant domain may be selected to tailor the chimeric antibody for participation in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. In a further effort to resolve the antigen binding functions of antibodies and to minimize the use of heterologous sequences in human antibodies, humanized antibodies have been generated for various antigens in which substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted at regions by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. For example, rodent (CDR) residues have been substituted for the corresponding segments of a human antibody. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some complementarity determining region (CDR) residues and possibly some framework region (FR) residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534-1536 (1988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral humanized anti-humanVEGF antibodies have been successfully generated, and have shown significant huVEGF-inhibitory activities both in vitro and in vivo. Presta et al. (1997) \nCancer Research \n57:4593-4599; Chen et al. (1999) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n293:865-881. One specific humanized anti-VEGF antibody, the Avastin™ antibody, is currently used in several clinical trials for treating various solid tumors; and another high-affinity variant of the humanized anti-VEGF antibody is currently clinically tested for treating choroidal neovascularization related age macular degeneration (AMD).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to administering a therapeutic antibody to human, preclinical studies in nonhuman mammals are generally desired to evaluate the efficacy and/or toxicity of the antibody. Ideally, the antibodies subject to these studies are capable of recognizing and reacting with high potency to a target antigen endogenous to the host animal such as mouse or nonhuman primate.\n\n\n \nPhage Display\n\n\n \n \n \nPhage display technology has provided a powerful tool for generating and selecting novel proteins that bind to a ligand, such as an antigen. Using the technique of phage display, large libraries of protein variants can be generated and rapidly sorted for those sequences that bind to a target antigen with high affinity. Nucleic acids encoding variant polypeptides are fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a viral coat protein, such as the gene III protein or the gene VIII protein. Monovalent phage display systems where the nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein or polypeptide is fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a portion of the gene III protein have been developed. (Bass, S., \nProteins, \n8:309 (1990); Lowman and Wells, \nMethods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology, \n3:205 (1991)). In a monovalent phage display system, the gene fusion is expressed at low levels and wild type gene III proteins are also expressed so that infectivity of the particles is retained. Methods of generating peptide libraries and screening those libraries have been disclosed in many patents (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,723,286, U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,018, U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,717, U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,908 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,530).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe demonstration of expression of peptides on the surface of filamentous phage and the expression of functional antibody fragments in the periplasm of \nE. coli \nwas important in the development of antibody phage display libraries. (Smith et al., \nScience \n(1985), 228:1315; Skerra and Pluckthun, Science (1988), 240:1038). Libraries of antibodies or antigen binding polypeptides have been prepared in a number of ways including by altering a single gene by inserting random DNA sequences or by cloning a family of related genes. Methods for displaying antibodies or antigen binding fragments using phage display have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,750,373, 5,733,743, 5,837,242, 5,969,108, 6,172,197, 5,580,717, and 5,658,727. The library is then screened for expression of antibodies or antigen binding proteins with desired characteristics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage display technology has several advantages over conventional hybridoma and recombinant methods for preparing antibodies with the desired characteristics. This technology allows the development of large libraries of antibodies with diverse sequences in less time and without the use of animals. Preparation of hybridomas or preparation of humanized antibodies can easily require several months of preparation. In addition, since no immunization is required, phage antibody libraries can be generated for antigens which are toxic or have low antigenicity (Hogenboom, Immunotechniques (1988), 4:1-20). Phage antibody libraries can also be used to generate and identify novel therapeutic antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage display libraries have been used to generate human antibodies from immunized, non-immunized humans, germ line sequences, or naïve B cell Ig repertories (Barbas & Burton, Trends Biotech (1996), 14:230; Griffiths et al., EMBO J. (1994), 13:3245; Vaughan et al., Nat. Biotech. (1996), 14:309; Winter EP 0368 684 B1). Naïve, or nonimmune, antigen binding libraries have been generated using a variety of lymphoidal tissues. Some of these libraries are commercially available, such as those developed by Cambridge Antibody Technology and Morphosys (Vaughan et al. (1996) Nature Biotech 14:309; Knappik et al. (1999) J. Mol. Biol. 296:57). However, many of these libraries have limited diversity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability to identify and isolate high affinity antibodies from a phage display library is important in isolating novel antibodies for therapeutic use. Isolation of high affinity antibodies from a library is dependent on the size of the library, the efficiency of production in bacterial cells and the diversity of the library. See, for e.g., Knappik et al., J. Mol. Biol. (1999), 296:57. The size of the library is decreased by inefficiency of production due to improper folding of the antibody or antigen binding protein and the presence of stop codons. Expression in bacterial cells can be inhibited if the antibody or antigen binding domain is not properly folded. Expression can be improved by mutating residues in turns at the surface of the variable/constant interface, or at selected CDR residues. (Deng et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1994), 269:9533, Ulrich et al., PNAS (1995), 92:11907-11911; Forsberg et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1997), 272:12430). The sequence of the framework region is a factor in providing for proper folding when antibody phage libraries are produced in bacterial cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerating a diverse library of antibodies or antigen binding proteins is also important to isolation of high affinity antibodies. Libraries with diversification in limited CDRs have been generated using a variety of approaches. See, for e.g., Tomlinson, Nature Biotech. (2000), 18:989-994. CDR3 regions are of interest in part because they often are found to participate in antigen binding. CDR3 regions on the heavy chain vary greatly in size, sequence and structural conformation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOthers have also generated diversity by randomizing CDR regions of the variable heavy and light chains using all 20 amino acids at each position. It was thought that using all 20 amino acids would result in a large diversity of sequences of variant antibodies and increase the chance of identifying novel antibodies. (Barbas, \nPNAS \n91:3809 (1994); Yelton, D E, \nJ. Immunology, \n155:1994 (1995); Jackson, J. R., \nJ. Immunology, \n154:3310 (1995) and Hawkins, R E, \nJ. Mol. Biology, \n226:889 (1992)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere have also been attempts to create diversity by restricting the group of amino acid substitutions in some CDRs to reflect the amino acid distribution in naturally occurring antibodies. See, Garrard & Henner, \nGene \n(1993), 128:103; Knappik et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol\n. (1999), 296:57. However, these attempts have had varying success and have not been applied in a systematic and quantitative manner. Creating diversity in the CDR regions while minimizing the number of amino acid changes has been a challenge.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel antibodies and polypeptide sequences.

Further, another antibody of this invention is an antibody comprising a variable region of any one of the antibodies of \nFIGS. 2\n, \n7\n, \n24\n-\n29\n and \n34\n-\n43\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one preferred embodiment, the antibodies of this invention are synthesized by recombinant methods rather than produced directly from a hybridoma or derived from an antibody sequence from a hybridoma. In one preferred embodiment, the antibody binds to hVEGF with a Kd value of no more than about 2 nM, no more than about 1 nM, or no more than about 500 pM. According to one embodiment, antibody is a monoclonal antibody. According to another embodiment, the antibody is a multi-specific antibody (e.g., a bispecific antibody).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment of the invention, the high affinity anti-hVEGF antibody is also capable of binding to a VEGF from a non-human mammal species with Kd values comparible to, or at least within ten-fold of, the Kd value for its hVEGF binding. Such antibodies with cross-species high binding affinities are particularly useful for preclinical research as well as diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Some of the antibodies intended for therapeutic use were generated using a target human antigen as the immunogen. The resultant antibody may be “species-dependent”, i.e. while binding specifically to human antigen, it may be much less effective at binding a homologue of that antigen from a nonhuman mammal. This is found herein to be problematic, particularly where the nonhuman mammal is one in which preclinical studies of the antibody are to be carried out. An example is the anti-VEGF antibody, the Avastin™ antibody, used for treating cancers. While the Avastin™ antibody had a strong binding affinity for human VEGF (i.e. K\nd \n1.8 nM), the affinity for murine VEGF was unsuitable for conducting experiments in mouse models.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the antibodies are synthetic antibodies comprising at least one variant CDR in its variable domains, wherein the variant CDR comprises variant amino acid in at least one solvent accessible and highly diverse amino acid position, wherein the variant amino acid is encoded by a nonrandom codon set, and wherein at least 70% of the amino acids encoded by the nonrandom set are target amino acids for that position in known antibody variable domains. The antibody may have a heavy chain variable domain which comprises at least 1, 2 or 3 variant CDRs selected from the group consisting of CDR H1, H2 and H3. Preferably the heavy chain variable domain comprises a variant CDR H3. The antibody may also have a light chain variable domain which comprises at least 1, 2 or 3 variant CDRs selected from the group consisting of CDR L1, L2 and L3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another embodiment, an antibody of this invention binds human VEGF and a rodent VEGF with a desired affinity but does not bind to any one or all of the VEGF-related homologues selected from the group consisting of human VEGF-B, human VEGF-D, and human PIGF-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one preferred embodiment, an antibody of this invention has a combination of three or more of any one of the above-mentioned embodiments. According to another embodiment, a Fab antibody of this invention is conjugated to an agent the will increase the half-life of the Fab antibody. According to one preferred embodiment, the agent is a polypeptide comprising the sequence DICLPRWGCLW (SEQ ID NO:935). In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of this invention do not bind to PIGF, VEGF-D or VEGF-B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a method of selecting a hVEGF antibody from a library of synthetic antibodies comprising: a) generating the library of synthetic antibodies having a designed diversity in at least one of the CDRs; b) contacting the library with hVEGF to form binders; c) separating the binders from the nonbinders, and eluting the binders from the target hVEGF and incubating the binders in a solution with decreasing amounts of the target hVEGF in a concentration from about 0.1 nM to 1000 nM; and d) selecting the binders that can bind to the lowest concentration of the target VEGF and that have an affinity of about 500 pM to 2 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso contemplated are variants of the synthetic antibodies with improved binding affinities to hVEGF or to VEGF of non-human species, or both. Various forms of the antibody and variants thereof are contemplated herein. For example, the antibody mutant may be a full length antibody (e.g. having a human immunoglobulin constant region) or an antibody fragment (e.g. a Fab or F(ab′)\n2\n). Furthermore, the antibody mutant may be labeled with a detectable label, immobilized on a solid phase and/or conjugated with a heterologous compound (such as a cytotoxic agent).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiagnostic and therapeutic uses for the antibody are contemplated. In one diagnostic application, the invention provides a method for determining the presence of a protein of interest comprising exposing a sample suspected of containing the protein to the antibody mutant and determining binding of the antibody mutant to the sample. For this use, the invention provides a kit comprising the antibody mutant and instructions for using the antibody mutant to detect the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides: isolated nucleic acid encoding the antibody; a vector comprising the nucleic acid, optionally, operably linked to control sequences recognized by a host cell transformed with the vector; a host cell transformed with the vector; a process for producing the antibody comprising culturing this host cell so that the nucleic acid is expressed and, optionally, recovering the antibody mutant from the host cell culture (e.g. from the host cell culture medium).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a composition comprising the antibody and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. This composition for therapeutic use is sterile and may be lyophilized. Also contemplated is the use of an antibody or polypeptide of this invention in the manufacture of a medicament for treating an indication described herein. The composition can further comprise a second thereapeutic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, a cytotoxic agent or an anti-angiogenic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides a method for treating a mammal, comprising administering an effective amount of the antibody to the mammal. The mammal to be treated in the method may be a nonhuman mammal, e.g. a primate suitable for gathering preclinical data or a rodent (e.g., mouse or rat or rabbit). The nonhuman mammal may be healthy (e.g. in toxicology studies) or may be suffering from a disorder to be treated with the antibody of interest. In one embodiment, the mammal is suffering from or is at risk of developing abnormal angiogenesis (e.g., pathological angiogenesis). In one specific embodiment, the disorder is a cancer selected from the group consisting of colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), bronchoalveolar carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. In another embodiment, the disorder is a disease caused by ocular neovascularisation, e.g., diabetic blindness, retinopathies, primarily diabetic retinopathy, age-induced macular degeneration and rubeosis. In another embodiment, the mammal to be treated is suffering from or is at risk of developing an edema (e.g., an edema associated with brain tumors, an edema associated with stroke, or a cerebral edema). In another embodiment, the mammal is suffering from or at risk of developing a disorder or illness selected from the group consisting of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, refractory ascites, psoriasis, sarcoidosis, arterial arteriosclerosis, sepsis, burns and pancreatitis. According to another embodiment, the mammal is suffering from or is at risk of developing a genitourinary illness selected from the group consisting of polycystic ovarian disease (POD), endometriosis and uterine fibroids. The amount of antibody administered will be a therapeutically effective amount to treat the disorder. In dose escalation studies, a variety of doses of the antibody may be administered to the mammal. In another embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount of the antibody is administered to a human patient to treat a disorder in that patient. In one preferred embodiment, antibodies of this invention useful for treating inflammatory or immune diseases described herein (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) are Fab or scFv antibodies, especially Fab or scFv antibodies derived from the G6 series of antibodies or the B20 series of antibodies. Antibodies that do not cause aggregation of VEGF and do not aggregate themselves such as the B20 series of IgG antibodies are particularly useful in treating inflammatory and immune diseases. Accordingly, such antibodies can be used in the manufacture of a medicament for treating an inflammatory or immune disease. A mammal that is suffering from or is at risk for developing a disorder or illness described herein can be treated by administering, a second therapeutic agent, simultaneously, sequentially or in combination with, an antibody of this invention. It should be understood that other therapeutic agents, in addition to the second therapeutic agent, can be administered to the mammal or used in the manufacture of a medicament for the desired indications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese antibodies and polypeptides can be used to understand the role of host stromal cell collaboration in the growth of implanted non-host tumors, such as in mouse models wherein human tumors have been implanted. These antibodies and polypeptides can be used in methods of identifying human tumors that can escape anti-VEGF treatment by observing or monitoring the growth of the tumor implanted into a rodent or rabbit after treatment with an anti-VEGF antibodies of this invention. The antibodies and polypeptides of this invention can also be used to study and evaluate combination therapies with anti-VEGF antibodies of this invention and other therapeutic agents. The antibodies and polypeptides of this invention can be used to study the role of VEGF in other diseases by administering the antibodies or polypeptides to an animal suffering from the disease of a similar disease and determining whether one or more symptoms of the disease are alleviated.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n is a schematic illustration of various types of antibody fragments useful for phage display.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n compares residue changes within heavy chain CDRs of the template antibody h4D5 and the four selected novel synthetic antibodies (SEQ ID NO: 921-928). Also compared are VEGF bindings of the four antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n depicts the abilities of VEGF receptors (Flt1-d2 and KDR) to block VEGF bindings of the novel anti-VEGF antibodies. Y0959A, an anti-VEGF variant, was used as control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n shows that the G6 antibody specifically binds to both hVEGF and mVEGF, but not to VEGF-related antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 5A and 5B\n show that G6 can effectively block both hVEGF and mVEGF binding to the KDR receptor. Fab-12 and Y0317 were used as controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 6A-6C\n show effects of G6 on VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 7A and 7B\n illustrate the steps of generating high affinity anti-VEGF antibodies and the list of residues and binding affinities related to various affinity-improved G6 variants  (SEQ ID NO: 44-84).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 8A-8C\n compare VEGF bindings of G6, G6-23 and Fab-12. Association rates (on-rate) to both hVEGF and mVEGF were measured over time; the calculated Kon, Koff and Kd are listed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 9A and 9B\n compare VEGF binding on-rates of G6 and further improved variants of G6-23.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 10A and 10B\n depict the effects of VEGF antagonists (G6-23 and Flt1-3Fc) on neonate mice body weights and survival rates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 11A and 11B\n depict the effects of G6-23 on tumor growth in nude mice with xenografted human tumor cells (KM12 cells and SW480 cells), as measured by tumor volumes over number of treatment days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 12A and 12B\n show VEGF expressions (both hVEGF and mVEGF) in KM12 xenograft mice in the presence or absence of G6-23.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 13\n depicts effects of VEGF antagonists (G6-23 and Flt1-3Fc) on tumor growth in nude mice with xenografted mouse tumor (LL2), as measured by tumor volumes over number of treatment days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 14A and 14B\n describe codons designed for shotgun scanning codons of G6 and G6-23. For each scan, degenerate shotgun codons for (A) heavy and (B) light chain were designed to encode the wild-type amino acid and alanine (m1) in alanine-scan or similar amino acid (m4) in homolog-scan for both G6 and G6-23 Fab. The shotgun codons are represented by the IUB code (K=G/T, M=A/C, R=A/G, S=G/C, V=A/C/G, W=A/T, Y=C/T). More substitutions (m2, m3, and m5) occurred in some residues due to the nature of the genetic code. In the case of wild-type alanine, the shotgun codon was designed to encode alanine and glycine. Each residue on CDRs is denoted by the single-letter code for amino acid, followed by a number denoting its position according to the scheme of Kabat et al., 1987. In positions where the sequences of G6 and G6-23 differ were shown in two letters, e.g. Q89K denotes \nposition\n 89 which is Gln or Lys in G6 or G6-23, respectively. Asterisks (*) indicate both alanine- and homolog-scan codons encode a common substitution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 15\n provides information regarding the construction of G6 and G6-23 shotgun scanning libraries. The shotgun scanning libraries were performed to mutate codons for the indicated residues on the heavy (hc) or light (lc) chain of G6 and G6-23 with either alanine- or homolog-scan shotgun codons (\nFIGS. 14A\n and B). In total, eight libraries were constructed using the mutagenic oligonucleotides as shown in Example 1. The theoretical diversity of each library, total numbers of amino acid combinations encoded by the mutagenic oligonucleotides, was exceeded at least 100-fold by the actual diversity of the constructed library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 16A and 16B\n describe the results of the G6 and G6-23 heavy chain shotgun scan. The effect of each mutation (\nFIGS. 14A and 14B\n) on the heavy chain CDR residues of (A) G6 and (B) G6-23 was evaluated by calculating wt/mut ratios from sequences of functional clones, either from the alanine-scan libraries (m1, m2, and m3) or the homolog-scan libraries (m4 and m5), isolated after binding selection to either hVEGF (target selection) or an anti-gD tag antibody (display selection). To provide a quantitative estimate of the effect of each mutation on the binding affinity of G6 and G6-23 for hVEGF, the function ratio (Fwt/mut) at each mutation site was derived from dividing the wt/mut ratio from target selection by that from display selection. Deleterious effects are indicated by Fwt/mut values greater than 1.0, and mutations that result in significantly deleterious effects (Fwt/mut>10) are shown in bold text. Several mutations were not observed amongst the target selection and only a lower limit could be defined for its wt/mut ratio; therefore, the Fwt/mut value was indicated as a greater sign.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 17A and 17B\n describe the results of the G6 and G6-23 light chain shotgun scan. The effect of each mutation (\nFIGS. 14A and 14B\n) on the light chain CDR residues of (A) G6 and (B) G6-23 was evaluated by calculating wt/mut ratios from sequences of functional clones, either from the alanine-scan libraries (m1, m2, and m3) or the homolog-scan libraries (m4 and m5), isolated after binding selection to either hVEGF (target selection) or an anti-gD tag antibody (display selection). To provide a quantitative estimate of the effect of each mutation on the binding affinity of G6 and G6-23 for hVEGF, the function ratio (Fwt/mut) at each mutation site was derived from dividing the wt/mut ratio from target selection by that from display selection. Deleterious effects are indicated by Fwt/mut values greater than 1.0, and mutations that result in significantly deleterious effects (Fwt/mut>10) are shown in bold text.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 18\n is a comparison of relative binding activities for FabG6 and G6-23 point mutants to hVEGF with function values (Fwt/mut) from shotgun scanning. The relative binding activities of each mutant protein to hVEGF were evaluated with IC50,mut/IC50,wt ratio, a measure of the fold reduction in hVEGF binding activity due to each point mutation. The IC50, wt values for G6 and G6-23 are 2.5 nM and 20 pM respectively. The ratio without showing the standard error is estimated the error is ±5%. The ratios of significantly deleterious mutations could not be precisely quantitated because no inhibition was observed at the highest concentration of hVEGF (1 uM and 0.1 uM for G6 and G6-23 respectively) used in the assay and were only shown as a lower limit (>400 and >5000 for G6 and G6-23 mutants respectively) for fold reduction in hVEGF binding. The function values (Fwt/mut) of shotgun scanning were from \nFIGS. 16 and 17\n. DDGmut-wt values for both mutagenesis scanning were calculated using the equation as indicated in the legend of \nFIGS. 22A and 22B\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 19\n describes the relative binding affinities for as measured by phage ELISAs for phage-derived hVEGF\n1-109 \nsingle alanine mutant to bind different versions of anti-hVEGF antibodies or hVEGF receptors (G6, G6-23, and B20-4 Fabs, monoclonal antibody A4.6.1 and receptors Flt-1 (1-3), Flt-1\nD2 \nand KDR-Ig, respectively). The effects of phage-derived single alanine mutants of hVEGF on the binding affinity of anti-hVEGF antibody and hVEGF receptor were assessed as the relative IC50 values, which are calculated as IC\n50,ala\n/ID\n50,wt \nfrom phage ELISAs. A number greater than 1.0 indicated reduction in binding affinity and any variant with significant relative IC50 values greater than 10 was highlighted as bold text. The IC5\n0,wt \nvalues for G6 and G6-23 are 2.5 nM and 20 pM respectively. The ratio without showing the standard error is estimated that the average error is +/−5%. Because phage ELISAs required substantial binding of the mutant phagemid to its protein target to generate a measurable signal, non-binders (NB) could not be precisely quantitated but may be interpreted to have a greatly reduced binding affinity (greater than 1000 IC50 value).

Definitions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe term “antibody” is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. A “G6 series polypeptide” according to this invention is a polypeptide, including an antibody according to this invention, that is derived from a sequence of a G6 antibody or G6-derived antibody according to any one of \nFIGS. 2\n, \n7\n, \n24\n-\n26\n and \n34\n-\n35\n and binds to human VEGF with a desired affinity according to this invention (e.g., 10 nm or less, 2 nM or less, 1 nM or less, 0.1 nM or less, 500 pM or less for the Fab version of the antibody at 25° C.). A “B20 series polypeptide” according to this invention is a polypeptide, including an antibody according to this invention, that is derived from a sequence of the B20 antibody or a B20-derived antibody according to any one of \nFIGS. 27-29\n and binds to VEGF with a desired affinity according to this invention. A “YADS series polypeptide” or “YADS polypeptide” according to this invention is a polypeptide, including an antibody according to this invention, that is derived from a sequence of the YADS antibody according to any one of \nFIGS. 36-40\n and binds to VEGF with a desired affinity according to this invention. A “YADS-2 series polypeptide” or “YADS2 polypeptide” according to this invention is a polypeptide, including an antibody according to this invention, that is derived from a sequence of the YADS2 antibody according to \nFIG. 36\n or \nFIG. 39\n and binds to VEGF with a desired affinity according to this invention. A “YADS-3 series polypeptide” or “YADS3 polypeptide” according to this invention is a polypeptide, including an antibody according to this invention, that is derived from a sequence of the YADS3 antibody according to \nFIG. 36\n or \nFIG. 39\n and binds to VEGF with a desired affinity according to this invention. “YS series polypeptide” or “YS polypeptide” according to this invention is a polypeptide, including an antibody according to this invention, that is derived from a sequence of a YS antibody according to \nFIG. 41-43\n and binds to VEGF with a desired affinity according to this invention. According to one preferred embodiment, the G series polypeptide, B20 series polypeptide, the YADS series polypeptide, the YADS2 series polypeptide, the YADS3 series polypeptide or the YS series polypeptide binds to human and a non-human mammalian VEGF with a Kd value that is within 10 fold of each other. According to one embodiment, the kD values for those antibodies binding to human VEGF and a mouse VEGF are 10 nM or less. In another embodiment, the antibodies bind to human VEGF and mouse VEGF with Kd values of 2 nM or less. In another embodiment, the antibodies bind to human VEGF with Kd values of 1 nM or less. The affinities of such G6 series, B20 series, YADS and YS series polypeptides for VEGF can be improved by methods, e.g., such as the phage display techniques taught herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “antibody variable domain” refers to the portions of the light and heavy chains of antibody molecules that include amino acid sequences of Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs; ie., CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3), and Framework Regions (FRs). V\nH \nrefers to the variable domain of the heavy chain. V\nL \nrefers to the variable domain of the light chain. According to the methods used in this invention, the amino acid positions assigned to CDRs and FRs may be defined according to Kabat (Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1987 and 1991)). Amino acid numbering of antibodies or antigen binding fragments is also according to that of Kabat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs; ie., CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3) refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody variable domain the presence of which are necessary for antigen binding. Each variable domain typically has three CDR regions identified as CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3. Each complementarity determining region may comprise amino acid residues from a “complementarity determining region” as defined by Kabat (i.e. about residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)) and/or those residues from a “hypervariable loop” (i.e. about residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901-917 (1987)). In some instances, a complementarity determining region can include amino acids from both a CDR region defined according to Kabat and a hypervariable loop. For example, the CDRH1 of the heavy chain of antibody 4D5 includes \namino acids\n 26 to 35.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Framework regions” (hereinafter FR) are those variable domain residues other than the CDR residues. Each variable domain typically has four FRs identified as FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4. If the CDRs are defined according to Kabat, the light chain FR residues are positioned at about residues 1-23 (LCFR1), 35-49 (LCFR2), 57-88 (LCFR3), and 98-107 (LCFR4) and the heavy chain FR residues are positioned about at residues 1-30 (HCFR1), 36-49 (HCFR2), 66-94 (HCFR3), and 103-113 (HCFR4) in the heavy chain residues. If the CDRs comprise amino acid residues from hypervariable loops, the light chain FR residues are positioned about at residues 1-25 (LCFR1), 33-49 (LCFR2), 53-90 (LCFR3), and 97-107 (LCFR4) in the light chain and the heavy chain FR residues are positioned about at residues 1-25 (HCFR1), 33-52 (HCFR2), 56-95 (HCFR3), and 102-113 (HCFR4) in the heavy chain residues. In some instances, when the CDR comprises amino acids from both a CDR as defined by Kabat and those of a hypervariable loop, the FR residues will be adjusted accordingly. For example, when CDRH1 includes amino acids H26-H35, the heavy chain FR1 residues are at positions 1-25 and the FR2 residues are at positions 36-49.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “codon set” refers to a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids. A set of oligonucleotides can be synthesized, for example, by solid phase synthesis, including sequences that represent all possible combinations of nucleotide triplets provided by the codon set and that will encode the desired group of amino acids. A standard form of codon designation is that of the IUB code, which is known in the art and described herein. A codon set typically is represented by 3 capital letters in italics, eg. NNK, NNS, XYZ, DVK and the like. A “non-random codon set”, as used herein, thus refers to a codon set that encodes select amino acids that fulfill partially, preferably completely, the criteria for amino acid selection as described herein. Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide “degeneracy” at certain positions is well known in that art, for example the TRIM approach (Knappek et al.; J. Mol. Biol. (1999), 296:57-86); Garrard & Henner, Gene (1993), 128:103). Such sets of oligonucleotides having certain codon sets can be synthesized using commercial nucleic acid synthesizers (available from, for example, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.), or can be obtained commercially (for example, from Life Technologies, Rockville, Md.). Therefore, a set of oligonucleotides synthesized having a particular codon set will typically include a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences, the differences established by the codon set within the overall sequence. Oligonucleotides, as used according to the invention, have sequences that allow for hybridization to a variable domain nucleic acid template and also can, but does not necessarily, include restriction enzyme sites useful for, for example, cloning purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “Fv” fragment is an antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight association, which can be covalent in nature, for example in scFv. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the V\nH\n-V\nL \ndimer. Collectively, the six CDRs or a subset thereof confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although usually at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “Fab” fragment contains a variable and constant domain of the light chain and a variable domain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. F(ab′)\n2 \nantibody fragments comprise a pair of Fab fragments which are generally covalently linked near their carboxy termini by hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Single-chain Fv” or “scFv” antibody fragments comprise the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains, which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv, see Pluckthun in \nThe Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies\n, \nVol\n 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “diabodies” refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) in the same polypeptide chain (V\nH \nand V\nL\n). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n90:6444-6448 (1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression “linear antibodies” refers to the antibodies described in Zapata et al., \nProtein Eng., \n8(10):1057-1062 (1995). Briefly, these antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (V\nH\n-C\nH\n1-V\nH\n-C\nH\n1) which, together with complementary light chain polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., \nNature \n256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The “monoclonal antibodies” may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., \nNature \n352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222:581-597 (1991), for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81:6851-6855 (1984)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Humanized” forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.

Biol. \n2:593-596 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “species-dependent antibody” is one which has a stronger binding affinity for an antigen from a first mammalian species than it has for a homologue of that antigen from a second mammalian species. Normally, the species-dependent antibody “binds specifically” to a human antigen (i.e. has a binding affinity (K\nd\n) value of no more than about 1×10\n−7 \nM, preferably no more than about 1×10\n−8 \nM and most preferably no more than about 1×10\n−9 \nM) but has a binding affinity for a homologue of the antigen from a second nonhuman mammalian species which is at least about 50 fold, or at least about 500 fold, or at least about 1000 fold, weaker than its binding affinity for the human antigen. The species-dependent antibody can be any of the various types of antibodies as defined above, but preferably is a humanized or human antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “antibody mutant” or “antibody variant” refers to an amino acid sequence variant of the species-dependent antibody wherein one or more of the amino acid residues of the species-dependent antibody have been modified. Such mutants necessarily have less than 100% sequence identity or similarity with the species-dependent antibody. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody mutant will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain of the species-dependent antibody, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or similarity with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical (i.e same residue) or similar (i.e. amino acid residue from the same group based on common side-chain properties, see below) with the species-dependent antibody residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence outside of the variable domain shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or similarity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo increase the half-life of the antibodies or polypeptide containing the amino acid sequences of this invention, one can attach a salvage receptor binding epitope to the antibody (especially an antibody fragment), as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277. For example, a nucleic acid molecule encoding the salvage receptor binding epitope can be linked in frame to a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide sequence of this invention so that the fusion protein expressed by the engineered nucleic acid molecule comprises the salvage receptor binding epitope and a polypeptide sequence of this invention. As used herein, the term “salvage receptor binding epitope” refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, or IgG\n4\n) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the IgG molecule (e.g., Ghetie, V et al., (2000) \nAnn. Rev. Immunol. \n18:739-766, Table 1). Antibodies with substitutions in an Fc region thereof and increased serum half-lives are also described in WO00/42072 (Presta, L.), WO 02/060919; Shields, R. L., et al., (2001) \nJBC \n276(9):6591-6604; Hinton, P. R., (2004) \nJBC \n279(8):6213-6216). In another embodiment, the serum half-life can also be increased, for example, by attaching other polypeptide sequences. For example, antibodies of this invention or other polypeptide containing the amino acid sequences of this invention can be attached to serum albumin or a portion of serum albumin that binds to the FcRn receptor or a serum albumin binding peptide so that serum albumin binds to the antibody or polypeptide, e.g., such polypeptide sequences are disclosed in WO01/45746. In one preferred embodiment, the serum albumin peptide to be attached comprises an amino acid sequence of DICLPRWGCLW. In another embodiment, the half-life of a Fab according to this invention is increased by these methods. See also, Dennis, M. S., et al., (2002) \nJBC \n277(38):35035-35043 for serum albumin binding peptide sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “isolated” antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “angiogenic factor or agent” is a growth factor which stimulates the development of blood vessels, e.g., promote angiogenesis, endothelial cell growth, stability of blood vessels, and/or vasculogenesis, etc. For example, angiogenic factors, include, but are not limited to, e.g., VEGF and members of the VEGF family, PIGF, PDGF family, fibroblast growth factor family (FGFs), TIE ligands (Angiopoietins), ephrins, Del-1, fibroblast growth factors: acidic (aFGF) and basic (bFGF), Follistatin, Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/scatter factor (SF), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Leptin, Midkine, Placental growth factor, Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), Platelet-derived growth factor, especially PDGF-BB or PDGFR-beta, Pleiotrophin (PTN), Progranulin, Proliferin, Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/vascular permeability factor (VPF), etc. It would also include factors that accelerate wound healing, such as growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), VIGF, epidermal growth factor (EGF), CTGF and members of its family, and TGF-alpha and TGF-beta. See, e.g., Klagsbrun and D'Amore, \nAnnu. Rev. Physiol., \n53:217-39 (1991); Streit and Detmar, \nOncogene, \n22:3172-3179 (2003); Ferrara & Alitalo, \nNature Medicine \n5(12):1359-1364 (1999); Tonini et al., \nOncogene, \n22:6549-6556 (2003) (e.g., Table 1 listing known angiogenic factors); and, Sato \nInt. J. Clin. Oncol., \n8:200-206 (2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “anti-angiogenesis agent” or “angiogenesis inhibitor” refers to a small molecular weight substance, an polynucleotide, an polypeptide, an isolated protein, a recombinant protein, an antibody, or conjugates or fusion proteins thereof, that inhibits angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, or undesirable vascular permeability, either directly or indirectly. It should be understood that the anti-angiogenesis agent includes those agents that bind and block the angiogenic activity of the angiogenic factor or its receptor. For example, an anti-angiogenesis agent is an antibody or other antagonist to an angiogenic agent as defined above, e.g., antibodies to VEGF-A or to the VEGF-A receptor (e.g., KDR receptor or Flt-1 receptor), anti-PDGFR inhibitors such as Gleevec™ (Imatinib Mesylate). Anti-angiogensis agents also include native angiogenesis inhibitors, e.g., angiostatin, endostatin, etc. See, e.g., Klagsbrun and D'Amore, \nAnnu. Rev. Physiol., \n53:217-39 (1991); Streit and Detmar, \nOncogene, \n22:3172-3179 (2003) (e.g., Table 3 listing anti-angiogenic therapy in malignant melanoma); Ferrara & Alitalo, \nNature Medicine \n5(12):1359-1364 (1999); Tonini et al., \nOncogene, \n22:6549-6556 (2003) (e.g., Table 2 listing known antiangiogenic factors); and, Sato \nInt. J. Clin. Oncol., \n8:200-206 (2003) (e.g., Table 1 lists anti-angiogenic agents used in clinical trials).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “Kd” or “Kd value” according to this invention is in one preferred embodiment measured by a radiolabeled VEGF binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of the antibody and a VEGF molecule as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for VEGF by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (\n125\nI)-labeled VEGF(109) in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled VEGF, then capturing bound VEGF with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (Chen, et al., (1999) \nJ. Mol Biol \n293:865-881). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 ug/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23° C.). In a non-adsorbant plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [\n125\nI]VEGF(109) are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest, e.g., Fab-12 (Presta et al., (1997) \nCancer Res. \n57:4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for 65 hours to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature for one hour. The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates had dried, 150 ul/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25° C. with immobilized hVEGF (8-109) CM5 chips at ˜10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Human VEGF is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5 ug/ml (˜0.2 uM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 ul/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of human VEGF, 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25° C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 ul/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999) \nJ. Mol Biol \n293:865-881. If the on-rate exceeds 10\n6 \nM\n−1 \nS\n−1 \nby the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate is can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25° C. of a 20 nM anti-VEGF antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of human VEGF short form (8-109) or mouse VEGF as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “on-rate” or “rate of association” or “association rate” or “k\non\n” according to this invention is preferably determined with same surface plasmon resonance technique described above using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25° C. with immobilized hVEGF (8-109) CM5 chips at ˜10 response units (RU).

For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25° C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 ul/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999) \nJ. Mol Biol \n293:865-881. However, if the on-rate exceeds 10\n6 \nM\n−1 \nS\n−1 \nby the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate is preferably determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25° C. of a 20 nM anti-VEGF antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of human short form (8-109) or mouse VEGF as measured in a a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “functional epitope” according to this invention refers to amino acid residues of an antigen that contribute energetically to the binding of an antibody. Mutation of any one of the energetically contributing residues of the antigen (for example, mutation of wild-type VEGF by alanine or homolog mutation) will disrupt the binding of the antibody such that the relative affinity ratio (IC50mutant VEGF/IC50wild-type VEGF) of the antibody will be greater than 5 (see Example 2). In a preferred embodiment, the relative affinity ratio is determined by a solution binding phage displaying ELISA. Briefly, 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates (NUNC) are coated overnight at 4° C. with an Fab form of the antibody to be tested at a concentration of 2 ug/ml in PBS, and blocked with PBS, 0.5% BSA, and 0.05% Tween20 (PBT) for 2 h at room temperature. Serial dilutions of phage displaying hVEGF alanine point mutants (residues 8-109 form) or wild type hVEGF (8-109) in PBT are first incubated on the Fab-coated plates for 15 min at room temperature, and the plates are washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween20 (PBST). The bound phage is detected with an anti-M13 monoclonal antibody horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia) conjugate diluted 1:5000 in PBT, developed with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Kirkegaard & Perry Labs, Gaithersburg, Md.) substrate for approximately 5 min, quenched with 1.0 M H\n3\nPO\n4\n, and read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. The ratio of IC50 values (IC50,ala/IC50,wt) represents the fold of reduction in binding affinity (the relative binding affinity).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor competitive binding assays, Maxisorb plates are coated and blocked as above, and serial threefold dilutions of unlabeled VEGF(109) are made in PBS/Tween buffer in a Nunc plate. [\n125\nI]VEGF(109) is added, followed by addition of a fixed concentration of the Fab of interest. The final concentrations of the Fab of interest are 100 pM and 10 pM, respectively. After incubation (as above), bound VEGF is captured and quantified as described above. The binding data is analyzed using a computer program to perform Scatchard analysis (P. Munson et al., (1980) \nAnal. Biochem\n. (1980) 107:220-239) for determination of the dissociation binding constants, K\nd\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “library” refers to a plurality of antibody or antibody fragment sequences (for example, polypeptides of the invention), or the nucleic acids that encode these sequences, the sequences being different in the combination of variant amino acids that are introduced into these sequences according to the methods of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Phage display” is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to at least a portion of coat protein on the surface of phage, e.g., filamentous phage, particles. A utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of randomized protein variants can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target antigen with high affinity. Display of peptide and protein libraries on phage has been used for screening millions of polypeptides for ones with specific binding properties. Polyvalent phage display methods have been used for displaying small random peptides and small proteins through fusions to either gene III or gene VIII of filamentous phage. Wells and Lowman, \nCurr. Opin. Struct. Biol., \n3:355-362 (1992), and references cited therein. In a monovalent phage display, a protein or peptide library is fused to a gene III or a portion thereof, and expressed at low levels in the presence of wild type gene III protein so that phage particles display one copy or none of the fusion proteins. Avidity effects are reduced relative to polyvalent phage so that sorting is on the basis of intrinsic ligand affinity, and phagemid vectors are used, which simplify DNA manipulations. Lowman and Wells, \nMethods: A companion to Methods in Enzymology, \n3:205-0216 (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “phagemid” is a plasmid vector having a bacterial origin of replication, e.g., Co1E1, and a copy of an intergenic region of a bacteriophage. The phagemid may be used on any known bacteriophage, including filamentous bacteriophage and lambdoid bacteriophage. The plasmid will also generally contain a selectable marker for antibiotic resistance. Segments of DNA cloned into these vectors can be propagated as plasmids. When cells harboring these vectors are provided with all genes necessary for the production of phage particles, the mode of replication of the plasmid changes to rolling circle replication to generate copies of one strand of the plasmid DNA and package phage particles. The phagemid may form infectious or non-infectious phage particles. This term includes phagemids which contain a phage coat protein gene or fragment thereof linked to a heterologous polypeptide gene as a gene fusion such that the heterologous polypeptide is displayed on the surface of the phage particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “phage vector” means a double stranded replicative form of a bacteriophage containing a heterologous gene and capable of replication. The phage vector has a phage origin of replication allowing phage replication and phage particle formation. The phage is preferably a filamentous bacteriophage, such as an M13, fl, fd, Pf3 phage or a derivative thereof, or a lambdoid phage, such as lambda, 21, phi80, phi81, 82, 424, 434, etc., or a derivative thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “solvent accessible position” refers to a position of an amino acid residue in the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of a source antibody or antigen binding fragment that is determined, based on structure, ensemble of structures and/or modeled structure of the antibody or antigen binding fragment, as potentially available for solvent access and/or contact with a molecule, such as an antibody-specific antigen. These positions are typically found in the CDRs and on the exterior of the protein. The solvent accessible positions of an antibody or antigen binding fragment, as defined herein, can be determined using any of a number of algorithms known in the art. Preferably, solvent accessible positions are determined using coordinates from a 3-dimensional model of an antibody, preferably using a computer program such as the InsightII program (Accelrys, San Diego, Calif.). Solvent accessible positions can also be determined using algorithms known in the art (e.g., Lee and Richards, J. Mol. Biol. 55, 379 (1971) and Connolly, J. Appl. Cryst. 16, 548 (1983)). Determination of solvent accessible positions can be performed using software suitable for protein modeling and 3-dimensional structural information obtained from an antibody. Software that can be utilized for these purposes includes SYBYL Biopolymer Module software (Tripos Associates). Generally and preferably, where an algorithm (program) requires a user input size parameter, the “size” of a probe which is used in the calculation is set at about 1.4 Angstrom or smaller in radius. In addition, determination of solvent accessible regions and area methods using software for personal computers has been described by Pacios ((1994) “ARVOMOL/CONTOUR: molecular surface areas and volumes on Personal Computers.” \nComput. Chem. \n18(4): 377-386; and (1995). “Variations of Surface Areas and Volumes in Distinct Molecular Surfaces of Biomolecules.” \nJ. Mol. Model. \n1: 46-53.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Treatment” refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those in which the disorder is to be prevented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “disorder” is any condition that would benefit from treatment with the antibody. For example, mammals who suffer from or need prophylaxis against abnormal angiogenesis (excessive, inappropriate or uncontrolled angiogenesis) or vascular permeability. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples of disorders to be treated herein include malignant and benign tumors; non-leukemias and lymphoid malignancies; neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic and other glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal and blastocoelic disorders; and inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term abnormal angiogenesis occurs when new blood vessels either grow excessively, insufficiently or inappropriately (e.g., the location, timing or onset of the angiogenesis being undesired from a medical standpoint) in a diseased state or such that it causes a diseased state. Excessive, inappropriate or uncontrolled angiogenesis occurs when there is new blood vessel growth that contributes to the worsening of the diseased state or causes a diseased state, such as in cancer, especially vascularized solid tumors and metastatic tumors (including colon, lung cancer (especially small-cell lung cancer), or prostate cancer), diseases caused by ocular neovascularisation, especially diabetic blindness, retinopathies, primarily diabetic retinopathy or age-induced macular degeneration and rubeosis; psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, haemangioblastoma such as haemangioma; inflammatory renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, especially mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, diabetic nephropathy or hypertensive nephrosclerosis; various imflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, especially rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psorsasis, sarcoidosis, arterial arteriosclerosis and diseases occurring after transplants, endometriosis or chronic asthma and more than 70 other conditions. The new blood vessels can feed the diseased tissues, destroy normal tissues, and in the case of cancer, the new vessels can allow tumor cells to escape into the circulation and lodge in other organs (tumor metastases). Insufficient angiogenesis occurs when there is inadequate blood vessels growth that contributes to the worsening of a diseased state, e.g., in diseases such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and delayed wound healing. Further, ulcers, strokes, and heart attacks can result from the absence of angiogenesis that normally required for natural healing. The present invention contemplates treating those patients that are at risk of developing the above-mentioned illnesses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther patients that are candidates for receiving the antibodies or polypeptides of this invention have, or are at risk for developing, abnormal proliferation of fibrovascular tissue, acne rosacea, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, artery occlusion, atopic keratitis, bacterial ulcers, Bechets disease, blood borne tumors, carotid obstructive disease, choroidal neovascularization, chronic inflammation, chronic retinal detachment, chronic uveitis, chronic vitritis, contact lens overwear, corneal graft rejection, corneal neovascularization, corneal graft neovascularization, Crohn's disease, Eales disease, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, fungal ulcers, Herpes simplex infections, Herpes zoster infections, hyperviscosity syndromes, Kaposi's sarcoma, leukemia, lipid degeneration, Lyme's disease, marginal keratolysis, Mooren ulcer, Mycobacteria infections other than leprosy, myopia, ocular neovascular disease, optic pits, Osler-Weber syndrome (Osler-Weber-Rendu, osteoarthritis, Pagets disease, pars planitis, pemphigoid, phylectenulosis, polyarteritis, post-laser complications, protozoan infections, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, pterygium keratitis sicca, radial keratotomy, retinal neovascularization, retinopathy of prematurity, retrolental fibroplasias, sarcoid, scleritis, sickle cell anemia, Sogrens syndrome, solid tumors, Stargarts disease, Steven's Johnson disease, superior limbic keratitis, syphilis, systemic lupus, Terrien's marginal degeneration, toxoplasmosis, trauma, tumors of Ewing sarcoma, tumors of neuroblastoma, tumors of osteosarcoma, tumors of retinoblastoma, tumors of rhabdomyosarcoma, ulcerative colitis, vein occlusion, Vitamin A deficiency and Wegeners sarcoidosis, undesired angiogenesis associated with diabetes, parasitic diseases, abnormal wound healing, hypertrophy following surgery, injury or trauma, inhibition of hair growth, inhibition of ovulation and corpus luteum formation, inhibition of implantation and inhibition of embryo development in the uterus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-angiogenesis therapies are useful in the general treatment of graft rejection, lung inflammation, nephrotic syndrome, preeclampsia, pericardial effusion, such as that associated with pericarditis, and pleural effusion, diseases and disorders characterized by undesirable vascular permeability, e.g., edema associated with brain tumors, ascites associated with malignancies, Meigs' syndrome, lung inflammation, nephrotic syndrome, pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, permeability associated with cardiovascular diseases such as the condition following myocardial infarctions and strokes and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther angiogenesis-dependent diseases according to this invention include angiofibroma (abnormal blood of vessels which are prone to bleeding), neovascular glaucoma (growth of blood vessels in the eye), arteriovenous malformations (abnormal communication between arteries and veins), nonunion fractures (fractures that will not heal), atherosclerotic plaques (hardening of the arteries), pyogenic granuloma (common skin lesion composed of blood vessels), scleroderma (a form of connective tissue disease), hemangioma (tumor composed of blood vessels), trachoma (leading cause of blindness in the third world), hemophilic joints, vascular adhesions and hypertrophic scars (abnormal scar formation).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “VEGF” or “VEGF” as used herein refers to the 165-amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factor and related 121-, 189-, and 206-amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factors, as described by Leung et al. \nScience, \n246:1306 (1989), and Houck et al. \nMol. Endocrin., \n5:1806 (1991), together with the naturally occurring allelic and processed forms thereof. The term “VEGF” also refers to VEGFs from non-human species such as mouse, rat or primate. Sometimes the VEGF from a specific species are indicated by terms such as hVEGF for human VEGF, mVEGF for murine VEGF, and etc. The term “VEGF” is also used to refer to truncated forms of the polypeptide comprising \namino acids\n 8 to 109 or 1 to 109 of the 165-amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factor. Reference to any such forms of VEGF may be identified in the present application, e.g., by “VEGF (8-109),” “VEGF (1-109)” or “VEGF\n165\n.” The amino acid positions for a “truncated” native VEGF are numbered as indicated in the native VEGF sequence. For example, amino acid position 17 (methionine) in truncated native VEGF is also position 17 (methionine) in native VEGF. The truncated native VEGF has binding affinity for the KDR and Flt-1 receptors comparable to native VEGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “VEGF variant” as used herein refers to a VEGF polypeptide which includes one or more amino acid mutations in the native VEGF sequence. Optionally, the one or more amino acid mutations include amino acid substitution(s). For purposes of shorthand designation of VEGF variants described herein, it is noted that numbers refer to the amino acid residue position along the amino acid sequence of the putative native VEGF (provided in Leung et al., supra and Houck et al., supra.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “cancer” and “cancerous” refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney cancer, renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma and various types of head and neck cancer. “Mammal” for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, nonhuman primates, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, cats, cows, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “anti-neoplastic composition” refers to a composition useful in treating cancer comprising at least one active therapeutic agent, e.g., “anti-cancer agent.” Examples of therapeutic agents (anti-cancer agents) include, but are limited to, e.g., chemotherapeutic agents, growth inhibitory agents, cytotoxic agents, agents used in radiation therapy, anti-angiogenesis agents, apoptotic agents, anti-tubulin agents, and other-agents to treat cancer, such as anti-HER-2 antibodies, anti-CD20 antibodies, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonist (e.g., a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), HER1/EGFR inhibitor (e.g., erlotinib (Tarceva™), platelet derived growth factor inhibitors (e.g., Gleevec™ (Imatinib Mesylate)), a COX-2 inhibitor (e.g., celecoxib), interferons, cytokines, antagonists (e.g., neutralizing antibodies) that bind to one or more of the following targets ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, PDGFR-beta, BlyS, APRIL, BCMA or VEGF receptor(s), TRAIL/Apo2, and other bioactive and organic chemical agents, etc. Combinations thereof are also included in the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “epitope tagged” when used herein refers to an antibody mutant fused to an “epitope tag”. The epitope tag polypeptide has enough residues to provide an epitope against which an antibody thereagainst can be made, yet is short enough such that it does not interfere with activity of the antibody mutant. The epitope tag preferably also is fairly unique so that the antibody thereagainst does not substantially cross-react with other epitopes. Suitable tag polypeptide generally have at least 6 amino acid residues and usually between about 8-50 amino acid residues (preferably between about 9-30 residues). Examples include the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 (Field et al. \nMol. Cell. Biol. \n8:2159-2165 (1988)); the c-myc tag and the 8F9, 3C7, 6E10, G4, B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereagainst (Evan et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol. \n5(12):3610-3616 (1985)); and the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) tag and its antibody (Paborsky et al., \nProtein Engineering \n3(6):547-553 (1990)). In certain embodiments, the epitope tag is a “salvage receptor binding epitope”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cytotoxic agent” as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g., I\n131\n, I\n125\n, Y\n90 \nand Re\n186\n), chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, or fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “chemotherapeutic agent” is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer.

See, e.g., Wilman, “Prodrugs in Cancer Chemotherapy” \nBiochemical Society Transactions, \n14, pp. 375-382, 615th Meeting Belfast (1986) and Stella et al., “Prodrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery,” \nDirected Drug Delivery\n, Borchardt et al., (ed.), pp. 247-267, Humana Press (1985). The prodrugs of this invention include, but are not limited to, phosphate-containing prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing prodrugs, sulfate-containing prodrugs, peptide-containing prodrugs, D-amino acid-modified prodrugs, glycosylated prodrugs, β-lactam-containing prodrugs, optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide-containing prodrugs, 5-fluorocytosine and other 5-fluorouridine prodrugs which can be converted into the more active cytotoxic free drug. Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, those chemotherapeutic agents described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the patient can be treated with an antibody of the invention in conjunction with any one or more of the following drugs: DMARDS (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (e.g., methotrexate), NSAI or NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), HUMIRA™ (adalimumab; Abbott Laboratories), ARAVA® (leflunomide), REMICADE® (infliximab; Centocor Inc., of Malvern, Pa.), ENBREL™ (etanercept; Immunex, WA), COX-2 inhibitors. DMARDs commonly used in RA are hydroxycloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide, etanercept, infliximab, azathioprine, D-penicillamine, Gold (oral), Gold (intramuscular), minocycline, cyclosporine, Staphylococcal protein A immunoadsorption. Adalimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to TNFα. Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to TNFα. Etanercept is an “immunoadhesin” fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand binding portion of the human 75 kD (p75) tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) linked to the Fc portion of a human IgG1. For conventional treatment of RA, see, e.g., “Guidelines for the management of rheumatoid arthritis” \nArthritis \n& \nRheumatism \n46(2): 328-346 (February, 2002). In a specific embodiment, the RA patient is treated with a CD20 antibody of the invention in conjunction with methotrexate (MTX). An exemplary dosage of MTX is about 7.5-25 mg/kg/wk. MTX can be administered orally and subcutaneously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease, the patient can be treated with an antibody of the invention in conjunction with, for example, Remicade® (infliximab; from Centocor Inc., of Malvern, Pa.), ENBREL (etanercept; Immunex, WA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor treatments for SLE, the patient can be treated with an antibody of the invention in conjunction with, for example, a high-dose corticosteroids and/or cyclophosphamide (HDCC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the treatment of psoriasis, patients can be administered an antibody of this invention in conjunction with topical treatments, such as topical steroids, anthralin, calcipotriene, clobetasol, and tazarotene, or with methotrexate, retinoids, cyclosporine, PUVA and UVB therapies. In one embodiment, the psoriasis patient is treated with the antibody sequentially or concurrently with cyclosporine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “isolated” nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the antibody nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the antibody where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression “control sequences” refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid is “operably linked” when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, “operably linked” means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the expressions “cell,” “cell line,” and “cell culture” are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. Thus, the words “transformants” and “transformed cells” include the primary subject cell and cultures derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. Where distinct designations are intended, it will be clear from the context.\n\n\n \nII. Modes for Carrying out the Invention\n\n\nSynthetic High-Affinity Anti-VEGF Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention herein provides novel anti-VEGF antibodies with high binding affinity to VEGF. Exemplary methods for generating antibodies are described in more detail in the following sections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe novel anti-VEGF antibodies are selected using the VEGF antigen derived from a first mammalian species. Preferably the antigen is human VEGF (hVEGF). However, VEGFs from other species such as murine VEGF (mVEGF) can also be used as the first target antigen. The VEGF antigens from various mammalian species may be isolated from natural sources. In other embodiments, the antigen is produced recombinantly or made using other synthetic methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody selected will normally have a sufficiently strong binding affinity for the first VEGF antigen. For example, the antibody may bind hVEGF with a K\nd \nvalue of no more than about 5 nM, preferably no more than about 2 nM, and more preferably no more than about 500 pM. Antibody affinities may be determined by a surface plasmon resonance based assay (such as the BIAcore assay as described in Examples); enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA); and competition assays (e.g. RIA's), for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the antibody may be subjected to other biological activity assays, e.g., in order to evaluate its effectiveness as a therapeutic. Such assays are known in the art and depend on the target antigen and intended use for the antibody. Examples include the HUVEC inhibition assay (as described in the Examples below); tumor cell growth inhibition assays (as described in WO 89/06692, for example); antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) assays (U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362); and agonistic activity or hematopoiesis assays (see WO 95/27062).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo screen for antibodies which bind to a particular epitope on the antigen of interest, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in \nAntibodies, A Laboratory Manual\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping, e.g. as described in Champe et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n270:1388-1394 (1995), can be performed to determine whether the antibody binds an epitope of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecies-specificity of the novel antibodies is then determined. The binding affinity of the antibody for a homologue of the antigen used to select the antibody (where the homologue is from the “second mammalian species”) is assessed using techniques such as those described above. In preferred embodiments, the second mammalian species is a nonhuman mammal to which the antibody will be administered in preclinical studies. Accordingly, the second mammalian species may be a nonhuman primate, such as rhesus, cynomolgus, baboon, chimpanzee and macaque. In other embodiment, the second mammalian species may be a rodent (e.g., mouse or rat), cat or dog, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the preferred method of the instant invention for determining species-dependence (and for evaluating antibody mutants with improved properties; see below) is to quantify antibody binding affinity, in other embodiments of the invention, one or more biological properties of the synthetic antibody and antibody variants are evaluated in addition to, or instead of, binding affinity determinations. Exemplary such biological assays are described above. Such assays are particularly useful where they provide an indication as to the therapeutic effectiveness of the antibody. Normally, though not necessarily, antibodies which show improved properties in such assays, will also have an enhanced binding affinity. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention where the assay of choice is a biological activity assay other than an binding affinity assay, the species-dependent antibody will normally have a “biological activity” using “material” (e.g. antigen, cell, tissue, organ or whole animal) from the second mammalian species which is at least about 50 fold, or at least about 500 fold, or at least about 1000 fold, less effective than its biological activity in a corresponding assay using reagents from the first mammalian species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe species-dependent antibody is then altered so as to generate an antibody mutant which has a stronger binding affinity for the antigen from the second mammalian species, than the species-dependent antibody. The antibody mutant preferably has a binding affinity for the antigen from the nonhuman mammal which is at least about 10 fold stronger, preferably at least about 20 fold stronger, more preferably at least about 50 fold stronger, and sometimes at least about 100 fold or 200 fold stronger, than the binding affinity of the species-dependent antibody for the antigen. The enhancement in binding affinity desired or required will depend on the initial binding affinity of the species-dependent antibody. Where the assay used is a biological activity assay, the antibody mutant preferably has a biological activity in the assay of choice which is at least about 10 fold better, preferably at least about 20 fold better, more preferably at least about 50 fold better, and sometimes at least about 100 fold or 200 fold better, than the biological activity of the species-dependent antibody in that assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo generate the antibody mutant, one or more amino acid alterations (e.g. substitutions) are introduced in one or more of the hypervariable regions of the species-dependent antibody. Alternatively, or in addition, one or more alterations (e.g. substitutions) of framework region residues may be introduced in the species-dependent antibody where these result in an improvement in the binding affinity of the antibody mutant for the antigen from the second mammalian species. Examples of framework region residues to modify include those which non-covalently bind antigen directly (Amit et al. \nScience \n233:747-753 (1986)); interact with/effect the conformation of a CDR (Chothia et al. \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901-917 (1987)); and/or participate in the V\nL\n-V\nH \ninterface (\nEP\n 239 400B1). In certain embodiments, modification of one or more of such framework region residues results in an enhancement of the binding affinity of the antibody for the antigen from the second mammalian species. For example, from about one to about five framework residues may be altered in this embodiment of the invention. Sometimes, this may be sufficient to yield an antibody mutant suitable for use in preclinical trials, even where none of the hypervariable region residues have been altered. Normally, however, the antibody mutant will comprise additional hypervariable region alteration(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hypervariable region residues which are altered may be changed randomly, especially where the starting binding affinity of the species-dependent antibody for the antigen from the second mammalian species is such that such randomly produced antibody mutants can be readily screened.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne useful procedure for generating such antibody mutants is called “alanine scanning mutagenesis” (Cunningham and Wells \nScience \n244:1081-1085 (1989)). Here, one or more of the hypervariable region residue(s) are replaced by alanine or polyalanine residue(s) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with the antigen from the second mammalian species. Those hypervariable region residue(s) demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other mutations at or for the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. The ala-mutants produced this way are screened for their biological activity as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother procedure for generating such antibody mutants involves affinity maturation using phage display (Hawkins et al. \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n254:889-896 (1992) and Lowman et al. \nBiochemistry \n30(45):10832-10837 (1991)). Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (e.g. 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody mutants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed mutants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g. binding affinity) as herein disclosed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a more systematic method for identifying amino acid residues to modify. According to this method, one identifies hypervariable region residues in the species-dependent antibody which are involved in binding the antigen from the first mammalian species and those hypervariable region residues involved in binding a homologue of that antigen from the second mammalian species. To achieve this, an alanine-scan of the hypervariable region residues of the species-dependent antibody can be performed, with each ala-mutant being testing for binding to the antigen from the first and second mammalian species. Alternatively, the X-ray crystal structures of antibody-antigen complexes are analyzed for contacting residues as well as surrounding residues (as described in Examples). The hypervariable region residues involved in binding the antigen from the first mammalian species (e.g. human), and those involved in binding the homologue of the antigen from the second mammalian species (e.g. nonhuman mammal) are thereby identified. Preferably, those residue(s) significantly involved in binding the antigen from the second mammalian species (e.g. nonhuman mammal), but not the antigen from the first mammalian species (e.g. human), are chosen as candidates for modification. In another embodiment, those residue(s) significantly involved in binding the antigen from both the first and second mammalian species are selected to be modified (see Example below). In yet a further but less preferred embodiment, those residues involved in binding the antigen from the first mammalian species, but not the second mammalian species, are selected for modification. Such modification can involve deletion of the residue or insertion of one or more residues adjacent to the residue. However, normally the modification involves substitution of the residue for another amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNormally one would start with a conservative substitution such as those shown below under the heading of “preferred substitutions”. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity (e.g. binding affinity), then more substantial changes, denominated “exemplary substitutions” in the following table, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, are introduced and the products screened.\n\n\n \nPreferred Substitutions:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOriginal\n\n\nExemplary\n\n\nPreferred\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResidue\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla (A)\n\n\nval; leu; ile\n\n\nval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg (R)\n\n\nlys; gln; asn\n\n\nlys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn (N)\n\n\ngln; his; lys; arg\n\n\ngln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp (D)\n\n\nglu\n\n\nglu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys (C)\n\n\nser\n\n\nser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln (Q)\n\n\nasn\n\n\nasn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlu (E)\n\n\nasp\n\n\nasp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly (G)\n\n\npro; ala\n\n\nala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis (H)\n\n\nasn; gln; lys; arg\n\n\narg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle (I)\n\n\nleu; val; met; ala; phe; norleucine\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu (L)\n\n\nnorleucine; ile; val; met; ala; phe\n\n\nile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys (K)\n\n\narg; gln; asn\n\n\narg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet (M)\n\n\nleu; phe; ile\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe (F)\n\n\nleu; val; ile; ala; tyr\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro (P)\n\n\nala\n\n\nala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer (S)\n\n\nthr\n\n\nthr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr (T)\n\n\nser\n\n\nser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp (W)\n\n\ntyr; phe\n\n\ntyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr (Y)\n\n\ntrp; phe; thr; ser\n\n\nphe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal (V)\n\n\nile; leu; met; phe; ala; norleucine\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEven more substantial modifications in the antibodies biological properties are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr, asn, gln;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) acidic: asp, glu;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(4) basic: his, lys, arg;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the sites selected for modification are affinity matured using phage display (see above).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence mutants are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared mutant or a non-mutant version of the species-dependent antibody. The preferred method for making mutants is site directed mutagenesis (see, e.g., Kunkel, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n82:488 (1985)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the antibody mutant will only have a single hypervariable region residue substituted. In other embodiments, two or more of the hypervariable region residues of the species-dependent antibody will have been substituted, e.g. from about two to about ten hypervariable region substitutions. For example, the murinized anti-VEGF antibody variant of the example below had four hypervariable region substitutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrdinarily, the antibody mutant with improved biological properties will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain of the species-dependent antibody, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or similarity with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical (i.e same residue) or similar (i.e. amino acid residue from the same group based on common side-chain properties, see above) with the species-dependent antibody residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence outside of the variable domain shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or similarity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing production of the antibody mutant, the biological activity of that molecule relative to the species-dependent antibody is determined. As noted above, this may involve determining the binding affinity and/or other biological activities of the antibody. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a panel of antibody mutants are prepared above and are screened for binding affinity for the antigen from the second mammalian species. One or more of the antibody mutants selected from this initial screen are optionally subjected to one or more further biological activity assays to confirm that the antibody mutant(s) with enhanced binding affinity are indeed useful, e.g. for preclinical studies. In preferred embodiments, the antibody mutant retains the ability to bind the antigen from the first mammalian species with a binding affinity similar to the species-dependent antibody. This may be achieved by avoiding altering hypervariable region residues involved in binding the antigen from the first mammalian species. In other embodiments, the antibody mutant may have a significantly altered binding affinity for the antigen from the first mammalian species (e.g. the binding affinity for that antigen is preferably better, but may be worse than the species-dependent antibody).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody mutant(s) so selected may be subjected to further modifications, oftentimes depending on the intended use of the antibody. Such modifications may involve further alteration of the amino acid sequence, fusion to heterologous polypeptide(s) and/or covalent modifications such as those elaborated below. With respect to amino acid sequence alterations, exemplary modifications are elaborated above. For example, any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody mutant also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant cross linking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment). Another type of amino acid mutant has an altered glycosylation pattern. This may be achieved by deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody. Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used. Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques for producing antibodies, which may be species-dependent and therefore require modification according to the techniques elaborated herein, follow:\n\n\n \nA. Generation of High-Affinity Anti-VEGF Antibodies From Synthetic Antibody Phage Libraries\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also provide a method for generating and selecting novel high-affinity anti-VEGF antibodies using a unique phage display approach. The approach involves generation of synthetic antibody phage libraries based on single framework template, design of sufficient diversities within variable domains, display of polypeptides having the diversified variable domains, selection of candidate antibodies with high affinity to target VEGF antigen, and isolation of the selected antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetails of the phage display methods can be found, for example, in the provisional U.S. Application No. 60/385,338 (filed Jun. 3, 2002) and relating applications, the entire disclosures of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the antibody libraries used in the invention can be generated by mutating the solvent accessible and/or highly diverse positions in at least one CDR of an antibody variable domain. Some or all of the CDRs can be mutated using the methods provided herein. In some embodiments, it may be preferable to generate diverse antibody libraries by mutating positions in CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3 to form a single library or by mutating positions in CDRL3 and CDRH3 to form a single library or by mutating positions in CDRL3 and CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3 to form a single library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA library of antibody variable domains can be generated, for example, having mutations in the solvent accessible and/or highly diverse positions of CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3. Another library can be generated having mutations in CDRL1, CDRL2 and CDRL3. These libraries can also be used in conjunction with each other to generate binders of desired affinities. For example, after one or more rounds of selection of heavy chain libraries for binding to a target antigen, a light chain library can be replaced into the population of heavy chain binders for further rounds of selection to increase the affinity of the binders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, a library is created by substitution of original amino acids with variant amino acids in the CDRH3 region of the variable region of the heavy chain sequence. The resulting library can contain a plurality of antibody sequences, wherein the sequence diversity is primarily in the CDRH3 region of the heavy chain sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the library is created in the context of the humanized antibody 4D5 sequence, or the sequence of the framework amino acids of the humanized antibody 4D5 sequence. Preferably, the library is created by substitution of at least residues 95-100a of the heavy chain with amino acids encoded by the DVK codon set, wherein the DVK codon set is used to encode a set of variant amino acids for every one of these positions. An example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (DVK)\n7\n. In some embodiments, a library is created by substitution of residues 95-100a with amino acids encoded by both DVK and NNK codon sets. An example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (DVK)\n6 \n(NNK). In another embodiment, a library is created by substitution of at least residues 95-100a with amino acids encoded by both DVK and NNK codon sets. An example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (DVK)\n5 \n(NNK). Another example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (NNK)\n6\n. Other examples of suitable oligonucleotide sequences can be determined by one skilled in the art according to the criteria described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, different CDRH3 designs are utilized to isolate high affinity binders and to isolate binders for a variety of epitopes. The range of lengths of CDRH3 generated in this library is 11 to 13 amino acids, although lengths different from this can also be generated. H3 diversity can be expanded by using NNK, DVK and NVK codon sets, as well as more limited diversity at N and/or C-terminal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiversity can also be generated in CDRH1 and CDRH2. The designs of CDR-H1 and H2 diversities follow the strategy of targeting to mimic natural antibodies repertoire as described with modification that focus the diversity more closely matched to the natural diversity than previous design.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor diversity in CDRH3, multiple libraries can be constructed separately with different lengths of H3 and then combined to select for binders to target antigens. The multiple libraries can be pooled and sorted using solid support selection and solution sorting methods as described previously and herein below. Multiple sorting strategies may be employed. For example, one variation involves sorting on target bound to a solid, followed by sorting for a tag that may be present on the fusion polypeptide (eg. anti-gD tag) and followed by another sort on target bound to solid. Alternatively, the libraries can be sorted first on target bound to a solid surface, the eluted binders are then sorted using solution phase binding with decreasing concentrations of target antigen. Utilizing combinations of different sorting methods provides for minimization of selection of only highly expressed sequences and provides for selection of a number of different high affinity clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh affinity binders for the target VEGF antigen can be isolated from the libraries. Limiting diversity in the H1/H2 region decreases degeneracy about 10\n4 \nto 10\n5 \nfold and allowing more H3 diversity provides for more high affinity binders. Utilizing libraries with different types of diversity in CDRH3 (eg. utilizing DVK or NVT) provides for isolation of binders that may bind to different epitopes of a target antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf the binders isolated from the pooled libraries as described above, it has been discovered that affinity may be further improved by providing limited diversity in the light chain. Light chain diversity is generated in this embodiment as follows in CDRL1: \namino acid position\n 28 is encoded by RDT; \namino acid position\n 29 is encoded by RKT; \namino acid position\n 30 is encoded by RVW; \namino acid position\n 31 is encoded by ANR; \namino acid position\n 32 is encoded by THT; optionally, \namino acid position\n 33 is encoded by CTG; in CDRL2: \namino acid position\n 50 is encoded by KBG; \namino acid position\n 53 is encoded by AVC; and optionally, \namino acid position\n 55 is encoded by GMA; in CDRL3: \namino acid position\n 91 is encoded by TMT or SRT or both; \namino acid position\n 92 is encoded by DMC; \namino acid position\n 93 is encoded by RVT; \namino acid position\n 94 is encoded by NHT; and \namino acid position\n 96 is encoded by TWT or YKG or both.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a library or libraries with diversity in CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3 regions is generated. In this embodiment, diversity in CDRH3 is generated using a variety of lengths of H3 regions and using primarily codon sets XYZ and NNK or NNS. Libraries can be formed using individual oligonucleotides and pooled or oligonucleotides can be pooled to form a subset of libraries. The libraries of this embodiment can be sorted against target bound to solid. Clones isolated from multiple sorts can be screened for specificity and affinity using ELISA assays. For specificity, the clones can be screened against the desired target antigens as well as other nontarget antigens. Those binders to the target VEGF antigen can then be screened for affinity in solution binding competition ELISA assay or spot competition assay. High affinity binders can be isolated from the library utilizing XYZ codon sets prepared as described above. These binders can be readily produced as antibodies or antigen binding fragments in high yield in cell culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, it may be desirable to generate libraries with a greater diversity in lengths of CDRH3 region. For example, it may be desirable to generate libraries with CDRH3 regions ranging from about 7 to 19 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh affinity binders isolated from the libraries of these embodiments are readily produced in bacterial and eukaryotic cell culture in high yield. The vectors can be designed to readily remove sequences such as gD tags, viral coat protein component sequence, and/or to add in constant region sequences to provide for production of full length antibodies or antigen binding fragments in high yield.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA library with mutations in CDRH3 can be combined with a library containing variant versions of other CDRs, for example CDRL1, CDRL2, CDRL3, CDRH1 and/or CDRH2. Thus, for example, in one embodiment, a CDRH3 library is combined with a CDRL3 library created in the context of the humanized 4D5 antibody sequence with variant amino acids at \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 28, 29, 30, 31, and/or 32 using predetermined codon sets. In another embodiment, a library with mutations to the CDRH3 can be combined with a library comprising variant CDRH1 and/or CDRH2 heavy chain variable domains. In one embodiment, the CDRH1 library is created with the humanized antibody 4D5 sequence with variant amino acids at \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n 28, 30, 31, 32 and 33. A CDRH2 library may be created with the sequence of humanized antibody 4D5 with variant amino acids at \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n 50, 52, 53, 54, 56 and 58 using the predetermined codon sets.\n\n\n \nB. Vectors, Host Cells and Recombinant Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-VEGF antibody of the invention can be produced recombinantly, using techniques and materials readily obtainable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor recombinant production of an anti-VEGF antibody, the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated or synthethized using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to DNAs encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\n \n(i) Signal Sequence Component\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibody of this invention may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, which is preferably a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the native antibody signal sequence, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, 1 pp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the native signal sequence may be substituted by, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, a factor leader (including \nSaccharomyces \nand \nKluyveromyces \nα-factor leaders), or acid phosphatase leader, the \nC. albicans \nglucoamylase leader, or the signal described in WO 90/13646. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA for such precursor region is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the antibody.\n\n\n \n(ii) Origin of Replication Component\n\n\n \n \n \nBoth expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally, in cloning vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA, and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2μ plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors (the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter).\n\n\n \n \n(iii) Selection Gene Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for \nBacilli. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid, such as DHFR, thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I and -II, preferably primate metallothionein genes, adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR) transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding antibody, wild-type DHFR protein, and another selectable marker such as \naminoglycoside\n 3′-phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,199.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 (Stinchcomb et al., \nNature, \n282:39 (1979)). The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example, ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1. Jones, \nGenetics, \n85:12 (1977). The presence of the trp1 lesion in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. Similarly, Leu2-deficient yeast strains (ATCC 20,622 or 38,626) are complemented by known plasmids bearing the Leu2 gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, vectors derived from the 1.6 μm circular plasmid pKD1 can be used for transformation of \nKluyveromyces \nyeasts. Alternatively, an expression system for large-scale production of recombinant calf chymosin was reported for \nK. lactis\n. Van den Berg, \nBio/Technology, \n8:135 (1990). Stable multi-copy expression vectors for secretion of mature recombinant human serum albumin by industrial strains of \nKluyveromyces \nhave also been disclosed. Fleer et al., \nBio/Technology, \n9:968-975 (1991).\n\n\n \n(iv) Promoter Component\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the antibody nucleic acid. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the phoA promoter, β-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system, and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. However, other known bacterial promoters are suitable. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPromoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3′ end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3′ end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for \nalcohol dehydrogenase\n 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, metallothionein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73,657. Yeast enhancers also are advantageously used with yeast promoters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and most preferably Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,978. See also Reyes et al., \nNature \n297:598-601 (1982) on expression of human β-interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively, the rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.\n\n\n \n(v) Enhancer Element Component\n\n\n \n \n \nTranscription of a DNA encoding the antibody of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, α-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv, \nNature \n297:17-18 (1982) on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a \nposition\n 5′ or 3′ to the antibody-encoding sequence, but is preferably located at a \nsite\n 5′ from the promoter.\n\n\n \n(vi) Transcription Termination Component\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5′ and, occasionally 3′, untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding the antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94/11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.\n\n\n \n \n(vii) Selection and Transformation of Host Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein are the prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryote cells described above. Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for example, Enterobacteriaceae such as \nEscherichia\n, e.g., \nE. coli, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella\n, e.g., \nSalmonella typhimurium, Serratia\n, e.g., \nSerratia marcescans\n, and \nShigella\n, as well as \nBacilli \nsuch as \nB. subtilis \nand \nB. licheniformis \n(e.g., \nB. licheniformis \n41P disclosed in DD 266,710 published 12 Apr. 1989), \nPseudomonas \nsuch as \nP. aeruginosa\n, and \nStreptomyces\n. One preferred \nE. coli \ncloning host is \nE. coli \n294 (ATCC 31,446), although other strains such as \nE. coli \nB, \nE. coli \nX1776 (ATCC 31,537), and \nE. coli \nW3110 (ATCC 27,325) are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody-encoding vectors. \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n, or common baker's yeast, is the most commonly used among lower eukaryotic host microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, a number of other genera, species, and strains are commonly available and useful herein, such as \nSchizosaccharomyces pombe; Kluyveromyces \nhosts such as, e.g., \nK. lactis, K. fragilis \n(ATCC 12,424), \nK. bulgaricus \n(ATCC 16,045), \nK. wickeramii \n(ATCC 24,178), \nK. waltii \n(ATCC 56,500), \nK. drosophilarum \n(ATCC 36,906), \nK. thermotolerans\n, and \nK. marxianus; yarrowia \n(EP 402,226); \nPichia pastoris \n(EP 183,070); \nCandida; Trichoderma reesia \n(EP 244,234); \nNeurospora crassa; Schwanniomyces \nsuch as \nSchwanniomyces occidentalis\n; and filamentous fungi such as, e.g., \nNeurospora, Penicillium, Tolypocladium\n, and \nAspergillus \nhosts such as \nA. nidulans \nand \nA. niger. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antibody are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as \nSpodoptera frugiperda \n(caterpillar), \nAedes aegypti \n(mosquito), \nAedes albopictus \n(mosquito), \nDrosophila melanogaster \n(fruitfly), and \nBombyx mori \nhave been identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available, e.g., the L-1 variant of \nAutographa californica \nNPV and the Bm-5 strain of \nBombyx mori \nNPV, and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention, particularly for transfection of \nSpodoptera frugiperda \ncells. Plant cell cultures of cotton, corn, potato, soybean, petunia, tomato, and tobacco can also be utilized as hosts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells, and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., \nJ. Gen Virol. \n36:59 (1977)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/−DHFR (CHO, Urlaub et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n77:4216 (1980)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, \nBiol. Reprod. \n23:243-251 (1980)); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (Mather et al., \nAnnals N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n383:44-68 (1982)); \nMRC\n 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma line (Hep G2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n \n(viii) Culturing the Host Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe host cells used to produce the antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in Ham et al., \nMeth. Enz. \n58:44 (1979), Barnes et al., \nAnal. Biochem. \n102:255 (1980), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; 4,560,655; or 5,122,469; WO 90/03430; WO 87/00195; or U.S. Pat. Re. 30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN™ drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n(ix) Antibody Purification\n\n\n \n \n \nWhen using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, is removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al., \nBio/Technology \n10:163-167 (1992) describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of \nE. coli\n. Briefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human γ1, γ2, or γ4 heavy chains (Lindmark et al., \nJ. Immunol. Meth. \n62:1-13 (1983)). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human γ3 (Guss et al., \nEMBO J. \n5:15671575 (1986)). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX™ resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE™ chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).\n\n\n \nC. Pharmaceutical Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \nTherapeutic formulations of the antibody are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (\nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example, it may be desirable to further provide an immunosuppressive agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsule and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsule, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and γ ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37° C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S—S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.\n\n\n \nD. Non-Therapeutic Uses for the Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the invention may be used as affinity purification agents. In this process, the antibodies are immobilized on a solid phase such a Sephadex resin or filter paper, using methods well known in the art. The immobilized antibody is contacted with a sample containing the antigen to be purified, and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except the antigen to be purified, which is bound to the immobilized antibody. Finally, the support is washed with another suitable solvent, such as glycine buffer, pH 5.0, that will release the antigen from the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of this invention may also be useful in diagnostic assays, e.g., for detecting expression of an antigen of interest in specific cells, tissues, or serum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor diagnostic applications, the antibody typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety. Numerous labels are available which can be generally grouped into the following categories:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) Radioisotopes, such as \n35\nS, \n14\nC, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, and \n131\nI. The antibody can be labeled with the radioisotope using the techniques described in \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology\n, \n \nVolumes\n \n 1 and 2, Coligen et al., Ed. Wiley-Interscience, New York, N.Y., Pubs. (1991) for example and radioactivity can be measured using scintillation counting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) Fluorescent labels such as rare earth chelates (europium chelates) or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, Lissamine, phycoerythrin and Texas Red are available. The fluorescent labels can be conjugated to the antibody using the techniques disclosed in \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology\n, supra, for example. Fluorescence can be quantified using a fluorimeter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) Various enzyme-substrate labels are available and U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149 provides a review of some of these. The enzyme generally catalyzes a chemical alteration of the chromogenic substrate which can be measured using various techniques. For example, the enzyme may catalyze a color change in a substrate, which can be measured spectrophotometrically. Alternatively, the enzyme may alter the fluorescence or chemiluminescence of the substrate. Techniques for quantifying a change in fluorescence are described above. The chemiluminescent substrate becomes electronically excited by a chemical reaction and may then emit light which can be measured (using a chemiluminometer, for example) or donates energy to a fluorescent acceptor. Examples of enzymatic labels include luciferases (e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase; U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, malate dehydrogenase, urease, peroxidase such as horseradish peroxidase (HRPO), alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases (e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), heterocyclic oxidases (such as uricase and xanthine oxidase), lactoperoxidase, microperoxidase, and the like. Techniques for conjugating enzymes to antibodies are described in O'Sullivan et al., Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme-Antibody Conjugates for use in Enzyme Immunoassay, in \nMethods in Enzym\n. (ed J. Langone & H. Van Vunakis), Academic press, New York, 73:147-166 (1981).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of enzyme-substrate combinations include, for example:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) Horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) with hydrogen peroxidase as a substrate, wherein the hydrogen peroxidase oxidizes a dye precursor (e.g., orthophenylene diamine (OPD) or 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine hydrochloride (TMB));\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) alkaline phosphatase (AP) with para-Nitrophenyl phosphate as chromogenic substrate; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(iii) β-D-galactosidase (β-D-Gal) with a chromogenic substrate (e.g., p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactosidase) or fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-galactosidase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous other enzyme-substrate combinations are available to those skilled in the art. For a general review of these, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,275,149 and 4,318,980.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSometimes, the label is indirectly conjugated with the antibody. The skilled artisan will be aware of various techniques for achieving this. For example, the antibody can be conjugated with biotin and any of the three broad categories of labels mentioned above can be conjugated with avidin, or vice versa. Biotin binds selectively to avidin and thus, the label can be conjugated with the antibody in this indirect manner. Alternatively, to achieve indirect conjugation of the label with the antibody, the antibody is conjugated with a small hapten (e.g., digoxin) and one of the different types of labels mentioned above is conjugated with an anti-hapten antibody (e.g., anti-digoxin antibody). Thus, indirect conjugation of the label with the antibody can be achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the invention, the antibody need not be labeled, and the presence thereof can be detected using a labeled antibody which binds to the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention may be employed in any known assay method, such as competitive binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays. Zola, \nMonoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques\n, pp. 147-158 (CRC Press, Inc. 1987).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetitive binding assays rely on the ability of a labeled standard to compete with the test sample analyze for binding with a limited amount of antibody. The amount of antigen in the test sample is inversely proportional to the amount of standard that becomes bound to the antibodies. To facilitate determining the amount of standard that becomes bound, the antibodies generally are insolubilized before or after the competition, so that the standard and analyze that are bound to the antibodies may conveniently be separated from the standard and analyze which remain unbound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSandwich assays involve the use of two antibodies, each capable of binding to a different immunogenic portion, or epitope, of the protein to be detected. In a sandwich assay, the test sample analyze is bound by a first antibody which is immobilized on a solid support, and thereafter a second antibody binds to the analyze, thus forming an insoluble three-part complex. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110. The second antibody may itself be labeled with a detectable moiety (direct sandwich assays) or may be measured using an anti-immunoglobulin antibody that is labeled with a detectable moiety (indirect sandwich assay). For example, one type of sandwich assay is an ELISA assay, in which case the detectable moiety is an enzyme.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor immunohistochemistry, the tumor sample may be fresh or frozen or may be embedded in paraffin and fixed with a preservative such as formalin, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies may also be used for in vivo diagnostic assays. Generally, the antibody is labeled with a radionuclide (such as \n111\nIn, \n99\nTc \n14\nC, \n131\nI, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, \n32\nP or \n35\nS), or a dye so that the tumor can be localized using immunoscintiography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a method of detecting VEGF in a biological sample (e.g., tissue, blood, sera, spinal fluid) or a prepared biological sample can comprise the step of contacting an antibody of this invention with the sample and observing the anti-VEGF antibody bound to the VEGF in the sample or determining the amount of the anti-VEGF antibody bound to VEGF in the sample. In another embodiment, a method of detecting VEGF in a subject comprises the step of administering an antibody of this invention to the subject and observing the anti-VEGF antibody bound to the VEGF in the subject or determining the amount of the anti-VEGF antibody bound to VEGF in the subject (e.g., human, mouse, rabbit, rat, etc).\n\n\n \nE. Diagnostic Kits\n\n\n \n \n \nAs a matter of convenience, the antibody of the present invention can be provided in a kit, i.e., a packaged combination of reagents in predetermined amounts with instructions for performing the diagnostic assay. Where the antibody is labeled with an enzyme, the kit will include substrates and cofactors required by the enzyme (e.g., a substrate precursor which provides the detectable chromophore or fluorophore). In addition, other additives may be included such as stabilizers, buffers (e.g., a block buffer or lysis buffer) and the like. The relative amounts of the various reagents may be varied widely to provide for concentrations in solution of the reagents which substantially optimize the sensitivity of the assay. Particularly, the reagents may be provided as dry powders, usually lyophilized, including excipients which on dissolution will provide a reagent solution having the appropriate concentration.\n\n\n \nF. In Vivo Uses for the Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is contemplated that the antibody of the present invention may be used to treat a mammal. In one embodiment, the antibody is administered to a nonhuman mammal for the purposes of obtaining preclinical data, for example. Exemplary nonhuman mammals to be treated include nonhuman primates, dogs, cats, rodents and other mammals in which preclinical studies are performed. Such mammals may be established animal models for a disease to be treated with the antibody or may be used to study toxicity of the antibody of interest. In each of these embodiments, dose escalation studies may be performed in the mammal. Where the antibody is an anti-VEGF antibody, it may be administered to a host rodent in a solid tumor model, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, or in the alternative, the antibody is used to treat a human, e.g. a patient suffering from a disease or disorder who could benefit from administration of the antibody. The conditions which can be treated with the antibody are many and include conditions arising from or exacerbated by abnormal angiogenesis, e.g., by excessive, inappropriate or uncontrolled angiogenesis. For example, such conditions include, cancer such as colorectal cancer and NSCLS and others described above and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and others described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following references describe lymphomas and CLL, their diagnoses, treatment and standard medical procedures for measuring treatment efficacy. Canellos G P, Lister, T A, Sklar J L: The Lymphomas. W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, 1998; van Besien K and Cabanillas, F: Clinical Manifestations, Staging and Treatment of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Chap. 70, pp 1293-1338, in: Hematology, Basic Principles and Practice, 3rd ed. Hoffman et al. (editors). Churchill Livingstone, Philadelphia, 2000; and Rai, K and Patel, D:Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Chap. 72, pp 1350-1362, in: Hematology, Basic Principles and Practice, 3rd ed. Hoffman et al. (editors). Churchill Livingstone, Philadelphia, 2000.\n\n\n \n \nThe parameters for assessing efficacy or success of treatment of an autoimmune or autoimmune related disease will be known to the physician of skill in the appropriate disease. Generally, the physician of skill will look for reduction in the signs and symptoms of the specific disease. The following are by way of examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the methods and compositions of the invention are useful to treat rheumatoid arthritis. RA is characterized by inflammation of multiple joints, cartilage loss and bone erosion that leads to joint destruction and ultimately reduced joint function. Additionally, since RA is a systemic disease, it can have effects in other tissues such as the lungs, eyes and bone marrow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe VEGF binding antibodies can be used as first-line therapy in patients with early RA (i.e., methotrexate (MTX) naive), or in combination with, e.g., MTX or cyclophosphamide. Or, the antibodies can be used in treatment as second-line therapy for patients who were DMARD and/or MTX refractory, in combination with, e.g., MTX. In one preferred embodiment, the VEGF binding antibodies of this invention are administered to mammals who are DMARD and/or MTX refractory. The anti-VEGF antibodies are useful to prevent and control joint damage, delay structural damage, decrease pain associated with inflammation in RA, and generally reduce the signs and symptoms in moderate to severe RA. The RA patient can be treated with the anti-VEGF antibodies of this invention prior to, after or together with treatment with other drugs used in treating RA (see combination therapy below). In one embodiment, patients who had previously failed disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and/or had an inadequate response to methotrexate alone are treated with an anti-VEGF binding antibody. In another embodiment, the patients are administered an anti-VEGF antibody of this invention plus cyclophosphamide or anti-VEGF binding antibody plus methotrexate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne method of evaluating treatment efficacy in RA is based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, which measures the percentage of improvement in tender and swollen joints, among other things. The RA patient can be scored at for example, ACR 20 (20 percent improvement) compared with no antibody treatment (e.g., baseline before treatment) or treatment with placebo. Other ways of evaluating the efficacy of antibody treatment include X-ray scoring such as the Sharp X-ray score used to score structural damage such as bone erosion and joint space narrowing. Patients can also be evaluated for the prevention of or improvement in disability based on Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ] score, AIMS score, SF-36 at time periods during or after treatment. The \nACR\n 20 criteria may include 20% improvement in both tender (painful) joint count and swollen joint count plus a 20% improvement in at least 3 of 5 additional measures:\n\n\n \n \n1. patient's pain assessment by visual analog scale (VAS),\n\n\n2. patient's global assessment of disease activity (VAS),\n\n\n3. physician's global assessment of disease activity (VAS),\n\n\n4. patient's self-assessed disability measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire, and\n\n\n5. acute phase reactants, CRP or ESR.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \n \nACR\n \n 50 and 70 are defined analogously. Preferably, the patient is administered an amount of anti-VEGF binding antibody of the invention alone or in combination with other agents for treating rheumatoid arthritis effective to achieve at least a score of \nACR\n 20, preferably at \nleast ACR\n 30, more preferably at least ACR50, even more preferably at least ACR70, most preferably at \nleast ACR\n 75 and higher.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPsoriatic arthritis has unique and distinct radiographic features. For psoriatic arthritis, joint erosion and joint space narrowing can be evaluated by the Sharp score as well. The anti-VEGF binding antibodies disclosed herein can be used to prevent the joint damage as well as reduce disease signs and symptoms of the disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody is administered by any suitable means, including parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local immunosuppressive treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. In addition, the antibody is suitably administered by pulse infusion, particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Preferably the dosing is given by injections, most preferably intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of antibody will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 μg/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g., 0.1-20 mg/kg) of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 μg/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays. An exemplary dosing regimen for an anti-LFA-1 or anti-ICAM-1 antibody is disclosed in WO 94/04188. Exemplary dosing regimens and therapeutic combinations for treating cancer can be found in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/474,480, filed May 30, 2003.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody composition will be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The “therapeutically effective amount” of the antibody to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat a disease or disorder. The antibody need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above.

Most libraries to date are “natural” antibody libraries which used the natural repertoires as the source for its diversity, where the genes as message RNA of immune cells from naïve or immunized animals or human were amplified and cloned into vector for phage display or other display technology, such as ribosome or yeast display. The natural antibodies usually have multiple frameworks, which together with variable CDRs sequences and the recombination of light chain and heavy chain made up the diversity of the library. The size of the library determined the performance of the libraries since the repertoires were in general larger than the library size (marks et al). The synthetic library, on the other hand, is a new branch of library where the diversity is designed and built into the library with synthetic DNA. Single or multiple frameworks have been used. For single framework library, the source of the diversity solely depends on the degeneracy of synthetic DNA designed to create the diverse CDR loops. Both the diversity design and the size of the libraries are critical for the library performance, which can be measured by the affinity of the antibodies found from the libraries.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe developed a strategy of building synthetic antibody phage library upon the template of a single framework. Residues were selected from CDR loops that are either solvent exposed or highly variable in natural antibodies repertoires according to Kabat database and were randomized by mimicking the natural diversity using tailored codons. We also explored restricting the randomization to heavy chain, which often contribute to the main binding interaction with antigen among natural antibodies, and found it was sufficient to find binders to naïve targets. One of the reasons to restrict the diversity is so that the gap between the DNA degeneracy and practical phage library size is not overwhelmingly large and the sequence space will be covered at sufficient density.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe first library was built on humanized 4D5 framework with a randomized heavy chain and fixed light chain in the format of single chain Fv (ScFv). To the target antigen murine VEGF (mVEGF), many unique binders were found.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe libraries were then generally further improved by fine-tuning the diversity of CDR-H1 and H2 or the light chain to closely mimic the natural diversity, and by exploring the diversity design of CDR-H3 in the Fab format of display. See \nFIG. 1\n for illustrations of different types of antibody libraries. We found libraries with different designs of CDR-H3 of similar size resulted in binders of hVEGF and mVEGF with sub-nM affinity. The affinity of these binders can be further improved to pM range by a second step of randomizing their light chain CDRs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor details of strategies and methods for generating synthetic antibody libraries with single template, see, for example, U.S. provisional application U.S. Ser. No. 60/385,338 (filed Jun. 3, 2002), the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. Thus, novel antibodies with high affinity to both human VEGF and mouse VEGF could be found in diverse synthetic antibody phage libraries based on a single framework template.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nG6 and B20 Derived Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n(a) Selection of High Affinity Anti-VEGF Fab Clones\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe selection procedures for high affinity anti-VEGF Fab clones consisted of various combinations of solid-supported and solution-binding sortings. In solid-supported sortings, the antibody phage library was panned with target antigen coated on NUNC 96-well Maxisorp immunoplate at concentration of 5 ug/ml. In solution-binding sorting method, phage library was incubated with decreasing concentration of biotinylated antigen in solution, which then was captured by neutravidin coated on the 96-well Maxisorp plate (2˜5 ug/ml). Decreasing concentration allowed more stringency in panning to fish for tighter binders. To the target antigen mVEGF, a two-step sorting strategy was developed such that, in \nstep\n 1, potent binders were isolated from naïve libraries by means of the solid-supported selection, and subsequently in \nstep\n 2, those stronger affinity binders could be isolated from weaker ones by the progressive solution-binding method with decreasing target antigen concentration. To quickly screen out these binders, the high throughput single-spot competition binding ELISA was used. Low amount of mVEGF (25 nM) was applied in this assay to screen 16 clones from each library after the 3\nrd \nround sorting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs the result of combining solid-supported and solution-binding sortings, three Fab clones, G6, B29, and C3, all from NNK library, were identified as high affinity binders. And after the 5\nth \nround sorting, the whole library was dominated by G6 clone. Interestingly, B20, which came from NVT library, was found by solution-binding sorting alone. This suggested that more clones can be found by different strategies of sorting methods, which may bias for different clones. With different library designs, more VEGF binding clones with distinct sequences should be identified also. The four unique clones with distinct sequences were first characterized for their binding affinity to murine and human VEGF using competition-binding ELISA at 25° C. IC50 data from phage binding assays represent an estimation of their affinities, and G6 was identified as the highest affinity binder with IC50 at 0.5-1 nM for both human and murine VEGF (\nFIG. 2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) Activities and Properties\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA series of in vitro assays were conducted to examine properties and activities of the selected novel anti-VEGF antibodies.\n\n\n \nEpitope Blocking Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nFirst, the antibody phage clones were examined for their possible binding epitopes on VEGF. A phage-blocking assay was used, wherein the bindings of the phage clones (at constant concentration) to mVEGF-coated wells were measured in the presence of either a full extracellular domain (ECD) of KDR or a second domain of Flt-1 (Flt-1\nD2\n), both at increasing concentrations, respectively. Full ECD of KDR or Flt-1 has seven immunoglobulin-like domains, and binds VEGF through the second and third domain. The second domain of Flt-1 alone can bind VEGF at Kd of 2 nM with known epitopes on VEGF, based on the published crystal structure theVEGF-VEGFR complex (Wiesmann et al. (1997) \nCell \n91:695-704). The Kd of KDR ECD binding to VEGF is about 5 nM. We expected that the bindings of the phage clones to be reduced with the increasing addition of receptors, if the epitopes for an antibody on phage overlap significantly with receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor receptor blocking assay at protein level with purified Fab expressed from \nE. coli\n, (mouse or human VEGF), VEGF receptor immobilized plate by coating baculovirus expressed Flt-1 ECD fragment (Ig domain1-5) (Flt-1\nD1-5\n) directly, or 293 cell-expressed KDR-Ig fusion, which present KDR ECD (Ig domain 1-7) as Fcγ fusion captured with goat anti-human IgG Fcγ (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab. West Grove, Pa.) coated on the 96-well Maxisorp immunoplate and blocked with 0.5% BSA and 0.02% Tween20. Biotinylated bacterially expressed hVEGF or mVEGF at 0.2 nM was first incubated with three-fold serial diluted anti-VEGF Fabs, G6, Fab-12 (the Fab of the Avastin™ antibody), or Y0317 in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). After 1 h incubation at room temperature, the mixtures were transferred to a VEGF receptor immobilized plate and incubated for 10 min. The VEGF-A that was not blocked by anti-VEGF was captured with VEGF receptor coated wells and detected by streptavidin-HRP conjugate and developed with TMB substrate as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 3\n, the four clones were blocked to different extents by Flt-1\nD2 \nand KDR. The results of the blocking assay suggested that these four clones might have different binding epitopes on VEGF that are nonetheless overlapped with receptor binding epitope. The affinities of the antibody clones did not correlate with the efficiency of blocking by receptor in this blocking assay. Y0959, a phage clone with known epitope was used as a control. Among the four novel clones, G6 and B20 appeared to have epitopes that sufficiently overlapped with those for both Flt-1 and KDR, since their bindings to mVEGF was significantly reduced in the presence of the receptor fragments. The difference in the blocking efficient is small but has been consistent with multiple assays. One prediction is that G6 or B20 has epitopes that matches with those of receptor on VEGF much better than Fab-12 or its variants, Y0317 and Y0959 (Muller, Y. A., et al., (1998) \nStructure \n6:1153-1167). Therefore, we proceeded to generate Fab protein to confirm the binding and examine the epitope. G6 was chosen first for further study since it has the highest affinity against both mVEGF and hVEGF.\n\n\n \nBinding Specificity and Neutralizing Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine the binding specificity of G6 Fab clone, ELSA assays were conducted using human, mouse, rat and rabbit VEGF-A\n165 \nas well as VEGF homologs including mouse and human placenta growth factor (PIGF-2), mVEGF-D and human VEGF-B. Human and murine placental growth factor (PIGF-2), murine VEGF-D, rat VEGF-A and human VEGF-B were from R&D system. The tested antigens were coated on NUNC 96-well Maxisorp immunoplate at the concentration of 2 ug/ml. Binding with increasing concentrations of G6 Fab protein was measured by Protein G-horse radish peroxidase conjugate and substrate. For example, Fab protein was prepared from \nE. coli \nharboring the plasmid of G6 Fab expression construct under the promoter of alkaline phosphatase and secretion leader sequences sal and purified with Protein G affinity column. G6 Fab binding to VEGF and its homologs were measured by direct ELISA. VEGF homolog-coated wells (at 2 ug/ml in PBS concentration) were blocked with 0.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween20 at 25° C. Fab at increasing concentrations were incubated with the VEGF homolog-coated wells for 1 h at 25° C. and measured with anti-human Fab antibody horse radish peroxidase conjugate diluted in PBT buffer, then developed with TMB substrate. Solution binding assays were also carried out for some proteins by incubating 0.5 nM of G6 Fab with increasing concentrations of a VEGF homolog for 1-2 h at 25° C., and the unbound Fab was captured with mVEGF-A coated wells and measured. As shown in \nFIG. 4\n, the G6 Fab protein binds equally well to both mVEGF and hVEGF (approximately 0.6 nM and 1.4 nM, respectively). Moreover, the G6 antibody did not bind to other VEGF homologs at all, and thus is highly specific to VEGF. The G6 Fab bound rat and rabbit VEGF with similar affinity as for mVEGF (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test if G6 not only binds to VEGF at high affinity, but also is capable of effectively blocking VEGF's binding to VEGF receptors, blocking assays were conducted, wherein either hVEGF or mVEGF was tested for its binding to KDR in the presence of increasing concentrations of the G6 Fab clone. Also used as control were the two anti-hVEGF antibodies, Fab-12 (the Fab of Avastin™) and Y0317, that are capable of effectively blocking hVEGF but neither bind to mVEGF nor block its activities. As shown in \nFIG. 5\n, G6 effectively blocked hVEGF's binding to KDR with an efficacy similar to that of Fab-12 or Y0317. Furthermore, G6 can also significantly block mVEGF's binding to KDR. In comparison, neither Fab-12 nor Y0317 showed any blocking effect on mVEGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the novel anti-VEGF antibody G6 of this invention is a high affinity anti-VEGF antibody capable of binding and blocking VEGF from both human and murine species.\n\n\n \nCell-Based Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nTo further determine binding specificity and blocking activities of the novel antibody G6, a cell-based assay using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was conducted, wherein various anti-VEGF antibodies were tested for their abilities to block either human or murine VEGF induced cell proliferation. Basically, 96-well tissue culture plates were seeded with 3000 HuVECs per well and fasted in the assay medium (F12:DMEM 50:50 supplemented with 1.5% (v/v) diafiltered fetal bovine serum) for 24 hours. The concentration of VEGF used for stimulating the growth of cells was determined by first titrating to identify the amount of VEGF that can induce 90% of maximal DNA synthesis. Fresh assay medium with fixed amounts of VEGF (0.1 nM final concentration) and increasing concentrations of anti-VEGF Fab were then added. After 24 hours of incubation, cells were pulsed with 0.5 μCi per well of [\n3\nH] thymidine for 24 hours, and then harvested on to 96-well filter plate for counting by a TopCount gamma counter. Here the DNA synthesis was measured by incorporation of tritiated thymidine. In this assay, the anti-VEGF antibodies serving as the control were Fab-12 and Y0317.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 6\n, G6 antibody significantly reduced both hVEGF and mVEGF's abilities to promote HUVEC proliferation. The basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) experiment here served as a control to demonstrate that none of the anti-VEGF Fabs used in this assay had any non-specific toxicity to the host cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) Affinity Improvement of the G6 and B20 Anti-VEGF Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo novel antibody clones, G6 and B20, were chosen for further improvement on binding affinities. To improve affinity, several selected residues of the light chain CDR were randomized, since both clones came from a library with only randomized heavy chain and a fixed light chain. Surface exposed CDR residues and residues that are highly diverse in the Kabat database of natural antibody sequences were chosen. Site-directed mutagenesis was used with tailored degenerate codons to generate amino acid diversity that mimicked the natural immune repertoire at each CDR site on light chain (\nFIG. 7\n). Sorting was first performed by adding the library on immobilized hVEGF or mVEGF on the Maxisorp 96-well plate to maximize the recovery of binders, followed by solution sorting with decreasing concentration of biotinylated hVEGF or mVEGF as two separate tracks of selection. Concentration of biotinylated VEGF was selected based on the initial affinity of the clone to gauge the pressure of the sorting. The selection pressure was also increased by incubating phage binders with 1000 fold excess of un-biotinylated antigen in solution for different length of time at different temperature after initial incubation of the phage library with biotinylated VEGF and before capturing by neutravidin coated on 96-well Maxisorp plate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs an example of the above-described processes, G6 having 1 nM affinity was subject to further affinity improvement. The first round of sorting used solid-supported method to capture all clones that still bound VEGF, and then at the second round of sorting, the phage library was incubated with 1 nM of VEGF. Next, the solution-binding used 1 nM biotinylated hVEGF to select most binders. Before capturing, 1 uM unbiotinylated hVEGF was added and incubated at RT for 15 min to compete off fast off-rate binders. Then in the following rounds of sorting (3\nrd \nand 4\nth\n), more selection pressure was put into solution sorting by using less biotinylated hVEGF (0.1 nM) to select and 100 nM unbiotinylated hVEGF at 37 C for 30 min or longer time (2 hr or 6 hr) to compete off high off-rate binders and fish for low off-rate binders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe same strategy was utilized to improve B20 clone, except that less stringent condition was used because of its low affinity against hVEGF (IC50˜150 nM). The mVEGF selection track followed the same procedures and conditions as what were used with hVEGF. Enrichment was calculated by the eluted phage titers ratio to selection without biotinylated target. After sorting, high throughput single-spot competition binding ELISA as described above was used to quickly screen for improved affinity clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this assay, low amount of hVEGF or mVEGF (10 nM) was applied to screen 51 clones from G6-based phage library and 110 clones from B20-based phage library with the control of wild type G6 and B20 binders. Several improved G6 clones, collectively termed G6-II variants, were selected out and showed remarkably increased binding affinity to both human and murine VEGF by over one hundred fold by comparing the phage IC50 values with wild-type clones (\nFIG. 7\n). Clones with many unique sequences were found that have improved affinity, which suggested that there are many light chains that can accommodate the heavy chain of the selected clones. It is also interesting to note that binding specificities of some clones were changed. This suggests that light chain is able to modulate the interaction of heavy chain with its antigen sufficiently to alter its specificities. As for the clone sequences, most G6-II clones were different from G6 only in their third light chain CDR (CDR-L3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo generate Fab protein or IgG protein for affinity and activity assays, we cloned the variable region into a Fab expression plasmid for expression in an \nE. coli \nor a mammalian cell (a phagemid vector that had been modified by deleting the sequence encoding the C-terminal domain of phage coat protein p3 and adding a termination sequence for ribosome binding about 20 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon at the end of heavy chain first constant domain). Fab protein was generated by growing transformed 34B8 \nE. coli \ncells in AP5 media at 30° C. for 24 h as described (Presta, L et al., (1997) \nCancer Res \n57:4593-4599). IgG was purified with Protein A columns and Fab was purified with Protein G affinity chromatography. The production yield for Fab was typically 5-10 mg/L in small scale shake flask growth and 0.5-3 g/L in fermenter growth. IgG production was reasonably high at 10-50 mg/L small scale culture with some clone to clone differences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree G6-II improved clones, G6-8, G6-23 and G6-31 (see \nFIG. 7\n for residue changes in light chain CDRs), were selected to make into Fab protein for affinity measurement, epitope mapping by receptor blocking assay, and activity study in HuVEC growth inhibition assay. For affinity determinations of anti-mVEGF Fabs, we used surface plasmon resonance assays on a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25° C. and 37° C. with immobilized mVEGF or hVEGF CM5 chips at ˜100 response units (RU) as described (Chen, Y., et al., (1999) \nJ. Mol Biol \n293:865-881). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) were activated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Human or murine VEGF was diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5 ug/ml (˜0.2 uM) before injected at a flow rate of 5 ul/minute to achieve approximately 100 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of 1M ethanolamine to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (100 to 0.78 nM or 3 nM to 500 nM) were injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25° C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 ul/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) were calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the k\non \nof affinity improved G6 variants did not result in satisfactory statistics with the available binding model in BIAcore evaluation methods, solution competition binding assays using phage-displayed proteins were also carried out to measure the relative affinity of those antibodies at equilibrium. VEGF displayed on phage were incubated with serial dilutions of Fab at room temperature for 20 h to reach equilibrium and the unbound VEGF-phage were captured with G6 Fab briefly (10 min) and measured with anti-M13-HRP and substrate TMB as above. A second format of solution competition binding assay was also carried out where Fab was displayed on phage and interact with dilutions of VEGF to reach equilibrium (20 h) and unbound Fab were captured on VEGF coated 96-well plate and measured as above. The two IC50s values were averaged to get binding affinities as final IC50s. Binding of Fabs to mVEGF were assayed only with second format due to the lack of the reagent of mVEGF displaying phage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom initial SPR experiments, it was noted that there was significant k\non \nimprovement. For example, we found that G6-23 had the most significant improvement in on-rate at 25° C. and 37° C. against both human and murine VEGF, and small reduction in off-rate (\nFIG. 8\n). The k\non \nfor G6-31 improved as compared to G6 as well (data not shown). Further, the solution competition binding assays confirmed that G6-23 was the most affinity-improved clone with its high affinity of IC50 of 20 pM against hVEGF and mVEGF (\nFIG. 7\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFluorescent quenching assays were also performed to determine the k\non \nrates of the higher affinity G6 series antibodies. Therefore, three of the affinity matured Fabs (G6-8, G6-23 and G6-31) were purified as Fab proteins, and their affinities for mVEGF were compared to G6 by using and fluorescence quenching in solution for the rate of association (on rate, k\non\n) (Table 1 and \nFIGS. 30A\n and B).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAffinity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nClone\n\n\nk\non \n(10\n5 \nM\n−1 \nS\n−1\n)\n\n\nK\noff \n(10\n−4 \nS\n−1\n)\n\n\nKd (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG6\n\n\n1.75 (1.93)\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n0.91\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG6-23\n\n\n56.6\n\n\n1.21\n\n\n0.021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG6-31\n\n\n21.6\n\n\n0.35\n\n\n0.016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG6-8\n\n\n16.8\n\n\n1.29\n\n\n0.077\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fluorescence quenching assays were performed as follows. The change of fluorescence intensity in complexing the Fab and VEGF was used to determine the rate of association as developed for the on-rate determination of Fab-12 variants and VEGF (Marvin J. S. and H. B. Loman (2003) \nBiochemistry \n42:7077-7083). We first determined that the fluorescence intensity with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm of G6 (or variants)-VEGF complex was lower than the sum of individual components using an 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophometer (Thermo-Spectronic) by adding 100 nM VEGF to a stirred cuvette containing 20 nM Fab in PBS, pH 7.2, at 25° C. Next, increasing concentrations of VEGF (100-400 nM) was mixed with equal volumes of 40 nM Fab in a stop-flow (Aviv Instruments) equipped spectrophometer to observe the rate of the decrease of fluorescence intensity at 25 C. For each experiment, nine measurements were performed for each concentration and fitted to a single-exponential curve. The observed rate was then plotted against VEGF concentrations for pseudo-first order analysis, and the slope is the rate of association. Two to three independent experiments were carried out and the differences were within 50%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe estimated k\non \nof the improved clones from the SPR method were ˜3-6-fold lower than the measurements by solution-based fluorescence quenching assay, whereas k\non \nmeasurements for parent G6 Fab from SPR was statistically sound and within 1.2-fold difference with fluorescence quenching assays. It is possible that using BIAcore SPR technology for fast on-rate measurements was limited by the complex flow dynamics, or there could be some differences in protein behaviors between the parent clone and affinity-improved clones, though aggregation problems were not observed with these proteins. Based on the fluorescence assays, the three Fabs exhibited improvements over G6 in the on-rate by 6, 8 or 20-fold for G6-8, G6-31 or G6-23, respectively. Fab-G6-31 also exhibited an ˜4-fold improvement in the off-rate, and as a result, the affinity of Fab-G6-31 (K\nd\n=16 pM) and Fab-G6-23 (K\nd\n=21 pM) was ˜40-60-fold improved compared to the G6 parent (K\nd\n=910 pM). It was consistent with the solution phase competition assays, which showed a 20-60-fold improvement in IC\n50 \nvalue for G6-31 (30 pM) or G6-23 (10 pM) in comparison with G6 (0.67 nM). We applied the light chain affinity maturation strategy to five other heavy chain sequences and have observed 10- to 30-fold improvements in binding affinities (data not shown). Unlike G6, many improved clones adopted new sequences for all three light chain CDRs. Thus, we found that the three G6 variants increased binding affinity to both human and murine VEGF over G6, predominantly by the increase in the rate of association (on rate or k\non\n). G6-23 had the highest on rate and then followed by G6-8 and then G6-31. The improvement in the rate of dissociation (off rate or k\noff\n) was 2-3 fold for G6-23, and 8 or 13-fold for G6-31 for hVEGF or mVEGF, respectively. Compared to Fab-12 and Y0317, G6 and G6-23 had significantly different binding kinetics (\nFIG. 32\n). G6-23 had similar Kd as Y0317 but a faster kinetics with fast on rate of over 10\n6 \n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n), and moderate rate of dissociation (off rate or k\noff\n) at 1-2×10\n−4 \ns\n−1\n, whereas Y0317 has slow k\non \nat 3×10\n−4 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, and very slow k\noff \nat ˜5×10\n−6 \ns\n−1 \n(\nFIG. 32\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solution competition binding assay used biotinylated protein antigens equilibrated with serial dilutions of purified Fab or IgG proteins, and the unbound biotin-antigen was captured with immobilized Fab or IgG coated on Maxisorb plates and was detected with streptavidin conjugated HRP. Alternatively Fab or IgG proteins were equilibrated with serial dilutions of protein antigen, and the unbound Fab or IgG was captured with immobilized antigen and detected with protein A-HRP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the VEGF receptor blocking assay using purified Fab, VEGF receptor was immobilized on a plate by coating Flt-1 ECD fragment (Ig domain1-5) (Flt-1\nD1-5\n) directly, or by first coating with goat anti-human IgG Fcγ (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab. West Grove, Pa.) and then treating with KDR-IgG fusion receptor which presented KDR ECD (Ig domain 1-7) as a dimer, on a 96-well Maxisorp immunoplate. The plate was then blocked with 0.5% BSA and 0.02% Tween20. Sub-nanomolar concentrations of biotinylated hVEGF or mVEGF at 0.2 nM were incubated with three-fold serial diluted anti-VEGF Fabs, G6, G6-II (G6-8, 23, and 31), Fab-12, or Y0317 in PBST. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, the mixtures were transferred to the plate containing immobilized VEGF receptor and incubated for 10 min. The VEGF-A that was not blocked by anti-VEGF was captured with VEGF receptor coated wells and detected by streptavidin-HRP conjugate and developed with TMB substrate as described above. The results showed that, compared to the original G6, the selected G6-II Fabs indeed have increased blocking activities for both hVEGF and mVEGF. Strong blocking had been observed with both G6 and B20 phage display clones which suggested that their binding epitopes on VEGF overlapped with the epitopes for receptors. G6 Fab was also shown to block the binding of both human and murine VEGF to Flt-1 ECD (\nFIG. 31\n) efficiently. In comparison, Fab-12 can only block hVEGF but not mVEGF binding to receptor, consistent with binding specificities. An Fab-12 variant with improved affinity for hVEGF (Kd=20 pM), Y0317, inadvertently acquired some weak affinity to mVEGF (Kd˜300 nM at 25 C, Y. Chen and H. Lowman unpublished results) and show a slight receptor blocking activity to mVEGF at high concentrations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of VEGF activity in the endothelial cell growth assay (HuVEC) was performed as described above. Like G6, G6-II specifically inhibited the growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cell stimulated by human and murine VEGF, but not the growth stimulated by human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The concentration required to inhibit 50% of the growth of the cells stimulated by both human and murine VEGF (HuVEC IC50) correlated well with the affinity measured by BIAcore or solution binding ELISA assay at 37° C. Compared with G6, G6-23 and G6-31 showed at least 100 fold improvement in inhibiting HuVECs growth stimulated by hVEGF or mVEGF. Fab-12 and Y0317 Fabs were also measured in the same assays to serve as controls. Fab-12 showed no measurable binding to mVEGF, whereas Y0317 Fab could bind mVEGF at 350 nM affinity. Therefore, as expected, Y0317 and Fab-12 did not show any inhibitory effects on mVEGF mediated HUVEC growth. We showed that many G6-II variants with different light chain can have improved affinity and the solution-binding assay can also predict the outcome of the potency as inhibitor in HuVEC cell assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVEGF bindings of G6-23 were compared with that of G6 as well as Fab-12. As shown in \nFIG. 8\n, G6-23 has significantly improved on-rate for binding to both hVEGF and mVEGF. While the off-rate of G6-23 is substantially similar to that of G6, the overall Kd of G6-23 is at least about 7 fold better than that of G6 for both hVEGF and mVEGF.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nMapping of VEGF Binding Sites on G6 and G6-23 Antibodies\n\n\nFunctional Mapping of G6 and G6-23 by Shotgun Alanine and Homolog Scanning\n\n\n \n \n \nFunctional mapping of G6 and G6-23 by shotgun alanine and homolog scanning were performed to identify residues that are important for binding hVEGF and finding residues that can be improved further for binding VEGF. We generated combinatorial phage libraries which allowed heavy chain or light chain CDR residues in separate libraries to be either alanine or wild type (alanine scanning), or either homologous amino acid or wild type (homolog scanning).\n\n\n \nMutagenic Oligonucleotides for Shotgun Scanning Libraries\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following mutagenic oligonucleotides for shotgun alanine (A)- and homolog (H)-scan library constructions to randomize CDR residues in G6 and G6-23 antibodies were designed using previously described shotgun codons (Vajdos et al. (2002) \nJ. Mol Biol \n320:415-428). Equimolar DNA degeneracies are represented in the IUB code (K=G/T, M=A/C, R=A/G, S=G/C, V=A/C/G, W=A/T, Y=C/T), and the degenerate codons are shown in bold text.

The phagemid vector, pS0643 (also known as phGHam-g3, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,666, Example 8), contains pBR322 and f1 origins of replication, an ampicillin resistant gene, an \nE. coli \nalkaline phosphatase (phoA) promoter (Bass et al., (1990) \nProteins \n8:309-314), and a sequence encoding a stII secretion signal sequence fused to residues 1-191 of human growth hormone (hGH) and a sequence encoding the C-terminal residues 267-421 of protein III of M13 phage (hereinafter, cP3 or pIII). The pS0643 phagemid also contains an XbaI site and an amber stop \ncodon following residue\n 191 of hGH. The stII secretion signal sequence can export a protein to the periplasm of a bacteria cell (e.g., a light chain region (LC) of an antibody). The sequence encoding the human growth hormone (hGH) was removed from the pS0643 vector and replaced with a NsiI/XbaI nucleic acid fragment encoding a humanized anti-Her2 Fab fragment (“h4D5” sequence) ligated in frame with the stII secretion signal (humAb4D5-8, see Carter et al., (1992) \nPNAS \n89:4285-4289 therein or U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337, for sequence). The amber stop codon between the heavy chain fragment and cP3 was deleted, as this modification has been shown to increase the levels of Fab displayed on phage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe h4D5 antibody is a humanized antibody that specifically recognizes a cancer-associated antigen known as Her-2 (erbB2). The h4d5 sequence was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using the humAb4D5 version 8 (“humAb4D5-8”) sequence and primers engineered to give rise to a 5′ NsiI site and a 3′ XbaI site in the PCR product (Carter et al., (1992) \nPNAS \n89:4285-4289). The PCR product was cleaved with NsiI and XbaI and ligated into the pS0643 phagemid vector. The h4D5 nucleic sequence encodes modified CDR regions from a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for Her-2 in a mostly human consensus sequence Fab framework. Specifically, the sequence contains a kappa light chain (LC region) upstream of VH and CH1 domains (HC region). The method of making the anti-Her-2 antibody and the identity of the variable domain sequences are provided in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,821,337 and 6,054,297. The pS0643 plasmid containing humanized 4D5 (version 8) was still further modified. For example, a herpes \nsimplex virus type\n 1 glycoprotein D epitope tag (gD tag—MADPNRFRGKDLGG (SEQ ID NO:17)) was added in frame to the c-terminus of the LC using site-directed mutagenesis. Following the stop codon downstream of the LC, a ribosome binding site and nuclec acid molecule encoding a stII signal sequence were ligated to the N-terminus of the HC sequence. Consequently, the HC sequence is in frame with the C-terminal domain of the p3 (cP3), a minor coat protein of M13 phage. Thus, a Fab displayed on phage can be produced from one construct. This Fab phagemid vector is referred to as pV0350-2b and is be schematically illustrated in \nFIG. 1\n. The light gene in pV0350-2b was further modified by mutating a few other amino acid residues, e.g., Arg66 to a Gly and S93 to Ala.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo generate F(ab)′2 displayed on phage, the PV0350-4 vector was further modified by inserting a dimerizable leucine zipper GCN4 sequence (GRMKQLEDKVEELLSKNYHLENEVARLKKLVGERG) (SEQ ID NO:18) between the HC and cP3 sequences by cassette mutagenesis. The GCN4 leucine zipper brings two sets of LC/HC-cP3 fusion polypeptides together in the \nE. coli \nperiplasm and presents the dimer on the surface of phage. This F(ab)′2 phagemid vector is referred to as pV0350-4 is also schematically illustrated in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor G6-23 heavy chain shotgun-scan library construction, phagemid pWO448-2 was constructed by introducing G6-23 CDRL3 sequence into pV0350-2b phagemid using Kunkel mutagenesis method (Kunkel et al., (1991) \nMethods Enzymol \n204:125-139)). Phagemid pW0448-1 was also generated from pV0350-2b as template for G6 and G6-23 light chain shotgun-scanning library that contains the heavy chain variable domain of G6 and stop codon (TAA) in all three CDRs in light chain.\n\n\n \nConstruction of Shotgun Scanning Libraries\n\n\n \n \n \nPhage-displayed libraries were constructed using Kunkel mutagenesis method as described (Kunkel et al., 1991, supra). In total, eight libraries were generated: hcA-G6, hcA-G6.23, IcA-G6 and lcA-G6.23 were alanine scanning libraries of heavy chain (hc) or light chain (lc) of G6 and G6-23; hcH-G6, hcH-G6.23, lcH-G6, IcH-G6.23 were homolog scanning libraries. The template containing TAA stop codon within all three heavy or light chain CDRs was simultaneously repaired during the mutagenesis reaction by the above mutagenic oligonucleotides with designed degenerate codons. After mutagenesis, 10 ug of DNA were electroporated into \nE. coli \nSS320 cells (˜10\n11 \ncells) (Sidhu et al., (2000) \nMethods Enzymol \n328:333-363), which were grown overnight at 30° C. in 2YT broth supplemented with M13-KO7 helper phage (New England Biolabs), 50 ug/ml carbenicillin and kanamycin. Library sizes were 2-5×10\n9\n. Phage were concentrated from the culture media by precipitation with PEG/NaCl and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as described previously (Sidhu et al., 2000, supra).\n\n\n \nLibrary Sorting and Screening Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein target, VEGF or anti-gD tag antibody (provided by Genentech research groups), was immobilized on NUNC (Roskilde, Denmark) 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates overnight at 4° C., and before sorting, the plates were blocked with bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) for 2 hour at room temperature (RT). Phage libraries from the above preparation (˜10\n13 \nphage/ml) were incubated in the target-coated immunoplates for 1 h at RT to allow for phage binding. Plates were then washed 15 times with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 (PST) buffer, and bound phage were eluted with 0.1 M HCl for 15 minutes and neutralized with 1.0 M Tris base. Eluted phage were propagated in \nE. coli \nXL1-blue (Stratagene) for next round of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndividual clones selected from the second round of panning were grown in a 96-well plate overnight at 37° C. with 150 ul of 2YT broth supplemented with 50 ug/ml carbenicillin and M13-VCS helper phage (1:2500) (Stratagene). The culture supernatants were directly used in phage competitive enzyme-linked immuno-absorbant assays (phage ELISAs) to screen functional phage-displayed G6 or G6-23 Fab variants binding to target proteins coated on the plate (Sidhu et al., 2000, supra). The clones exhibited both positive phage ELISA signals to VEGF antigen and anti-gD tag antibody were subjected to DNA sequence analysis.\n\n\n \nDNA Sequencing and Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe functional clones from the above screening were grown in 96-well plates with 100 ul of 2YT broth and 50 ug/ml carbenicillin at 37° C. for 2 hour. Little amount of culture supernatants (1˜2 ul) was served as templates for PCRs (GeneAmp® PCR System 9700, Applied Biosystems) to amplify the phagemid DNA fragments containing the light and heavy chain genes with sequencing primers to add M13 (−21) universal sequences at the 5′ end of the amplified fragments, thus facilitating the use of M13 forward primers in sequencing reactions. Amplified DNA fragments in a 96-well format were sequenced using Big-Dye terminator sequencing reactions and analyzed on an ABI Prism 3700 96-capillary DNA analyzer (PE Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) by Genentech DNA sequencing group. The sequences were analyzed with the program SGCOUNT as described previously (Weiss et al., (2000) \nPNAS USA \n97:8950-8954).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following number of functional clones in parenthesis selected from each library against VEGF antigen was subjected to DNA sequence analysis: hcA-G6 (107), hcA-G6-23 (124), lcA-G6 (111), lcA-G6-23 (102), hcH-G6 (111), hcH-G6-23 (135), lcH-G6 (106), lcH-G6-23 (97). For the clones from anti-gD tag antibody binding selection: hcA-G6 (108), hcA-G6-23 (130), lcA-G6 (116), lcA-G6-23 (98), hcH-G6 (120), hcH-G6-23 (122), lcH-G6 (111), lcH-G6-23 (102).\n\n\n \nFab G6 and G6-23 Point Mutants and Affinity Measurements\n\n\n \n \n \nTo generate G6 and G6-23 Fab mutants for affinity measurements, we used previously modified Fab expression plasmid from phage-displayed vector with an \nE. coli \nalkaline phosphatase (phoA) promoter (Presta et al., (1997) \nCancer Res \n57:4593-4599). Each point mutant was constructed using the Kunkel site-directed mutagenesis method (Kunkel et al., 1991, supra) with oligonucleotides designed to have point mutation within CDRs. For mutant productions, expression plasmids were transformed into 34B8 \nE. coli \ncells, and single colony was picked and grown in complete C.R.A.P. medium (Presta et al., 1997, supra) supplemented with 25 ug/ml carbenicillin at 30° C. for 24 h. The expressed recombinant proteins were purified through a Protein G high trap column (Amersham Pharmacia) and quantitated by UV absorption at 280 nm (Presta et al., 1997, supra). The binding affinities of G6 and G6-23 Fab mutants were evaluated using competitive solution binding ELISA with hVEGF displaying phage as described. The fold reduction in wild-type VEGF phage binding activity due to each point mutation was determined by dividing the IC\n50 \nfor the G6 or G6-23 point mutant by the IC\n50 \nfor wild-type G6 or G6-23 Fab respectively.\n\n\n \nBIACORE™ Binding Analysis for FabG6 and G6-23 Variants\n\n\n \n \n \nFor binding kinetics, surface plasmon resonance (SRP) measurement with a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) was used as previously described (Karlsson & Fält, (1997) \nJ. Immunol Methods \n200:121-133). Carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) were activated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Human VEGF (hVEGF) was diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5 ug/ml (˜0.2 uM) before injected at a flow rate of 5 ul/minute to achieve approximately 100 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following by the injection of 1M ethanolamine to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of G6 or G6-23 Fab variants (0.7 nM to 100 nM) were injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25° C. at a flow rate of 25 ul/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) were calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore™ Evaluation Software version 3.2). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. Based on the selection of the phage library, two resides in heavy chain CDR2 appeared to prefer to be alanine or homologous amino acid: HC-Y58 preferred to be alanine, HC-151 preferred to be valine for binding VEGF. We therefore generated mutant protein Fab with single mutation to confirm the finding from phage libraries. The top graph in \nFIG. 9\n shows that the BIAcore analysis of mutation G6-23-Y58A (G6-23.1) (50 nM) binding to human VEGF coated chip improved the binding on-rate compared to G6-23, which already had a much improved on-rate compared to G6. The lower graph showed the BIAcore analysis of mutant G6-Y58A (G6-1) or G6-I51V (G6-2) to VEGF coated chip. Both had improved on-rate compared to G6. In fact, the double mutant (Y58A/I51V) had an additive effect on the on-rate improvement for G6 and G6-23.\n\n\n \n \nResults of Shotgun scanning of G6 and G6-23\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of both shotgun scanning on G6 and G6-23 antibodies indicated that heavy chain CDR side-chains dominated the binding interactions with hVEGF. When mapped onto the X-ray crystal structure of G6 Fab, the functionally important residues in combination represent a portion of the structural epitope, which is defined by the residues in direct contact with hVEGF. The shotgun alanine-scan results revealed the functional epitope comprising the solvent-exposed ridge, which was composed of residues Y32, W33, G54, V96, F97, F98, L99, and Y100a on the heavy chain and Y49 on the light chain. Interestingly, the numbers of functionally important residues revealed by the shotgun homolog-scan were significantly smaller and contained within the group of residues that were important functionally in the shotgun alanine-scan. These hot spots are W33, G54, V96, F97, and L99, which constitute a small patch that overlapped in both scans, suggesting that this surface makes precise contact with the antigen hVEGF that even homologous amino acid substitutions were disruptive. G55 was substituted with alanine only in the homolog scan and it was a highly disruptive, so we believe that G55 is also within this patch.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther functional important residues revealed by both scans on the heavy chain, G50 and T52, are not part of the solvent-exposed surface of G6 since they are buried inside according to the structural information, acting as scaffolding side-chains that pack against residues in the functional epitope in order to hold this epitope in a binding—competent conformation (C. Wiesmann, unpublished results). As for F95 in CDR-H3 of G6, definitely, alanine substitution at this position in alanine-scan was disruptive; nonetheless, this residue is capable of tolerating tyrosine substitution in homolog-scan, suggesting that its role is in maintaining the structure integrity of the antigen-binding site, which has also been confirmed with structural information.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor Y32, F98, and Y100a, the structural information demonstrated that these surface residues were critical and represented 30% of total heavy chain buried surface areas upon binding hVEGF. The alanine substitutions at these residues were definitely disruptive for affinity with significant function ratios (F\nwt/mut \nvalue) greater than 30, yet interestingly, they tolerated homologous amino acid substitutions (Tyr for Phe and vise versa), suggesting that the aromatic rings for these positions were making the important interactions with hVEGF antigen and adding or removing the hydroxyl group was not making much impact, which were distinct from the above scaffolding residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth shotgun scans identified new mutations in the heavy chain for further affinity improvement, which were 151V and Y58A. This intriguing observations were verified through producing Fab point mutants, and testing binding activity with competitive ELISA and BIAcore™ (\nFIG. 23\n and \nFIG. 18\n). Because 151 and Y58 are not the members of structural epitope (C. Wiesmann, unpublished results), it was believed that the affinity improvement, especially in on-rate, with single or double mutation was not from the introduction of new contact with antigen hVEGF, but probably through optimizing the structure integrity of CDR-H2 loop, to make it more competent for antigen binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the structural epitope, G6 light chain CDR residues represented 25% of total structural epitope surface (878 Å\n2\n) (C. Wiesmann, unpublished results). Interestingly, the only residue that showed functional importance in both shotgun scanning was Y49 in CDR-L2, which only stood for 2% of the total structural epitope surface, suggesting that most structural epitope residues in the light chain were not involved in the energetic contact with hVEGF antigen. This readout implies that G6 light chain is more important structurally than functionally since it still retained the same sequence as 4D5, the template used for displaying antibody library on the phage where G6 was isolated from in the first place (Carter et al., 1992).\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nG6 and G6-23 Derived Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n(a) Libraries for Selection\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional anti-VEGF antibodies were obtained by sorting phage from the shotgun alanine and homolog scanning libraries described in Example 2. Specifically, at particular residues, scanned residues were allowed to vary as either wild type or alanine (alanine scan), or either wild type or a homologue residue (homolog scan). (\nFIGS. 14A\n and B). For the G6, shotgun alanine and homolog scanning was performed on the G6 light chain and heavy chain separately, resulting in four libraries. For G623, shotgun alanine and homolog scanning was performed on the G623 light chain, and shotgun homolog scanning was performed on G623 heavy chain, resulting in three libraries. A G623 shotgun alanine scanning library was not prepared because, as discussed above, G623 is a high affinity antibody, with most of its residues critical for binding located in the heavy chain. Mutating heavy chain residues to alanine, which means truncating the heavy chain amino acid side chains, would most likely disrupt binding and result in lower affinity antibody variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) Selecting Anti-VEGF Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the first round, a plate sorting strategy was used for selection. Human VEGF (hVEGF, provided by Genentech Research Groups) was immobilized on 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates (NUNC) by incubating wells with 5 ug/ml of protein target over night at 4° C. The plates were blocked with 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, Sigma) for 30 min in RT, after which 1% Tween20 was added for additional 30 min. The phage libraries described above were incubated on the hVEGF coated immunoplates at a concentration of ˜1E13 phage/ml for 1 h in RT under agitation, to allow binding of the phage displayed Fab to the target. After binding, plates were washed 15 times with PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween20. Bound phage were eluted by incubating wells with 0.1M HCl for 30 min. Elutions were neutralized with 1.0 M Tris base, \npH\n 11. \nE. Coli \nXL1-blue (Stratagene) were infected with the eluted phage and M13-K07 helper phage (New England Biolabs). The phage was propagated over night for the next round of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe bacterial culture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 4° C. and the supernatant collected. The phage was precipitated from the media by addition of 1/5 volume of PEG/NaCl. After 5 min incubation on ice the phage containing culture media was centrifuged at 10 krpm for 15 min in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 4° C. and the supernatant discarded. The remaining phage pellet was resuspended in PBS and centrifuged at 15 krpm for 5 min in a SS-34 rotor at 4° C. to pellet insoluble matter. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and the phage concentration was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 268 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following rounds of sorting were performed by a solution-phase sorting method with increasing stringency. Purified phage was incubated with biotinylated hVEGF for 1 hour at RT in PBS with 0.05% Tween20 and 0.5% Superblock (Pierce). After three to ten-fold dilution with superblock, the mixture was added to neutravidin coated wells blocked with 1% BSA (Sigma) and Tween20. The hVEGF-conjugated biotin was allowed to bind the immobilized neutravidin for 10 min. After capture the plate was washed 10-15 times with 0.05% Tween20 in PBS. To study the background, i.e. nonspecific binding on the phage to neutravidin, a control reaction lacking the biotinylated hVEGF was added to a coated well. The stringency was increased each round by decreasing antigen concentration in solution, as well as phage concentration or increasing temperature. Increasing number of washes is also a way to achieve more stringent conditions. For the third and fourth round of sorting non-biotinylated hVEGF was added to the reaction mix of biotin-hVEGF and library phage to compete off low affinity binders. By adding 1000 fold excess of competitor for 30 min in 37° C. before capturing, stringency could be increased additionally in the last rounds in order to select for high affinity binders. Manipulating binding and capture times could further increase the stringency from round to round.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor G623 the starting concentration of biotinylated hVEGF was 1 nM for the heavy chain shotgun library and 0.2 nM for the light chain shotgun-scanning library. The concentration was decreased to 0.5 nM and 0.1 nM respectively in the last round. For G6, with lower starting affinity than G623, library sorting was performed with less stringent starting conditions; 5 nM for heavy chain libraries and 2 nM for the light chain libraries, which was decreased to 1.75 and 0.5 nM respectively in the last round of sorting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo study the enrichment of hVEGF specific Fabs displayed on the phage, 90 ul \nE. Coli \nXL-Blue (Stratagene) was infected with 10 ul phage elution from the captured library binding reactions as well as the background mixtures for 30 min at 37° \nC. A\n 5 ul culture was plated out on carbencillin supplemented plates and incubated at 37° C. over night. The number of phage particles in the elution could be calculated from the number of colonies from each elution. After the last two rounds of sorting, 50 ul of the above mentioned culture of phagemid-containing bacteria, was plated out on carbencillin-supplemented plates and grown over night at 37° C. The resulting clones were subject to screening.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) Single Spot Competitive ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo screen for high affinity clones a high-throughput single point competitive ELISA assay in 96-well format was performed. For both antibodies approximately a hundred clones from the last two rounds of selection were picked randomly and screened in this assay. Phagemid containing \nE. Coli \nXL1-blue clones were grown in 400 ul rich 2YT broth, supplemented with carbencillin and M13-KO7 helper phage (New England Biolabs) by shaking over night at 37° C. The culture supernatant of each clone was diluted five times with 0.05% Tween20 and 0.5% BSA in PBS with addition of hVEGF as well as without. After 1 h incubation by shaking in RT, 80 ul of the reactions were transferred to hVEGF-coated immunoplates and incubated for 10 min. The plate was washed 8 times with 0.05% Tween20 in PBS and incubated 30 min with 100 ul anti-M13 antibody horseradish conjugate (New England Biolabs) diluted 5000 times in PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween20 and 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma). The plates were washed an additional 8 times and developed with TMB substrate for 5 min. The reactions were stopped with 1.0 M H\n3\nPO\n4 \nand read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. To estimate the relative affinity, the ratio of the optical density in the presence of hVEGF to that of the absence of hVEGF was calculated. A low ratio suggests that most Fab displayed on on the phage bound hVEGF in solution. As a consequence little Fab can bind to the immobilized hVEGF on the immunoplate. Clones showing lower ratio than wild type (WT) G6 or G623 were selected and, their supernatants used to infect XL1-blue. Phagemid containing bacteria were streaked out on carbencillin plates and grown over night at 37° C. for sequencing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe selection of the G6 heavy chain libraries resulted in no more than three unique sequences out of the 33 clones analyzed, suggesting that most G6 heavy chain changes result in lost of binding affinity. Furthermore, all unique heavy chain variants derived were from the homolog scan library. It seems that alanine mutation of G6 heavy chain residues can result in a dramatic loss of binding. This intolerance to changes in amino acid sequence selection supports the view that G6 heavy chain harbors many key residues for VEGF binding.

Similar selection criteria was used for both antibody libraries. However, lower cutoffs were used for the G6 LC library compared to the G6 HC library as HC variants were expected to show less affinity improvement compared to WT than LC variants. G6 alanine and homolog libraries were pooled before screening the heavy chain and light chain variants. The number of unique clones from the selected pool was determined by DNA sequencing. LC=Light Chain. HC=Heavy Chain. WT=Wild Type. Hom=Homolog scanning library. Ala=Alanine scanning library\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(d) DNA Sequencing and Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClones selected from the single spot screening were grown in 96-well plates with 100 ul 2YT broth supplemented with carbencillin for 2 hours. 1 ul of the culture was subjected to PCR (GeneAmp® PCR System 9700, Applied Biosystems) in order to amplify the DNA encoding the light chain or heavy chain of the different clones. The primers used in the PCR reaction were designed to add M13 universal sequences at the 5′ end of the amplified fragment. By adding this sequence, M13 forward primers could be used in the following sequencing reactions. After amplification in 96-well format, the DNA fragments were sequenced by Genentech DNA sequencing group using Big-Dye terminator sequencing reactions and analyzed with an ABI Prism 3700 96-capillary DNA analyzer. (PE Biosystems, Fosters City, Calif.). The heavy and light chain sequences were aligned and identical sequences eliminated. Based on their sequence, clones were selected for affinity determination by IC50 measurement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(e) Affinity Measurement of Phage Clones\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IC50 values for the phage clones were determined by competitive phage ELISA. A single colony of the selected clones was grown in 5 ml 2YT media supplemented with 50 ug/ml carbencillin for 5 hours. The culture was then infected with M13-K07 helper phage (New England Biolabs) for 1 h and transferred to a 25 ml culture supplemented with 50 ug/ml carbencillin and 50 ug/ml kanamycin. The phage was propagated over night at 37° C. After phage purification as described above, the phage was serially diluted with 0.05% Tween20 and 0.5% BSA in PBS and incubated on a hVEGF coated immunoplate to assess antigen binding at different phage concentrations. The phage dilution that gave ˜70% saturating signal was used in the IC50 determination assay. Phage was incubated with increasing concentration of hVEGF over night at 37° C. The unbound phage was captured on an hVEGF coated immunoplate for 10 min. The plate was washed, and the bound phage was detected with an anti-M13 antibody horseradish conjugate (New England Biolabs) followed by TMB development, as previously described. The hVEGF concentration that inhibited 50% of phage binding to the immobilized antigen represented the IC50. The signals, which indicate bound phage, were plotted against the hVEGF concentration, and the data was fitted to a competitive binding curve by non-linear regression, enabling IC\n50 \ndetermination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 34 and 35\n show the IC\n50 \nvalues of G6 and G6-23 variants, respectively, as well as the alterations in sequences compared to G6 or G6-23. From the G6 pool, many binders with apparent better affinity than wild type G6 were identified. Many more affinity improved G6 variants were derived from the light chain homolog library (\nFIG. 34A\n). However, two higher affinity G6 variants were selected from the heavy chain homolog scan library (\nFIG. 34B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome G6 variants showed up to a hundred-fold affinity improvement, according to the IC\n50 \ndeterminations. Of the few G6 heavy chain variants selected, they differed in only a few residues from wild type G6. These heavy chain mutations were located in CDR-H1 and CDR-H2. The conserved nature of the heavy chain, and CDR-H3 in particular, confirmed that most residues important for G6 binding to hVEGF are present in this region. Mutations were more abundant in the G6 light chain variants. They were mainly located in CDR-L1 and CDR-L3 regions, indicating that changing CDR-L2 residues impairs binding instead of improving affinity. A combination of mutations in CDR-L1 and CDR-L3 seem to be favorable for binding, allowing significant affinity improvement compared to wild type.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost G623 variants showed similar or slightly reduced binding affinity compared to wild type according to their IC\n50 \nvalues (\nFIG. 35\n). The highest affinity variants were derived from both homolog and alanine light chain shotgun library. Only a small number of high affinity binders were identified in the heavy chain shotgun scan pool. As for G6, heavy chain residues were conserved, and only few mutations present among the clones studied. The light chain variants also showed similar mutation-pattern as G6 variants, with most changes located in CDR-L1 and CDR-L3.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nAlanine Scanning of HVEGF to MAP Anti-VEGF Antibody Binding Sites\n\n\n \n \n \nTo understand the molecular basis of the cross reactivity of G6 and G6-23 and to map their functional epitopes, the relative binding affinities of G6 or G6-23 Fab for individual alanine-substituted hVEGF mutants versus wild type hVEGF were measured using hVEGF displaying phage ELISA as previously described (Muller et al., (1997) \nPNAS USA \n94:7192-7197). hVEGF was mutated at sites near the binding epitopes of Flt-1, KDR, the Avastin™ antibody and Y0317 with Kunkel mutagenesis method and phage displaying the individual mutant was generated as described previously (Muller et al., (1997) \nPNAS USA \n94:7192-7197). Solution binding phage ELISAs were used to determine the relative binding affinity of each mutant VEGF mutant versus wild type (wt) VEGF on Fab G6-23, G6-23. Briefly, 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates (NUNC) were coated overnight at 4° C. with G6 or G6-23 Fab at a concentration of 2 ug/ml in PBS, and blocked with PBS, 0.5% BSA, and 0.05% Tween20 (PBT) for 2 h at room temperature. Serial dilutions of phage displaying hVEGF mutants in PBT were first incubated on the G6-Fab-coated plates for 15 min at room temperature, and the plates were washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween20 (PBST). Bound phage were detected with anti-M13 monoclonal antibody horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia) conjugate diluted 1:5000 in PBT, developed with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Kirkegaard & Perry Labs, Gaithersburg, Md.) substrate for approximately 5 min, quenched with 1.0 M H\n3\nPO\n4\n, and read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. The relative IC\n50 \nvalues (IC\n50,Ala\n/IC\n50,wt\n) to represent the fold of reduction in binding affinity, and evaluate the energetic contribution of individual side-chains of hVEGF for interacting with G6 or G6-23 Fab were calculated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ratios of IC50 represented the energetic contribution of the individual side chain in the interaction with G6 Fab (\nFIG. 19\n). The general folding of alanine mutants, especially ones that had significant reduction in binding G6, was verified by its near-wild type binding to other molecules that have distinct epitopes on VEGF, such as the Avastin™ antibody, Y0317 or Flt-1, as mapped previously (\nFIG. 19\n). It is evident that G6 had a distinct epitope as compared to hybridoma derived Avastin™ antibody. All functionally important hVEGF residues for binding G6 were conserved between human and murine VEGF, thus explaining in part its cross reactivity. The Fab of the Avastin™ antibody (Fab-12) and Y0317, on the other hand, lost most of their binding to VEGF upon alanine substitution at residue Gly88, which is Ser in mVEGF. To visualize the epitope on a VEGF molecule, functionally important residues for binding G6 were highlighted on the surface of hVEGF crystal structure according to their relative affinities for G6. G6 epitope mapped to a patch that was conserved between human and mouse VEGF and dotted with a few energetically important residues, Phe17, Tyr21, Tyr, Ile83 and Gln89, which clustered in close proximity. This is indicative of a functional epitope with an interaction “hot spot”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe next compared the functional epitope of G6 to the structural epitope of Fab-12 (same as Y0317) or Flt-1D2, the VEGF residues that became buried upon forming complex with these molecules based on the crystal structure of the complex. Interestingly, the functional epitope of G6 on VEGF matches the structural epitope for Flt-1D2 more closely than does the structural epitope of Fab-12. Further, G6 shared similar hot spot as Flt-1 for VEGF since residues Phe17, Tyr21 and Tyr25 were highly important energetically for both interactions (\nFIG. 19\n). Fab-12 or Y0317, on the other hand, centered on the non-conserved and functionally important residue, Gly88, which is believed to be the reason for its lack of binding to mVEGF. It appeared that phage library derived antibody G6 targeted a conserved epitope on VEGF in a nearly identical fashion as VEGF receptor, while a hybridoma for hVEGF avoided generating a self-reactive anti-mouse antibody. There was, however, sufficient overlap between the two epitopes of G6 and Fab-12 as the binding of G6 and Fab-12 (Y0317) to hVEGF were mutually exclusive (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComparing the important sites on hVEGF for binding G6 and G6-23 indicated that the residues contributing most energetically, F17, Y21, and Y25 on 20's helix, and Q89A on 80's loop, remained the same, except the impact of residues on binding seemed to change (\nFIG. 19\n). For example, residues Y21 and Q89 when changed to alanine became a bigger hit for G6-23 than for G6. There were sites that modestly decreased its relative impact of its side chain in binding to G6-23 as compared to G6, e.g., 183, H86, and I91A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere was no new functionally important residues observed for the affinity-improved version, G6-23, yet a shuffling of energetic contributions among these functionally important residues in both antibodies, which was consistent with the finding structurally that identical positions of hVEGF were buried upon complexing with G6 or G6-23 (structural data below). When mapping these functionally important residues along with other moderate contributors on hVEGF structure, they appeared as a contiguous patch within the structural epitope of Flt-1D2, which were highly conserved between human and mouse VEGF, which explains the fact that both antibodies had equal affinity for both VEGF. By comparison of the footprint of both structural and functional epitope for G6 on hVEGF structure, it clearly showed that heavy chain CDR residues were the ones making contact with the positions on VEGF where alanine mutation were disruptive, such as the 20's helix and 80′ loop of hVEGF, whereas light chain CDR residues contact the 60's loop of hVEGF where the side chains were not functionally as important.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dilutions of phage that produced the sub-maximal binding signal (50-70%) were used in the solution competition assay where wild type or mutant hVEGF phage in PBT buffer were first incubated with increasing concentration of competing G6 or G6-23 Fab for 1-2 h at room temperature, then the mixtures were transferred to G6-Fab-coated plates to capture the unbound phage for 15 min, and bound phage were detected as described above. Competition curves were fit with a four-parameter non-linear regression curve-fitting program (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software) to determine the IC\n50 \nvalues which were calculated as the concentration of G6 or G6-23 Fab in solution binding stage that inhibited 50% of the phage from binding to immobilized G6 Fab. The ratio of the IC\n50 \nof mutant versus wild type hVEGF is the relative fold difference in binding affinities. For mutants that have severe reduced binding to G6-Fab-coated plate, Fab12 (Presta, 1997) or Flt-1\nD1-5 \nwere used as coat to capture to mutant phage after incubations with G6 or G6-23 Fab. Binding of hVEGF-phage to G6, G6-23 Fab, Fab12, Fab and Flt-1\nD1-5 \nwere mutually exclusive as tested with wild type VEGF phage.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nStructural Mapping of VEGF Binding Sites on G6, G6-23 and B20 and G6 and B20 Binding Sites on VEGF by Crystallography\n\n\nExpression, Purification Crystallization and Structural Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nResidues 8-109 of human VEGF were expressed, refolded, and purified as previously described (Christinger, H.

The mixture was homogenized and then passed twice through a microfluidizer. The suspension was then centrifuged at 12 k rpm for 60 min. The protein was loaded onto a Protein G column previously equilibrated with PBS at 5 ml/min. The column was washed with PBS to base line and then eluted with 0.58% acetic acid. Fractions containing G6 Fab were pooled and loaded directly onto a SP-sepharose column equilibrated with 20 mM MES, pH 5.5. The protein was eluted with a salt gradient of 0 to 0.25 M NaCl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG6 eluted from the SP-sepharose column was mixed with hVEGF8-109 and further purified over a \nSuperdex\n 200 column equilibrated with 30 mM Tris·Cl, pH 7.5 and 0.4 M NaCl. Fractions containing the complex were pooled, concentrated and used in crystallization trials. Crystals were grown at 19° C. using vapor diffusion method in sitting drops. Crystallization buffer containing 2.0 M ammonium sulfate and 5% iso-propanol were mixed in equal volume with protein solution (8 mg/ml protein). Crystals appeared after 3 days and belonged to space group P3121 with cell dimensions of a=117.9 Å and c=212.6 Å. These crystal forms contained 1 complex comprising of a VEGF dimer and 2 Fab molecules in the asymmetric unit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crystals were soaked in mother liquor, dipped in artificial mother liquor containing 25% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. A 2.8 Å data set was collected on an SSRL Synchrotron Source on beam line 9-1. The data were reduced using programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, Z. (1993). DENZO.

These results help describe the regions in VEGF and the regions in the antibodies that contact one another. Together with functional data relating to the binding VEGF presented earlier, common features of the G6 series of antibodies and the B20 series of antibodies can be observed. G6, G6-23 and B20 antibodies, as well as others bound to both mouse and human VEGF with relatively high affinities, unlike Fab-12 or YO317 (data not shown). Mutations of human VEGF G88A or G88S severely effected binding of Fab-12 or YO317 to VEGF, whereas the G6 series of antibodies and the B20 series of antibodies were relatively unaffected. Further, the binding of antibodies such as Fab-12 to VEGF resulted in the surface area of G88 being 100% buried whereas the binding of G6 and G6-23 resulted in G88 being less than 66% buried. Thus, it is believed that although partial contact with G88 is allowable for antibodies having the property of recognizing both mouse and human VEGF with good affinity, it is not likely that antibodies that contact human VEGF such that the surface area of Gly88 of human VEGF is 80% or more buried will bind to both mouse and human VEGF with good affinity. The functional epitope mapping results also show that the footprint of the G series of antibodies on VEGF is different from Fab-12 in that it has a greater contact extending into the 20's helix of VEGF (approximately residues numbered 10-30 of human VEGF) as well as contacting residues in the 80s loop (approximately residues 80-94 of human VEGF). The structural studies correlate well with the functional studies (see \nFIG. 19\n) in that mutations to several residues in the 20s helix decrease binding of the G6 and B20 series antibodies. The functional studies described in \nFIG. 19\n indicate that the G6 and the B20 series antibodies interact well with residues that are important for both Flt-1 and KDR binding as compared to A4.6.1\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nTetrinomial Diversity Libraries\n\n\n \n \n \nTo investigate whether a small subsets of the natural amino acids could be used to generate antigen-binding surfaces, we constructed naïve heavy chain phage-displayed libraries of antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) based on the humanized Fab4D5 (30), which recognizes the extracellular domain of the human receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 (Fendly, B. M., et al., (1990), \nCancer Res. \n50:1550-8. First, a previously described phagemid was modified to display bivalent Fab4D5 (Fab′-zip) on the surface of M13 bacteriophage. The gene coding for the Fab′-zip was fused to the C-terminal domain of the M13 gene-3 minor coat protein and expressed under the control of the phoA promoter (Lee, V., et al., (2004) \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n284:119-132). The phagemid was modified by a single mutation in the light chain (R66G) and by the introduction of TAA stop codons into all three heavy chain CDRs. For each library construction, the resulting phagemid (pV-0116c) was used as the “stop template” in a mutagenesis reaction with oligonucleotides designed to repair simultaneously the stop codons and introduce designed mutations at the desired sites, as described previously (Sidhu, S. S. et al., (2004) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n338(2):299-310; Sidhu, S S et al., (2000) \nMethods in Enzymology \n328:333-363).\n\n\n \n \n \n \na. Construction of KMT Library\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolvent-accessible positions within the heavy chain CDRs encoded by the phagemid were replaced by a single type of degenerate codon, KMT, that produced equal proportions of four amino acids (Y, A, D, S). The number of possible tetranomial combinations of the 20 natural amino acids is too great to be investigated exhaustively, and thus, we chose combinations that fulfilled two criteria. Firstly, we were restricted to combinations that could be accessed with standard DNA synthesis methods. Secondly, we ensured that each tetranomial set contained at least one small amino acid (glycine, serine or alanine), as we reasoned that small residues would provide conformational flexibility and prevent steric crowding. A total of 18 positions were chosen for randomization: \npositions\n 28 and 30-33 in CDR-H1; positions 50, 52, 53, 54, 56 and 58 in CDR-H2; and positions 95-100a in CDR-H3. Each constructed library contained ˜10\n10 \nunique members, and thus, the library diversities were only about one order of magnitude less than the maximum theoretical diversity (4\n18\n=7×10\n10\n. The KMT library name corresponds to the degenerate codon used; equimolar DNA degeneracies are represented by IUB code (K=G/T, M=A/C, R=A/G, S=G/C, W=A/T, Y=C/T).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb. Sorting and Binding Assays for the KMT library\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage from the naïve heavy chain library was cycled through rounds of binding selection with either human vascular endothelial growth factor (hVEGF) or other antigens on 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates (NUNC) as the capture target, as described previously (Sidhu, S. S. et al., (2004) supra; Sidhu, S S et al., (2000) \nMethods in Enzymology \n328:333-363). Bound phage were eluted with 0.1 M HCl for 10 min and the eluant was neutralized with 1.0 M Tris base. Phage were propagated in \nE. coli \nXL1-blue (Stratagene) with the addition of M13-KO7 helper phage (New England Biolabs).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter three rounds of selection, individual clones were grown in a 96-well format in 500 ul of 2YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin and M13-KO7. The culture supernatants were used in phage ELISAs to detect positive clones that bound to antigen-coated plates but not to BSA-coated plates (Sidhu, S. S. et al., (2004) supra). Positive clones were subjected to DNA sequence analysis assessed for antigen-specific binding with phage enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISAs) (Sidhu, S. S. et al., (2004) supra). Approximately 100 clones were screened against each antigen and specific binding clones were identified in each case. DNA sequencing revealed the number of unique clones isolated against each antigen. At least one tyrosine-containing library was successful against each antigen. In particular, Library-KMT was successful against 3 of the 4 antigens and generated 11 unique clones against human vascular endothelial growth factor (hVEGF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc. Second KMT Library—Light Chain Diversity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe constructed new versions of the KMT Library in which the CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 diversities were the same as described above, but the diversity of CDR-H3 was increased by allowing for all possible length variations ranging from 3-15 residues inserted between \n \nresidues\n \n 94 and 100b. All together, the pooled libraries contained a diversity of ˜10\n10 \nunique members that were cycled through selections for binding to hVEGF. Phage ELISA screens identified 93 hVEGF binders and DNA sequencing revealed 15 unique sequences (\nFIG. 36\n). Most of the clones contained CDR-H3 sequences with seven inserted residues, but we also identified two clones that contained longer insertions. The unique clones were subjected to competitive phage ELISAs (Sidhu, S. S. et al., (2004) supra) and exhibited estimated affinities in the 10 micromolar range (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc. Affinity Maturation of Unique Clones from Second KMT Library\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe next investigated whether the low affinity anti-VEGF clones could be affinity matured to obtain Fabs with affinities comparable to those of natural antibodies. To this end, we recombined the 15 heavy chains (\nFIG. 36\n) with a light chain library in which 12 solvent-accessible positions were replaced with the same tetranomial KMT codon. Specifically, the following light chain positions were randomized: positions 28-32 in CDR-L1, positions 50 and 53 in CDR-L2, and positions 91-94 and 96 in CDR-L3. The libraries contained ˜10\n10 \nunique members which greatly exceeded the theoretical diversity of possible light chains (4\n12\n=2×10\n7\n). The phagemid selected for the display of a heavy chain sequence and above light chain sequence had been modified by the introduction of TAA stop codons into all three light chain CDRs. The resulting phagemid was used as the “stop template” in a mutagenesis reaction that repaired the stop codons and introduced desired mutations, as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage from the light chain libraries were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma), 0.5% Superblock (Pierce) with 100 nM hVEGF biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin reagent (Pierce). Biotinylated hVEGF and bound phage were captured for 5 min with neutravidin (Pierce) immobilized on Maxisorp immunoplates. The plates were washed with PBS, 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 and the bound phage were eluted and propagated for additional rounds of selection, as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter selection, individual clones were grown in a 96-well format in 500 ul of 2YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin and M13-KO7. The culture supernatants were used in phage ELISAs to detect positive clones that bound to antigen-coated plates but not to BSA-coated plates (Sidhu, S. S. et al., (2004) supra). Positive clones were subjected to DNA sequence analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nhVEGF in solution was used for a high stringency selection. We sequenced 256 clones and identified 64 unique light chains combined with 9 of the 15 heavy chains (top 9 sequences in \nFIG. 36\n). Competitive phage ELISAs were used to estimate affinities of clones (Sidhu, S. S. et al., (2004) supra). Such ELISAs were carried out generally as follows. Phage clones were propagated from a single colony by growing in 40 ml of 2YT culture supplemented with carbenicillin and KO7 helper phage overnight at 30° C. Phage purified by PEG/NaCl precipitation were first serially diluted in PBST and tested for binding to an antigen-coated plate (hVEGF or mVEGF). The dilution that gave 50-70% saturating signal was used in the solution binding assay in which phage were first incubated with increasing concentration of antigen for 1-2 h and then transferred to antigen coated plate to capture the unbound phage for 10-15 min. An IC\n50 \nwas calculated as the concentration of antigen in solution binding stage that inhibited 50% of the phage from binding to immobilized antigen.

Generally, the variable domains were cloned into vectors designed for Fab expression in \nE. coli \nor transient IgG expression in mammalian cells. The Fab expression vector was derived from the phage display phagemid by deleting the sequence encoding for cP3 and adding a terminator sequence (GCTCGGTTGCCGCCGGGCGTTTTTTAT) (SEQ ID NO:920) about 20 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon at the end of \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1. Fab protein was generated by growing the transformed 34B8 \nE. coli \ncells in AP5 media at 30 C for 24 h as described (Presta, L. G., et al., (1997) \nCancer Res. \n57, 4593-4599). Fab was purified with Protein G affinity chromatography. The production yield for Fab was typically 5-10 mg/L in small scale shake flask growth and 0.5-3 g/L in fermenter growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding kinetic values for the purified Fabs based on surface plasmon resonance are shown below. hVEGF\n8-109 \nor mVEGF were immobilized on CM5 chips at ˜100 response units in a BIAcore™-3000, as described previously (Chen, Y., et al., (1999) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n293:865-881). Serial dilutions of Fab proteins (3-500 nM) were injected, and binding responses on the hVEGF or mVEGF flow cell were corrected by subtraction of responses on a blank flow cell. For kinetic analysis, a 1:1 Languir model with separate fittings of k\non \nand k\noff \nwas used. The K\nd \nvalues were estimated from the ratios of k\non \nand k\noff\n. All three Fabs bound with high affinity to hVEGF, but only two exhibited appreciable affinity for the highly homologous murine VEGF (mVEGF, 90% amino acid identity). We reasoned that YADS2 and YADS3 recognized VEGF through a very similar mechanism, as they exhibited high sequence homology in their CDRs and bound to both human and murine VEGF. In contrast, YADS1 likely represented a unique mode of antigen recognition as it contained very different CDR sequences and did not recognize mVEGF.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKinetic analysis of Fabs binding to immobilized VEGF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nk\non \n(s\n−1 \nM\n−1\n)\n\n\nk\noff \n(s\n−1\n)\n\n\nK\nd \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFab\n\n\nhVEGF\n\n\nmVEGF\n\n\nhVEGF\n\n\nmVEGF\n\n\n \nhVEGF\n \n \nmVEGF\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYADS\n \n \n \n \n\n\n3 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n \nND\n \n \n \n1\n \n\n\n5 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\nND\n1\n \n\n\n1.8 ± 0.3\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYADS\n\n\n1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n8 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n1 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n4 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n10 ± 2 \n\n\n5.0 ±\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYADS\n\n\n1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n3 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n5 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n2.0 ± 0.4\n\n\n3.7 ±\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nValues could not be determined due to the low affinity of the interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nCrystallization, Structure, Determination and Refinement of YADS1 and YADS2\n\n\n \n \n \nWe wanted to study the structural basis for antigen recognition, and so, the crystal structures of YADS1 and YADS2 in complex with hVEGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \na. Fab Protein Preparation for Crystal Structure Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhole cell broth was obtained from a 10 liter \nE. coli \nfermentation. The cells were lysed with a Manton-Gaulin homogenizer. The suspension was centrifuged, the supernatant was loaded on a protein A-Sepharose column (Genentech, Inc.), and the column was eluted with 0.1 M acetic acid. The pH was adjusted to 4.0 with 1.0 M Tris, pH 8.0 and the eluant was loaded on a SP-Sepharose column (Pharmacia). The column was washed with equilibration buffer (20 mM MES, pH 5.5) and Fab protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient in equilibration buffer. Residues 8-109 of human VEGF were expressed, refolded, and purified as previously described (Christinger, H. W., et al., (1996). \nProt. Struct. Funct. Genet. \n26, 353-357).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe complex between each Fab and the receptor-binding fragment of hVEGF was formed and purified, as described previously (Muller, Y. A., (1998), supra). The complex (in PBS, 25 mM EDTA) was concentrated to an optical density of A\n280\n=10. Hanging-drop experiments were performed using the vapor-diffusion method with 10 ul drops consisting of a 1:1 ratio of protein solution and reservoir solution. The reservoir solution for the YADS1 complex was 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 25% PEG 3350 (w/v), 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5. The reservoir solution for the YADS2 complex was 1.0 M lithium chloride, 10% PEG 6000 (w/v), 0.1 M MES, pH 6.0. After 1-2 weeks at 19° C., plate or spindle shaped crystals grew for the YADS1 or YADS2 complex, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCrystals were incubated in reservoir solution supplemented with 25% glycerol prior to flash freezing. A data set was collected from a single frozen crystal at the beam line 5.0.2 of the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley) for YADS1 and at the beam line 9.2 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Stanford University) for YADS2. The data was processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, Z. M., (1997) \nMethods Enzymol. \n276:307-326). The structures were solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (CCP4 (1994) \nActa Cryst\n. D50:760-763) and the coordinates of a previously solved Fab-hVEGF complex (PDB entry 1BJ1). The structure was refined using the programs REFMAC (CCP4 (1994), supra). The models were manually adjusted using program O (Jomes, T. A., et al., (1991) \nActa Crystallogra A \n47 (Pt2):969-995). The following programs were used to calculate the surface areas of interaction RESAREA version 3.2: 05/08/93 and AREAIMOL version 3.2: 19/12/95. These programs are part of the CCP4 suite Collaborative Computational Project, \nNumber\n 4. 1994 (“The CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography” \nActa Cryst\n. D50, 760-763). The crystal structures of YADS1 and YADS2 in complex with hVEGF were solved and refined at 2.65 and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively (Table 9).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nData collection and refinement statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor YADS1 and YADS2 hVEGF complexes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nYADS\n 1\n\n\n \nYADS\n 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.

Also reported is the surface area of each residue of VEGF antibody that is buried in VEGF (Å\n2\n) is reported below together with the percentage of the total surface area of the residue that is buried. See values for YADS-1:VEGF and YADS-2:VEGF complexes below. In all cases, because VEGF is a dimer, the residue numbers of VEGF referring to monomer 1 (of the VEGF dimer) are 8-109 and residue numbers of VEGF referring to monomer 2 (of the VEGF dimer) are 1008-1109.

These results help describe the regions in VEGF and the regions in the antibodies that contact one another. Together with functional data relating to the binding VEGF presented earlier, common features of the G6 series of antibodies YADS-2 and YADS-3 antibodies can be observed. The binding of antibodies such as Fab-12 and YADS-1 to VEGF resulted in the surface area of G88 being 100% and 95%, respectively, buried whereas the binding of G6, G6-23 and YADS-2 resulted in G88 being only 66% or less buried.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fab frameworks were essentially unchanged in comparison with the structure of the parental Fab4D5; the C\nα\n atoms of the YADS1 and YADS2 frameworks superimposed with Fab4D5 with root mean square deviations (rmsd) of 0.87 and 0.55 Å, respectively. The Cα atoms of the hVEGF molecules in the two structures superimpose well onto each other with rmsds of 0.7 Å for 87 Cα positions. The largest deviation of 3.7 Å occurs at residue \nglutamic acid\n 64. The loop containing this residue has inherent flexibility as shown by Muller et al., supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn both complexes, antigen recognition was entirely mediated by contacts with the CDR loops. In terms of buried surface area, YADS1 used both the heavy (498 Å\n2\n) and light chain (407 Å\n2\n), whereas YADS2 used mostly the heavy chain (543 Å\n2\n) and a small contribution from the light chain (157 Å\n2\n). Notably, residues at randomized positions accounted for essentially all of the buried surface area (98% and 100% for YADS1 and YADS2, respectively), and furthermore, the buried surface area involved almost entirely side chain atoms (82% and 80% for YADS1 and YADS2, respectively). Thus, both Fabs bound to antigen through interactions that were almost entirely mediated by side chains located at positions that were randomized in the libraries.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the hVEGF side, the structural epitopes for binding to YADS1 and YADS2 overlap with each other, and also, with the structural epitope for binding to \ndomain\n 2 of the hVEGF receptor Flt-1 (Flt-1\nD2\n,). The YADS1 and YADS2 antibodies can inhibit binding of Flt to human VEGF in vitro (data not shown), and they are expected to inhibit binding of KDR to human VEGF too. Nonetheless, there are significant differences between the structural epitopes for the two Fabs. In particular, of the 11 residues that differ between human and murine VEGF, only \nresidue\n 88 is in contact with the Fabs, but the interactions involving this residue explain the differing affinities of YADS1 and YADS2 for mVEGF. In the YADS2 complex, Gly88 is partially exposed to solvent, while in the YADS1 complex it is completely buried in the interface. Murine VEGF contains a larger serine residue at \nposition\n 88; this substitution can be readily accommodated in the YADS2 complex, but in the YADS1 model, the introduction of a serine side chain at the buried Gly88 position would require major rearrangements for the complex to be preserved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, both Fabs bind to antigen through contacts almost exclusively involving side chains at varied sites. In total, the CDRs of YADS1 and YADS2 contain 66 residues derived from randomized codons, and these residues are almost equally distributed amongst the four amino acid types allowed in the library design. However, when we consider the subset of residues that make contact with antigen, there is a clear bias in that 16 tyrosines account for 50% of the contact residues. Indeed, all but two of the tyrosines selected in the CDRs of YADS1 and YADS2 make contact with antigen, and all told, tyrosines contribute 71% of the surface area buried upon complexation with hVEGF. Thus, essentially every selected tyrosine side chain is involved in directly mediating antigen recognition and the other selected amino acids apparently play auxiliary roles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite the predominance of tyrosine in the synthetic antigen-binding sites, an examination of the heavy atom (non-hydrogen) content of buried surface areas reveals that the Fab-hVEGF interfaces are no more hydrophobic than the interface between hVEGF and Flt-1\nD2\n. On the hVEGF side, the heavy atom composition of the buried surface area is very similar in all three cases, being composed predominantly of carbon but also containing significant proportions of nitrogen and oxygen. Within the buried surface areas of the Fabs, nitrogen atoms are almost entirely absent, because the side chains allowed in the libraries were composed entirely of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. Nonetheless, both Fabs bury a large number of oxygen atoms upon binding to hVEGF, and in both cases, the proportion of the buried surface area contributed by carbon is considerably less than that contributed by carbon to the buried surface area of Flt-1\nD2\n. Thus, the predominance of tyrosine in the synthetic CDRs does not produce highly hydrophobic Fab-antigen interfaces dominated by aromatic interactions. On the contrary, the tyrosine residues make specific contacts with a wide variety of residues on the hVEGF surface, and these interactions utilize both the side chain hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, we circumvented the complexity of the natural immune system by using precisely defined synthetic libraries, and as a result, we were able to investigate the special role that tyrosine plays in antigen-binding sites. We generated libraries with restricted diversities and displayed the diverse surfaces on a fixed scaffold formed by the framework regions and buried CDR residues. Our results dramatically demonstrate that, in the context of a suitable scaffold, the tyrosine side chain is capable of mediating most of the contacts necessary for high affinity antigen recognition. Thus, it seems very likely that the overabundance of tyrosine in natural antigen-binding sites is a consequence of the side chain being particularly well suited for making productive contacts with antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis supposition is also consistent with the chemical nature of tyrosine. As noted previously, the tyrosine side chain is large enough to sweep out large volumes of space with only a few torsion angles, and it can form hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and attractive electrostatic interactions with positively charged groups (Zemlin, M., et al., (2003) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n334:733-749). In addition, the uncharged tyrosine side chain avoids electrostatic repulsion effects, and its midrange hydrophilicity allows it to adapt favorably to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments (Zemlin, (2003), supra; Ivanov, I., et al., (2002) in \nThe Antibodies\n, eds. Zanetti, M. & Capra, J. (Taylor & Fancis, London, N.Y.), pp. 43-67; Mian, I. S., et al., (1991) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n217:133-151).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also observed that, while alanine and serine residues did not make many direct contacts with antigen, they allowed for space and conformational flexibility which may be crucial for appropriate positioning of the large tyrosine side chains. Thus, these small residues may serve an auxiliary function in facilitating productive contacts between tyrosine and antigen. It is worth noting that, perhaps not coincidentally, serine is also highly abundant in natural antigen-binding sites (Mian, (1991), supra). Finally, the paucity of antigen contacts mediated by aspartate suggests that it may be possible to further minimize the chemical diversity of these synthetic antigen-binding sites.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nAnti-VEGF Antibodies from YADS-A and YADS-B Libraries\n\n\n \n \n \n(a) Construction of Phage-Displayed Fab Libraries YADS-A and YADS-B\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo phage displayed libraries (YADS-A and YADS-B) were constructed, as generally described in Example 6, with a previously described phagemid designed to display bivalent Fab moieties dimerized by a leucine zipper domain inserted between the Fab heavy chain and the C-terminal domain of the gene-3 minor coat protein (P3C), except that the following positions of 4D5 were randomized were randomized as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRandomized Positions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary\n\n\nCDRH1\n\n\nCDRH2\n\n\nCDRH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYADS-\n \n \n \n \nA\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n28, 30, 31, 32, 33\n\n\n50, 52, 53, 54,\n\n\n95, 96, 97, 98, 99,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n56, 58\n\n\n100, 100a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYADS-\n \n \n \n \nB\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n28, 30, 31, 32, 33\n\n\n50, 52, 53, 54,\n\n\n95, 96, 97, 98, 99,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n56, 58\n\n\n100, 100a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor library YADS-A, two separate mutagenesis reactions were performed.

This resulted in the introduction of degenerate codons that encoded for the four amino acids tyrosine, alanine, aspartate, and serine (YADS).

After overnight growth at 37° C., phage were concentrated by precipitation with PEG/NaCl and resuspended in PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma), as described previously (Sidhu et al., supra). Phage solutions (˜10\n12 \nphage/mL) were added to the coated immunoplates. Following a 2 h incubation to allow for phage binding, the plates were washed 10 times with PBS, 0.05% Tween20. Bound phages were eluted with 0.1 M HCl for 10 min and the eluant was neutralized with 1.0 M Tris base. Eluted phage were amplified in \nE. coli \nXL1-blue and used for further rounds of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe libraries were subjected to 4 rounds of selection against each target protein. Individual clones from each round were grown in a 96-well format in 500 μL of 2YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin and M13-VCS, and the culture supernatants were used directly in phage ELISAs (Sidhu et al., supra) to detect phage-displayed Fabs that bound to plates coated with target protein but not to plates coated with BSA. A clone was considered to be a specific binder if the ELISA signal on target coated plates was at least 20 times greater than that on BSA coated plates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific binders were sequenced, and the sequences of unique clones are shown in \nFIGS. 37 and 38\n for libraries YADS-A and YADS-B, respectively.

This vector comprised the YADS2 sequence. The humanized antibody YADS2 variable domains were expressed under the control of the IPTG-inducible Ptac promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLibrary NNK was constructed with randomized residues in the heavy chain CDR-3 of YADS2. The specific residues that were randomized are 50, 95, 97, 99, 100, and 100a of the heavy chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt each of the randomized positions, the wild-type codon was replaced by a degenerate NNK codon (N=A/T/G/C, K=G/T in an equimolar ratio) that encoded for all 20 natural amino acids.\n\n\n \n \nLibraries were constructed using the method of Kunkel (Kunkel, T. A., Roberts, J. D. & Zakour, R. A., \nMethods Enzymol\n. (1987), 154, 367-382) with previously described methods (Sidhu, S. S., Lowman, H. B., Cunningham, B. C. & Wells, J. A., \nMethods Enzymol\n. (2000), 328, 333-363). A unique “stop template” version of the Fab display vector was used to generate the NNK library.

Mutagenic oligonucleotides with degenerate NNK codons at the positions to be diversified were used to simultaneously introduce CDR diversity and repair the stop codons. Diversity was introduced into CDR-H3 with the oligonucleotide named NNK-H1 (GCA GCT TCT GGC TTC GCT ATT TAT GAT TAT GAT ATA CAC TGG GTG CGT (SEQ ID NO:25)), NNK-H2 (CTG GAA TGG GTT GCA NNK ATT GCT CCA TAT GCT GGT GCT ACT GCT TAT GCC GAT AGC GTC (SEQ ID NO:26)) and NNK-H3 GTC TAT TAT TGT AGC CGC NNK TCT NNK GCT NNK NNK NNK GCT ATG GAC TAC TGG (SEQ ID NO:27)). The mutagenic oligonucleotides for all three heavy chain CDRs were incorporated simultaneously in a single mutagenesis reaction, so that simultaneous incorporation of the mutagenic oligonucleotide resulted in the introduction of the designed diversity at each position and simultaneously repaired all the TAA stop codons, thus generating an open reading frame that encoded a Fab library member fused to a homodimerizing leucine zipper and P3C. Note that the oligonucleotide NNK-H1 does not contain any degenerate codon and is added to the mutagenesis reaction to repair the TAA stop codons and introduce the wild type YADS2 sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mutagenesis reactions were electro porated into \nE. coli \nSS320 (Sidhu et al., supra), and the transformed cells were grown overnight in the presence of M13-KO7 helper phage (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) to produce phage particles that encapsulated the phagemid DNA and displayed Fab fragments on their surfaces.

After overnight growth at 37° C., phage were concentrated by precipitation with PEG/NaCl and resuspended in Superblock TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma), as described previously (Sidhu et al., supra). Phage solutions (˜10\n12 \nphage/mL) were added to the coated immunoplates. Following a 2 h incubation to allow for phage binding, the plates were washed 10 times with PBS, 0.05\n% Tween\n 20. Bound phage were eluted with 0.1 M HCl for 10 min and the eluant was neutralized with 1.0 M Tris base. Eluted phage were amplified in \nE. coli \nXL1-blue and used for further rounds of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe libraries were subjected to 5 rounds of selection against VEGF. Individual clones from each round of selection were grown in a 96-well format in 500 μL of 2YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin and M13-VCS, and the culture supernatants were used directly in phage ELISAs (Sidhu et al., supra) to detect phage-displayed Fabs that bound to plates coated with target protein but not to plates coated with BSA. Specific binders were defined as those phage clones that exhibited an ELISA signal at least 15-fold greater on target-coated plates in comparison with BSA-coated plates. Individual clones were screened after 3 to 5 rounds of selection for VEGF binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndividual clones representing specific binders were subjected to DNA sequence analysis, and the sequences of the randomized CDR positions are shown in \nFIG. 40\n. The affinity of the different YADS variants was estimated by using a “two point competitive phage ELISA”. The three best clones were produced as soluble Fab and were tested for their affinity with respect to hVEGF. BIAcore data was obtained according to Chen et al., \nJ Mol Biol\n. (1999), 293(4):865-81. Briefly, binding affinities were calculated from association and dissociation rate constants measured using a BIAcore™-3000 surface plasmon resonance system (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). A biosensor chip was activated for covalent coupling of VEGF using N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) instructions. hVEGF or mVEGF was buffer-exchanged into 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8 and diluted to approximately 30 mg/ml. Aliquots of VEGF were injected at a flow rate of 2 microL/minute to achieve approximately 200-300 response units (RU) of coupled protein. A solution of 1 M ethanolamine was injected as a blocking agent. For kinetics measurements, twofold serial dilutions of Fab were injected in PBS/Tween buffer (0.05% Tween20 in phosphate-buffered saline) at 25° C. at a flow rate of 10 microL/minute. Equilibrium dissociation constants, Kd values from surface plasmon resonance measurements were calculated as k\noff\n/k\non\n.

This vector comprises the humanized antibody 4D5 variable domains under the control of the IPTG-inducible Ptac promoter as described above. The humanized antibody 4D5 is an antibody which has mostly human consensus sequence framework regions in the heavy and light chains, and CDR regions from a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for Her-2. The method of making the anti-Her-2 antibody and the identity of the variable domain sequences are provided in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,821,337 and 6,054,297.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo libraries were constructed. Library YS-A was constructed with randomized residues in all three heavy chain CDRs, while Library YS-B was constructed with randomized residues in all three heavy chain CDRs and light chain CDR3. The specific residues that were randomized are shown below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRandomized Positions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary\n\n\nCDRL3\n\n\nCDRH1\n\n\nCDRH2\n\n\nCDRH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYS-\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n28, 30, 31,\n\n\n50, 52, 53,\n\n\n95, 96, 97, 98,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32, 33\n\n\n54, 56, 58\n\n\n99, 100, 100a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYS-B\n\n\n91-94, 96\n\n\n28, 30, 31,\n\n\n50, 52, 53,\n\n\n95, 96, 97, 98,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32, 33\n\n\n54, 56, 58\n\n\n99, 100, 100a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt each of the randomized positions, the wild-type codon was replaced by a degenerate TMT codon (M=A/C in an equimolar ratio) that encoded for Tyr and Ser in an equimolar ratio. In addition, the length of CDRH3 was varied by using oligonucleotides that replaced the 7 wild-type codons between positions 101 to 107 with varying numbers of TMT codons (7 to 20 for Library YS-A and 7 to 15 for Library YS-B). In addition, the CDRL3 of Library YS-B was randomized so that 50% of the library members contained a deletion at \nposition number\n 91 while the other 50% contained the wildtype Gln residue at this position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLibraries were constructed using the method of Kunkel (Kunkel, T. A., Roberts, J. D. & Zakour, R. A., \nMethods Enzymol\n. (1987), 154, 367-382) with previously described methods (Sidhu, S. S., Lowman, H. B., Cunningham, B. C. & Wells, J. A., \nMethods Enzymol\n. (2000), 328, 333-363). A unique “stop template” version of the Fab display vector was used to generate both libraries YS-A and YS-B. We used a template phagemid designated pV0350-4 with TAA stop codons inserted at \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 30, 33, 52, 54, 56, 57, 60, 102, 103, 104, 107, 108 of the heavy chain. No stops were introduced in the light chain CDR3. Mutagenic oligonucleotides with degenerate TMT codons at the positions to be diversified were used to simultaneously introduce CDR diversity and repair the stop codons. For both libraries, diversity was introduced into CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 with oligonucleotides H1 and H2, respectively. For Library YS-A, diversity was introduced into CDR-H3 with an equimolar mixture of oligonucleotides. For library YS-B, diversity was introduced into CDR-H3 with an equimolar mixture of oligonucleotides. For library YS-B, diversity was introduced into CDR-L3 with an equimolar mixture of oligonucleotides. The mutagenic oligonucleotides for all CDRs to be randomized were incorporated simultaneously in a single mutagenesis reaction, so that simultaneous incorporation of all the mutagenic oligonucleotides resulted in the introduction of the designed diversity at each position and simultaneously repaired all the TAA stop codons, thus generating an open reading frame that encoded a Fab library member fused to a homodimerizing leucine zipper and P3C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mutagenesis reactions were electroporated into \nE. coli \nSS320 (Sidhu et al., supra), and the transformed cells were grown overnight in the presence of M13-KO7 helper phage (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) to produce phage particles that encapsulated the phagemid DNA and displayed Fab fragments on their surfaces. Each library contained greater than 5×10\n9 \nunique members.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) Selection of Specific Antibodies from the Naïve Libraries YS-A and YS-B\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage from library YS-A or YS-B were cycled through rounds of binding selection to enrich for clones binding to targets of interest. Target proteins, human VEGF\n8-109 \nand murine VEGF were analyzed separately with each library. The binding selections were conducted using previously described methods (Sidhu et al., supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNUNC 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates were coated overnight at 4° C. with capture target (5 μg/mL) and blocked for 2 h with Superblock TBS (tris-buffered saline) (Pierce). After overnight growth at 37° C., phage were concentrated by precipitation with PEG/NaCl and resuspended in Superblock TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma), as described previously (Sidhu et al., supra). Phage solutions (˜10\n12 \nphage/mL) were added to the coated immunoplates. Following a 2 h incubation to allow for phage binding, the plates were washed 10 times with PBS, 0.05\n% Tween\n 20. Bound phage were eluted with 0.1 M HCl for 10 min and the eluant was neutralized with 1.0 M Tris base. Eluted phage were amplified in \nE. coli \nXL1-blue and used for further rounds of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe libraries were subjected to 5 rounds of selection against each target protein, and at each round, titers were obtained for phage binding to either the target protein or blank wells coated with Superblock TBS. The titer of phage bound to target-coated wells divided by the titer of phage bound to the blank wells was defined as an enrichment ratio used to quantify specific binding of phage pools to the target protein; larger enrichment ratios indicate higher specific binding. The enrichment ratios were observed after 3, 4, or 5 rounds of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndividual clones from each round of selection were grown in a 96-well format in 500 μL of 2YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin and M13-VCS, and the culture supernatants were used directly in phage ELISAs (Sidhu et al., supra) to detect phage-displayed Fabs that bound to plates coated with target protein but not to plates coated with BSA. Specific binders were defined as those phage clones that exhibited an ELISA signal at least 15-fold greater on target-coated plates in comparison with BSA-coated plates. Individual clones were screened after 2 rounds of selection for binding to human VEGF or after 5 rounds of selection for the other target proteins. These data were used to calculate the percentage of specific binders, and the results for each library against each target protein. Each library produced binders against each target protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndividual clones representing specific binders were subjected to DNA sequence analysis, and the sequences of the randomized CDR positions are shown in \nFIG. 41\n. It can be seen that, for each target protein, it was possible to select specific binders that contained only Tyr or Ser at the randomized positions (although some non-designed mutations were observed, which were likely created during library construction probably due to impurities in the oligonucleotides). Furthermore, the sequences of specific binders were unique to the target protein against which they were selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo of the binders listed in \nFIG. 41\n (\nhVEGF binder #\n3 and #18) were tested for their affinity with respect to hVEGF and mVEGF. BIAcore data was obtained according to Chen et al., \nJ Mol Biol\n. (1999), 293(4):865-81. Briefly, binding affinities of \nhVEGF binder #\n3 and #18 for hVEGF and mVEGF were calculated from association and dissociation rate constants measured using a BIAcore™-2000 surface plasmon resonance system (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). A biosensor chip was activated for covalent coupling of VEGF using N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) instructions. hVEGF or mVEGF was buffer-exchanged into 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8 and diluted to approximately 30 mg/ml. Aliquots of VEGF were injected at a flow rate of 2 microL/minute to achieve approximately 200-300 response units (RU) of coupled protein. A solution of 1 M ethanolamine was injected as a blocking agent. For kinetics measurements, twofold serial dilutions of Fab were injected in PBS/Tween buffer (0.05% Tween20 in phosphate-buffered saline) at 25° C. at a flow rate of 10 microL/minute.

A phagemid designed to display bivalent Fab4D5 on the surface of M13 bacteriophage was used to construct libraries, as described above. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to replace CDR positions with TMT degenerate codons, (M=A/C in equal proportions).

Each library contained ˜10\n10 \nunique members, and thus, the actual library diversities were comparable to the maximum number of unique sequences encoded by the library designs (4×10\n9\n).\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage from the libraries were cycled through rounds of binding selection with antigen immobilized on 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates (NUNC) as the capture target, as described previously (Sidhu, S. S., et al., (2000) \nMethods Enzymol. \n328:333-363). After five rounds of selection, phage were produced from individual clones grown in a 96-well format and the culture supernatants were used in phage ELISAs to detect specific binding clones. Specific binding clones were determined to be Fab-phage that bound to the cognate antigen but did not exhibit detectable binding to seven other proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetitive phage ELISA. A modified phage ELISA was used to estimate the binding affinities of Fabs (Sidhu, (2000), supra; Deshayes, K., et al., (2002) \nChem. Biol. \n9:495-505). Phage ELISAs were carried out on plates coated with antigen, as described above. Phage displaying antibody fragments were serially diluted in PBS, 0.5% (w/v) BSA, 0.1% (v/v) \nTween\n 20, and binding was measured to determine a phage concentration giving ˜50% of the signal at saturation. A fixed, sub-saturating concentration of phage was preincubated for 2 hours with serial dilutions of antigen and then transferred to assay plates coated with antigen. After 15 minutes incubation, the plates were washed with PBS, 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 and incubated 30 minutes with horseradish peroxidase/anti-M13 antibody conjugate (1:5000 dilution) (Pharmacia). The plates were washed, developed with TMB substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories), quenched with 1.0 M H\n3\nPO\n4\n, and read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. The binding affinities of the Fabs were determined as IC\n50 \nvalues defined as the concentration of antigen that blocked 50% of the phage binding to the immobilized antigen. DNA sequencing of 184 binding clones revealed 63 unique sequences shown in \nFIG. 42\n. Interestingly, the clones from library B exhibit homology within the selected CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 sequences. In contrast, the CDR-H3 sequences of the clones from library A exhibit homology amongst themselves but are very different from the sequences from library B. Thus, it appears that the nature of the CDR-L3 sequence influenced the selection of CDR-H3 sequences, and as a result, two distinct classes of anti-hVEGF antibodies arose from the two different libraries. The clones were screened by competitive phage ELISA and exhibited IC\n50 \nvalues ranging from approximately 60 nM to greater than 5 μM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein purification and affinity analysis. The three anti-hVEGF clones with the highest estimated affinities (top three sequences in \nFIG. 42\n) were purified as free Fab proteins. Fab proteins were purified from \nE. coli \nas described previously (Muler, Y. A., et al., (1998) \nStructure \n6:1153-1167). See \nFIG. 43\n for YS1 Fab sequence. The binding kinetics of the purified Fabs (designated Fab-YS1, Fab-YS2 and Fab-YS3) were studied by surface plasmon resonance. Binding kinetics were determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore™-3000 with hVEGF immobilized on CM5 chips at ˜500 response units, as described previously (Chen, Y., et al., (1999) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n293:865-881). Serial dilutions of Fab proteins were injected, and binding responses were corrected by subtraction of responses on a blank flow cell. For kinetic analysis, a 1:1 Langmuir model of global fittings of k\non \nand k\noff \nwas used. The K\nd \nvalues were determined from the ratios of k\non \nand k\noff\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYS1\n \nYS2\n \nYS3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nk\na \n(10\n4 \n· M\n−1 \n· s\n−1\n)\n \n5 ± 1\n \n 6 ± 1\n \n5 ± 1\n \n \n \n \n \nkd (10\n−3 \n· s\n−1\n)\n \n2.8 ± 0.1\n \n11.7 ± 0.4\n \n9.4 ± 0.1\n \n \n \n \n \nK\nD \n(nM)\n \n60 ± 20\n \n220 ± 60\n \n190 ± 40 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFab-YS1 exhibited the highest affinity for hVEGF (K\nd\n=60 nM), while the other two Fabs bound approximately 5-fold less tightly due to faster off rates. The sequences of Fab-YS1 and Fab-YS2 differ in only three positions, and thus, these three differences account for the improved affinity of Fab-YS1 in comparison with Fab-YS2.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunohistochemistry. We next investigated the specificity of Fab-YS1 by using the protein to visualize VEGF in mammalian cells transfected with a gene encoding for VEGF fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Human A673 cells expressing murine VEGF-GFP were stained and imaged, as described (Peden, A. A., et al., (2004) \nJ. Cell. Biol. \n164:1065-1076). In the plus VEGF panel, Fab-YS1 was pre-incubated for 5 minutes with a 5-fold excess of recombinant VEGF before being incubated with the cells. The immunohistochemical staining with Fab-YS1 precisely overlapped with the fluorescence signal from the VEGF-GFP fusion (data not shown). Furthermore, the signal was completely blocked by incubating Fab-YS1 with hVEGF prior to the staining.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoprecipitation. We also conducted immunoprecipitations of endogenous hVEGF and compared the performance of Fab-YS1 to that of a highly specific, natural anti-hVEGF monoclonal antibody (A4.6.1) (Kim, K. J., et al., (1992) \nGrowth Factors \n7:53-64). A673 cells were metabolically labelled and immunoprecipitations were performed from the media, as described (Kim, K. J., et al., supra) using 15 ug of anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Clontech), Fab-YS1 or monoclonal antibody A4.6.1. The immune complexes were eluted by boiling and resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 14% acrylamide gel under reducing conditions. The gel was dried and then exposed to a phosphoimager plate overnight. Both antibodies immunoprecipitated an identical set of bands that likely represent hVEGF variants generated by alternative mRNA splicing (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that Fab-YS1 binds to hVEGF with high affinity and specificity comparable to that of a natural antibody, even in the complex cellular milieu.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nIn vivo Activities of the Anti-VEGF Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nG6-23 inhibits neonate mouse growth and survival. Newborn mice (C57/BL6) were intra-peritoneally (i.p.) injected daily at 1 day post-natally with G6-23 IgG (50 mg/kg) or Flt-1(1-3) Fc (50 mg/kg), or appropriate controls, gp120-Fc, PBS or no injection. The body weights were measured daily and the survival rate of the mice were counted. As shown in \nFIG. 10\n, G6-23 reduced body weight equal potently as mFlt-1(1-3)Fc, which is a known mVEGF antagonist. Moreover, mouse survival rates were also equivalent between the two groups. Significantly, the results of G6-23 specifically indicated that mVEGF is required for the growth and survival of new born mice, whereas the effect of Flt-1(1-3) Fc is less specific since it is known to block not only mVEGF, but also placental growth factor (PIGF) and VEGF-B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG6-23 effectively inhibits the growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice. KM12 and SW480, two human colon-rectal cancer cell lines, were grown in cell culture first and about 10\n6 \ncells from each cell line were injected into host nude mice. When the tumor reached approximately 100 mm\n3 \nin size (1 week after injection), G6-23 or control were injected (10 mg/kg) twice weekly (six nude mice were used for each group). The tumor sizes were measured till \nday\n 13 after antibody injection. As shown in \nFIG. 11\n, G6-23 was significantly effective in reducing tumor volumes of both KM12 (left graph) and SW480 (right graph) cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene expressions for both hVEGF and mVEGF were examined in KM12 xenograft mice. Samples of tumors and surrounding tissues were extracted and Tagman was used to quantify the gene expression levels. In these xenograft models, hVEGF came from the implanted human KM12 tumor cells, whereas mVEGF came from surrounding host stromal cells. As shown in \nFIG. 12\n, samples from mice treated with G6-23 on \nday\n 3 and \nday\n 13 had higher gene expression levels for both hVEGF and mVEGF compared to the control groups. The results indicate that while mouse treated with G6-23 had reduced tumor growth and much decreased vascularity, expressions of both mVEGF and hVEGF were up-regulated in response to the reduction of angiogenesis. It also indicates that at the tumor site, there is significant infiltration of mouse stromal cells, which is a major source of VEGF for the tumor angiogenesis. Therefore, in a preclinical animal model such as the xenograft model described herein, an antibody capable of cross-reacting and blocking both hVEGF and mVEGF is necessary for studying its efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMouse (Lewis) lung carcinoma (LL2) cells were also used in a nude mice model to test the inhibitory effect of G6-23. About 10\n6 \ncells LL2 cells in a matrigel formulation were administered subcutaneously in the flank of 5-week old beige nude mice. One group of six mice were then treated with G6-23 at 10 mg/kg, injected via i.p. twice weekly for a span of 19 days. Other control agents (i.e., mFlt(1-3)-IgG, rag-10) were also used to treat groups of six mice. As shown in \nFIG. 13\n, G6-23 significantly reduced the rate of tumor growth with a pharmacological effect comparable to that of mFlt(1-3)-IgG, which is known to be multi-potent in blocking not only mVEGF, but also other angiogenic factors mPIGF and mVEGF-B. Serum levels of bioactive G6-23 was also measured. The result indicates that its levels (62-121 ug/ml) are well within the expected range for a therapeutic neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHM-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were also used to study the tumor growth inhibition in nude mice. G6 IgG antibody, G6-31 IgG antibody, the Avastin™ antibody, the Y0317 IgG antibody used in this study were expressed in and purified from CHO cells. HM-7 cells were maintained in culture with F12:DMEM medium, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 1% Glutamine. Cells were grown at 37° C. in 5% CO2 until confluence, harvested, counted, and washed and resuspended in sterile Metrigel at a concentration of 25×10\n6 \ncells per ml. Xenografts were established in 4- to 6-week-old female Beige Nude XID mice by injecting 5×10\n6 \nof HM-7 cultured cells into the dorsal flank of the mice and allowed to grow. After 48 hours, the tumors were palpable in all mice, and cohorts were randomly selected (n=10) to provide day-0 controls. The remaining mice were divided into 23 groups and injected twice weekly with different anti-VEGF antibodies. The treatments for the study groups are as follows: Group A (n=10×1): mice treated with control antibody MAB (an anti-ragweed antibody) in 0.1 ml by interperitoneal injection twice/week with a high dose (5 mg/kg). Group B (n=10×5): mice treated with G6 IgG antibody in 0.1 ml by interperitoneal injection twice/week with the same dose (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 2 or 5 mg/kg). Group C (n=10×5): mice treated with Y0317 IgG antibody in 0.1 ml by interperitoneal injection twice/week with the same dose (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 2 or 5 mg/kg). Group D (n=10×5): mice treated with the Avastin™ antibody in 0.1 ml by interperitoneal injection twice/week with the same dose (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 2 or 5 mg/kg). Group E (n=10×5): mice treated with G6-31 IgG antibody in 0.1 ml by interperitoneal injection twice/week with the same dose (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 2 or 5 mg/kg). The mice (n=10 control and treated animals) were killed at \n \n \n \n \n \nday\n \n \n \n \n \n 4, 7, 11, 14, 17 and 21 after initiation of injections, and the tumors were excised and weighed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results show that there was a significant suppression of tumor growth when the G6, G6-31, Y0317 and the Avastin™ antibodies were administered (p<0.5) (\nFIGS. 33A-E\n). The excised tissues from the anti-VEGF antibody treated mice were smaller in size and less vascularized as compared to the tumors excised from the control mice. As discussed above, the G6 and the G6-23 antibody unlike the Avastin™ antibody and the Y0317 antibody can bind to both human VEGF and mouse VEGF, including mouse stromal VEGF which can be upregulated upon implantation of human colorectal tumors in mouse models. Direct comparison of the activity of the G6 and G6-31 antibodies, which antibodies bind similar epitopes, indicates that at most datapoints the antibody with the higher affinity for VEGF-A, the G6-31 antibody, had increased tumor growth inhibiting properties."
