    "text": "Serotonin reuptake inhibitors AbstractA serotonin reuptake inhibitor which can be used in the treatment of depression and which has a decreased occurrence of unwanted side effects. The serotonin reuptake inhibitors are bi-functional organic molecules which combine serotonin transporter reuptake inhibition with serotonin (5-HT, such as 5-HT2A) receptor antagonism in one molecular entity. The serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) homologue portion of the molecule shows an affinity to the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) and has antidepressant properties. The piperazine or piperidine portion of the molecule demonstrates an affinity to 5-HT receptors and restores the undesired side effects of SSRIs. Claims (\n3\n)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.

No. 60/557,069, entitled “NOVEL SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS” filed on Mar. 26, 2004, having Maria G. Miranda, Kevin G. Pinney, and James N. Dorsey, listed as the inventors, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nThis invention pertains to novel serotonin reuptake inhibitors which comprise a structural homologue of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, known to treat depression, and a piperazine moiety, known to treat sexual dysfunction induced by serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n\n\nDepression is a common, life-disrupting, potentially lethal illness that can affect both sexes and all ages. Untreated major depression remains a serious public health problem ands its incidences are staggering. Its peak onset is in the early adult years. Suicide occurs in as many as 15% of patients with depression, especially those with recurrent episodes and hospitalizations. Therefore it becomes evident that treatment of depression is a matter of prime importance. Depression has no single cause; often, it results from a combination of factors. Whatever its cause, depression is not just a state of mind. It is related to physical changes in the brain, and connected to an imbalance of a type of chemical that carries signals in the brain and nerves. These chemicals are called neurotransmitters. Among the most important neurotransmitters related with depression are serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA). Serotonin plays a very important role in the mood disorders, especially in anxiety and depression, aggression and impulsivity. Regulation of the mood disorders is possible either by agonistic or antagonistic action on a certain type of the serotonin receptors.\n\n\nSerotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (PROZAC®), have traditionally been the mainstay of treatment for clinical depression—replacing the more toxic tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). SSRIs have a more favorable adverse reaction profile in comparison to the TCAs and are much easier to tolerate. SSRIs exert their therapeutic effect by blocking the reuptake of serotonin into the presynaptic nerve terminal, thus increasing the synaptic concentration of serotonin. It is also believed that SSRIs increase the efficacy of the serotonin (5-HT) neurons by desensitizing 5-HT autoreceptors located on the presynaptic 5-HT nerve terminals. The ability of the 5-HT autoreceptors to inhibit the release of 5-HT decreases after long-term treatment with SSRIs, with the net effect being that a greater amount of 5-HT is released per impulse. The release of 5-HT from these Neurons, thus, becomes more efficient.\n\n\nUnfortunately, SSRIs are not innocuous drugs. In spite of the progress in the treatment of depression with the advent of the SSRIs, some troublesome side effects still remain—most notably, sexual dysfunction. As prescribing of SSRIs increased, the side effect of sexual dysfunction emerged, and clinicians searched for methods to treat or reverse SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction. A number of pharmacological agents—notably, drugs in the piperazine class—have been used to reverse SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction.\n\n\nIt is widely believed that a number of monoamine neurotransmitters have a role in the etiology of depression and, consequently, its treatment. The most notable of these neurotransmitters include norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT). It is well known that inhibiting the reuptake of NE or 5-HT (or both) has elicited a favorable response in patients being treated for depression. Without question, however, inhibition of 5-HT reuptake has been the most widely studied, and treatment of depression has focused on inhibiting the reuptake mechanism of the neurotransmitter. Indeed, it was this premise which led to the hypothesis that altering 5-HT function could lead to an effective mechanism in the treatment of depression.\n\n\nResearch in the treatment of depression remains focused on 5-HT because a good number of selective 5-HT reuptake blockers tested in clinical trials have been effective in treating major depression. The general mechanism of action is hypothesized as enhanced 5-HT neurotransmission due to the increased availability of 5-HT in the synapse of these neurons (Blier et al., 1990). SSRIs generally have a 50- to 100-fold or greater selectivity for the inhibition of serotonin uptake in vitro when compared to their ability to inhibit NE or DA uptake (Lemberger et al., 1985).\n\n\nSexual dysfunction is a common problem in affective disorders such as major depression. It is important to note, however, that the drugs used in the treatment of depression can cause sexual dysfunction as well. Antidepressants such as the TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and the SSRIs have all been reported to cause sexual side effects. The inhibitory effects of the SSRIs on sexual function are well documented, and the frequency of occurrence varies widely. By switching to a less serotonergic drug, it is surmised that the non-selective effects of 5-HT can be reduced within the synapse of the 5-HT neuron. Although the connection between serotonergic activity and sexual function is not straightforward, it is believed that the increased central serotonergic activity of SSRIs (at the receptor subtypes 5-HT\n1A\n, 5-HT\n1B\n, 5-HT\n2C\n, 5-HT\n2A \nand 5-HT\n3\n) plays a role in the emergence of sexual dysfunction (Modell et al., 1997). It follows, therefore, that reducing the activity of SSRIs at these receptors could allow the suppression or inhibition of the sexual response to be corrected. Strategies which have been tried in treating or reversing sexual dysfunction include: titration of an antidepressant dose, scheduling of a drug holiday during treatment, and administering a second drug (along with an SSRI, for example) to counteract the SSRI's sexual side effects.\n\n\nThe drugs which have been administered along with an SSRI include a broad range of medicinal agents. Drugs such as: amantadine (normally used in the treatment of Parkinsonism), cyproheptadine, buspirone, trazodone, nefazodone, methylphenidate, mianserin, yohimbine, and even sildenafil citrate have been used. Bupropion has also been of benefit. The success of each of these agents varies widely, but the best studied agents include bupropion and buspirone (Hyttel, 1982). Buspirone, which has a pyrimidinyl-piperazine group, is generally used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and has been used with some success in treating patients with SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction (Gonzalez-Heydrich, 1990) It is interesting to note that other piperazine-containing groups (specifically, functionalized phenylpiperazines) have likewise been used with success in treating sexual dysfunction. These agents include: sildenafil citrate, trazodone, and nefazodone.\n\n\nWhat is needed, therefore, is an SSRI with an adverse reaction profile that is devoid of sexual side effects.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nThe present invention relates to novel serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The reuptake inhibitors comprise bi-functional organic molecules which combine serotonin transporter reuptake inhibition with serotonin (5-HT, such as 5HT\n2A\n) receptor antagonism in one molecular entity. In particular, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors comprise a structural homologue of an antidepressant serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) coupled to the piperidine or piperazine moiety of a compound having 5-HT receptor antagonism. The serotonin reuptake inhibitors may have a free amine group, or they may exist as salts, such as hydrochloride salts.\n\n\nThe SSRI portion of the molecule is most closely similar in structure to that of fluoxetine (Prozac®), shown in \nFIG. 1\n. There are two preferred types of homologues of the SSRI portion, an aminoethane derivative (Type I) and an aminopropane derivative (Type II), as shown in \nFIG. 2\n. The 5-HT receptor antagonist portion of the molecule is most closely similar in structure to the piperazinyl-containing portion of any of the compounds used to treat the side effects or sexual dysfunction caused by SSRIs. Examples are shown in \nFIG. 3\n. Thus, the :5-HT receptor antagonist portion of the molecule comprises a piperazine or piperidine moiety coupled to a variety of groups, most of which are aryl groups. \nFIG. 4\n shows a generalized representation of the bi-functional molecules, in which Part a is the SSRI homologue having the ability to inhibit the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) and Part b is the piperazine or piperidine moiety which demonstrates antagonism to the 5-HT receptors.\n\n\nOne aspect of the present invention is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor having the general formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein X is F or CF\n3\n; and salts thereof.

The specific uptake of [\n3\nH]5-HT by human platelets was typically >90% specific as defined by 10 μM fluoxetine.\n\n\nOutdated human platelets were obtained from the blood bank at Pitt County Memorial Hospital, Greenville, N.C. Platelets from 5-10 donors were pooled, 10% dimethylsulfoxide was added, and aliquots were stored frozen at −80° C. until use. For assays, 5 ml of platelets were thawed and suspended in 20 mL ice-cold Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) buffer as previously described (Cozzi and Foley, 2002). The KRH buffer contained the following ingredients: 124.0 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgSO\n4\n, 1.2 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 2.4 mM CaCl\n2\n, 5.2 mM d-glucose, 25.0 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM sodium ascorbate, 0.1 mM pargyline. The buffer was adjusted to pH 7.4 with 5 M NaOH. The ability of platelets to accumulate [\n3\nH] serotonin was measured in the absence and presence of test drugs as follows: a 490 μaliquot of the platelet suspension was added to glass tubes containing 5 μl test drug (various concentrations, dissolved in DMSO), 5 μl DMSO (for total determinations), or 5 μl fluoxetine hydrochloride dissolved in DMSO (for nonspecific determinations; final concentration, 10 μM). The assay tubes were preincubated in a 37° C. shaking water bath for 5 min. The tubes were then returned to the ice bath and chilled for 10 min. [\n3\nH] Serotonin was added 5 μl of stock solution; final concentration, 10 nM), giving a total incubation volume of 500 μl. All tubes were returned to the 37° C. shaking water bath for 5 min to initiate neurotransmitter uptake. Uptake was terminated by chilling the test tubes in the ice bath. After adding 3 ml ice-cold KRH, each assay tube was immediately vacuum filtered through glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/B) pretreated with 0.1% polyethyleneimine. Filters were washed with 2×3 ml ice-cold KRH, allowed to dry briefly under vacuum, then placed in liquid scintillation vials. Scintillation cocktail (8 ml) was added and the vials were sealed, vortexed, and allowed to stand overnight. Radioactivity was measured using liquid scintillation spectroscopy (Packard Tri-Carb 1600 CA). Specific uptake was defined as uptake at 37° C. minus uptake in the presence of 10 μM fluoxetine. Under these conditions, specific [\n3\nH] serotonin uptake was typically 90% of total uptake. The IC\n50 \nvalue for each test drug was determined from displacement curves using at least 6 drug concentrations, each run in triplicate. Data were transformed from dpm to % specific uptake and fitted to a four-parameter logistic curve using commercial computer software, from which the IC\n50 \nvalues are obtained. The IC50 values are shown in Table 1 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50 \n(μM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCMPD %#\n\n\nSERT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10b\n\n\n1.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11b\n\n\n3.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12b\n\n\n9.56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDose-response curves for inhibition of [\n3\nH]5-HT uptake by Compounds 10b, 11b, and 12b are presented in \nFIGS. 9-11\n. The inhibition curves all had slope coefficients that did not differ from unity, indicating that the compounds all interacted with a single site on the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT). Compounds 10b and 11b were the most potent inhibitors of [\n3\nH]5-HT accumulation, with IC\n50 \nvalues of 1.45±0.08 μM and 3.27±0.23 μM, respectively. These values did not differ from each other at the P<0.05 level of significance (one-way ANOVA followed by a Student-Newman-Keuls t-test). Compound 12b was the least potent compound in the series with an IC\n50 \nvalue of 9.56±2.4 μM; this was only one-sixth the potency of compound 10b and three-fold less potent than compound 1b1 (P<0.05). It is apparent that the new compounds are significantly less potent than fluoxetine, which exhibits nanomolar (nM) affinity for the SERT, but it is not possible at this stage to decide whether the decreased potency is due to electrostatic, stereochemical, or steric considerations or some combination of these. For example, the phenylpiperazine moiety of the new compounds adds considerable bulk to the side-chain amine of fluoxetine and also changes its electronic character with the addition of new lone pair electrons and an electron-rich aromatic ring. Without wanting to be bound by theory, it is possible that the electron-withdrawing, hydrophobic trifluoromethyl group present on the phenyl ring of 12b is responsible for the attenuated serotonin uptake inhibition activity of this compound when compared to compounds 10b and 11b, but the methoxy substitution on compound 11b also represents a positional isomer and this may influence binding through a steric mechanism.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\nBiological Evaluation\n\n\nBiological Evaluation of selected compounds was done through the National Institutes of Health Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (NIH-PDSP). Biological evaluation of the synthesized molecules consisted of: (a) Neurotransmitter uptake assays for the human serotonin transporter (SERT), (b) Binding assays for the serotonin receptor 5-HT\n1A\n, (c) Binding assays for the serotonin receptor 5-HT\n2A\n, and (d) Comparison of the biological data obtained for the synthesized molecules with that of currently used psychotherapeutics.\n\n\nAll binding assays were carried out with an incubation time of 60 minutes at room temperature. All binding assays were performed in a similar manner, although the buffers used differ from assay to assay.\n\n\na.

Compounds 10b, 11b and 12b were previously evaluated for their serotonin uptake ability as described in Example 5. For screening purposes, \ncompounds\n 1b through 7b were analyzed for their affinity towards the serotonin 5-HT\n1A \nreceptor as well as their affinity towards the 5-HT\n2A \nreceptor and the SERT. Data in Table 2 represent mean % inhibition (N=4 determinations) for compound tested at receptor subtypes. Significant inhibition is considered >50%. In cases where negative inhibition (−) is seen, this represents a stimulation of binding. Occasionally, compounds at high concentrations will non-specifically increase binding. Ki values were determined only for compounds with % inhibition >50%. As can be seen in Table 3, all the compounds show low to moderate affinity for \n5\n-HT\n1A\n. Compound 6b shows the highest affinity for 5-HT\n1A\n. \n \nCompounds\n \n 1b and 2b exhibit the desired dual activity towards the 5-HT\n2A \nreceptor and the SERT, although low. None of the compounds has exhibited significant affinity for SERT; however, compounds 1b and 2b show low affinity which is still higher than that showed by compounds 10b through 12b (see Table 1 in Example 5).\n\n\nREFERENCES CITED\n\n\nThe entire content of each of the references given below is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n \n \nBlier, P.; de Montigny, C.; Chaput, Y. \nJ.
