Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to diarylhydantoin compounds including diarylthiohydantoins, and methods for synthesizing them and using them in the treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer. This application claims priority from \n \nU.S. provisional applications bearing \nserial numbers\n 60/756,552\n \n, \n \n60/750,351\n \n, and \n \n60/680,835\n \n, the specifications of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nProstate cancer is the most common incidence of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in Western men. When the cancer is confined locally, the disease can be cured by surgery or radiation. However, 30% of such cancer relapses with distant metastatic disease and others have advanced disease at diagnoses. Advanced disease is treated by castration and/or administration of antiandrogens, the so-called androgen deprivation therapy. Castration lowers the circulating levels of androgens and reduces the activity of androgen receptor (AR). Administration of antiandrogens blocks AR function by competing away androgen binding, therefore, reducing the AR activity. Although initially effective, these treatments quickly fail and the cancer becomes hormone refractory.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, overexpression of AR has been identified and validated as a cause of hormone refractory prostate cancer. See \nChen, C.D., Welsbie, D.S., Tran, C., Baelc, S.H., Chen, R., Vessella, R., Rosenfeld, M.G., and Sawyers, C.L., Molecular determinants of resistance to antiandrogen therapy, Nat. Med., 10: 33-39, 2004\n, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Overexpression of AR is sufficient to cause progression from hormone sensitive to hormone refractory prostate cancer, suggesting that better AR inhibitors than the current drugs can slow the progression of prostate cancer. It was demonstrated that AR and its ligand binding are necessary for growth of hormone refractory prostate cancer, indicating that AR is still a target for this disease. It was also demonstrated that overexpression of AR converts anti-androgens from antagonists to agonists in hormone refractory prostate cancer (an AR antagonist inhibits AR activity and an AR agonist stimulates AR activity). Data from this work explains why castration and anti-androgens fail to prevent prostate cancer progression and reveals unrecognized properties of hormone refractory prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBicalutamide (brand name: Casodex) is the most commonly used anti-androgen. While it has an inhibitory effect on AR in hormone sensitive prostate cancer, it fails to suppress AR when cancer becomes hormone refractory. Two weaknesses of current antiandrogens are blamed for the failure to prevent prostate cancer progression from the hormone sensitive stage to the hormone refractory disease and to effectively treat hormone refractory prostate cancer. One is their weak antagonistic activities and the other is their strong agonistic activities when AR is overexpressed in hormone refractory prostate cancer. Therefore, better AR inhibitors with more potent antagonistic activities and minimal agonistic activities are needed to delay disease progression and to treat the fatal hormone refractory prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNonsteroidal anti-androgens, such as bicalutamide, have been preferred over steroidal compounds for prostate cancer because they are more selective and have fewer side effects. This class of compounds has been described in many patents such as \n \nU.S. Patent Number 4,097,578\n \n, \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,411,981\n \n, \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,705,654\n \n, \n \nPCT International Applications WO 97/00071\n \n and \n \n \nWO\n 00/17163\n \n, and \n \nU.S. Published Patent Application Number 2004/0009969\n \n, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,434,176\n \n includes broad claims which encompass a very large number of compounds, but synthetic routes are only presented for a small fraction of these compounds and pharmacological data are only presented for two of them, and one skilled in the art could not readily envision other specific compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause the mechanism of hormone refractory prostate cancer was not known, there was no biological system to test these compounds described in these patents for their effect on hormone refractory prostate cancer. Particularly, the ability of AR overexpression in hormone refractory prostate cancer to switch inhibitors from antagonists to agonists was not recognized. Some new properties of hormone refractory prostate cancer are reported in \n \nPCT applications US04/42221\n \n and \n \nUS05/05529\n \n, which are hereby incorporated by reference. \n \nPCT International Application US05/05529\n \n presented a methodology for identifying androgen receptor antagonist and agonist characteristics of compounds. However, for each compound produced, the time consuming process of determining the antagonist and agonist characteristics of a compound must be determined. That is, there is no method to accurately predict characteristics relevant to treating prostate cancer from the chemical structure of a compound alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is a need for new thiohydantoin compounds having desirable pharmacological properties, and synthetic pathways for preparing them. Because activities are sensitive to small structural changes, one compound may be effective in treating prostate cancer, whereas a second compound may be ineffective, even if it differs from the first compound only slightly, say by the replacement of a single substituent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdentification of compounds which have high potency to antagonize the androgen activity, and which have minimal agonistic activity should overcome hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) and avoid or slow down the progression of hormone sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC). Therefore, there is a need in the art for the identification of selective modulators of the androgen receptor, such as modulators which are non-steroidal, non-toxic, and tissue selective.\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides a series of compounds having strong antagonistic activities with minimal agonistic activities against AR.

In describing embodiments, specific terminology is employed for the sake of clarity. However, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other equivalent parts can be employed and other methods developed without parting from the spirit and scope of the invention. All references cited herein are incorporated by reference as if each had been individually incorporated.\n\n\n \n\n\nSynthesis of Diarylhydantoin Compounds\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides for synthesis of diarylthiohydantoin compound having the formula\n\n \n \n\nwith R71 including an alkyl chain of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. For example, R72 can be carbamoyl, e.g., -(CO)NH\n2\n, or methylcarbamoyl, e.g., -(CO)NHCH\n3\n. An amide group bonded at the carbon atom of the carbonyl to another structure is termed a carbamoyl substituent. For example, R73 can be a fluorine or a hydrogen atom. That is, a fluorine atom can be attached to any one of the carbons of the right-hand aryl ring which are not bonded to the R72 substituent or the nitrogen atom. Alternatively, no fluorine atom can be attached to the carbons of the right-hand aryl ring which are not bonded to the R72 substituent or the nitrogen atom. For example, a hydrogen atom can be attached to each of the carbons of the right-hand aryl ring which are not bonded to the R72 substituent or the nitrogen atom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, as further presented below (see, for example, \nFigs. 3\n, \n5\n, \n11-13\n), the compound having the formula\n\n \n \n\nexhibited surprisingly potent antagonistic activities with minimal agonistic activities for overexpressed AR in hormone refractory prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA list of several compounds according to this invention is presented in Tables 5 - 11.

A number of compounds exhibited potent antagonistic activities with minimal agonistic activities for over expressed AR in hormone refractory prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn vitro biological assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of compounds on AR by a reporter assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds were subjected to tests using an artificial AR response reporter system in a hormone refractory prostate cancer cell line. In this system, the prostate cancer LNCaP cells were engineered to stably express about 5-fold higher level of AR than endogenous level. The exogenous AR has similar properties to endogenous AR in that both are stabilized by a synthetic androgen R1881. The AR-over expressed cells were also engineered to stably incorporate an AR response reporter and the reporter activity of these cells shows features of hormone refractory prostate cancer. It responds to low concentration of a synthetic androgen R1881, is inhibited only by high concentrations of bicalutamide, (see Table 1), and displays agonistic activity with bicalutamide (\nFigure 1\n and Table 2). Consistent with published data, bicalutamide inhibited AR response reporter and did not have agonistic activity in hormone sensitive prostate cancer cells (\nFigure 2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe examined the antagonistic activity of the compounds for which the synthesis is described above in the presence of 100 pM of R1881. Engineered LNCaP cells (LNCaP-AR, also abbreviated LN-AR) were maintained in Iscove's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Two days prior to drug treatment, the cells were grown in Iscove's medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped FBS (CS-FBS) to deprive of androgens. The cells were split and grown in Iscove's medium containing 10% CS-FBS with 100 pM of R1881 and increasing concentrations of test compounds. After two days of incubation, reporter activities were assayed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 1 lists the IC50 of these compounds to inhibit AR in hormone refractory prostate cancer. The control substance bicalutamide has an IC50 of 889 nM. Most of the compounds identified (diarylthiohydantoins) have IC50s between 100 to 200 nM in inhibiting AR in hormone refractory prostate cancer. In contrast, antiandrogenic compounds listed as examples in \n \nUS patent no. 5,705,654\n \n, such as examples 30-2, 30-3, 31-2, 31-3, and 24-3 (RD73-RD77) have no inhibitory activities on AR. in

These cells also carry a GR response reporter and the reporter activity was induced by dexamethasone, a GR agonist and the induction was blocked by RU486, a GR inhibitor. Example 7-3b (RD37) (4-(8-oxo-6-thioxo-5-(4-methylphenyl)-5,7-diazaspiro[3.4]oct-7-yl)-2-trifluoromethyl benzonitrile) had no effect on GR in this system.\n\n\n \n\n\nEffect of compounds on AR by measuring secreted levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is well established that PSA levels are indicators of AR activities in prostate cancer. To examine if the compounds affect AR function in a physiological environment, we determined secreted levels of endogenous PSA induced by R1881 in the AR-overexpressed LNCaP cells (LNCaP-AR, also abbreviated LN-AR). The LNCaP-AR cells are a line of lymph node carcinoma of prostate cells transduced with a plasmid that makes express androgen receptors. LNCaP-AR cells were maintained in Iscove's medium containing 10% FBS. Two days prior to drug treatment, the cells were grown in Iscove's medium containing 10% CS-FBS to deprive of androgens. The cells were split and grown in Iscove's medium containing 10% CS-FBS with appropriate concentrations of R1881 and the test compounds. After four days incubation, secreted PSA levels were assayed using PSA ELISA kits (American Qualex, San Clemente, CA)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe secreted PSA level of LNCaP-AR cells was strongly induced by 25 pM of R1881. In contrast, PSA was not induced in the parental LNCaP cells until concentration of R1881 reached 100 pM. This is consistent with our previous report that the AR in hormone refractory prostate cancer is hypersensitive to androgens. A dose-dependent inhibition on AR activity was carried out to determine the IC50s of different compounds in inhibiting PSA expression, and the results were listed in Table 1. IC50s of the selective compounds on PSA expression closely resemble those measured by the reporter assay, confirming that the diarylhydantoin derivatives are strong inhibitors of AR in hormone refractory prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also examined agonistic activities of selective compounds on AR in hormone refractory prostate cancer using secreted PSA as the surrogate marker. To do this, androgen-starved AR over expressed LNCaP cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of the compounds for which a synthesis is described above in the absence of R1881 and secreted PSA in the culture medium was measured 4 days later.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 3 lists the agonistic activities of the selective compounds. Consistent with the results obtained from the reporter assay, the diarylthiohydantoin derivatives such as examples 7-3b (RD37), 33 (RD91), 34 (RD92), and 35 (RD93) have no agonistic activities.

The compounds were examined for their effect on growth of hormone refractory prostate cancer cells. Overexpressed LNCaP cells were used because these cells behave as hormone refractory prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo \n(1)\n. We measured mitochondria activity by MTS assay, a surrogate for growth. LNCaP cells with overexpressed AR (LN-AR) were maintained in Iscove's medium containing 10% FBS. Two days prior to drug treatment, the cells were grown in Iscove's medium containing 10% CS-FBS to deprive of androgens. The cells were then split and grown in Iscove's medium containing 10% CS-FBS with appropriate concentrations of R1881 and increasing concentrations of the test compounds. After four days incubation, cell growth was monitored by MTS (Promega, Madison, WI).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsistent with the reporter assay and PSA assay, growth of the AR-overexpressed LNCaP was stimulated by 25 microM of R1881, but the parental cells were not stimulated until R1881 concentration reached 100 microM. \nFigure 2\n shows the inhibitory effect of selected compounds on growth of hormone refractory prostate cancer in the presence of 100 pM of R1881. The current clinical drug bicalutamide did not inhibit hormone refractory prostate cancer. In contrast, example 5-3b (RD7) (4-[3-(4-methylphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-5-oxo-2-thioxoimidazolidin-1-yl]-2-trifluoromethyl-benzonitrile) and example 7-3b (RD37) (4-(8-oxo-6-thioxo-5-(4-methylphenyl)-5,7-diazaspiro[3.4]oct-7-yl)-2-trifluoromethylbenzonitrile) inhibited hormone refractory prostate cancer with high potency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe examined if growth inhibition in the MTS assay occurs by targeting AR, example 5-3b (RD7) (4-[3-(4-methylphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-5-oxo-2-thioxoimidazolidin-1-yl]-2-trifluoromethylbenzonitrile) and example 7-3b (RD37) (4-(8-oxo-6-thioxo-5-(4-methylphenyl)-5,7-diazaspiro[3.4]oct-7-yl)-2-trifluoromethylbenzonitrile) were tested in DU-145 cells, a prostate cancer cell line that lacks AR expression. These compounds had no growth inhibitory effect on DU-145 cells. The compounds did not inhibit cells other than AR-expressed prostate cancer cells, as they had no growth effect on MCF7 and SkBr3, two commonly used breast cancer cells, or 3T3, a normal mouse fibroblast cell line.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of in vitro biological activity of diarylthiohydantoin derivatives are shown in the \nFigures 3\n, \n4\n and \n5\n. For example, based on relative luciferase activity, \nFig. 3\n indicates that at a concentration of 500 nM the compounds ranked, in order of most active to least active as follows: RD152 > RD153 > RD145 > RD163 > RD161 = RD162 > bicalutamide. For example, based on relative PSA level, \nFig 4\n indicates that at a concentration of 500 nM the compounds ranked, in order of most active to least active as follows: RD138 > RD131 > RD37 > RD133 > RD134 > RD137 > RD138 > RD135 > bicalutamide. For example, based on relative MTS units, \nFig. 5\n indicates that at a concentration of 500 nM the compounds ranked, in order of most active to least active as follows: RD168 > RD37 > RD141 > RD162 > bicalutamide.\n\n\n \n\n\nInhibitory effect on hormone refractory prostate cancer xenograft tumors.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nExample 7-3b (RD37) (4-(8-oxo-6-thioxo-5-(4-methylphenyl)-5,7-diazaspiro[3.4]oct-7-yl)-2-trifluoromethylbenzonitrile) was used to examine if the diarylhydantoin derivatives have in vivo effects on hormone refractory prostate cancer. First we examined this compound on xenograft tumors established from AR-overexpressed LNCaP cells. The engineered cells in Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of the castrated male SCID mice. Tumor size was measured weekly in three dimensions using calipers. After xenograft tumors established (tumor size reached at least 40 mm\n3)\n, mice with tumors were randomized and treated with different doses of compounds orally once daily. Consistent with clinical observation, current clinical drug bicalutamide did not inhibit growth of hormone refractory prostate cancer (same as vehicle) (\nFigure 7a\n). In contrast, example 7-3b (RD37) (4-(8-oxo-6-thioxo-5-(4-methylphenyl)-5,7-diazaspiro[3.4]oct-7-yl)-2-trifluoromethylbenzonitrile) strongly inhibited growth of these tumors (\nFigure 7a\n) and the inhibition is dose-dependent (\nFigure 7b\n). Furthermore, example 7-3b (RD37) inhibited PSA expression (\nFigure 8\n), the clinical marker for hormone refractory prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExample 7-3b (RD37) (4-(8-oxo-6-thioxo-5-(4-methylphenyl)-5,7-diazaspiro[3.4]oct-7-yl)-2-trifluoromethylbenzonitrile) was also tested in another xenograft model of hormone refractory prostate cancer, hormone refractory LAPC4. This model was established from passaging of hormone sensitive prostate cancer in castrated mice, which mimics the clinical progression of prostate cancer (2). Similar to the finding using AR-overexpressed LNCaP xenograft model, current clinical drug bicalutamide did not inhibit growth and PSA expression in hormone refractory LAPC4 xenograft model (same as vehicle) (\nFigure 9a and 9b\n). In contrast, example 7-3b (RD37) strongly inhibited growth and PSA expression of these tumors (\nFigure 9a and 9b\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nInhibitory effect on growth of hormone sensitive prostate cancer cells.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine if the diarylthiahydantoin derivatives also inhibit hormone sensitive prostate cancer cells, we tested some selective compounds on growth of LNCaP cells by measuring MTS of mitochondria activities. In contrast to have no effect on growth of hormone refractory prostate cancer, the current clinical drug bicalutamide mildly inhibited hormone sensitive LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner. Example 5-3b (RD7) (4-[3-(4-methylphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-5-oxo-2-thioxoimidazolidin-1-yl]-2-trifluoromethyl-benzonitrile) and example 7-3b (RD37) (4-(8-oxo-6-thioxo-5-(4-methylphenyl)-5,7-diazaspiro[3.4]oct-7-yl)-2-trifluoromethylbenzonitrile) inhibited hormone sensitive prostate cancer with a 10-fold higher potency than bicalutamide (\nFigure 10\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nIn vivo biological assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAll animal experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines of the Animal Research Committee of the University of California at Los Angeles. Animals were bought from Taconic and maintained in a laminar flow tower in a defined flora colony. LNCaP-AR and LNCaP-vector cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS. 10\n6\n cells in 100 µl of 1:1 Matrigel to RPMI medium were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of intact or castrated male SCID mice. Tumor size was measured weekly in three dimensions (length x width x depth) using calipers. Mice were randomized to treatment groups when tumor size reached approximately 100 mm\n3\n. Drugs were given orally every day at 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg. To obtain pharmacodynamic readout, the animals were imaged via an optical CCD camera, 3 hours after last dose of the treatment. A ROI is drawn over the tumor for luciferase activity measurement in photon/second. The right panels were a representation of the ROIs measurements. Data are shown in \nfigures 11\n and \n12\n. Over 18 days RD162 was effective to prevent tumor growth and even to cause tumor shrinkage, and was distinctly more effective than bicalutamide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of bicalutamide, 4-[7-(4-cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-8-oxo-6-thioxo-5,7-diaza-spiro[3.4]oct-5-yl]-toluene [RD37], \nN\n-methyl-4-{4-[7-(4-cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-8-oxo-6-thioxo-5,7-diaza-spiro[3.4]oct-5-yl]phenyl}butanamide [RD131], and \nN-\nmethyl-4-[7-(4-cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-8-oxo-6-thioxo-5,7-diaza-spiro[3.4]oct-5-yl]-2-fluorobenzamide (52d) [RD162] were evaluated in vivo using 8 week-old FVB mice which were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Mice were divided into groups of three for each time points. Two mice were not treated with drug and two other mice were treated with vehicle solution. Each group was treated with 10 mg per kilogram of body weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe drug was dissolved in a mixture 1:5:14 of DMSO : PEG400 : H\n2\nO. (Vehicle solution) and was administered into mice through the tail vein. The animals are warmed under a heat lamp for approximately 20 minutes prior to treatment to dilate their tail vein. Each mouse was placed into a mouse restrainer (Fisher Sci. Cat# 01-288-32A) and was injected with 200 µl of drug in vehicle solution into the dilated tail vein. After drug administration, the animals were euthanized via CO\n2\n inhalation at different timepoints: 5 mn, 30 mn, 2 h, 6 h, 16 h. Animals were immediately bleed after exposure to CO\n2\n via cardiac puncture (1 ml BD syringe + \n27G\n 5/8 needle). For oral dosage, the drug was dissolved in a mixture 50:10:1:989 of DMSO : Carboxymethylcellulose : Tween80:H20 before oral administration via a feeding syringe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe serum samples were analyzed to determine the drug's concentration by the HPLC which (\nWaters\n 600 pump, \nWaters\n 600 controller and Waters 2487 detector) was equipped with an Alltima C18 column (3µ, 150 mm×4.6 mm). The RD37, RD131, and RD162 compounds were detected at 254 nm wave length and bicalutamide was detected at 270 nm wave length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe samples for HPLC analysis were prepared according to the following procedure:\n\n \n \n \nBlood cells were separated from serum by centrifugation.\n \nTo 400 µl of serum were added 80 µl of a 10 µM solution of an internal standard and 520 µl of acetonitrile. Precipitation occurred.\n \nThe mixture was vortexed for 3 minutes and then placed under ultrasound for 30 minutes.\n \nThe solid particles were filtered off or were separated by centrifugation.\n \nThe filtrate was dried under an argon flow to dryness. The sample was reconstructed to 80 µl with acetonitrile before analyzing by HPLC to determine the drug concentration.\n \nStandard curve of drug was used to improve accuracy.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe concentration of RD 162 in plasma as a function of time resulting from intravenous and from oral administration is shown in \nfigure 13\n. The steady state concentration (Css) of bicalutamide, RD131, and RD162 is shown in Table 4. The concentration at steady state of RD162 is essentially as good as that of bicalutamide, and substantially better than RD 131.\n\n \nTable 4.

Table 11 presents diarylhydantoin compounds which have not been placed into a tier. The placement of compounds into tiers was based on available data coupled with analytical judgment. Data considered included in vitro assays (AR response reporter system in LNCaP cell line, PSA level measurement, MTS mitochondrial assay) and in vivo experiments (tumor size measured directly or by emission induced by luciferase reporter gene, pharmacokinetic assays based on blood plasma levels). Not every compound was subjected to each assay. Not all data that was generated is shown. Judgment was applied in ranking compounds relative to each other for their utility in treating prostate cancer, in particular when ranking two compounds for which the same experiments were not performed. Characteristics considered in establishing the ranking include AR antagonism activity, lack of AR agonism in hormone refractory cells, prevention of tumor growth, tumor shrinkage, and pharmacokinetic behavior, with a longer residence time in blood being advantageous.\n\n\n \n\n\n \nTier\n 1\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGenerally, \nTier\n 1 compounds are diarylthiohydantoins with a disubstituted left hand aryl ring that are disubstituted on the right hydantoin carbon, and have either an oxygen or N substituent on the left hydantoin carbon. It is expected that the amido substituent hydrolyzes to an oxygen in aqueous solutions such as encountered in biological systems, in vitro and in vivo. RD100 has good activity with an iodine instead of a CF\n3\n substituent on the left hand aryl ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTier\n 1 compounds (see Table 5) were judged to be much better than bicalutamide for treating prostate cancer. However, RD37 and RD131 were found to metabolize fast, that is, have a short residence time in blood. RD162 had desirable pharmacokinetics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 17\n shows that under treatment with bicalutamide, PSA levels for LNCaP cells stayed the same or increased relative to treatment with vehicle solution, whereas under treatment with RD162, PSA levels decreased. \nFigure 18\n illustrates that under treatment with vehicle solution, tumors continued to increase in size. By contrast, under treatment with RD162 at a dose of 1 mg per kg body weight per day, the rate of tumor increase decreased, and the size of the tumor appeared to be stabilizing after about 17 days. Under treatment with RD162 at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight per day, tumor size decreased with time. \nFigure 19\n illustrates that under treatment with RD162 at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight per day, photon emission associated with luciferase activity decreased. \nFigure 20\n shows that treatment with RD162 at this dose resulted in a decrease or stabilization of tumor size and a decrease in photon emission associated with luciferase activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 21\n shows that under treatment with RD162, RD162′, RD162\", RD169, and RD170 at doses of 100, 200, 500, and 1000 nM, PSA levels of LN-AR cells decreased. Moreover, the higher the dose, the lower the PSA level. \nFigure 23\n presents urogenital tract weight and rate of photon emission associated with luciferase activity initially and after 14 days of treatment with bicalutamide or with RD162 for intact and castrated mice. The weight and rate of photon emission increased for both intact and castrated mice. Treatment of castrated mice with RD162 resulted in a decrease in weight and photon emission with respect to the untreated castrated mice, as did treatment with bicalutamide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, \nTier\n 1 compounds are particularly advantageous for use as AR antagonists, and as therapeutic agents for hormone refractory prostate cancer. They may be useful to treat other AR related diseases or conditions such as benign prostate hyperplasia, hair loss, and acne. These and related compounds may also be useful as modulators of other nuclear receptors, such as glucocorticoid receptor, estrogen receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and as therapeutic agents for diseases in which nuclear receptors play a role, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, cardiac diseases, and metabolism related diseases. They may be useful in assays e.g. as standards, or as intermediates or prodrugs.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nTier\n 2\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTier\n 2 compounds (see Table 6) were significantly better than bicalutamide for treating prostate cancer, although there were indications that RD54 could act as an agonist. \nFigure 3\n illustrates that compounds RD145, RD152, RD153, RD162, and RD163 in \nTier\n 1 and RD161 in \nTier\n 2 dosed at concentrations ranging from 125 nM to 1000 nM acted to reduce luciferase activity in LNCaP-AR cells whereas control solutions of DMSO and of bicalutamide had little or no effect. \nFigure 4\n illustrates, for example, that at concentrations of 1000 nM, compounds RD37 and RD131, in \nTier\n 1, caused a greater decrease in PSA level of LNCaP-AR cells than RD133, RD134, and RD138 in \nTier\n 2. \nFigure 11\n presents tumor volume over time, and illustrates that under treatment with bicalutamide or vehicle solution, tumors continued to grow, whereas under treatment with RD162, in \nTier\n 1, tumors decreased in size. \nFigure 12\n illustrates that photon emission associated with luciferase activity remained about the same or increased under treatment with bicalutamide relative to treatment with vehicle solution, whereas photon emission decreased under treatment with RD162. \nFigure 14\n illustrates that under treatment with bicalutamide, there was little or no decrease in PSA levels, whereas under treatment with RD131 and RD162, PSA levels decreased. \nFigure 15\n illustrates that the IC\n50\n for RD37, RD 131, and RD162, in \nTier\n 1, was much lower than the IC\n50\n for bicalutamide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, \nTier\n 2 compounds are structurally similar to \nTier\n 1 compounds, but with different substituents on the right hand aryl ring. \nTier\n 2 compounds are advantageous for use as AR antagonists, and as therapeutic agents for hormone refractory prostate cancer. They may be useful to treat other AR related diseases or conditions such as benign prostate hyperplasia, hair loss, and acne. These and related compounds may also be useful as modulators of other nuclear receptors, such as estrogen receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and as therapeutic agents for diseases in which nuclear receptors play a role, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, cardiac diseases, and metabolism related diseases. They may be useful in assays e.g. as standards, or as intermediates or prodrugs.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nTier\n 3\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTier\n 3 compounds (see Table 7) were judged to be slightly better than bicalutamide for treating prostate cancer. RD133, RD134, and RD138 (in Tier 2) caused a greater decrease in PSA level of LNCaP-AR cells than RD135 and RD137, in \nTier\n 3. All of these compounds caused a greater decrease in PSA level than bicalutamide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nOther Tier\n 3 compounds (not shown) were not diarylthiohydantoins, and were comparable in activity to prior art monoarylhydantoin compounds RD2, RD4, and RD5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, \nTier\n 3 compounds are useful as AR antagonists, and as therapeutic agents for hormone refractory prostate cancer. They may be useful to treat other AR related diseases or conditions such as benign prostate hyperplasia, hair loss, and acne. These and related compounds may also be useful as modulators of other nuclear receptors, such as estrogen receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and as therapeutic agents for diseases in which nuclear receptors play a role, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, cardiac diseases, and metabolism related diseases. They may be useful in assays e.g. as standards, or as intermediates or prodrugs.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nTier\n 4\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTier\n 4 compounds (see Table 8) were judged to be no better than bicalutamide for treating prostate cancer. \nTier\n 4 RD 39 and RD40 and \nTier\n 1 RD37, for example, differ only in the substituent on the lower right carbon of the hydantoin ring. The substituents on the right hand aryl ring may also affect activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome \nTier\n 4 compounds (including those shown and others that are not shown) were not diaryl compounds (lacking the right hand aryl ring), were not thiohydantoins, were not disubstituted on the carbon on the lower right hand of the hydantoin ring, and/or had substituents other than oxygen or amido on the lower left hand carbon of the hydantoin ring. This provides evidence of the surprising advantages of diarylthiohydantoins that are disubstituted on the lower right hand carbon of the hydantoin ring and have oxygen or amido on the lower left hand carbon of the hydantoin ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, \nTier\n 4 compounds may be useful as AR antagonists, and as therapeutic agents for hormone refractory prostate cancer, at least to the extent that they are comparable to bicalutamide. They may be useful to treat other AR related diseases or conditions such as benign prostate hyperplasia, hair loss, and acne. These and related compounds may also be useful as modulators of other nuclear receptors, such as estrogen receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and as therapeutic agents for diseases in which nuclear receptors play a role, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, cardiac diseases, and metabolism related diseases. They may be useful in assays e.g. as standards, or as intermediates or prodrugs.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nTier\n 5\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTier\n 5 compounds (see Table 9) were inactive or nearly inactive, and thus, were worse than bicalutamide for treating prostate cancer. The substituents on the right hand aryl ring are important to determining activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome \nTier\n 5 compounds (some of which are shown and some that are not shown) were not diaryl compounds (lacking the right hand aryl ring), were not thiohydantoins, were not disubstituted on the carbon on the lower right hand of the hydantoin ring, and/or had substituents other than oxygen or amido on the lower left hand carbon of the hydantoin ring. This provides evidence of the surprising advantages of diarylthiohydantoins that are disubstituted on the lower right hand carbon of the hydantoin ring and have oxygen or amido on the lower left hand carbon of the hydantoin ring. In particular, the terminal substituent in RD155, RD 156, and 158 (CH\n2\nNR\nx\nR\ny\n, where R\nx,y\n = H or methyl) is not seen as contributing to activity in these compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTier\n 5 compounds would not be desirable for treatment of prostate cancer or as AR antagonists, although these and related compounds may be useful as modulators of other nuclear receptors, such as estrogen receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and as therapeutic agents for diseases in which nuclear receptors play a role, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, cardiac diseases, and metabolism related diseases. They may be useful in assays e.g. as standards, or as intermediates or prodrugs.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nTier\n 6\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTier\n 6 compounds (see Table 10) were inactive or nearly inactive, and furthermore were strong agonists, and thus were much worse than bicalutamide for treating prostate cancer. The comparative compounds ranked very poor relative to the inventive compounds. Notably, RD72 had very poor activity, with a chlorine substituent on the left hand aryl ring, whereas RD7, with a trifluoromethane, and RD100, with iodine, ranked in \nTier\n 1. The results for the \nTier\n 6 compounds provide evidence of the surprising advantages of diarylthiohydantoins that are disubstituted on the lower right hand carbon of the hydantoin ring and have oxygen or amido on the lower left hand carbon of the hydantoin ring, and have certain substituents on the left hand aryl ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTier\n 6 compounds would not be desirable for treatment of prostate cancer or as AR antagonists.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nUntiered compounds\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor several compounds, there was insufficient experimental data to rank them. These untiered compounds are presented in Table 11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the data and methods of the invention, and applying judgment based on review of many compounds, including some not shown here, one can make some observations about the untiered compounds. Comparative example RD1 is expected to be in \nTier\n 3 with comparative examples RD3-RD5. RD89 is expected to hydrolyze to RD37 (Tier 1), and should therefore have comparable activity. RD104 is expected to hydrolyze to RD58 (Tier 1), and should therefore have comparable activity. RD105 is expected to hydrolyze to RD8 (Tier 1), and RD 139 and RD140 are expected to hydrolyze to RD138 (Tier 2), and they should therefore have comparable activity.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn short, novel compounds which show evidence of being far superior to bicalutamide in treating prostate cancer were identified and produced.\n\n\n \n\n\nSensitivity of Anti-Cancer Activity of Compounds to Structural Differences\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe inventors have determined that what might appear to be a small change in the structure of hydantoin compounds may result in a large change in that compound's performance in treating prostate cancer. For example, RD161 and RD162 differ only by a single fluorine substituent on an aryl ring, and RD162 is in \nTier\n 1, while RD161 is in \nTier\n 2, both being better than bicalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer, but RD162 being superior. However, RD149, which differs from RD 161 only in having an additional carbon atom between the methylcarbamoyl group and the aryl ring, is no better than bicalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer and is ranked in \nTier\n 4. The effect of RD161, RD162, and RD149 on luciferase activity can be seen in \nFigure 24\n. At a given concentration of compound, the luciferase activity upon exposure to RD161 and RD162 is less than the luciferase activity upon exposure to RD 149.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRD9 differs from RD8 only in that an amino group is substituted for a hydroxyl group. However, whereas RD8 is in \nTier\n 1, much better than bicalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer, RD9 is in \nTier\n 4, no better than bicalutamide. The effect of RD8 and RD9 on luciferase activity in the 1AR cell line can be seen in \nFigure 27\n. For a given dose, the luciferase activity upon exposure to RD8 is less than the luciferase activity upon exposure to RD9. The effect of RD8 and RD9 on luciferase activity in the 4AR cell line can be seen in \nFigure 26\n. For a given dose, the luciferase activity upon exposure to RD8 is less than the luciferase activity upon exposure to RD9. The effect of RD8 and RD9 on PSA levels in the LN/AR cell line can be seen in \nFigure 25\n. For a given dose, the PSA level upon exposure to RD8 is less than the PSA level upon exposure to RD9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRD130 and RD 131 differ from each other only by a methyl substituent on the end of a carbamoyl group and both compounds are ranked in \nTier\n 1, although RD131 has been found to be particularly advantageous. RD129 is the same as RD130, with the exception of a methoxy group being substituted for an amino group. However, RD129 is ranked in \nTier\n 3. RD128 is similar to RD129, but has one less carbon in the chain linking the ester group to the aryl ring; RD128 is ranked in \nTier\n 3. The effect of RD130, RD131, RD128, and RD129 on PSA levels in the LN/AR cell line can be seen in \nFigure 28\n. For a given concentration, the PSA level upon exposure to RD130 and RD131 is less than the PSA level upon exposure to RD128 and RD129.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRD153 and RD155 differ from each other in that the former has a methylcarbamoyl group attached to an aryl ring and a dimethyl substituent attached to the thiohydantoin group, whereas the latter has a methylamino group attached to the right hand aryl ring and a cyclobutyl substituent attached to the thiohydantoin group. Whereas RD153 is in \nTier\n 1, much better than bicalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer, RD155 is in \nTier\n 5, inactive or nearly inactive in the treatment of prostate cancer. The effect of RD153 and RD155 on luciferase activity in the LN/AR cell line can be seen in \nFigure 29\n. For a given concentration, the luciferase activity upon exposure to RD153 is less than the luciferase activity upon exposure to RD155.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRD58 and RD60 differ from each other in the substitution of a thio for an oxo group and a dimethyl substituent for a cyclobutyl substituent. Whereas RD58 is in \nTier\n 1, RD60 is in \nTier\n 4.\n\n\n \n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions and Administration\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are useful as pharmaceutical compositions prepared with a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, as defined herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diarylhydantoin compounds of the invention can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a subject in need of treatment, for example a mammal, such as a human patient, in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, for example, orally, nasally, intraperitoneally, or parenterally, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes, or by injection into tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, diarylhydantoin compounds of the invention may be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier, or by inhalation or insufflation. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the diarylhydantoin compounds may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. The diarylhydantoin compounds may be combined with a fme inert powdered carrier and inhaled by the subject or insufflated. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% diarylhydantoin compounds. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2% to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of diarylhydantoin compounds in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the diarylhydantoin compounds may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices. For example, the diarylhydantoin compounds may be incorporated into time release capsules, time release tablets, and time release pills.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diarylhydantoin compounds may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the diarylhydantoin compounds can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations can contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the diarylhydantoin compounds which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form should be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the diarylhydantoin compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical administration, the diarylhydantoin compounds may be applied in pure form. However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Other solid carriers include nontoxic polymeric nanoparticles or microparticles. Useful liquid carriers include water, alcohols or glycols or water/alcohol/glycol blends, in which the diarylhydantoin compounds can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the diarylhydantoin compounds to the skin are known to the art; for example, see \n \nJacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392\n \n), \n \nGeria (U.S. Pat No. 4,992,478\n \n), \n \nSmith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157\n \n) and\n \n Wortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508\n \n), all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful dosages of the compounds of formula I can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949\n \n, which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the concentration of the diarylhydantoin compounds in a liquid composition, such as a lotion, can be from about 0.1-25% by weight, or from about 0.5-10% by weight. The concentration in a semi-solid or solid composition such as a gel or a powder can be about 0.1-5% by weight, or about 0.5-2.5% by weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the diarylhydantoin compounds required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffective dosages and routes of administration of agents of the invention are conventional. The exact amount (effective dose) of the agent will vary from subject to subject, depending on, for example, the species, age, weight and general or clinical condition of the subject, the severity or mechanism of any disorder being treated, the particular agent or vehicle used, the method and scheduling of administration, and the like. A therapeutically effective dose can be determined empirically, by conventional procedures known to those of skill in the art. See, \ne.g.,\n \nThe Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Goodman and Gilman, eds., Macmillan Publishing Co., New York\n. For example, an effective dose can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays or in suitable animal models. The animal model may also be used to determine the appropriate concentration ranges and routes of administration. Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans. A therapeutic dose can also be selected by analogy to dosages for comparable therapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particular mode of administration and the dosage regimen will be selected by the attending clinician, taking into account the particulars of the case (\ne.g.,\n the subject, the disease, the disease state involved, and whether the treatment is prophylactic). Treatment may involve daily or multi-daily doses of compound(s) over a period of a few days to months, or even years.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, however, a suitable dose will be in the range of from about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg, e.g., from about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, such as above about 0.1 mg per kilogram, or in a range of from about 1 to about 10 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day. For example, a suitable dose may be about 1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg of body weight per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diarylhydantoin compounds are conveniently administered in unit dosage form; for example, containing 0.05 to 10000 mg, 0.5 to 10000 mg, 5 to 1000 mg, or about 100 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diarylhydantoin compounds can be administered to achieve peak plasma concentrations of, for example, from about 0.5 to about 75 µM, about 1 to 50 µM, about 2 to about 30 µM, or about 5 to about 25 µM. Exemplary desirable plasma concentrations include at least or no more than 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100 or 200 µM. For example, plasma levels may be from about 1 to 100 micromolar or from about 10 to about 25 micromolar. This may be achieved, for example, by the intravenous injection of a 0.05 to 5% solution of the diarylhydantoin compounds, optionally in saline, or orally administered as a bolus containing about 1-100 mg of the diarylhydantoin compounds. Desirable blood levels may be maintained by continuous infusion to provide about 0.00005 - 5 mg per kg body weight per hour, for example at least or no more than 0.00005, 0.0005, 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, or 5 mg/kg/hr. Alternatively, such levels can be obtained by intermittent infusions containing about 0.0002 - 20 mg per kg body weight, for example, at least or no more than 0.0002, 0.002, 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, or 50 mg of the diarylhydantoin compounds per kg of body weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diarylhydantoin compounds may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of the above-identified compounds exhibit little or no agonistic activities with respect to hormone refractory prostate cancer cells. Because these compounds are strong AR inhibitors, they can be used not only in treating prostate cancer, but also in treating other AR related diseases or conditions such as benign prostate hyperplasia, hair loss, and acne. Because AR belongs to the family of nuclear receptors, these compounds may serve as scaffolds for drug synthesis targeting other nuclear receptors, such as estrogen receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. Therefore, they may be further developed for other diseases such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, cardiac diseases, and metabolism related diseases, in which nuclear receptors play a role.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe embodiments illustrated and discussed in this specification are intended only to teach those skilled in the art the best way known to the inventors to make and use the invention.
