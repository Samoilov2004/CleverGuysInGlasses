Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is in the field of applied biotechnology and relates in particular to an economic way of introducing antibodies into a variety of products, especially food and animal feed. The invention further relates to such products\n\n\n \n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo fulfil many unmet demands of the society, there is a clear need to provide new products from which consumers may benefit, in particular in the field of food products including animal feed. One of the problems with the presently used consumer products is that if they contain functional compounds, these compounds are not very specific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor instance, for killing microorganisms in food products the functional compound may be salt or acid. When the concentration of either of these compounds is sufficiently high, they are able to kill microorganisms. However, often the level of salt makes the taste of the product less attractive to the consumer. Moreover, high levels of salt are not recommended by health authorities. The same holds for products that contain considerable amounts of acids or preservatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-food consumer products such as laundry products may contain compounds that are able to bleach stains, but as they do not specifically recognise stains, considerable amounts of these bleach generating compounds (e.g. percarbonate/TAED) are necessary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example is that some personal hair care products contain compounds that kill the microorganisms involved in dandruff. Also these compounds are not specific and in addition to the causative microorganisms of dandruff they also kill other microorganisms on the skin which are beneficial to the consumer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill another example of an unmet demand of the society is the overproduction of manure due to cattle farming. Part of this problem is that the conversion of animal feed into nutrients is not optimal due to the presence of negative compounds like fytic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above given examples of unmet consumer needs and society needs can be extended, but it will already be clear that consumer products and animal feed with compounds which specifically meet the demand of the consumer or society will be of great importance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe main characteristic of processes in living cells or living species is that they are highly specific. Enzymes just recognise specific substrates and the specificity of antibodies is unsurpassed. Therefore in recent years the industries involved in the manufacturing of (chemical and biotechnological) consumer products or animal feed are increasingly applying biological molecules in order to make their products more specific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA successful example of this development is the introduction of proteases, lipases, cellulases and amylases in laundry products. These enzymes have a certain specificity and because the production of these enzymes has been improved considerably by recombinant DNA techniques, these microbial enzymes can be produced by microorganisms at costs affordable for consumer products. The introduction of enzymes in detergents has indeed met demands of our society. Over the last decades the energy usage for cleaning of laundry has been reduced with about 50% and the amount of chemicals with about 40%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the area of animal feed enzymes can play an important role to reduce the environmental pollution, as has been nicely demonstrated by the application of the enzyme fytase in animal feed. Again this development was possible due to the enormous improvement of the production of fytase by rDNA techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, often a higher specificity than just recognising a protein or fat is highly desirable to fulfil the unmet demands and therefore the consumer goods and animal feed industry is looking for ways to get specificities in the same order as antibodies have.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn nature microorganisms do not produce antibodies. Although it is well known that by using rDNA technology microorgansims can produce almost any protein, irrespective of its origin, the yield of homologous proteins is much higher than for heterologous proteins. Moreover, expensive purification processes are needed to recover the heterologous protein from its producing cell, since it is not allowed to bring living rDNA organisms into the environment. These two factors, the low production yield and the fact that rDNA organisms have to be separated from the products that they produce have slowed down the introduction of heterologous proteins in consumer products other than in laundry products and some food products. In animal feed only the addition of fytase is a real success up to now.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates in particular to introducing certain categories of antibodies into a variety of products, especially food and animal feed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \n \nWO 94/18330\n \n a method is disclosed for immobilizing a binding protein to the exterior of the cell wall of a microbial host cell, in particular a lower eukaryote, by producing a fusion protein which binds to the anchoring part of a cell wall anchoring protein, thereby ensuring that the binding protein is localized in or at the exterior of the cell wall of the host cell. The binding proteins may ligate or bind to the specific compound to be isolated since they have specific recognition of such compounds or compounds related therewith. Examples of binding proteins mentioned in this reference include antibodies, antibody fragments, combinations of antibody fragments, receptor proteins, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, \n \nWO 94/01567\n \n discloses a method for immobilizing an enzyme to the exterior of the cell wall of a microbial host cell, in particular a lower eukaryote.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nHamers-Casterman et al., Nature (1993) 363:446-448\n disclose isolated immunoglobulins from the serum of camelids comprising two heavy polypeptide chains sufficient for the formation of a complete antigen binding site, which immunoglobulins further being devoid of light polypeptide chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO 94/25591\n \n discloses the production of antibodies or functionalised fragments thereof derived from heavy chain immunoglobulins of \nCamelidae,\n using transformed lower eukaryote host organisms. The term \"functionalized fragment\" was used for indicating an antibody or fragment thereof to which one or more functional groups, including enzymes and other binding polypeptides, are attached resulting in fusion products of such antibody fragment with another biofunctional molecule. The same definition will be used herein for the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nSpinelli et al., Nature structural biology (1996) 3:752-757\n disclose the crystal structure of a llama heavy chain variable domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn many processes involving recombinant DNA techniques and culturing or fermenting transformed microorganisms, it is necessary at some stage, for example at the conclusion of the fermentation, to kill the active cells in order to prevent any viable recombinant organisms from being released into the environment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA conventional way of killing cells is using heat. \n \nU.S. Patent 4,601,986\n \n is an example of the use of heat to kill the cells and stop the growth of microorganism cultures. Other conventional ways of killing cells are by lysing the cells, for example by changing the osmotic pressures or by adding enzymes which break down the cell walls or membranes. These techniques are exemplified in \n \nU.S. Patents 4,299,858\n \n, \n \n3,816,260\n \n, \n \n3,890,198\n \n, and \n \n3,917,510\n \n, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn many systems host microorganisms, for example lower eukaryote cells, are difficult to kill. Conventional methods, such as heat, are too severe and may destroy or alter the desired product before the cells are killed. This applies also for the immobilized systems of binding proteins on lower eukaryotes disclosed in \n \nWO 94/18330\n \n, when the binding protein is an antibody or a functional fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, there is still a need for stable functional systems involving transformed microorganisms, where the microorganisms are inactivated or killed while the functional activity of the system is substantially maintained. The present invention provides such a stable functional system.\n\n\n \n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention there is provided a product, preferably selected from the group consisting of food products, personal care products, and animal feed products, comprising inactivated recombinant lower eukaryotic cells having at least at their outer surface functionally active antibodies, or functionally active fragments of antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment of the invention, the antibodies or, more preferably, antibody fragments are heavy chain antibodies from \nCamelidae\n or the variable domain of these antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lower eukaryotic cells are substantially inactivated by either one or more physical techniques or chemical treatment, or a combination of physical and chemical treatment. The lower eukaryote cells are preferably inactivated with a factor >10\n6\n by physical treatment. Chemical treatment comprises the action of an effective amount of at least one of an antimicrobial agent, for example sorbic acid, benzoic acid, nisin, MB21, or another bacteriocin, and a cell wall degrading enzyme, for example β-(1,3)-glucanase, β-(1,6)-glucanase, chitinase, or a redox enzyme, or a combination of one or more antimicrobial agents and one or more cell wall degrading enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment of the invention, the antibody fragments recognise harmful microorganisms or toxins with a binding constant of >10\n6\n, preferably >10\n7\n, most preferably >10\n8\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment according to the invention there are provided animal feed products containing killed yeast cells having on their surface one or more functional anti-animal pathogenic microorganisms, for example \nE. coli\n, \nSalmonella\n, \nShigella\n, and animal viruses antibodies. In a preferred embodiment there are provided animal feed products containing inactivated yeast cells having functional anti-\nE. coli\n K88 llama antibodies on their surface that protect animals against this pathogenic bacterium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese and other aspects of the invention will be described in further detail in the description which follows.\n\n\n \n\n\nBrief Description of the Drawings\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nFigure 1\n shows a typical dilution curve for the antibodies used, from which the sub-saturation point was determined.\n\n\n \nFigure 2\n shows the antigen binding after temperature treatment of hCG specific mouse MAbs (A) and llama V\nHH\ns (B) or RR-6 specific mouse MAbs (C) and llama V\nHH\ns (D). Antibodies were incubated for 2 hrs at different temperatures, cooled down to room temperature and subsequently ELISA was performed.\n\n\n \nFigure 3\n shows the antigen binding in presence of ammonium thiocyanate at sub saturation point of hCG specific mouse MAbs (A) and llama V\nHH\ns (B) or RR-6 specific mouse MAbs (C) and llama V\nHH\ns (D).\n\n\n \nFigure 4\n shows the antigen binding in the presence of ethanol at sub-saturation point of hCG specific mouse MAbs (A) and llama V\nHH\ns (B) or RR-6 specific mouse MAbs (C) and llama V\nHH\ns (D).\n\n\n \nFigure 5\n represents a restriction map of \nplasmid pUR\n 4588.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Description of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nComplete antibodies, consisting of two heavy and two light chains are rather stable as they have to circulate in the blood and lymph systems to protect the host against invaders. This stability is caused by several S-S bridges between the heavy chains and the strong interaction between the heavy and the light chain. However, production of complete antibodies in microorganisms is very difficult and economically not feasible for introduction into consumer products or animal feed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, it has been shown that antibody fragments of \"traditional\" antibodies can be produced by certain microorganisms (\nsupra\n), but in general the yield of these fragments is rather low. The stability of fragments of traditional antibodies (defined as a single chain of a heavy and a light chain, with a linker between them) is rather low and the physics of protein stability is still not sufficiently developed to predict protein stability from its amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has also been shown that the variable domain of antibodies of \nCamelidae\n which consist of only one heavy chain can be suitably produced by micoorganisms. In particular, they can be produced very well on the cell wall of lower eukaryotes. Cell wall proteins which typically have a GPI anchor, are secreted by lower eukaryotes via a different secretion pathway as compared to normal secreted proteins. Whereas stability of pure proteins cannot be predicted on the basis of their amino acid sequence yet, the effect of linking proteins to the glucan layer on their stability is even more unknown and unpredictable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is based on the surprising finding, after extensive research and experimentation, that the variable domains of \nCamelidae\n heavy chain antibodies are more stable against higher temperatures as compared with the variable domains of traditional antibodies. It is even more surprising that certain variable domains of \nCamelidae\n antibodies from llamas appear to be very stable under pasteurisation conditions. Furthermore, the specific properties of these antibodies or antibody fragments are substantially maintained when they are immobilised on the glucan layer of cell walls which are present in a large variety of lower eukaryotes. Immobilisation of these antibodies, or their variable fragments, on the cell wall of lower eukaryotes does not just ensure a good production yield, but also offers the possibility of separating these lower eukaryotes from the fermentation liquid either by centrifugation or filtration. Both centrifugation and filtration processes are relatively cheap and are applied in the manufacture of compounds for consumer products and animal feed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is further based on the finding that physical techniques and chemical treatment, or a combination of physical techniques and chemical treatment or a combination of special types of mild techniques is able to kill these lower eukaryotes, typically with a factor >10\n6\n, whereas the antibody fragments retain their functionality to a large extent, typically >60%, and preferably from about 70% to 100%. Reduction with a factor of at least 10\n6\n is desired, because this killing efficiency is often acceptable for the health authorities as killing efficiency for pathogenic bacteria in food products. A preferred reduction is with a factor of 10\n-7\n to 10\n-9\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, in one aspect of the present invention there is provided a product, preferably selected from the group consisting of food products and animal feed products, comprising inactivated lower eukaryotic cells having at their outer surface functionally active antibodies, or functionally active fragments of antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect of the present invention, it has been found that immobilising these antibody fragments to the glucan layer of lower eukaryotes do not decrease the temperature stability to such an extent that immobilised llama antibody fragments will loose their functionality during pasteurisation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough heat is by far the most widely applied physical decontamination technique in the consumer product industry, the stability of these immobilised antibodies was also tested against ultra high pressure, pulse electric field and radiation. For all these physical decontamination techniques conditions were found in which the lower eukaryote was killed with an efficiency of >10\n6\n, whereas the antibody fragment retained over 70% of its functionality.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn still another aspect of the invention it was found that combinations of mild physical treatments and antimicrobial compounds, such as acids or antimicrobial peptides were even more effective to kill the lower eukaryotes, while maintaining the functionality of the \nCamelidae\n antibody fragment. Using these combinations, killing effects of >10\n7\n could be achieved, while the functionality of the antibody remained substantially unaffected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) or fragments thereof have many potential applications in addition to for example cancer therapy and diagnostic kits. However, for most applications large quantities are needed whereas costs have to be reduced. For MAbs or fragments thereof these conditions often cannot be met. The \nCamelidae\n heavy-chain antibodies offer a solution to this problem. Probably because of their simple one chain structure and their solubility (Spinelli \net al.,\n 1996), the variable part of llama heavy chain antibodies (V\nHH\n; also referred to as \"HCV\" or \"H-CV\") can be secreted relatively pure and in high amounts by the yeast \nS. cerevisiae.\n For this reason, llama antibody V\nHH\ns are suitable for large scale applications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be shown in the experimental part, llama V\nHH\ns are far more heat stable compared to mouse MAbs. Most llama V\nHH\ns were still able to bind after two hours at temperatures as high as 90°C. The thermal denaturation at lower temperatures of mouse MAbs can be explained because of heavy and light chain separation. After cooling down, these fragments will not associate, or only randomly, resulting substantially in non- functional antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, llama V\nHH\ns and mouse MAbs are comparable in antigen binding in the presence of ATC. HCG specific antibodies could bind at higher ATC concentrations than RR-6 specific antibodies. This is probably due to the nature of the antigen and or antibody-antigen interaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegarding the specificity, llama V\nHH\ns have about the same potential as mouse MAbs in recognition of antigen. Within the small subset of anti-hCG, llama V\nHH\ns, some were found specific to separate alpha-subunit, beta-subunit and intact hCG. The anti-RR6 llama V\nHH\ns did not crossreact with other azodyes, resembling RR-6 in structure. The small subset tested seems to be very specific to RR-6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost of the llama V\nHH\ns have apparent affinities (K\nD\n) range of 10\n-7\n-10\n-9\n M, which is of high affinity. Some mouse MAbs used were found to have higher affinity (10\n9\n-10\n11\n M\n-1\n) which can be contributed to avidity because mouse MAbs are bivalent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, when comparing the biochemical properties of llama V\nHH\ns and mouse MAbs for stability, specificity and affinity, it appears that llama V\nHH\ns have physical chemical properties which make them excellent candidates for use both in existing and novel applications. These applications are in a variety of fields and which are immediately evident to the man skilled in the art. As most food products have to be pasteurized, the addition of V\nHH\ns create really new options. For example, V\nHH\ns that bind and neutralize redox enzymes thereby preventing colour changes of food products, or V\nHH\ns that recognize proteins or polysaccharide of food products thereby providing or improving the structure to the product, or V\nHH\ns that bind off flavours (scavenging) or bind flavours (controlled release). However, also many personal care products are decontaminated by physical techniques like heat or pressure and in these personal care products V\nHH\ns can be introduced as well and provide important benefits like recognition of acne causing microorganisms, scavenging of under-arm odours, etc. Preferred products in which V\nHH\ns can be applied therefore include, for example, consumer products, such as food products and cosmetics (e.g. skin creams), and animal feed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation of the immobilized functionally active antibodies or functionally active fragments of antibodies on the outer surface of lower eukaryote cells (which term include yeasts, moulds and fungi) according to the present invention is similar to the preparation of immobilized binding proteins as described in \n \nWO 94/18330\n \n, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The preparation of the specific \nCamelidae\n heavy-chain antibody fragments has also been described in the literature (\nsupra\n, the disclosures of which are also incorporated herein by reference), so that the man skilled in the art can easily prepare these immobilized antibodies without applying inventive skill.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a typical example of the present invention the \nCamelidae\n antibodies or functional antibody fragments are immobilized on α-agglutinin as the cell wall protein. It is to be understood, however, that also other cell wall ingredients are suitable to anchor the antibodies or antibody fragments, thereby maintaining substantially their primary function. Suitable cell wall ingredients include, for example, CWP1, CWP2, TIP1, SED1, TIR2, YCR89w, FLO1, AGa1, and AGA1; see \nVan der Vaart, J.M. and C.T. Verrips (1998), Cell wall proteins of S. cerevisiae, Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Reviews 15:387-411\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is further illustrated by the following experimental work which however is not intended to limit the invention in any respect.\n\n\n \n\n\nMaterials and methods\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo investigate if llama antibodies can be used in a range of applications, a number of physical chemical and functional characteristics was investigated, thereby concentrating on three characteristics: stability, specificity and affinity. Llama V\nHH\ns and \"classical\" bivalent mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies (\"mouse MAbs\"), specific for either the human pregnancy hormone or the azodye Reactive Red-6 (\"RR-6\"), were compared with respect to heat stability and antigen binding in chaotropic environment (ammonium thiocyanate, ATC elution). Furthermore, llama V\nHH\ns were tested for their antigen specificity and affinity. Both llama and mouse antibodies consist of two subsets: one specific for the protein antigen human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) and one specific for the hapten azodye RR-6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results show that llama V\nHH\ns display similar functional characteristics with respect to specificity, affinity, and binding, in the presence of ammonium thiocyanate and ethanol, compared to \"classical\" mouse MAbs. However, especially regarding functional binding at high temperature (about 90°C) llama V\nHH\ns are extraordinarily stable, compared to mouse MAbs.\n\n\n \n\n\nPurification of llama V\nHH\ns and mouse MAbs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nLlama V\nHH\ns HI-6, H-13, H-14, HI-15, HI-113 (anti-hCG) and R2, R4, R7, R8, R9, R10 (anti RR-6), described in EMBL data library accession numbers: AJ236095 (HI-6), AJ236096 (H-13), AJ236094 (H-14), AJ236097 (HI-15), AJ236098 (HI-113), AJ236100 (R2), AJ236102 (R4), AJ236105 (R7), AJ236106 (R8), AJ236107 (R9), and AJ236108 (R10), were secreted by \nS. cerevisiae\n as a fusion protein comprising a V\nHH\n with a C-terminal myc-tag and a (His)\n6\n-tag. For stability studies, yeast culture supernatants containing llama V\nHH\ns were ultrafiltrated using membranes with cut off limits of 50kD and 5kD, respectively, (Filtron, USA) and dialysed against phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 145 mM NaCl, 7.5 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 2.5 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.01% sodium azide).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe final V\nHH\n preparation had a purity between 80-90% as judged by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250, Sigma, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) staining of sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMouse MAbs were obtained from hybridoma culture supernatant and purified using protein A and subsequent dialysis against PBS. The hCG specific mouse MAbs used was mAB 3299 (anti-Thyroid Stimulating Hormone). The RR-6 specific mouse MAbs used was URL 08-04.\n\n\n \n\n\nSub-saturation point\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing ELISA, dilution curves were made for all antibodies. From these dilution curves subsaturation point was determined (\nFig. 1\n). The sub-saturation point was defined as the highest concentration on the linear part of the curve. Using this sub-saturation point any effect on antigen binding can be observed as a decrease in signal.\n\n\n \n\n\nTemperature\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nLlama V\nHH\ns and mouse MAbs were incubated at various temperatures (4°C, 60°C, 70°C, 80°C and 90°C) for two hours. Subsequently, antibodies were put 30 minutes at 25°C and stored at 4°C. Samples were diluted to sub saturation point and ELISA was performed (\nFig. 2\n). It can be concluded that the V\nHH\n fragments are more stable than the MAbs fragments.\n\n\n \n\n\nBinding in the presence of ATC\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDouble ATC (0-8M) concentrations were mixed 1:1 with double sub saturation concentrations of antibodies and were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Standard ELISA was performed using antibody-ATC mixtures. See \nFigure 3\n. In general, llama V\nHH\ns and mouse MAbs are comparable in antigen binding in the presence of ATC. HCG specific antibodies could bind at higher ATC concentrations than RR-6 specific antibodies. This is probably due to the nature of the antigen and/or antibody-antigen interaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom \nFigure 3B and 3D\n it can be concluded that the llama V\nHH\n fragments HI-15 and R7 are able to bind at higher concentrations ammonium thiocyanate than any of the RR-6 or hCG specific mouse MAbs tested. The binding of HI-15 was reduced only 20% in 4M ammonium thiocyanate, whereas none of the other antibodies tested were able to bind at this concentration. Llama V\nHH\n fragment R7 was completely inhibited in RR-6 binding at 4M ammonium thiocyanate, whereas the best anti RR-6 Mabs (URL 08-01 and URL 08-13) were already completely inhibited at 2M ammonium thiocyanate (\nFig. 3C\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nBinding in the presence of ethanol\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing a comparable setup as for thiocyanate, antibody binding in increasing ethanol concentrations was tested. Both Llama V\nHH\ns and mouse MAbs bound similarly to their antigen in the presence of ethanol at concentrations as high as 50% (\nFig. 4\n). Neither llama V\nHH\ns nor mouse MAbs were inhibited in binding at 50% ethanol. No difference was found between hCG and RR-6 specific antibodies, both llama and mouse. Only RR-6 specific llama V\nHH\n fragments R2 and R4 display a small decrease in binding above 30% ethanol.\n\n\n \n\n\nSpecificity of llama V\nHH\ns.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nELISA was performed on separate alpha-, beta-subunit, or native hCG.

(1990). Immunizations were performed both subcutaneously and intramuscularly using 1 \nml\n 50 mg/l K88ac per immunization site. The first two immunizations were performed with a three week interval and using a water in oil emulsion (4:5 (v/v) antigen in water:specol) as described by Bokhout \net al\n. (1981 and 1986). The third and fourth immunization were done without adjuvant, five and nine weeks after the first immunization. The immune response was followed by antigen specific ELISA's.\n\n\n \n\n\nMethod\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPolystyrene microtiter ELISA plates (Greiner HC plates) were activated overnight at 4°C with 100 µl/well of 5 mg/l K88ac antigen in 0.05 M sodium carbonate buffer at pH 9.5. After each incubation plates were washed four times with 0.05% (v/v) \nTween\n 20 in demi water in order to remove unbound proteins. The wells were then successively incubated 1 hr at ambient temperature with 100 Fl antibody solution in blocking buffer (PBS containing 2% (w/v) BSA; 0.05% (v/v) \nTween\n 20; 1% (v/v) culture supernatant of a \nS. cerevisiae\n strain, SU 50 (Giuseppin, \net al.\n, 1993) grown on YPD; 1% (v/v) of a cleared lysate of \nE. coli\n JM109 cells). The antigen sensitized plates were then successively incubated with (1) serially diluted llama serum samples, (2) 2000-fold diluted polyclonal rabbit anti llama serum (obtained via immunizing rabbits with llama immunoglobulines which were purified via ProtA and ProtG columns), (3) 2000-fold diluted swine-anti-rabbit immunoglobulins conjugated with horse radish peroxidase. The bound peroxidase activity was determined using the \nsubstrate\n 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2 - Cloning, expressing and screening of llama V\nHH\n fragments.\n\n\n\n\n2.1 \nIsolation of gene fragments encoding llama V\n \n \nHH\n \n \ndomains.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nFrom an immunized llama a blood sample of about 200 ml was taken and an enriched lymphocyte population was obtained via Ficoll (Pharmacia) discontinuous gradient centrifugation. From these cells, total RNA was isolated by acid guanidium thiocyanate extraction (e.g. via the method described by Chomczynnski and Sacchi (1987). After first strand cDNA synthesis (e.g. with the Amersham first strand cDNA kit), DNA fragments encoding V\nHH\n fragments and part of the long or short hinge region where amplified by PCR using specific primers:\n\n\nS = C and G, M = A and C, R = A and G, W = A and T,\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon digestion of the PCR fragments with PstI (coinciding with \n \ncodon\n \n 4 and 5 of the V\nHH\n domain, encoding the amino acids L-Q) and \nBst\nEII (located at the 3'-end of the V\nHH\n gene fragments, outside and upstream of the 08 primer coinciding with the amino acid sequence Q-V-T), the DNA fragments with a length between 300 and 450bp (encoding the V\nHH\n domain, but lacking the first three and the last three codons) were purified via gel electrophoresis and isolation from the agarose gel.\n\n\n \n2.2 \nConstruction of \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n expression plasmids encoding llama V\n \n \nHH\n \n \ndomains\n \n\n\n \n \n \nPlasmids pUR4547 (CBS 100012) and pUR4548 (CBS 100013) are \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n episomal expression plasmids, derived from pSY1 (Harmsen \net al.,\n 1993). Both plasmids contain the GAL7 promoter and PGK terminator sequences as well as the invertase (SUC2) signal sequence. In both plasmids the DNA sequence encoding the SUC2 signal sequence is followed by the first 5 codons (encoding Q-V-Q-L-Q; see SEQ. ID. NO: 4) of the V\nHH\n domain (including the \nBst\nII site), a stuffer sequence, the last six codons (encoding Q-V-T-V-S-S; see SEQ. ID. NO: 5) of the V\nHH\n domain. In pUR4547, this is followed by two stop codons, an \nAfl\nII and \nHin\ndIII site. In pUR4548, the Q-V-T-V-S-S sequence is followed by eleven codons encoding the myc-tag, two stop codons, an \nAfl\nII and \nHin\ndIII site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasmids pUR4547 and pUR4548 were deposited under the Budapest Treaty at the Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures, Baarn (The Netherlands) on 18th August 1997 with deposition numbers CBS 100012 and CBS 100013, respectively. In accordance with Rule 28(4) EPC, or a similar arrangement from a state not being a contracting state of the EPC, it is hereby requested that a sample of such deposit, when requested, will be submitted to an expert only.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon digesting pUR4548 with \nPst\nI and \nBst\nEII, the about 6.4kb vector fragment was isolated and ligated with the \nPst\nI-\nBst\nEII fragments of between 300 and 450 bp obtained as described above. After transformation of \nS. cerevisiae\n via electroporation, transformants were selected from minimal medium agar plates (comprising 0.7% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose and 2% agar, supplemented with the essential amino acids and bases).\n\n\n \n2.3 \nScreening for antigen specific V\n \n \nHH\n \n \ndomains\n \n\n\n \n \n \nFor the production of llama V\nHH\n fragments with myc-tail, individual transformants were grown overnight in selective minimal medium (comprising 0.7% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, supplemented with the essential amino acids and bases) and subsequently diluted ten times in YPGal medium (comprising 1% yeast extract, 2% bacto pepton and 5% galactose). After 24 and 48 hours of growth, the culture supernatant of the colonies was analysed by ELISA for the presence of V\nHH\n fragments which specifically bind to the \nE. coli\n K88 antigen, in essential the same way as described in Example 1. In this case, however, the presence of specifically bound V\nHH\n fragments was detected by incubation with monoclonal anti-myc antibodies, followed by incubation with polyclonal rabbit-anti-mouse conjugate with alkaline phosphatase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this way a number of V\nHH\n fragments have been obtained, which specifically recognise the \nE. coli\n K88 antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo examples of such fragments are given below:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nExample3 - Construction of \"self-cloning\" yeast expression cassette, encoding a chimeric protein anchored to the cell wall of yeast, comprising a binding domain and a cell wall anchor\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to display a binding domain at the yeast cell wall, a genetic fusion of the gene encoding the binding domain and a gene encoding the cell wall anchor has to be constructed, either with or with out a linker sequence, essentially as described in \n \nWO 94/25591\n \n. As an example, the construction of a \"self cloned\" yeast, displaying a llama V\nHH\n fragment fused via the \"long hinge\" region to the a-agglutinin cell wall anchor will be described below. Obviously this can be done in much the same way for different binding domains, different linkers/hinges and different cell wall anchors.\n\n\n \n3.1 \nIsolation of the llama \"heavy chain\" long hinge sequence.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nFor the isolation of the hinge regions of the llama \"heavy chain\" antibodies, the cDNA which was obtained as described in Example 1, was amplified by PCR using the primers V\nH\n-2B and Lam-03. The nucleotide sequence of the latter primer was based on a consensus sequence based on the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 domains of different species. The PCR reaction resulted in three DNA fragments of about 450 (a), 550 (b) and 850 (c) bp.\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon digesting these fragments with PstI and \nBam\nHI and size fractionation, they were ligated into pEMBL (Dente, 1983) and subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. The clones obtained from the DNA fragment with an avarage length of -450 bp (a) were found to comprise a short hinge region, having the following sequence:\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe clones obtained from the DNA fragment with an average length of ∼550 bp (b) was found to comprise a long hinge region, having the following sequence:\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the construction of pUR4588, a \nNhe\nI site was introduced in the 3'-end of the long hinge region via PCR using the primers:\n\n\n\n\nvia which the following sequence:\n\n\nbecame\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon digestion with \nBst\nEII and \nNhe\nI, an about 90 bp fragment was obtained encoding the last 4 amino acids of the V\nHH\n domain and the long hinge region except for the last 5 amino acids.\n\n\n \n3.2 \nAdaptation of the α-agglutinin gene\n \n\n\n \n \n \nPlasmid pUR4482 is a yeast episomal expression plasmid for expression of a fusion protein with the invertase signal sequence, the CH\nv\n09 variable region, the Myc-tail and the Camel \"X-P-X-P\" Hinge region (see Hamers-Casterman \net al.,\n 1993), and the α-agglutinin cell wall anchor region. For its construction, see \n \nWO 94/25591\n \n; Example 9 and Figure 18.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nPst\nI-site at position 1665 in the α-agglutinin gene was removed via a three step PCR using primers PAF01 to PAF04. For easy cloning and sequencing in pEMBL8, \nEco\nRI and \nHin\ndlII sites were introduced at the 3'- and 5'-end of the gene fragment encoding α-agglutinin, respectively. PCR-A using primers PAF01 and PAF02 on a pUR4482 template resulted in an about 707 bp fragment with the \nEco\nRI restriction site at the 3'-end. PCR-B using primers PAF03 and PAF04 on a pUR4482 template resulted in an about 427 bp fragment with the \nHin\ndIII site at the 5'-end. A third PCR was performed with the fragments obtained from reaction A and B, together with the primers PAF01 and PAF04. After digesting the obtained PCR product (∼1135 bp), which comprises the modified α-agglutinin gene without the \nPst\nI restriction site, with \nEco\nRI and \nHin\ndlII, the resulting ∼1130 bp fragment was ligated into the vector fragment of pEMBL8 which was digested with the same enzymes resulting in pRL03.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPCR-A\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPAF01\n \nG\nGAATT\nCGTCTCCTCAGAACAAAAAC\n \n(see SEQ.

PAF01 and BOLI-20 were used in a PCR reaction with pRL03 as template to generate an approximately 660 bp fragment and primers BOLI19 and PAF04 were used to make an approximately 504 bp fragment which were linked by splicing by overlap extension using primers PAF01 and PAF04 (PCR-C).

In accordance with Rule 28(4) EPC, or a similar arrangement from a state not being a contracting state of the EPC, it is hereby requested that a sample of such deposit, when requested, will be submitted to an expert only.\n\n\n \n\n\n3.4 Production of yeast strains \"functionally\" expressing the chimeric protein\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPlasmid pUR4588 was digested with SapI, after which an about 6.7 kb fragment was purified, via gel electrophoresis and isolated from the agarose gel. This fragment was introduced into yeast strains via electroporation. Transformants containing (multicopies of) the DNA fragment integrated into the rDNA locus of their genome were selected as described in Example 2. Induction of the production and display of the binding domain was also done as described in Example 2. In order to determine the functionality of the binding domains displayed at the yeast cell wall, the following assay was performed:\n\n\n \n\n\nGI-ELISA\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe yeast cells were diluted in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) to an A\n660\n = 1 and 10 µl of this suspension was mixed with 1 µg K88ac antigen in 100 µl PBST in an Eppendorf tube and incubated for 1 hr at ambient temperature. Unbound antigen was removed from the yeast cells by three washes in 1 ml PBST. Cells were collected after each wash by centrifugation and aspiration of the supernatant. The yeast cells were subsequently resuspended in 100 µl of PBST containing a conjugate of monoclonal antibody AD11, which is specific for K88, and horse radish peroxidase (AD11-HRPO; Van Zijderveld \net al.\n, 1990). After 1 hr incubation at ambient temperature the cells were washed again three times with PBST. The amount of ADll-HRPO bound to the yeast cells was taken as a measure of the amount of functional K88-binding domains displayed at the yeast cell wall. This value was determined by performing a peroxidase assay on serial twofold dilutions of these cells, using 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine as a substrate, and measuring the A\n450\n. The recovered functionality (RF) of the displayed antibody fragments after a physical treatment to inactivate the \nS. cerevisae\n cells is defined as the A\n450\n before treatment (is F0) divided by the A\n450\n after treatment (is Ft).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 4 - Heat inactivation of V\nHH\ns\n\n\n\n\n4.1 \nProduction of biomass suspension.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n strain SU50 containing the genomically integrated expression plasmid pUR4588 was used. The strain was grown in a 10 1 scale fermentor using a fed batch fermentation set up (Mendoza-Vega \net al\n., 1994). Such a fermentation consists of two steps: the first step (the batch phase) is performed in a Yeast extract and Peptone (YP) medium containing glucose. In the second step (the feed phase) YP medium is added containing glucose and galactose, in order to induce the promoter for the production of the V\nHH\n-agglutinine fusion. In this way a culture was obtained with a cell density of about 10\n9\n-10\n10\n per ml, comparable to large scale fermentations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell density or viable counts (N) were determined by making decimal dilutions of a cell culture in sterile pepton physiological salt (PFS; 0.85% NaCl, 0.1% Bactopepton (Difco), pH 7). Samples of these dilutions were plated on YPD agar and incubated for 5 days at 30 °C after which the number of colonies were counted. The reduction of viable counts (RVC) after treatment to inactivate the \nS. cerevisiae\n cells is defined as the logarithm of the viable counts after treatment (is Nt) divided by the number of viable counts before treatment (is N0); Log (Nt/N0).\n\n\n \n4.2 \nHeat treatment\n \n\n\n \n \n \nDetermination of the killing efficiency of heat treatment on high cell density cultures was performed using one of two different approaches, as desired.\n\n\n \n4.2.1 \nUsing glass capillaries\n \n\n\n \n \n \nSterile glass capillaries (Fisher Scientific Den Bosch, 1=100 mm, d=2 mm) were filled with 0.1 ml of the yeast culture medium and sealed. After incubating the filled, sealed capillaries, they were placed for a set time in a water bath at the desired temperature (experiments were performed at quadruplets). After this the recovered functionality (RF) and the reduction in viable counts (RVC) for the different samples was determined as described above.\n\n\n \n4.2.2 \nUsing aluminium vials\n \n\n\n \n \n \nSterile aluminium cryo vials (Omnilabo, volume 3 ml) were filled with 0.5 ml of the yeast culture for each temperature/time combination (experiments performed in duplo). The vials were placed in a water bath at the desired temperature and time. After this the recovered functionality (RF) and the reduction in viable counts (RVC) for the different samples was determined as described above.\n\n\n \n4.3 \nViable counts and GI-ELISA\n \n\n\n \n \n \nFrom the yeast culture the viable counts (N0) and the GI-ELISA signal (F0) was determined before heat treatment. The same was done for the samples obtained as described above (Nt and Ft, respectively). The results are presented in Table 3 below.\n\n \n \nTable 3\n \n \n \n \nTemp (°C)\n \ntime (sec)\n \nRVC (= log (Nt/N0))\n \nRF (=Ft/F0)\n \n \n \n \n60\n \n300\n \n- 4\n \n100%\n \n \n \n62\n \n60\n \n> -6\n \n100%\n \n \n \n70\n \n30\n \n> -7\n \n> 85%\n \n \n \n74\n \n15\n \n> -7\n \n> 85%\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5 - Inactivation of \nS. cerevisiae\n SU50 (pUR 4588) with Ultra High Pressure\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFrom literature it is known that at pressures over 300 MPa proteins FF ATP-ase can be inactivated (Wouters \net al\n, 1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nS. cerevisiae\n SU50 (pUR4588), displaying anti-\nE. coli\n K88 V\nHH\n fragments, was grown at 10 liter scale as described above. Samples of 1.5 ml were taken and transferred to bags for Ultra High Pressure treatment in a \"Food Lab Multi Vessel\" (Stansted Fluid Power, UK). Samples were incubated at three different pressures 250, 300 and 325 Mpa for different periods of time. The survival of the yeast cells and the functionality of the displayed V\nHH\ns was determined as described above. The results are presented in Table 4 below.\n\n \n \nTable 4\n \n \n \n \nPressure (Mpa)\n \ntime (min)\n \nRVC (=log (Nt/N0))\n \nRF (=Ft/F0)\n \n \n \n \n250\n \n60\n \n- 9\n \n100%\n \n \n \n300\n \n3\n \n- 6\n \n>70%\n \n \n \n \n \n20\n \n- 9\n \n>70%\n \n \n \n325\n \n1\n \n- 6\n \n70%\n \n \n \n \n \n3\n \n- 9\n \n70%\n \n \n \n \n \n20\n \n- 9\n \n70%\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was further found that yeast cells that do not have the capacity to synthesize trehalose are much more sensitive for UHP (Fernandes \net al\n., 1997). Therefore, a preferred embodiment of the inactivation of yeast with UHP is, instead of using a wild type yeast strain, using a variant strain defective in the synthesis of trehalose, e.g. a strain in which the TPS1 gene has been inactivated e.g. by partial or complete deletion. In this way the UHP treatment could be reduced from 300 MPa to 200 MPa with the same reduction in viable counts.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 6 - Killing of yeast cells by irradiation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAn alternative for the inactivation of yeast cells is gamma radiation. \nS. cerevisiae\n SU50 (pUR4588), was grown at 10 liter scale as described above. After fermentation the biomass slurry was transferred to polypropylene drums and exposed to 10 kGray or 25 kGray of gamma radiation ('Gammaster', Ede). The survival of the yeast cells and the functionality of the displayed V\nHH\ns was determined as described above. For both cases, the RVC was better than - 10 (no viable counts left after irradiation), whereas the RF of the V\nHH\ns was 100%. The anti-K88 activity was not affected by the irradiation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of genes involved in DNA repair are known (e.g \nrad\n9, \nrad\n30, \nrad\n52, \nsir\n2, \nsir3\n, \nsir\n4). Yeast strains carrying mutations in these genes, are known to be more sensitive towards radiation (Friedberg \net al.\n, 1991; Tsukamoto \net al.\n, 1997). In a preferred embodiment of this invention, a yeast strain with one or more mutations in one or more of these genes is used.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 7 - Combined effect of heat inactivation and antimicrobials on \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nS. cerevisiae\n SU50 (pUR4588) cells were cultivated and harvested as described above and subjected to heat treatment as described above in the presence of antimicrobials like ethanol, potassium sorbate and antimicrobial peptides like nisin and MB21. According to the methods described in the previous examples the inactivation efficiency and the recovery of the functionality of the V\nHH\n antibodies have been determined.

Therefore, a preferred embodiment of inactivation of yeast by a combination of heat and acid is to use, instead of the wild type yeast strain, a strain in which the PMR gene is inactivated, e.g. via partial or complete deletion. In this way either the temperature or the amount of acid or both can be reduced considerably.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 8 - Animal feeding trials with yeast displaying anti \nE\n. \ncoli\n K88 V\nHH\ns on their surface\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn this experiment two groups of piglets were used.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates generally to the generation and characterization of neutralizing anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibodies with broad reactivity against various IFN-α subtypes. The invention further relates to the use of such anti-IFN-α antibodies in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders associated with increased expression of IFN-α, in particular, autoimmune disorders such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription of the Related Art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterferon-α (IFN-α)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAlthough interferons were initially discovered for their anti-viral activities, subsequent research has unraveled a plethora of regulatory activities associated with these powerful cytokines. Type I interferons form an ancient family of cytokines that includes IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-δ, IFN-ω and IFN-τ (\nRoberts et al., J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 18: 805-816 [1998\n]). They are coded by intronless genes and are widely distributed amongst vertebrates. Whereas IFN-β is coded by a single gene in primates and rodents, more than 10 and 15 different subtypes of IFN-α have been found in mice and man respectively. Other interferons of type I are more restricted, e.g. IFN-δ in the pig, IFN-τ in cattle and sheep, and IFN-ω in cattle and humans. Thus, human type I interferons comprise multiple members of the IFN-α family, and single members of the IFN-β and IFN-ω families. All type I TFNs appear to bind to a single receptor that is comprised of at least two membrane spanning proteins. Type II interferons on the other hand are represented by a single member, IFN-γ, and bind to a distinct receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough all type I IFNs, including IFN-α, exhibit anti-viral and anti-proliferative activities and thereby help to control viral infections and tumors (\nLefevre et al., Biochimie 80: 779-788 [1998\n]; \nHorton et al., Cancer Res. 59: 4064-4068 [1999\n]; \nAlexenko et al., J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 17: 769-779 [1997\n]; \nGresser, J. Leukoc. Biol. 61: 567-574 [1997\n]), there are also several autoimmune diseases that are associated with increased expression of IFNα, most notably insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nType I diabetes, also known as autoimmune diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), is an autoimmune disease characterized by the selective destruction of pancreatic β cells by autoreactive T lymphocytes (\nBach, Endocr. Rev. 15: 516-542 [1994\n]; \nCastano and Eisenbarth, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 8: 647-679 [1990\n]; \nShehadeh and Lafferty, Diabetes Rev. 1: 141-151 [1993\n]). The pathology of IDDM is very complex involving an interaction between an epigenetic event (possibly a viral infection), the pancreatic β cells and the immune system in a genetically susceptible host. A number of cytokines, including TFN-α and IFN-γ, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IDDM in humans and in animal models of the disease (\nCampbell et al., J. Clin. Invest. 87: 739-742 [1991\n]; \nHuang et al., Diabetes 44: 658-664 [1995\n]; \nRhodes and Taylor, Diabetologia 27: 601-603 [1984\n]). For example, pancreatic \nIfn\n-α mRNA expression and the presence of immunoreactive IFN-α in β cells of patients with IDDM have been reported (\nFoulis et al., Lancet 2: 1423-1427 [1987\n]; Huang \net al.,\n [1995] \nsupra\n; \nSomoza et al., J. Immunol. 153: 1360-1377 [1994\n]). IFN-α expression has been associated with hyperexpression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I\nA\n antigens in human islets (Foulis \net al.,\n [1987] \nsupra\n; Somoza \net al.,\n [1994] \nsupra\n). In two rodent models of autoimmune diabetes, the diabetes-prone DP-BB rat and streptozotocin-treated mice, \nIfn\n-α mRNA expression in islets precedes insulitis and diabetes (\nHuang et al., Immunity 1: 469-478 [1994\n]). Furthermore, transgenic mice harboring a hybrid human insulin promoter-\nIfn\n-α construct develop hypoinsulinemic diabetes accompanied by insulitis (\nStewart et al., Science 260: 1942-1946 [1993\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt appears that local expression of IFN-α by pancreatic islet cells in response to potential diabetogenic stimuli such as viruses may trigger the insulitic process. Consistent with its role as an initiating agent, IFN-α has been shown to induce intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and HLA class I\nA\n on endothelial cells from human islets, which may contribute to leukocyte infiltration during insulitis (\nChakrabarti et al., J. Immunol. 157: 522-528 [1996\n]). Furthermore, IFN-α facilitates T cell stimulation by the induction of the co-stimulatory molecules ICAM-1 and B7.2 on antigen-presenting cells in islets (\nChakrabarti et al., Diabetes 45: 1336-1343 [1996\n]). These studies collectively indicate that early IFN-α expression by β cells may be a critical event in the initiation of autoimmune diabetes. Although there are a number of reports implicating IFN-γ in the development of IDDM in rodent models, there is a poor correlation between the expression of this cytokine and human IDDM. Thus, cells expressing IFN-γ can be found in the islets of a subset of human patients selected for significant lymphocytic infiltration into the islets. In a group of patients that were not selected by this criterion there was no obvious association between IFN-γ expression and human IDDM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the increased level of IFN-α expression in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), IFN-α has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE (\nYtterberg and Schnitzer, Arthritis Rheum. 25: 401-406 [1982\n]; \nShi et al., Br. J. Dermatol. 117: 155-159 [1987\n]). It is interesting to note that IFN-α is currently used for the treatment of cancer as well as viral infection such as chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection. Consistent with the observations of increased levels of IFN-α triggering autoimmunity, significant increase in the appearance of autoimmune disorders such as IDDM, SLE and autoimmune thyroiditis has been reported in the patients undergoing IFN-α therapy. For example, prolonged use of IFN-α as an anti-viral therapy has been shown to induce IDDM (\nWaguri et al., Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 23: 33-36 [1994\n]; \nFabris et al., J. Hepatol. 28: 514-517 [1998\n]) or SLE (\nGarcia-Porrua et al., Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 16: 107-108 [1998\n]). The treatment ofcoxsackievirus B (CBV) infection with IFN-α therapy is also associated with the induction of IDDM (\nChehadeh et al., J. Infect. Dis. 181: 1929-1939 [2000\n]). Similarly, there are multiple case reports documenting IDDM or SLE in IFN-α treated cancer patients (\nRonnblom et al., J. Intern. Med. 227: 207-210 [1990\n]).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAntibody therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe use of monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics has gained increased acceptance with several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) either approved for human use or in late stage clinical trials. The first mAb approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of allograft rejection was anti-CD3 (OKT3) in 1986. Since then the pace of progress in the field of mAbs has been considerably accelerated, particularly from 1994 onwards which led to approval of additional seven mAbs for human treatment. These include ReoPro\n®\n for the management of complications of coronary angioplasty in 1994, Zenapax\n®\n (anti-CD25) for the prevention of allograft rejection in 1997, Rituxan\n®\n (anti-CD20) for the treatment of B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1997, Infliximab\n®\n (anti-TNF-α) initially for the treatment of Crohn's disease in 1998 and subsequently for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in 1999, Simulect\n®\n (anti-CD25) for the prevention of allograft rejection in 1998, Synagis\n®\n (anti-F protein of respiratory syncitial virus) for the treatment of respiratory infections in 1998, and Herceptin\n®\n (anti-HER2/neu) for the treatment of HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast tumors in 1998 (\nGlennie and Johnson, Immunol. Today 21: 403-410 [2000\n]).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAnti-IFN-α Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDisease states that are amenable to intervention with mAbs include all those in which there is a pathological level of a target antigen. For example, an antibody that neutralizes IFN-α present in the sera of patients with SLE, and expressed by the pancreatic islets in IDDM, is a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention in these diseases. It could also be used for therapeutic intervention in other autoimmune diseases with underlying increase in and causative role of IFN-α expression. In both human IDDM (\nFoulis, et al., Lancet 2: 1423-1427 [1987\n]; \nHuang, et al., Diabetes 44: 658-664 [1995\n]; \nSomoza, et al., J. Immunol. 153: 1360-1377 [1994\n]) and human SLE (\nHooks, et al., Arthritis & Rheumatism 25: 396-400 [1982\n]; \nKim, et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 70: 562-569 [1987\n]; \nLacki, et al., J. Med. 28: 99-107 [1997\n]; \nRobak, et al., Archivum Immunologiae et Therapiae Experimentalis 46: 375-380 [1998\n]; \nShiozawa, et al., Arthritis & Rheumatism 35: 417-422 [1992\n]; \nvon Wussow, et al., Rheumatology International 8: 225-230 [1988\n]) there appears to be correlation between disease and IFN-α but not with either IFN-β or IFN-γ. Thus, anti-interferon mAb intervention in IDDM or SLE would require specific neutralization of most, if not all, of the IFN-α subtypes, without any significant neutralization of IFN-β or IFN-γ. Leaving the activity of these last two interferons intact may also have an advantage in allowing the retention of significant anti-viral activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile a few mAbs that show reactivity with a range of recombinant human IFN-α subtypes have been described, these were found to neutralize only a limited subset of the recombinant IFN-α subtypes analyzed or were not capable of neutralizing the mixture of IFN-α subtypes that are produced by stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes (\nTsukui et al., Microbiol. Immunol. 30: 1129-1139 [1986\n]; \nBerg, J. Interferon Res. 4: 481-491 [1984\n]; \nMeager and Berg, J. Interferon Res. 6: 729-736 [1986\n]; \n \nUS Patent No. 4,902,618\n \n; and \n \nEP publication No. 0,139,676 B1\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, there is a great need for anti-IFN-α antibodies that not only bind to most, preferably all, subtypes of IFN-α but also neutralize such subtypes while do not interfere with the biological function of other interferons.\n\n\n \n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is based on the development of a monoclonal antibody that was experimentally found to neutralize all seven of different recombinant human IFN-α subtypes tested and two independent pools of natural human IFN-α subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides an anti-human IFN-α monoclonal antibody which binds to and neutralizes a biological activity of at least human IFN-α subtypes IFN-α1, IFN-α2, IFN-α4, IFN-α5, IFN-α8, IFN-α10, and IFN-α21.

The antibody may be of the IgG class and isotypes such as IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, or IgG\n4\n. The scope of the invention also covers antibody fragments such as Fv, scFv, Fab, F(ab')\n2\n, and Fab' fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this specification, CDR's are as defined by \nKabat, et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, NIH Publication 91-3242, Bethesda MD [1991], vols. 1-3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody may be a homo-tetrameric structure composed of two disulfide-bonded antibody heavy chain-light chain pairs.

Further provided is a chimeric antibody comprising (A) the mouse/human chimeric light chain variable domain amino acid sequence, or the entire chimeric light chain polypeptide amino acid sequence, encoded by the XAIFN-ChLpDR1 vector deposited with the ATCC on January 9, 2001 and having accession No. PTA-2880; and (B) the mouse/human chimeric heavy chain variable domain amino acid sequence, or the entire chimeric heavy chain polypeptide amino acid sequence, encoded by the XAIFN-ChHpDR2 vector deposited with the ATCC on January 9,2001 and having accession No. PTA-2883.

The patient is a mammalian patient, preferably a human patient. The disease is an autoimmune disease, such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM); systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); or autoimmune thyroiditis.\n\n\n \n\n\nBrief Description of the Drawings\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nFig. 1\n shows a schematic diagram of the strategy used for the development of the anti-human IFN-α monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n \nFig. 2\n shows that a murine anti-human IFN-α mAb (9F3) is able to neutralize a spectrum of recombinant IFN-α subtypes but not recombinant IFN-β. The indicated IFN's were assayed for inhibition of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) viral growth in A549 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of the mAb 9F3. Data are presented as the percentage of the viral growth inhibition activity obtained with the indicated IFN in the absence of mAb 9F3.\n\n\n \nFigs. 3A-3B\n show the neutralization of leukocyte interferon (Sigma) (\nFig. 3A\n) and lymphoblastoid interferon (NIH reference Ga23-901-532) (\nFig. 3B\n). In \nFig. 3A\n, 20,000 IU/ml (filled bars) or 5,000 IU/ml (open bars) of leukocyte interferon (Sigma Product No. I-2396) were incubated with blank control (buffers only) (denoted as \"-\"), 10 :g/ml control mouse IgG (denoted as \"mlgG\"), or 10 :g/ml mAb 9F3 (denoted as \"9F3\"). Dilutions were assayed and the amount of remaining activity shown. The results shown are means of duplicate determinations. In \nFig. 3B\n, lymphoblastoid interferon (NIH reference Ga23-901-532) was assayed at 10 (filled columns) or 3 (open columns) IU/ml in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of mAb 9F3. A higher cytopathic effect is indicative of a decrease in interferon activity. The results shown are the means of duplicate determinations.\n\n\n \nFig. 4\n depicts results of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showing the induction of an ISGF3/ISRE complex by IFN-α and the ability of 9F3 mAb to prevent the formation of the complex. EMSA was performed in the presence or absence of either human IFN-α2 (denoted as \"α2\") or IFN-∃ (denoted as \"∃\") at a concentration of 25 ng/ml with 9F3 mAb (denoted as \"9F3\") or murine IgG control antibody (denoted as \"IgG\") at a concentration of 10 :g/ml.\n\n\n \nFig. 5A\n shows the alignment of light chain variable domain amino acid sequences of murine 9F3 (murine, SEQ ID NO: 1), humanized 9F3 version 13 (V 13, SEQ ID NO:3), and the consensus human variable domain light κ subgroup I (huκI, SEQ ID NO: 4). The CDRs (L1, SEQ ID NO: 7; L2, SEQ ID NO: 8; and L3, SEQ ID NO: 9) are highlighted by underlining. The residue numbering is according to Kabat \net al.,\n (1991) \nsupra.\n The differences between the murine 9F3 and V13 sequences and the differences between 9F3 and huκI sequences are indicated by asterisks.\n\n\n \nFig. 5B\n shows the alignment of heavy chain variable domain amino acid sequences of murine 9F3 (murine, SEQ ID NO: 2), humanized 9F3 version 13 (V 13, SEQ ID NO: 5), and the consensus human variable domain heavy subgroup III (huIII, SEQ ID NO: 6). The CDRs (H1, SEQ ID NO: 10; H2, SEQ ID NO: 11; and H3, SEQ ID NO: 12) are highlighted by underlining. The residue numbering is according to Kabat \net al.\n (1991) \nsupra.\n The differences between the murine 9F3 and V13 sequences and the differences between 9F3 and huIIIsequences are indicated by asterisks.\n\n\n \nFig. 6\n shows neutralization activity of the starting mAb 9F3 (left panel) and the chimeric protein CH8-2 (right panel) toward the viral growth inhibition exhibited by recombinant IFN-α subtypes in A549 cells challenged with encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus.\n\n\n \nFig. 7\n depicts a model of humanized 9F3 version 13. Backbone of VL and V\nH\n domains is shown as a ribbon. CDRs are shown in white and are labeled (L1, L2, L3, H1, H2, H3). Framework side chains altered from human to murine are shown in white and are labeled by residue number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment\n\n\n\n\nA. \nDefinitions\n \n\n\n \n \n \nUnless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. See, e.g. \nSingleton et al., Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology 2nd ed., J. Wiley & Sons (New York, NY 1994\n); \nSambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Springs Harbor Press (Cold Springs Harbor, NY 1989\n). For purposes of the present invention, the following terms are defined below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"type I interferon\" is defined to include all subtypes of native sequence type I interferons of any mammalian species, including interferon-α, interferon-β, interferon-δ, interferon-ω and interferon-τ. Similarly, the term \"human type I interferon\" is defined to include all subtypes of native sequence type I human interferons, including human interferon-α, interferon-β and interferon-ω classes and which bind to a common cellular receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise expressly provided, the terms \"interferon-α,\" \"IFN-α,\" and \"human interferon-α\", \"human IFN-α\" and \"hIFN-α\" are used herein to refer to all species of native sequence human alpha interferons, including all subtypes of native sequence human interferons-α. Natural (native sequence) human interferon-α comprises 23 or more closely related proteins encoded by distinct genes with a high degree of structural homology (\nWeissmann and Weber, Prog. Nucl. Acid. Res. Mol. Biol., 33: 251 [1986\n]; \nJ. Interferon Res., 13: 443-444 [1993\n]; \nRoberts et al., J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 18: 805-816 [1998\n]). The human IFN-α locus comprises two subfamilies. The first subfamily consists of at least 14 functional, non-allelic genes, including genes encoding IFN-αA (IFN-α2), IFN-αB (IFN-α8), IFN-αC (IFN-α10), IFN-αD (IFN-α1), IFN-αE (IFN-α22), IFN-αF (IFN-α21), IFN-αG (IFN-α5), and IFN-αH (IFN-α14), and pseudogenes having at least 80% homology. The second subfamily, α\nII\n or T, contains at least 5 pseudogenes and one functional gene (denoted herein as \"IFN-\nα\n \n \n \n11\n1\" or \"IFN-T\") which exhibits 70% homology with the IFN-α genes (Weissmann and Weber [1986] \nsupra\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms \"first human interferon-α (hIFN-α) receptor\", \"IFN-αR\", \"hIFNAR1\", \"IFNAR1\", and \"Uze chain\" are defined as the 557 amino acid receptor protein cloned by \nUze et al., Cell, 60: 225-234 (1990\n), including an extracellular domain of 409 residues, a transmembrane domain of 21 residues, and an intracellular domain of 100 residues, as shown in \nFig. 5\n on page 229 of Uze \net al.\n Also encompassed by the foregoing terms are fragments of IFNAR1 that contain the extracellular domain (ECD) (or fragments of the ECD) of IFNAR1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms \"second human interferon-α (hIFN-α) receptor\", \"IFN-αβR\", \"hIFNAR2\", \"IFNAR2\", and \"Novick chain\" are defined as the 515 amino acid receptor protein cloned by \nDomanski et al., J. Biol. Chem., 37: 21606-21611 (1995\n), including an extracellular domain of 217 residues, a transmembrane domain of 21 residues, and an intracellular domain of 250 residues, as shown in \nFig. 1\n on page 21608 of Domanski \net al.\n Also encompassed by the foregoing terms are fragments of IFNAR2 that contain the extracellular domain (ECD) (or fragments of the ECD) of IFNAR2, and soluble forms of IFNAR2, such as IFNAR2 ECD fused to an immunoglobulin sequence, e.g. IFNAR2 ECD-IgG Fc as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"native sequence\" in connection with type I interferon, IFN-α or any other polypeptide refers to a polypeptide that has the same amino acid sequence as a corresponding polypeptide derived from nature, regardless of its mode of preparation. Such native sequence polypeptide can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant and/or synthetic means or any combinations thereof. The term \"native sequence\" specifically encompasses naturally-occurring truncated or secreted forms (\ne.g.\n, an extracellular domain sequence), naturally-occurring variant forms (\ne.g.\n, alternatively spliced forms) and naturally-occurring allelic variants of the full length polypeptides. \"Polymerase chain reaction\" or \"PCR\" refers to a procedure or technique in which minute amounts of a specific piece of nucleic acid, RNA and/or DNA, are amplified as described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,683,195 issued 28 July 1987\n \n. Generally, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond needs to be available, such that oligonucleotide primers can be designed; these primers will be identical or similar in sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. The 5' terminal nucleotides of the two primers can coincide with the ends of the amplified material. PCR can be used to amplify specific RNA sequences, specific DNA sequences from total genomic DNA, and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA, bacteriophage or plasmid sequences, etc. See generally \nMullis et al., Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 51:263 (1987\n); \nErlich, ed., PCR Technology (Stockton Press, NY, 1989\n). As used herein, PCR is considered to be one, but not the only, example of a nucleic acid polymerase reaction method for amplifying a nucleic acid test sample comprising the use of a known nucleic acid as a primer and a nucleic acid polymerase to amplify or generate a specific piece of nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Antibodies\" (Abs) and \"immunoglobulins\" (Igs) are glycoproteins having the same structural characteristics. While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen, immunoglobulins include both antibodies and other antibody-like molecules which lack antigen specificity. Polypeptides of the latter kind are, for example, produced at low levels by the lymph system and at increased levels by myelomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Native antibodies and immunoglobulins\" are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light- and heavy-chain variable domains (\nChothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 186:651 [1985\n]; \nNovotny and Haber, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82:4592 [1985\n]; \nChothia et al., Nature 342: 877-883 [1989\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"variable\" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions both in the light-chain and the heavy-chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a β-sheer configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the β-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together, in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat \net al.\n (1991) \nsupra\n). The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPapain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called \"Fab\" fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual \"Fc\" fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab')\n2\n fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Fv\" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. In a two-chain Fv species, this region consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv species, one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a \"dimeric\" structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab')\n2\n antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \"light chains\" of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called κ and λ, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these can be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, IgG\n4\n, IgA\n1\n, and IgA\n2\n. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called α, δ, ε, γ, and µ respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"antibody\" includes all classes and subclasses of intact immunoglobulins. The term \"antibody\" also covers antibody fragments. The term \"antibody\" specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, including antibody fragment clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Antibody fragments\" comprise a portion of an intact antibody that contains the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n, and Fv fragments; diabodies; single-chain antibody molecules, including single-chain Fv (scFv) molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"monoclonal antibody\" as used herein refers to an antibody (or antibody fragment) obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the hybridoma culture, and are not contaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier \"monoclonal\" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by \nKohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975\n), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n). The \"monoclonal antibodies\" also include clones of antigen-recognition and binding-site containing antibody fragments (Fv clones) isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in \nClackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991\n) and \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 (1991\n), for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \"chimeric\" antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567 to Cabilly et al.\n \n; \nMorrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851-6855 [1984\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Humanized\" forms of non-human (\ne.g.\n, murine) antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from part or all of a complementarity-determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and optimize antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see \nJones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986\n); \nReichmann et al., Nature, 332:323-329 (1988\n); \nPresta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2:593-596 (1992\n); and \nClark, Immunol. Today 21: 397-402 (2000\n). The humanized antibody includes a Primatized™ antibody wherein the antigen-binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by immunizing macaque monkeys with the antigen of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Single-chain Fv\" or \"scFv\" antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains, which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see \nPluckthun, in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994\n), \nDall'Acqua and Carter, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 8: 443-450 (1998\n), and \nHudson, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 11: 548-557 (1999\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"diabodies\" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH - VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, \n \nEP 404,097\n \n; \n \nWO 93/11161\n \n; and \nHollinger et al., Proc. Natl. A cad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"isolated\" antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody \nin situ\n within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"neutralizing antibody\" is meant an antibody molecule which is able to eliminate or significantly reduce an effector function of a target antigen to which it binds. Accordingly, a \"neutralizing\" anti-IFN-α antibody is capable of eliminating or significantly reducing an effector function, such as receptor binding and/or elicitation of a cellular response, of IFN-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n>\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purpose of the present invention, the ability of an anti-IFN-α antibody to neutralize the receptor activation activity of IFN-α can be monitored, for example, in a Kinase Receptor Activation (KIRA) Assay as described in \n \nWO 95/14930, published June 1, 1995\n \n, by measuring the ability of a candidate antibody to reduce tyrosine phosphorylation (resulting from ligand binding) of the IFNAR1/R2 receptor complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purpose of the present invention, the ability of the anti-IFN-α antibodies to neutralize the elicitation of a cellular response by IFN-α is preferably tested by monitoring the neutralization of the antiviral activity of IFN-α, as described by \nKawade, J. Interferon Res. 1:61-70 (1980\n), or \nKawade and Watanabe, J. Interferon Res. 4:571-584 (1984\n), or \nYousefi, et al., Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 83: 735-740 (1985\n), or by testing the ability of an anti-IFN-α antibody to neutralize the ability of IFN-α to activate the binding of the signaling molecule, interferon-stimulated factor 3 (ISGF3), to an oligonucleotide derived from the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, as described by \nKurabayashi et al., Mol. Cell Biol., 15: 6386 (1995\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Significant\" reduction means at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, preferably at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85%, still more preferably at least about 90%, still more preferably at least about 95%, most preferably at least about 99% reduction of an effector function of the target antigen (e.g. IFN-α), such as receptor (e.g. IFNAR2) binding and/or elicitation of a cellular response. Preferably, the \"neutralizing\" antibodies as defined herein will be capable of neutralizing at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, preferably at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85%, still more preferably at least about 90%, still more preferably at least about 95%, most preferably at least about 99% of the anti-viral activity of IFN-α, as determined by the anti-viral assay of Kawade (1980), \nsupra\n, or Yousefi (1985), \nsupra.\n In another preferred embodiment, the \"neutralizing\" antibodies herein will be capable of reducing tyrosine phosphorylation, due to IFN-α binding, of the IFNAR1/IFNAR2 receptor complex, by at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, preferably at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 80%; even more preferably at least about 85%, still more preferably at least about 90%, still more preferably at least about 95%, most preferably at least about 99%, as determined in the KIRA assay referenced above. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies herein will be able to neutralize all, or substantially all, subtypes of IFN-α and will not be able to neutralize IFN-β. In this context, the term \"substantially all\" means that the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibody will neutralize at least IFN-α1, KN-α2, IFN-α4, IFN-α5, IFN-α8, IFN-α10, and IFN-α21.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purpose of the present invention, the ability of an anti-IFN-α, antibody to block the binding of an IFN-α to receptor is defined as the property or capacity of a certain concentration of the antibody to reduce or eliminate the binding of IFN-α to IFNAR2 in a competition binding assay, as compared to the effect of an equivalent concentration of irrelevant control antibody on IFN-α binding to IFNAR2 in the assay. Preferably, the blocking anti-IFN-α antibody reduces the binding of IFN-α to IFNAR2 by at least about 50%, or at least about 55%, or at least about 60%, or at least about 65%, or at least about 70%, or at least about 75%, or at least about 80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 95%, or at least about 99%, as compared to the irrelevant control antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purpose of the present invention, the ability of an anti-IFN-α antibody to block the binding of IFN-α to IFNAR2 can be determined by a routine competition assay such as that described in \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988\n). For example, the IFN-α-binding ELISA assay described in Example 2 below could be modified to employ competition binding between an anti-IFN-α antibody and a soluble IFNAR2. Such an assay could be performed by layering the IFN-α on microtiter plates, incubating the layered plates with serial dilutions of unlabeled anti-IFN-α antibody or unlabeled control antibody admixed with a selected concentration of labeled IFNAR2 ECD-human IgG Fc fusion protein, detecting and measuring the signal in each incubation mixture, and then comparing the signal measurements exhibited by the various dilutions of antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particularly preferred embodiment, the blocking anti-IFN-α antibodies herein will be able to block the IFNAR2-binding of all, or substantially all, subtypes of IFN-α and will not cross-react with IFN-β. In this context, the term \"substantially all\" means that the blocking anti-IFN-α antibody will block the IFNAR2-binding of at least IFN-α1, IFN-α2, IFN-α4, IFN-α5, IFN-α8, IFN-α10, and IFN-α21. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the blocking anti-IFN-α antibodies of the present invention will block the IFNAR2-binding of all known subtypes of IFN-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"epitope\" is used to refer to binding sites for (monoclonal or polyclonal) antibodies on protein antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies which bind to a particular epitope can be identified by \"epitope mapping.\" There are many methods known in the art for mapping and characterizing the location of epitopes on proteins, including solving the crystal structure of an antibody-antigen complex, competition assays, gene fragment expression assays, and synthetic peptide-based assays, as described, for example, in \nChapter 11 of Harlow and Lane, Using Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1999\n. Competition assays are discussed above and below. According to the gene fragment expression assays, the open reading frame encoding the protein is fragmented either randomly or by specific genetic constructions and the reactivity of the expressed fragments of the protein with the antibody to be tested is determined. The gene fragments may, for example, be produced by PCR and then transcribed and translated into protein \nin vitro,\n in the presence of radioactive amino acids. The binding of the antibody to the radioactively labeled protein fragments is then determined by immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis. Certain epitopes can also be identified by using large libraries of random peptide sequences displayed on the surface of phage particles (phage libraries). Alternatively, a defined library of overlapping peptide fragments can be tested for binding to the test antibody in simple binding assays. The latter approach is suitable to define linear epitopes of about 5 to 15 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody binds \"essentially the same epitope\" as a reference antibody, when the two antibodies recognize identical or sterically overlapping epitopes. The most widely used and rapid methods for determining whether two epitopes bind to identical or sterically overlapping epitopes are competition assays, which can be configured in all number of different formats, using either labeled antigen or labeled antibody. Usually, the antigen is immobilized on a 96-well plate, and the ability of unlabeled antibodies to block the binding of labeled antibodies is measured using radioactive or enzyme labels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term amino acid or amino acid residue, as used herein, refers to naturally occurring L amino acids or to D amino acids as described further below with respect to variants. The commonly used one- and three-letter abbreviations for amino acids are used herein (\nBruce Alberts et al., Molecular Biology of the Cell, Garland Publishing, Inc., New York (3d ed. 1994\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n>\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity\" with respect to the polypeptide sequences referred to herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in a sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, ALIGN-2 or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full-length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are obtained as described below by using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc. and its source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available through Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California, and the source code for the ALIGN-2 program and instructions for its use are disclosed in International Application Publication No. \n \nWO2000/39297 published July 6, 2000\n \n. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor purposes herein, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows: \n \n \n100\n \n \n \ntimes the fraction X\n \n/\n \nY\n \n \n \n \n\nwhere X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described above using the ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program. However, % amino acid sequence identity may also be determined using the sequence comparison program NCBI-BLAST2 (\nAltschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402 (1997\n)). The NCBI-BLAST2 sequence comparison program may be downloaded from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. NCBI-BLAST2 uses several search parameters, wherein all of those search parameters are set to default values including, for example, unmask = yes, strand = all, expected occurrences = 10, minimum low complexity length = 15/5, multi-pass e-value = 0.01, constant for multi-pass = 25, dropoff for final gapped alignment = 25 and scoring matrix = BLOSUM62.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn situations where NCBI-BLAST2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows:\n\n100 times the fraction X/Y\n\nwhere X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program NCBI-BLAST2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid is \"operably linked\" when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, \"operably linked\" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"disease state\" refers to a physiological state of a cell or of a whole mammal in which an interruption, cessation, or disorder of cellular or body functions, systems, or organs has occurred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"effective amount\" refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat (including prevention) of a disease, disorder or unwanted physiological conditions in a mammal. In the present invention, an \"effective amount\" of an anti-IFN-α antibody may reduce, slow down or delay an autoimmune disorder such as IDDM or SLE; reduce, prevent or inhibit (\ni.e.\n, slow to some extent and preferably stop) the development of an autoimmune disorder such as IDDM or SLE; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with autoimmune disorders such as IDDM or SLE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the methods of the present invention, the term \"control\" and grammatical variants thereof, are used to refer to the prevention, partial or complete inhibition, reduction, delay or slowing down of an unwanted event, e.g. physiological condition, such as the generation of autoreactive T cells and development of autoimmunity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Treatment\" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those prone to have the disorder or those in which the disorder is to be prevented. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. \"Treatment\" can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Pharmaceutically acceptable\" carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are ones which are nontoxic to the cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages and concentrations employed. Often the physiologically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH buffered solution. Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as Tween™, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and Pluronics™.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Mammal\" for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, cats, cows, \netc.\n Preferably, the mammal is human.\n\n\n \nB. \nMethods for carrying out the \ninvention\n \n \n\n\n1. Generation of Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n(i) Polyclonal antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods of preparing polyclonal antibodies are known in the art. Polyclonal antibodies can be raised in a mammal, for example, by one or more injections of an immunizing agent and, if desired, an adjuvant. Typically, the immunizing agent and/or adjuvant will be injected in the mammal by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections. It may be useful to conjugate the immunizing agent to a protein known to be immunogenic in the mammal being immunized, such as serum albumin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor. Examples of adjuvants which may be employed include Freund's complete adjuvant and MPL-TDM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment, animals are immunized with a mixture of various, preferably all, IFN-α subtypes in order to generate anti-IFN-α antibodies with broad reactivity against IFN-α subtypes. In another preferred embodiment, animals are immunized with the mixture of human IFN-α subtypes that is present in the human lymphoblastoid interferons secreted by Burkitt lymphoma cells (Namalva cells) induced with Sendai virus, as described in Example 1 below. A suitable preparation of such human lymphoblastoid interferons can be obtained commercially (Product No. I-9887) from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO.\n\n\n \n\n\n(ii) Monoclonal antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by \nKohler et al., Nature 256: 495 (1975\n), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster or macaque monkey, is immunized as hereinabove described to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized \nin vitro.\n Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (\nGoding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103, [Academic Press, 1996\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOP-21 and MC.-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, California USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (\nKozbor, J. Immunol. 133: 3001 (1984\n); \nBrodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, [1987\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCulture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an \nin vitro\n binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of \nMunson et al., Anal. Biochem. 107: 220 (1980\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the cells may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (\nGoding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103, Academic Press, 1996\n). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, DMEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown \nin vivo\n as ascites tumors in an animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (\ne.g.\n, by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the monoclonal antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as \nE. coli\n cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (\nMorrison, et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 81: 6851 [1984\n]), or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. In that manner, \"chimeric\" or \"hybrid\" antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of an anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibody herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically such non-immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention, or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen-combining site having specificity for an IFN-α and another antigen-combining site having specificity for a different antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimeric or hybrid antibodies also may be prepared \nin vitro\n using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant production of antibodies will be described in more detail below.\n\n\n \n\n\n(iii) Humanized antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGenerally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a non-human source. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as \"import\" residues, which are typically taken from an \"import\" variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody (\nJones et al., Nature 321: 522-525 [1986\n]; \nRiechmann et al., Nature 332: 323-327 [1988\n]; \nVerhoeyen et al., Science 239: 1534-1536 [1988\n)]; reviewed in \nClark, Immunol. Today 21: 397-402 [2000\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, such \"humanized\" antibodies are chimeric antibodies (Cabilly, \nsupra\n), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and import sequence so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding. For further details, see \n \nU.S. patent No. 5,821,337\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\n(iv) Human antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAttempts to use the same technology for generating human mAbs have been hampered by the lack of a suitable human myeloma cell line. The best results were obtained using heteromyelomas (mouse x human hybrid myelomas) as fusion partners (\nKozbor, J. Immunol. 133: 3001 (1984\n); \nBrodeur, et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp.51-63, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987\n). Alternatively, human antibody-secreting cells can be immortalized by infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). However, EBV-infected cells are difficult to clone and usually produce only relatively low yields of immunoglobulin (\nJames and Bell, J. Immunol. Methods 100: 5-40 [1987\n]). In future, the immortalization of human B cells might possibly be achieved by introducing a defined combination of transforming genes. Such a possibility is highlighted by a recent demonstration that the expression of the telomerase catalytic subunit together with the SV40 large T oncoprotein and an oncogenic allele of H-\nras\n resulted in the tumorigenic conversion of normal human epithelial and fibroblast cells (\nHahn et al., Nature 400: 464-468 [1999\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g. mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production (\nJakobovits et al., Nature 362: 255-258 [1993\n]; \nLonberg and Huszar, Int. Rev. Immunol. 13: 65-93 [1995\n]; \nFishwild et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 14: 845-851 [1996\n]; \nMendez et al., Nat. Genet. 15: 146-156 [1997\n]; \nGreen, J. Immunol. Methods 231: 11-23 [1999\n]; \nTomizuka et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97: 722-727 [2000\n]; reviewed in \nLittle et al., Immunol. Today 21: 364-370 [2000\n]). For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region (J\nH\n) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production (\nJakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 2551-2555 [1993\n]). Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice results in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge (\nJakobovits et al., Nature 362: 255-258 [1993\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMendez et al. (Nature Genetics 15: 146-156 [1997\n]) have generated a line of transgenic mice designated as \"XenoMouse\n®\n II\" that, when challenged with an antigen, generates high affinity fully human antibodies. This was achieved by germ-line integration of megabase human heavy chain and light chain loci into mice with deletion into endogenous J\nH\n segment as described above. The XenoMouse\n®\n II harbors 1,020 kb of human heavy chain locus containing approximately 66 V\nH\n genes, complete D\nH\n and J\nH\n regions and three different constant regions (µ, δ and γ), and also harbors 800 kb of human κ locus containing 32 Vκ genes, Jκ segments and Cκ genes. The antibodies produced in these mice closely resemble that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and repertoire. The human antibodies are preferentially expressed over endogenous antibodies due to deletion in endogenous J\nH\n segment that prevents gene rearrangement in the murine locus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTomizuka et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97: 722-727 [2000\n]) have recently described generation of a double trans-chromosomic (Tc) mice by introducing two individual human chromosome fragments (hCFs), one containing the entire Ig heavy chain locus (\nIgH\n, ~1.5 Mb) and the other the entire κ light chain locus (\nIg\nκ, ~2 Mb) into a mouse strain whose endogenous \nIgH\n and \nIg\nκ loci were inactivated. These mice mounted antigen-specific human antibody response in the absence of mouse antibodies. The Tc technology may allow for the humanization of over megabase-sized, complex loci or gene clusters (such as those encoding T-cell receptors, major histocompatibility complex, P450 cluster etc) in mice or other animals. Another advantage of the method is the elimination of a need of cloning the large loci. This is a significant advantage since the cloning of over megabase-sized DNA fragments encompassing whole Ig loci remains difficult even with the use of yeast artificial chromosomes (\nPeterson et al., Trends Genet. 13: 61-66 [1997\n]; \nJacobovits, Curr. Biol. 4: 761-763 [1994\n]). Moreover, the constant region of the human \nIgH\n locus is known to contain sequences difficult to clone (\nKang and Cox, Genomics 35: 189-195 [1996\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the phage display technology can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments \nin vitro,\n from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors (\nMcCafferty et al., Nature 348: 552-553 [1990\n]; reviewed in \nKipriyanov and Little, Mol. Biotechnol. 12: 173-201 [1999\n]; \nHoogenboom and Chames, Immunol. Today 21: 371-378 [2000\n]). According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats (reviewed in \nJohnson and Chiswell, Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3: 564-571 [1993\n)]; \nWinter et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12: 433-455 [1994\n]; \nDall'Acqua and Carter, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 8: 443-450 [1998\n];\n Hoogenboom and Chames, Immunol. Today 21: 371-378 [2000\n]). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. \nClackson et al., (Nature 352: 624-628 [1991\n]) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597 (1991\n), or \nGriffiths et al., EMBO J. 12: 725-734 (1993\n). In a natural immune response, antibody genes accumulate mutations at a high rate (somatic hypermutation). Some of the changes introduced will confer higher affinity, and B cells displaying high-affinity surface immunoglobulin are preferentially replicated and differentiated during subsequent antigen challenge. This natural process can be mimicked by employing the technique known as \"chain shuffling\" (\nMarks et al., Bio/Technol. 10: 779-783 [1992\n]). In this method, the affinity of \"primary\" human antibodies obtained by phage display can be improved by sequentially replacing the heavy and light chain V region genes with repertoires of naturally occurring variants (repertoires) of V domain genes obtained from unimmunized donors. This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the nM range. A strategy for making very large phage antibody repertoires (also known as \"the mother-of all libraries\") has been described by \nWaterhouse et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 21: 2265-2266 (1993\n), and the isolation of a high affinity human antibody directly from such large phage library is reported by \nGriffiths et al., EMBO J. 13: 3245-3260 (1994\n). Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from rodent antibodies, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting rodent antibody. According to this method, which is also referred to as \"epitope imprinting\", the heavy or light chain V domain gene of rodent antibodies obtained by phage display technique is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating rodent-human chimeras. Selection on antigen results in isolation of human variable capable of restoring a functional antigen-binding site, i.e. the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining rodent V domain, a human antibody is obtained (see \n \nPCT patent application WO 93/06213, published 1 April 1993\n \n). Unlike traditional humanization of rodent antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies, which have no framework or CDR residues of rodent origin.\n\n\n \n(v) \nBispecific antibodies\n \n\n\n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies are monoclonal, preferably human or humanized, antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present case, one of the binding specificities is for an IFN-α to provide a neutralizing antibody, the other one is for any other antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities (\nMillstein and Cuello, Nature 305: 537-539 [1983\n]). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in \n \nPCT application publication No. WO 93/08829 (published 13 May 1993\n \n), and in \nTraunecker et al., EMBO J. 10: 3655-3659 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a different and more preferred approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance. In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, \nSuresh et al., Methods in Enzymology 121, 210 (1986\n):\n\n\n \n\n\n(vi) Heteroconjugate antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHeteroconjugate antibodies are also within the. scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,676,980\n \n), and for treatment of HIV infection (\n \nPCT application publication Nos. WO 91/00360\n \n and \n \nWO 92/200373\n \n; \n \nEP 03089\n \n). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,676,980\n \n, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.\n\n\n \n\n\n(vii) Antibody fragments\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibody (including murine, human and humanized antibodies, and antibody variants) is an antibody fragment. Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, \ne.g.,\n \nMorimoto et al., J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods 24:107-117 [1992\n] and \nBrennan et al., Science 229:81 [1985\n]). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells (reviewed in \nHudson, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 11: 548-557 [1999\n]; \nLittle et al., Immunol. Today 21: 364-370 [2000\n]). For example, Fab'-SH fragments can be directly recovered from \nE. coli\n and chemically coupled to form F(ab')\n2\n fragments (\nCarter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 [1992\n]). In another embodiment, the F(ab')\n2\n is formed using the leucine zipper GCN4 to promote assembly of the F(ab')\n2\n molecule. According to another approach, Fv, Fab or F(ab')\n2\n fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner.\n\n\n \n\n\n(viii) Amino acid sequence variants of antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence modification(s) of the anti-IFN-α antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the anti-IFN-α antibodies are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the nucleic acid encoding the anti-IFN-α antibody chains, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the anti-IFN-α antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of the anti-IFN-α antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called \"alanine scanning mutagenesis,\" as described by \nCunningham and Wells Science, 244:1081-1085 (1989\n). Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (\ne.g.\n, charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with the antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation \nper se\n need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed anti-IFN-α antibody variants are screened for the desired activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intra-sequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an anti-IFN-α neutralizing antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to an epitope tag. Other insertional variants of the anti-IFN-α antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody of an enzyme or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibody molecule removed and a different residue inserted in its place. Substitution mutagenesis may be performed in FR regions. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of \"preferred substitutions\". If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated \"exemplary substitutions\" in Table 1, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.\n\n \n \n \nTable 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOriginal Residue\n \n \n \nExemplary Substitutions\n \n \n \nPreferred Substitutions\n \n \n \n \n \nAla (A)\n \nval; leu; ile\n \nval\n \n \n \nArg (R)\n \nlys; gln; asn\n \nlys\n \n \n \nAsn (N)\n \ngln; his; asp, lys; arg\n \ngln\n \n \n \nAsp (D)\n \nglu; asn\n \nglu\n \n \n \nCys (C)\n \nser; ala\n \nser\n \n \n \nGln (Q)\n \nasn; glu\n \nasn\n \n \n \nGlu (E)\n \nasp; gln\n \nasp\n \n \n \nGly (G)\n \nala\n \nala\n \n \n \nHis (H)\n \nasn; gln; lys; arg\n \narg\n \n \n \nIle (I)\n \nleu; val; met; ala; phe; norleucine\n \nleu\n \n \n \nLeu (L)\n \nnorleucine; ile; val; met; ala; phe\n \nile\n \n \n \nLys (K)\n \narg; gln; asn\n \narg\n \n \n \nMet (M)\n \nleu; phe; ile\n \nleu\n \n \n \nPhe (F)\n \nleu; val; ile; ala; tyr\n \ntyr\n \n \n \nPro (P)\n \nala\n \nala\n \n \n \nSer (S)\n \nthr\n \nthr\n \n \n \nThr (T)\n \nser\n \nser\n \n \n \nTrp (W)\n \ntyr; phe\n \ntyr\n \n \n \nTyr (Y)\n \ntrp; phe; thr; ser\n \nphe\n \n \n \nVal (V)\n \nile; leu; met; phe; ala; norleucine\n \nleu\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n \n \n \n(1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile;\n \n(2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr;\n \n(3) acidic: asp, glu;\n \n(4) basic: asn, gln, his, lys, arg;\n \n(5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and\n \n(6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nNon-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibody also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as a Fv fragment).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA particularly preferred type of substitution variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitution variants is affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (e.g. 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g. antagonist activity) as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or in addition, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and TFN-α. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.\n\n\n \n\n\n(ix) Glycosylation Variants\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies are glycosylated at conserved positions in their constant regions (\nJefferis and Lund, Chem. Immunol. 65:111-128 [1997\n]; \nWright and Morrison, Trends Biotechnol. 15:26-32 [1997\n]). The oligosaccharide side chains of the immunoglobulins affect the protein's function (\nBoyd et al., Mol. Immunol. 32:1311-1318 [1996\n]; \nWittwe and Howard, Biochem. 29:4175-4180 [1990\n]), and the intramolecular interaction between portions of the glycoprotein which can affect the conformation and presented three-dimensional surface of the glycoprotein (Jefferis and Lund, \nsupra\n; \nWyss and Wagner, Current Opin. Biotech. 7:409-416 [1996\n]). Oligosaccharides may also serve to target a given glycoprotein to certain molecules based upon specific recognition structures. For example, it has been reported that in agalactosylated IgG, the oligosaccharide moiety 'flips' out of the inter-CH2 space and terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues become available to bind mannose binding protein (\nMalhotra et al., Nature Med. 1:237-243 [1995\n]). Removal by glycopeptidase of the oligosaccharides from CAMPATH-1H (a recombinant humanized murine monoclonal IgG1 antibody which recognizes the CDw52 antigen of human lymphocytes) produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells resulted in a complete reduction in complement mediated lysis (CMCL) (\nBoyd et al., Mol. Immunol. 32:1311-1318 [1996\n]), while selective removal of sialic acid residues using neuraminidase resulted in no loss of DMCL. Glycosylation of antibodies has also been reported to affect antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In particular, CHO cells with tetracycline-regulated expression of β(1,4)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), a glycosyltransferase catalyzing formation of bisecting GlcNAc, was reported to have improved ADCC activity (\nUmana et al., Mature Biotech. 17:176-180 [1999\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycosylation variants of antibodies are variants in which the glycosylation pattern of an antibody is altered. By altering is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, adding one or more carbohydrate moieties to the antibody, changing the composition of glycosylation (glycosylation pattern), the extent of glycosylation, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites). Similarly, removal of glycosylation sites can be accomplished by amino acid alteration within the native glycosylation sites of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequence is usually altered by altering the underlying nucleic acid sequence. Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the anti-IFN-α antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the anti-IFN-α antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glycosylation (including glycosylation pattern) of antibodies may also be altered without altering the amino acid sequence or the underlying nucleotide sequence. Glycosylation largely depends on the host cell used to express the antibody. Since the cell type used for expression of recombinant glycoproteins, e.g. antibodies, as potential therapeutics is rarely the native cell, significant variations in the glycosylation pattern of the antibodies can be expected (see, e.g. \nHse et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272:9062-9070 [1997\n]). In addition to the choice of host cells, factors which affect glycosylation during recombinant production of antibodies include growth mode, media formulation, culture density, oxygenation, pH, purification schemes and the like. Various methods have been proposed to alter the glycosylation pattern achieved in a particular host organism including introducing or overexpressing certain enzymes involved in oligosaccharide production (\n \nU. S. Patent Nos. 5,047,335\n \n; \n \n5,510,261\n \n and \n \n5.278,299\n \n). Glycosylation, or certain types of glycosylation, can be enzymatically removed from the glycoprotein, for example using endoglycosidase H (Endo H). In addition, the recombinant host cell can be genetically engineered, e.g. make defective in processing certain types of polysaccharides. These and similar techniques are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glycosylation structure of antibodies can be readily analyzed by conventional techniques of carbohydrate analysis, including lectin chromatography, NMR, Mass spectrometry, HPLC, GPC, monosaccharide compositional analysis, sequential enzymatic digestion, and HPAEC-PAD, which uses high pH anion exchange chromatography to separate oligosaccharides based on charge. Methods for releasing oligosaccharides for analytical purposes are also known, and include, without limitation, enzymatic treatment (commonly performed using peptide-N-glycosidase F/endo-β-galactosidase), elimination using harsh alkaline environment to release mainly O-linked structures, and chemical methods using anhydrous hydrazine to release both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides.\n\n\n \n\n\n(x) Other modifications of antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in \nEpstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:3688 (1985\n); \nHwang et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 77:4030 (1980\n); and \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045\n \n and \n \n4,544,545\n \n. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,013,556\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab' fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in \nMartin et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257:286-288 (1982\n) via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent (such as Doxorubicin) is optionally contained within the liposome. See \nGabizon et al., J. National Cancer Inst. 81(19):1484 (1989\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody of the present invention may also be used in ADEPT by conjugating the antibody to a prodrug-activating enzyme which converts a prodrug (\ne.g\n., a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent, see \n \nWO81/01145\n \n) to an active drug. See, for example, \n \nWO 88/07378\n \n and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,975,278\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active form exhibiting the desired biological properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include, but are not limited to, alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; cytosine deaminase useful for converting non-toxic 5-fluorocytosine into the anti-cancer drug, 5-fluorouracil; proteases, such as serratia protease, thermolysin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidases and cathepsins (such as cathepsins B and L), that are useful for converting peptide-containing prodrugs into free drugs; D-alanylcarboxypeptidases, useful for converting prodrugs that contain D-amino acid substituents; carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes such as β-galactosidase and neuraminidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs; β-lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with β-lactams into free drugs; and penicillin amidases, such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase, useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups, respectively, into free drugs. Alternatively, antibodies with enzymatic activity, also known in the art as \"abzymes\", can be used to convert prodrugs into free active drugs (see, \ne.g.\n, \nMassey, Nature 328:457-458 (1987\n)). Antibody-abzyme conjugates can be prepared as described herein for delivery of the abzyme to a desired cell population.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enzymes can be covalently bound to the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies by techniques well known in the art such as the use of the heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents discussed above. Alternatively, fusion proteins comprising at least the antigen binding region of an antibody of the invention linked to at least a functionally active portion of an enzyme of the invention can be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art (\nsee\n, \ne.g.\n, \nNeuberger et al., Nature 312:604-608 [1984\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, it may be desirable to use an antibody fragment, rather than an intact antibody. In this case, it may be desirable to modify the antibody fragment in order to increase its serum half-life. This may be achieved, for example, by incorporation of a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody fragment (\ne.g\n., by mutation of the appropriate region in the antibody fragment or by incorporating the epitope into a peptide tag that is then fused to the antibody fragment at either end or in the middle, \ne.g\n., by DNA or peptide synthesis). See \n \nWO96/32478 published October 17, 1996\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe salvage receptor binding epitope generally constitutes a region wherein any one or more amino acid residues from one or two loops of a Fc domain are transferred to an analogous position of the antibody fragment. Even more preferably, three or more residues from one or two loops of the Fc domain are transferred. Still more preferred, the epitope is taken from the CH2 domain of the Fc region (\ne.g.\n, of an IgG) and transferred to the CH1, CH3, or V\nH\n region, or more than one such region, of the antibody. Alternatively, the epitope is taken from the CH2 domain of the Fc region and transferred to the C\nL\n region or V\nL\n region, or both, of the antibody fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCovalent modifications of the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies are also included within the scope of this invention. They may be made by chemical synthesis or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of the antibody, if applicable. Other types of covalent modifications of the antibody are introduced into the molecule by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the antibody with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues. Exemplary covalent modifications of polypeptides are described in \n \nUS Patent 5,534,615\n \n. A preferred type of covalent modification of the antibody comprises linking the antibody to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, \ne.g\n., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner set forth in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 4,640,835\n \n; \n \n4,496,689\n \n; \n \n4,301,144\n \n; \n \n4,670,417\n \n; \n \n4,791,192\n \n or \n \n4,179,337\n \n.\n\n\n \n2. Screening for antibodies with the desired properties\n\n\n \n \n \nTechniques for generating antibodies have been described above. Anti-IFN-α antibodies with the desired, broad range neutralizing properties can then be identified by methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n\n\n(i) Binding assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThus, for example, neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies can be identified in IFN-α binding assays, by incubating a candidate antibody with one or more individual IFN-α subtypes, or an array or mixture of various IFN-α subtypes, and monitoring binding and neutralization of a biological activity of IFN-α. The binding assay may be performed with purified IFN-α polypeptide(s). The binding assay may be a competitive binding assay, where the ability of a candidate antibody to compete with a known anti-IFN-α antibody for IFN-α binding is evaluated. The assay may be performed in various formats, including the ELISA format, also illustrated in the Examples below. IFN-α binding of a candidate antibody may also be monitored in a BIAcore\n™\n Biosensor assay, as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable competition binding assay known in the art can be used to characterize the ability of a candidate anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibody to compete with murine anti-human IFN-α monoclonal antibody 9F3 for binding to a particular IFN-α species. A routine competition assay is described in \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988\n). In another embodiment, the IFN-α-binding ELISA assay described in Example 2 below could be modified to employ IFN-α binding competition between a candidate antibody and the 9F3 antibody. Such an assay could be performed by layering the IFN-α on microtiter plates, incubating the layered plates with serial dilutions of unlabeled anti-IFN-α antibody or unlabeled control antibody admixed with a selected concentration of labeled 9F3 antibody, detecting and measuring the signal from the 9F3 antibody label, and then comparing the signal measurements exhibited by the various dilutions of antibody.\n\n\n \n\n\n(ii) Antiviral Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of a candidate antibody to neutralize a biological activity of IFN-α can, for example, be carried out by monitoring the neutralization of the antiviral activity of IFN-α as described by \nKawade, J. Interferon Res. 1:61-70 (1980\n), or \nKawade and Watanabe, J. Interferon Res. 4:571-584 (1984\n). Briefly, a fixed concentration of IFN-α premixed with various dilutions of a candidate antibody is added to human amnion-derived FL cells, and the ability of the candidate antibody to neutralize the antiviral activity of IFN-α is determined, using an appropriate virus, e.g. Sindbis virus. The titers are expressed in international units (IU), as determined with the international reference human IFN-α (NIH Ga23-901-527).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe candidate anti-IFN-α antibody is considered able to inhibit the anti-viral activity of a selected IFN-α subtype if a certain concentration of the antibody inhibits more anti-viral activity than the baseline level of anti-viral activity inhibition measured in the presence of an equivalent concentration of control antibody. Optionally, the certain concentration of the candidate anti-IFN-α antibody will inhibit at least or about 60%, or at least or about 70%, preferably at least or about 75%, or more preferably at least or about 80%, or even more preferably at least or about 85%, or still more preferably at least or about 90%, or still more preferably at least or about 95%, or most preferably at least or about 99% of the anti-viral activity of the selected IFN-α subtype in the anti-viral activity assay as compared to baseline activity measured in the presence of an equivalent concentration of control antibody. The candidate anti-IFN-α antibody is considered unable to inhibit the anti-viral activity of a selected IFN-α subtype if there is no concentration of the antibody that exhibits more anti-viral activity inhibition than the baseline level of anti-viral activity inhibition measured in the presence of an equivalent concentration of control antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach interferon species used in the viral infectivity assay may be titrated to a concentration that provides the same level of inhibition of viral growth as that induced by a preselected number of units of an IFN-α standard. This concentration serves to provide the normalized units of the subject interferon species. In order to assess the ability of an anti-IFN-α antibody to inhibit the anti-viral activity of various IFN-α subtypes, the effective concentration (EC50) of anti-IFN-α antibody for inhibiting 50% of a particular IFN-α subtype's anti-viral activity (at the concentration titrated to provide the normalized units of activity) is determined for each IFN-α subtype to be tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antiviral activity neutralization assay may be performed as described in Example 1 below. Briefly, A549 cells are grown to a density of 5x10\n5\n A549 cells/well on 96-well microtiter plates. Serial dilutions of candidate anti-IFN-α antibody are incubated with 0.2 units/:1 of a selected IFN-α subtype (normalized to 0.2 units/:1 of NIH reference standard recombinant human IFN-α2) in a total volume of 100 :1 at 37EC for one hour. Each 100 :1 volume of antibody/interferon incubation mixture is then added to 5x10\n5\n A549 cells and 100 :1 of culture medium in an individual well on the microtiter plate, yielding a final IFN-α concentration of 100 units/ml in each well. The resulting cell culture mixtures are incubated for 24 hours at 37EC. Cells are then challenged with 2x10\n5\n pfu of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus and incubated for an additional 24 hours at 37EC. At the end of the incubation, cell viability is determined by visual microscopic examination or crystal violet staining. The effective concentration (EC50) of a candidate IFN-α antibody for inhibiting 50% of a particular IFN-α subtype's anti-viral activity in the assay is determined for each IFN-α subtype to be tested.\n\n\n \n\n\n(iii) Cross-blocking Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo screen for antibodies which bind to an epitope on IFN-α bound by an antibody of interest, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in \nAntibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988\n), can be performed. Alternatively, or additionally, epitope mapping can be performed by methods known in the art. For example, the IFN-α epitope bound by a monoclonal antibody of the present invention can be determined by competitive binding analysis as described in \nFendly et al. Cancer Research 50:1550 -1558 (1990\n). In another example, cross-blocking studies can be done with direct fluorescence on microtiter plates. In this method, the monoclonal antibody of interest is conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FIFC), using established procedures (\nWofsy et al. Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology, p. 287, Mishel and Schiigi (eds.) San Francisco: W.J. Freeman Co. (1980\n)). The selected IFN-α is layered onto the wells of microtiter plates, the layered wells are incubated with mixtures of (1) FITC-labeled monoclonal antibody of interest and (2) unlabeled test monoclonal antibody, and the fluorescence in each well is quantitated to determine the level of cross-blocking exhibited by the antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are considered to share an epitope if each blocks binding of the other by 50% or greater in comparison to an irrelevant monoclonal antibody control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results obtained in the cell-based biological assays can then be followed by testing in animal, e.g. murine, models, and human clinical trials. If desired, murine monoclonal antibodies identified as having the desired properties can be converted into chimeric antibodies, or humanized by techniques well known in the art, including the \"gene conversion mutagenesis\" strategy, as described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,821,337\n \n. Humanization of a particular anti-IFN-α antibody herein is also described in the Examples below.\n\n\n \n\n\n(iv) Phage Display Method\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-IFN-α antibodies can be identified by using combinatorial libraries to screen for synthetic antibody clones with the desired activity or activities. In principle, synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments (e.g. Fab, F(ab')\n2\n, etc.) of antibody variable region (Fv) fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of ' binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non-binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen, and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption/elution. Anti-IFN-α antibodies can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a full length anti-IFN-α antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region (Fc) sequences described in Kabat \net al.\n (1991), \nsupra.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nConstruction of phage display libraries\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antigen-binding domain of an antibody is formed from two variable (V) regions of about 110 amino acids each, from the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains, that both present three hypervariable loops or complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments, in which VH and VL are covalently linked through a short, flexible peptide, or as or D(ab')\n2\n fragments, in which they are each fused to a constant domain and interact non-covalently, as described in \nWinter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994\n). As used herein, scFv encoding phage clones and Fab or F(ab')\n2\n encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as \"Fv phage clones\" or \"Fv clones\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe naive repertoire of an animal (the repertoire before antigen challenge) provides it with antibodies that can bind with moderate affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of about 10\n6\n to 10\n7\n M\n-1\n) to essentially any non-self molecule. The sequence diversity of antibody binding sites is not encoded directly in the germline but is assembled in a combinatorial manner from V gene segments. In human heavy chains, the first two hypervariable loops (H1 and H2) are drawn from less than 50 VH gene segments, which are combined with D segments and JH segments to create the third hypervariable loop (H3). In human light chains, the first two hypervariable loops (L1 and L2) and much of the third (L3) are drawn from less than approximately 30 V8 and less than approximately 30 V6 segments to complete the third hypervariable loop (L3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach combinatorial rearrangement of V-gene segments in stem cells gives rise to a B cell that expresses a single VH-VL combination. Immunizations triggers any B cells making a combination that binds the immunogen to proliferate (clonal expansion) and to secrete the corresponding antibody. These naive antibodies are then matured to high affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of 10\n9\n-10\n10\n M\n-1\n) by a process of mutagenesis and selection known as affinity maturation. It is after this point that cells are normally removed to prepare hybridomas and generate high-affinity monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt three stages of this process, repertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and recombined randomly in phage libraries, which can then be searched for antigen-binding clones as described in \nWinter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994\n). Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by \nGriffiths et al., EMBO J, 12: 725-734 (1993\n). Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning the unrearranged V- or VIII-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by \nHoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage display mimics the B cell. Filamentous phage is used to display antibody fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIII. The antibody fragments can be displayed as single chain Fv fragments, in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer, e.g. as described by \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991\n), or as Fab (including F(ab')\n2\n) fragments, in which one chain is fused to pIII and the other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab-coat protein structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type coat proteins, e.g. as described in \nHoogenboom et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 19: 4133-4137 (1991\n). When antibody fragments are fused to the N-terminus of pIII, the phage is infective. However, if the N-terminal domain of pIII is excised and fusions made to the second domain, the phage is not infective, and wild type pIII must be provided by helper phage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pIII fusion and other proteins of the phage can be encoded entirely within the same phage replicon, or on different replicons. When two replicons are used, the pIII fusion is encoded on a phagemid, a plasmid containing a phage origin of replication. Phagemids can be packaged into phage particles by \"rescue\" with a helper phage such as M13K07 that provides all the phage proteins, including pIII, but due to a defective origin is itself poorly packaged in competitions with the phagemids as described in \nVieira and Messing, Meth. Enzymol., 153: 3-11 (1987\n). In a preferred method, the phage display system is designed such that the recombinant phage can be grown in host cells under conditions permitting no more than a minor amount of phage particles to display more than one copy of the Fv-coat protein fusion on the surface of the particle as described in \nBass et al., Proteins, 8: 309-314 (1990\n) and in \n \nWO 92/09690\n \n (\n \nPCT/US91/09133 published June 11, 1992\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of anti-IFN-α clones is desired, the subject is immunized with IFN-α to generate an antibody response, and spleen cells and/or circulating B cells other peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) are recovered for library construction. In a preferred embodiment, a human antibody gene fragment library biased in favor of anti-human IFN-α clones is obtained by generating an anti-human IFN-α antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene array (and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system) such that IFN-α immunization gives rise to B cells producing human-sequence antibodies against IFN-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimals may be immunized with a mixture of various, preferably all, IFN-α subtypes in order to generate an antibody response that includes B cells producing anti-IFN-α antibodies with broad reactivity against IFN-α subtypes. Animals may be immunized with the mixture of human IFN-α subtypes that is present in the human lymphoblastoid interferons secreted by Burkitt lymphoma cells (Namalva cells) induced with Sendai virus, as described in Example 1 below. A suitable preparation of such human lymphoblastoid interferons can be obtained commercially (Product No. I-9887) from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional enrichment for anti-IFN-α reactive cell populations can be obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing IFN-α-specific membrane bound antibody, e.g., by cell separation with IFN-α affinity chromatography or adsorption of cells to fluorochrome-labeled IFN-α followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the use of spleen cells and/or B cells or other PBLs from an unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire, and also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal (human or non-human) species in which IFN-α is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating \nin vitro\n antibody gene construction, stem cells are harvested from the subject to provide nucleic acids encoding unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a variety of animal species, such as human, mouse, rat, lagomorpha, luprine, canine, feline, porcine, bovine, equine, and avian species, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments (including VH and VL segments) are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of rearranged VH and VL gene libraries, the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers matching the 5' and 3' ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in \nOrlandi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 86: 3833-3837 (1989\n), thereby making diverse V gene repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA, with back primers at the 5' end of the exon encoding the mature V-domain and forward primers based within the J-segment as described in Orlandi \net al.\n (1989) and in \nWard et al., Nature, 341: 544-546 (1989\n). However, for amplifying from cDNA, back primers can also be based in the leader exon as described in \nJones et al., Biotechnol., 9: 88-89 (1991\n), and forward primers within the constant region as described in \nSastry et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 86: 5728-5732 (1989\n). To maximize complementarity, degeneracy can be incorporated in the primers as described in Orlandi \net al.\n (1989) or Sastry \net al.\n (1989). Preferably, the library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each V-gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the immune cell nucleic acid sample, e.g. as described in the method of \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991\n) or as described in the method of \nOrum et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 21: 4491-4498 (1993\n). For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors, rare restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in Orlandi \net al.\n (1989), or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V gene segments. Most of the human VH-gene segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in \nTomlinson et al., J. Mol. Biol., 227: 776-798 (1992\n)), and mapped (reported in \nMatsuda et al., Nature Genet., 3: 88-94 (1993\n); these cloned segments (including all the major conformations of the H1 and H2 loop) can be used to generate diverse VH gene repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described in \nHoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992\n). VH repertoires can also be made with all the sequence diversity focussed in a long H3 loop of a single length as described in \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89: 4457-4461 (1992\n). Human V6 and V8 segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in \nWilliams and Winter, Eur. J. Immunol., 23: 1456-1461 (1993\n)) and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires. Synthetic V gene repertoires, based on a range of VH and VL folds, and L3 and H3 lengths, will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V-gene encoding DNAs, germline V-gene segments can be rearranged \nin vitro\n according to the methods of \nHoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different vectors, and the vectors recombined \nin vitro,\n e.g., as described in \nHogrefe et al., Gene, 128: 119-126 (1993\n), or \nin vivo\n by combinatorial infection, e.g., the loxP system described in \nWaterhouse et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 21: 2265-2266 (1993\n). The \nin vivo\n recombination approach exploits the two-chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size imposed by \nE\n. \ncoli\n transformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned separately, one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then combined by phage infection of phagemid-containing bacteria so that each cell contains a different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present (about 10\n12\n clones). Both vectors contain \nin vivo\n recombination signals so that the VH and VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co-packaged into phage virions. These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of about 10\n-8\n M).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector, e.g. as described in \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88: 7978-7982 (1991\n), or assembled together by PCR and then cloned, e.g. as described in \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n). PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv (scFv) repertoires. In yet another technique, \"in cell PCR assembly\" is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in \nEmbleton et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 20: 3831-3837 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies produced by naive libraries (either natural or synthetic) can be of moderate affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of about 10\n6\n to 10\n7\n M\n-1\n), but affinity maturation can also be mimicked \nin vitro\n by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in Winter \net al.\n (1994), \nsupra.\n For example, mutation can be introduced at random in vitro by using error-prone polymerase (reported in \nLeung et al., Technique, 1: 11-15 (1989\n)) in the method of \nHawkins et al., J. Mol. Biol., 226: 889-896 (1992\n) or in the method of \nGram et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 89: 3576-3580 (1992\n). Additionally, affinity maturation can be performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs, e.g. using PCR with primers carrying random sequence spanning the CDR of interest, in selected individual Fv clones and screening for higher affinity clones. \n \nWO 9607754 (published 14 March 1996\n \n) described a method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in \nMarks et al., Biotechnol., 10: 779-783 (1992\n). This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the 10\n-9\n M range.\n\n\n \n\n\nPanning Phage Display Libraries for Anti-IFN-α Clones\n\n\n\n\na. Synthesis of IFN-α\n\n\n \n \n \nNucleic acid sequence encoding the IFN-α subtypes used herein can be designed using published amino acid and nucleic acid sequences of interferons, e.g. see the \nJ.

These methods include, but are not limited to, chemical synthesis by any of the methods described in \nEngels et al., Agnew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 28: 716-734 (1989\n), such as the triester, phosphite, phosphoramidite and H-phosphonate methods. In one embodiment, codons preferred by the expression host cell are used in the design of the interferon-encoding DNA. Alternatively, DNA encoding the interferon can be isolated from a genomic or cDNA library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing construction of the DNA molecule encoding the interferon of interest, the DNA molecule is operably linked to an expression control sequence in an expression vector, such as a plasmid, wherein the control sequence is recognized by a host cell transformed with the vector. In general, plasmid vectors contain replication and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as sequences which encode proteins that are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor expression in prokaryotic hosts, suitable vectors include pBR322 (ATCC No. 37,017), phGH107 (ATCC No. 40,011), pBO475, pS0132, pRIT5, any vector in the pRIT20 or pRIT30 series (\nNilsson and Abrahmsen, Meth. Enzymol., 185: 144-161 (1990\n)), pRIT2T, pKK233-2, pDR540 and pPL-lambda. Prokaryotic host cells containing the expression vectors suitable for use herein include \nE\n. \ncoli\n K12 strain 294 (ATCC NO. 31446), \nE coli\n strain JM101 (\nMessing et al., Nucl. Acid Res., 9: 309 (1981\n)), \nE. coli\n strain B, \nE. coli\n strain Π1776 (ATCC No. 31537), \nE. coli\n c600 (\nAppleyard, Genetics, 39: 440 (1954\n)), \nE. coli\n W3110 (F-, gamma-, prototrophic, ATCC No. 27325), \nE. coli\n strain 27C7 (W3110, \ntonA, phoA E15, (argF-lac)169, ptr3, degP41, ompT, kan\n \nr\n) (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,288,931\n \n, ATCC No. 55,244), \nBacillus subtilis\n, \nSalmonella typhimurium\n, \nSerratia marcesans\n, and \nPseudomonas\n species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic organisms, such as yeasts, or cells derived from multicellular organisms can be used as host cells. For expression in yeast host cells, such as common baker's yeast or \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n, suitable vectors include episomally replicating vectors based on the 2-micron plasmid, integration vectors, and yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vectors. For expression in insect host cells, such as Sf9 cells, suitable vectors include baculoviral vectors. For expression in plant host cells, particularly dicotyledonous plant hosts, such as tobacco, suitable expression vectors include vectors derived from the Ti plasmid of \nAgrobacterium tumefaciens\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, interest has been greatest in vertebrate host cells. Examples of useful mammalian host cells include monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, \nGraham et al., J. Gen Virol., 36: 59 (1977\n)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/-DHFR (\nCHO, Urlaub and Chasin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77: 4216 (1980\n)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, \nMather, Biol. Reprod., 23: 243-251 (1980\n)); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (\nMather et al., Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci., 383: 44-68 (1982\n)); MRC 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma cell line (Hep G2). For expression in mammalian host cells, useful vectors include vectors derived from SV40, vectors derived from cytomegalovirus such as the pRK vectors, including pRK5 and pRK7 (\nSuva et al., Science, 237: 893-896 (1987\n), \n \nEP 307,247 (3/15/89\n \n), \n \nEP 278,776 (8/17/88\n \n)) vectors derived from vaccinia viruses or other pox viruses, and retroviral vectors such as vectors derived from Moloney's murine leukemia virus (MoMLV).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, the DNA encoding the interferon of interest is operably linked to a secretory leader sequence resulting in secretion of the expression product by the host cell into the culture medium. Examples of secretory leader sequences include stII, ecotin, lamB, herpes GD, lpp, alkaline phosphatase, invertase, and alpha factor. Also suitable for use herein is the 36 amino acid leader sequence of protein A (\nAbrahmsen et al., EMBO J., 4: 3901 (1985\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells are transfected and preferably transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors of this invention and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransfection refers to the taking up of an expression vector by a host cell whether or not any coding sequences are in fact expressed. Numerous methods of transfection are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, for example, CaPO\n4\n precipitation and electroporation. Successful transfection is generally recognized when any indication of the operation of this vector occurs within the host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformation means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride, as described in section 1.82 of \nSambrook et al., Molecular Cloning (2nd ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY (1989\n), is generally used for prokaryotes or other cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers. Infection with \nAgrobacterium tumefaciens\n is used for transformation of certain plant cells, as described by \nShaw et al., Gene, 23: 315 (1983\n) and \n \nWO 89/05859 published 29 June 1989\n \n. For mammalian cells without such cell walls, the calcium phosphate precipitation method described in sections 16.30-16.37 of Sambrook \net al., supra,\n is preferred. General aspects of mammalian cell host system transformations have been described by Axel in \n \nU.S. 4,399,216 issued 16 August 1983\n \n. Transformations into yeast are typically carried out according to the method of \nVan Solingen et al., J. Bact., 130: 946 (1977\n) and \nHsiao et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 76: 3829 (1979\n). However, other methods for introducing DNA into cells such as by nuclear injection, electroporation, or by protoplast fusion may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProkaryotic host cells used to produce the interferon of interest can be cultured as described generally in Sambrook \net al.\n, \nsupra\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mammalian host cells used to produce the interferon of interest can be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in \nHam and Wallace, Meth. Enz., 58: 44 (1979\n), \nBarnes and Sato, Anal. Biochem., 102: 255 (1980\n), \n \nU.S. 4,767,704\n \n; \n \n4,657,866\n \n; \n \n4,927,762\n \n; or \n \n4,560,655\n \n; \n \nWO 90/03430\n \n; \n \nWO 87/00195\n \n; \n \nU.S. Pat. Re. 30,985\n \n; or \n \nU.S. 5,122,469\n \n, the disclosures of all of which are incorporated herein by reference, may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleosides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as Gentamycin\n™\n drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe host cells referred to in this disclosure encompass cells in \nin vitro\n culture as well as cells that are within a host animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an intracellular expression system or periplasmic space secretion system, the recombinantly expressed interferon protein can be recovered from the culture cells by disrupting the host cell membrane/cell wall (e.g. by osmotic shock or solubilizing the host cell membrane in detergent). Alternatively, in an extracellular secretion system, the recombinant protein can be recovered from the culture medium. As a first step, the culture medium or lysate is centrifuged to remove any particulate cell debris. The membrane and soluble protein fractions are then separated. Usually, the interferon is purified from the soluble protein fraction. If the IFN-α is expressed as a membrane bound species, the membrane bound peptide can be recovered from the membrane fraction by solubilization with detergents. The crude peptide extract can then be further purified by suitable procedures such as fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns; ethanol precipitation; reverse phase HPLC; chromatography on silica or on a cation exchange resin such as DEAE; chromatofocusing; SDS-PAGE; ammonium sulfate precipitation; gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75; hydrophobic affinity resins and ligand affinity using interferon receptor immobilized on a matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany of the human IFN-α used herein can be obtained from commercial sources, e.g. from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corporation (San Diego, CA) or ACCURATE Chemical & Scientific Corporation (Westbury, NY).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStandard cloning procedures described in \nManiatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989\n) are used to construct plasmids that direct the translocation of the various species of hIFN-α into the periplasmic space of \nE. coli\n. PCR reactions are performed on cDNA clones of the various subspecies of hIFN-α disclosed in \nGoeddel et al., Nature 290: 20-26 (1981\n) with Nsil and StyI restriction sites added to the primers. These PCR products are then subcloned into the corresponding sites of the expression vector pB0720 described in \nCunningham et al., Science 243:1330-1336 (1989\n). The resulting plasmids place production of the hIFN-α subtypes under control of the \nE\n. \ncoli phoA\n promoter and the heat-stable enterotoxin II signal peptide as described in \nChang et al., Gene 55: 189-196 (1987\n). The correct DNA sequence of each gene is confirmed using the United States Biochemical Sequenase Kit version 2.0. Each plasmid is transformed into the \nE\n. \ncoli\n strain 27C7 (ATCC # 55244) and grown in 10 liter fermentors as described in \nCarter et al., Bio/Technology 10: 163-167\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1992). Human hIFNs are purified from \nE\n. \ncoli\n paste containing each IFN-α by affinity chromatography. Bacterial cells are lysed, and the lysate is centrifuged at 10,000 x g to remove debris. The supernatant is applied to an immunoaffinity column containing a mouse anti-hIFN-αB antibody (LI-1) that is obtained as described in \nStaehelin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 78:1848-1852 (1981\n). LI-1 is immobilized on controlled pore glass by a modification of the method of \nRoy et al., Journal of Chromatography, 303: 225-228\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1984). The bound interferon is eluted from the column with 0.1 M citrate, pH 3.0, containing 20% (w/v) glycerol. The purified IFN is analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, and is assayed for bioactivity by the hIFN-induced anti-viral assay as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman IFN-α2/1 hybrid molecule (IFN-α2\n1-62\n/α\n64-166\n) was obtained as described in \nRehberg et al., J. Biol. Chem., 257: 11497-11502 (1992\n) or \nHorisberger and Marco, Pharmac. Ther., 66: 507-534 (1995\n).\n\n\n \nb. Immobilization of IFN-α\n\n\n \n \n \nThe purified IFN-α can be attached to a suitable matrix such as agarose beads, acrylamide beads, glass beads, cellulose, various acrylic copolymers, hydroxyl methacrylate gels, polyacrylic and polymethacrylic copolymers, nylon, neutral and ionic carriers, and the like, for use in the affinity chromatographic separation of phage display clones. Attachment of the IFN-α protein to the matrix can be accomplished by the methods described in \nMethods in Enzymology, vol. 44 (1976\n). A commonly employed technique for attaching protein ligands to polysaccharide matrices, e.g. agarose, dextran or cellulose, involves activation of the carrier with cyanogen halides and subsequent coupling of the peptide ligand's primary aliphatic or aromatic amines to the activated matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, IFN-α can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates, expressed on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting, or conjugated to biotin for capture with streptavidin-coated beads, or used in any other art-known method for panning phage display libraries.\n\n\n \nc. Panning Procedures\n\n\n \n \n \nThe phage library samples are contacted with immobilized IFN-α under conditions suitable for binding of at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent. Normally, the conditions, including pH, ionic strength, temperature and the like are selected to mimic physiological conditions. The phage bound to the solid phase are washed and then eluted by acid, e.g. as described in \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 88: 7978-7982 (1991\n), or by alkali, e.g. as described in \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991\n), or by IFN-α antigen, e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method \nof\n \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n). Phage can be enriched 20-1,000-fold in a single round of selection. Moreover, the enriched phage can be grown in bacterial culture and subjected to further rounds of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage may be serially incubated with various IFN-α subtypes immobilized in order to identify and further characterize phage clones that exhibit appreciable binding to a majority, preferably all, of IFN-α subtypes. In this method, phage are first incubated with one specific IFN-α subtype. The phage bound to this subtype are eluted and subjected to selection with another IFN-α subtype. The process of binding and elution is thus repeated with all IFN-α subtypes. At the end, the procedure yields a population of phage displaying antibodies with broad reactivity against all IFN-α subtypes. These phage can then be tested against other IFN species, i.e. other than IFN-α, in order to select those clones which do not show appreciable binding to other species of IFNs. Finally, the selected phage clones can be examined for their ability to neutralize biological activity, e.g. anti-viral activity, of various IFN-α subtypes, and clones representing antibodies with broad neutralization activity against a majority, preferably all, of IFN-α subtypes are finally selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe efficiency of selection depends on many factors, including the kinetics of dissociation during washing, and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics (and weak binding affinities) can be retained by use of short washes, multivalent phage display and high coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage through multivalent interactions, but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics (and good binding affinities) can be promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in \nBass et al., Proteins, 8: 309-314 (1990\n) and in \n \nWO 92/09690\n \n, and a low coating density of antigen as described in \nMarks et al., Biotechnol., 10: 779-783 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities, even with affinities that differ slightly, for IFN-α. However, random mutation of a selected antibody (e.g. as performed in some of the affinity maturation techniques described above) is likely to give rise to many mutants, most binding to antigen, and a few with higher affinity. With limiting IFN-α, rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all the higher affinity mutants, phage can be incubated with excess biotinylated IFN-α, but with the biotinylated IFN-α at a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for IFN-α. The high affinity-binding phage can then be captured by streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. Such \"equilibrium capture\" allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of binding, with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two-fold higher affinity from a great excess of phage with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing phage bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of dissociation kinetics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage may be serially incubated with various IFN-α subtypes immobilized on a solid support, such as chromatographic polymer matrix beads described above. In this method, the phage are first incubated with one specific IFN-α subtype. The phage bound to this subtype are eluted from solid phase with a suitable eluent, such as any salt or acid buffer capable of releasing the bound phage into solution. Next, the eluted phage clones are subjected to selection with another IFN-α subtype. In order to enrich the population for clones that compete with soluble IFNAR2 for binding to IFN-α, the phage clones recovered from the series of IFN-α subtype chromatographic separations are incubated with a complex of immobilized IFNAR2 preadsorbed to IFN-α, and the non-adsorbed phage clones are recovered from the incubation reaction mixture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe selection procedures can be designed to utilize any suitable batch chromatographic technique. In one embodiment, the phage clones are adsorbed to IFN-α-derivatized polymer matrix beads in suspension, the adsorbed beads are recovered by centrifugation, the recovered beads are resuspended and incubated in a suitable elution buffer, such as any salt or acid buffer capable of releasing the bound phage into solution, the elution mixture is centrifuged, the eluted phage clones are recovered from the supernatant, and then the adsorption/elution procedure is repeated for every additional IFN-α subtype. In order to enrich the population for clones that compete with soluble IFNAR2 for binding to IFN-α, the phage clones recovered from the IFN-α subtype chromatographic separations are incubated with a suspension of IFNAR2-derivatized polymer matrix beads preadsorbed to IFN-α, the incubation mixture is centrifuged, and the non-adsorbed phage clones are recovered from the supernatant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe selection procedure is designed to enrich the phage population for the property of inhibiting IFN-α binding to IFNAR2 during each of the affinity chromatographic separations. In this method, the phage are serially incubated with each of the specific IFN-α subtypes immobilized on a solid support and then eluted from solid phase with an eluent comprising an excess of soluble IFNAR2, such as IFNAR2 ECD-IgG Fc, under conditions wherein soluble IFNAR2 is capable of displacing any phage clone that competes with IFNAR2 for binding to the immobilized IFN-α. The process of binding and elution is thus repeated with each of the specific IFN-α subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phage clone may be adsorbed to IFN-α-derivatized polymer matrix beads in suspension, the adsorbed beads are recovered by centrifugation, the recovered beads are resuspended and incubated in a suitable elution buffer comprising an excess of soluble IFNAR2 (such as IFNAR2 ECD-IgG Fc) under conditions wherein the soluble IFNAR2 is capable of displacing any phage clone that competes with IFNAR2 for binding to the immobilized IFN-α and releasing the bound phage into solution, the elution mixture is centrifuged, the eluted phage clones are recovered from the supernatant, and then the adsorption/elution procedure is repeated for every additional IFN-α subtype.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the end, the procedure yields a population of phage displaying antibodies with IFNAR2-binding inhibition activity against a broad range of IFN-α subtypes. These phage can then be tested against other IFN species (other than IFN-α species), such as IFN-β, in order to select those clones which do not show appreciable binding to other species of IFNs. Finally, the selected phage clones can be examined for their ability to neutralize biological activity, e.g. anti-viral activity, of various IFN-α subtypes, and clones representing antibodies with broad neutralization activity against a majority, preferably all, of IFN-α subtypes are finally selected.\n\n\n \n \n \nActivity Selection of Anti-IFN-\n \nα \n \nClones\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides anti-IFN-α antibodies that bind to as well as neutralize the activity of a majority, preferably all, of IFN-α subtypes, but do not significantly bind to or neutralize the activity of any other interferon species. For example, the ability of various phage clones to neutralize the anti-viral activities of various IFN-α subtypes can be tested, essentially in the same manner as described earlier for the antibodies.\n\n\n \n4. Preparation of soluble IFNAR2-IgG\n\n\n \n \n \nA cDNA encoding the human immunoglobulin fusion proteins (immunoadhesins) based on the extracellular domain (ECD) of the hIFNAR2 (pRK5 hIFNAR2-IgG clone) can be generated using methods similar to those described by \nHaak-Frendscho et al., \n) for the construction of a murine IFN-( receptor immunoadhesin. Briefly, the plasmid pRKCD4\n2\nFc\n1\n is constructed as described in Example 4 of \n \nWO 89/02922\n \n (\n \nPCT/US88/03414 published April 6, 1989\n \n). The cDNA coding sequence for the first 216 residues of the mature hIFNAR2 ECD is obtained from the published sequence (\nNovick et al., Cell, 77: 391-400 [1994\n]). The CD4 coding sequence in the pRKCD4\n2\nFc\n1\n is replaced with the hIFNAR2 ECD encoding cDNA to form the pRK5hIFNAR2-IgG clone. hIFNAR2-IgG is expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells by transient transfection using a calcium phosphate precipitation technique. The immunoadhesin is purified from serum-free cell culture supernatants in a single step by affinity chromatography on a protein A-sepharose column as described in Haak-Frendscho \net al.\n (1993), \nsupra\n. Bound hIFNAR2-IgG is eluted with 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 3.0, containing 20% (w/v) glycerol. The hIFNAR2-IgG purified is over 95% pure, as judged by SDS-PAGE.\n\n\n \n5. Diagnostic uses of anti-IFN-α antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-IFN-α antibodies of the invention are unique research reagents in diagnostic assays for IFN-α expression. As discussed earlier, IFN-a expression is increased in certain autoimmune diseases such as IDDM, SLE, and autoimmune thymiditis. Increased expression of various IFN-α subtypes in such disorders can be detected and quantitated using anti-IFN-α antibodies of the instant invention with broad reactivity against a majority of IFN-α subtypes. Anti-IFN-α antibodies are also useful for the affinity purification of various IFN-α subtypes from recombinant cell culture or natural sources.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IFN-α antibodies can be used for the detection of IFN-α in any one of a number of well known diagnostic assay methods. For example, a biological sample may be assayed for IFN-α by obtaining the sample from a desired source, admixing the sample with anti-IFN-α antibody to allow the antibody to form antibody/IFN-α complex with any IFN-α subtype present in the mixture, and detecting any antibody/IFN-α complex present in the mixture. The biological sample may be prepared for assay by methods known in the art which are suitable for the particular sample. The methods of admixing the sample with antibodies and the methods of detecting antibody/IFN-α complex are chosen according to the type of assay used. Such assays include competitive and sandwich assays, and steric inhibition assays. Competitive and sandwich methods employ a phase-separation step as an integral part of the method while steric inhibition assays are conducted in a single reaction mixture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalytical methods for IFN-α all use one or more of the following reagents: labeled IFN-α analogue, immobilized IFN-α analogue, labeled anti-IFN-α antibody, immobilized anti-IFN-α antibody and steric conjugates. The labeled reagents also are known as \"tracers.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe label used is any detectable functionality that does not interfere with the binding of IFN-α and anti-IFN-α antibody. Numerous labels are known for use in immunoassay, examples including moieties that may be detected directly, such as fluorochrome, chemiluminescent, and radioactive labels, as well as moieties, such as enzymes, that must be reacted or derivatized to be detected. Examples of such labels include the radioisotopes \n32\nP, \n14\nC, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, and \n131\nI, fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, umbelliferone, luceriferases, e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456\n \n), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases, e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase, coupled with an enzyme that employs hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HRP, lactoperoxidase, or microperoxidase, biotin/avidin, spin labels, bacteriophage labels, stable free radicals, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConventional methods are available to bind these labels covalently to proteins or polypeptides. For instance, coupling agents such as dialdehydes, carbodiimides, dimaleimides, bis-imidates, bis-diazotized benzidine, and the like may be used to tag the antibodies with the above-described fluorescent, chemiluminescent, and enzyme labels. See, for example, \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 3,940,475\n \n (fluorimetry) and \n \n3,645,090\n \n (enzymes); \nHunter et al., Nature, 144: 945 (1962\n); \nDavid et al., Biochemistry, 13: 1014-1021 (1974\n); \nPain et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 40: 219-230 (1981\n); and \nNygren, J. Histochem. and Cytochem., 30: 407-412 (1982\n). Preferred labels herein are enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugation of such label, including the enzymes, to the antibody is a standard manipulative procedure for one of ordinary skill in immunoassay techniques. See, for example, \nO'Sullivan et al., \"\nMethods for the Preparation of Enzyme-antibody Conjugates for Use in Enzyme Immunoassay,\n\" in Methods in Enzymology, ed. J.J. Langone and H. Van Vunakis, Vol. 73 (Academic Press, New York, New York, 1981), pp. 147-166\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmobilization of reagents is required for certain assay methods. Immobilization entails separating the anti-IFN-α antibody from any IFN-α that remains free in solution. This conventionally is accomplished by either insolubilizing the anti-IFN-α antibody or IFN-α analogue before the assay procedure, as by adsorption to a water-insoluble matrix or surface (\n \nBennich et al., U.S. 3,720,760\n \n), by covalent coupling (for example, using glutaraldehyde cross-linking), or by insolubilizing the anti-IFN-α antibody or IFN-α analogue afterward, e.g., by immunoprecipitation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther assay methods, known as competitive or sandwich assays, are well established and widely used in the commercial diagnostics industry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetitive assays rely on the ability of a tracer IFN-α analogue to compete with the test sample IFN-α for a limited number of anti-IFN-α antibody antigen-binding sites. The anti-IFN-α antibody generally is insolubilized before or after the competition and then the tracer and IFN-α bound to the anti-IFN-α antibody are separated from the unbound tracer and IFN-α. This separation is accomplished by decanting (where the binding partner was pre-insolubilized) or by centrifuging (where the binding partner was precipitated after the competitive reaction). The amount of test sample IFN-α is inversely proportional to the amount of bound tracer as measured by the amount of marker substance. Dose-response curves with known amounts of IFN-α are prepared and compared with the test results to quantitatively determine the amount of IFN-α present in the test sample. These assays are called ELISA systems when enzymes are used as the detectable markers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother species of competitive assay, called a \"homogeneous\" assay, does not require a phase separation. Here, a conjugate of an enzyme with the IFN-α is prepared and used such that when anti-IFN-α antibody binds to the IFN-α the presence of the anti-IFN-α antibody modifies the enzyme activity. In this case, the IFN-α or its immunologically active fragments are conjugated with a bifunctional organic bridge to an enzyme such as peroxidase. Conjugates are selected for use with anti-IFN-α antibody so that binding of the anti-IFN-α antibody inhibits or potentiates the enzyme activity of the label. This method \nper se\n is widely practiced under the name of EMIT.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSteric conjugates are used in steric hindrance methods for homogeneous assay. These conjugates are synthesized by covalently linking a low-molecular-weight hapten to a small IFN-α fragment so that antibody to hapten is substantially unable to bind the conjugate at the same time as anti-IFN-α antibody. Under this assay procedure the IFN-α present in the test sample will bind anti-IFN-α antibody, thereby allowing anti-hapten to bind the conjugate, resulting in a change in the character of the conjugate hapten, e.g., a change in fluorescence when the hapten is a fluorophore.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSandwich assays particularly are useful for the determination of IFN-α or anti-IFN-α antibodies. In sequential sandwich assays an immobilized anti-IFN-α antibody is used to adsorb test sample IFN-α, the test sample is removed as by washing, the bound IFN-α is used to adsorb a second, labeled anti-IFN-α antibody and bound material is then separated from residual tracer. The amount of bound tracer is directly proportional to test sample IFN-α. In \"simultaneous\" sandwich assays the test sample is not separated before adding the labeled anti-IFN-α. A sequential sandwich assay using an anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibody as one antibody and a polyclonal anti-IFN-α antibody as the other is useful in testing samples for IFN-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing are merely exemplary diagnostic assays for IFN-α. Other methods now or hereafter developed that use anti-IFN-α antibody for the determination of IFN-α are included within the scope hereof, including the bioassays described above.\n\n\n \n6. Therapeutic compositions and administration of anti-IFN-α antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nTherapeutic formulations of the anti-IFN-α antibodies of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers \n(\n \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19th Edition, Alfonso, R., ed, Mack Publishing Co. (Easton, PA: 1995\n)), in the form of lyophilized cake or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as Tween, Pluronics or polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IFN-α antibody to be used for \nin vivo\n administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. The anti-IFN-α antibody ordinarily will be stored in lyophilized form or in solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic anti-IFN-α antibody compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe route of anti-IFN-α antibody administration is in accord with known methods, e.g. injection or infusion by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial, intracerebrospinal, or intralesional routes, or by sustained release systems as noted below. Preferably the antibody is given systemically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (\n \nU.S. 3,773,919\n \n, \n \nEP 58,481\n \n), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (\nSidman et al., Biopolymers, 22: 547-556 (1983\n)), poly (2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (\nLanger et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res., 15: 167-277 (1981\n) and \nLanger, Chem. Tech., 12: 98-105 (1982\n)), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer \net al.\n, \nsupra\n) or poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (\n \nEP 133,988\n \n). Sustained-release anti-IFNAR2 antibody compositions also include liposomally entrapped antibody. Liposomes containing antibody are prepared by methods known \nper se:\n \n \nDE 3,218,121\n \n; \nEpstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82: 3688-3692 (1985\n); \nHwang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77: 4030-4034 (1980\n); \n \nEP 52,322\n \n; \n \nEP 36,676\n \n; \n \nEP 88,046\n \n; \n \nEP 143,949\n \n; \n \nEP 142,641\n \n; Japanese patent application \n \n83-118008\n \n; \n \nU.S. 4,485,045\n \n and \n \n4,544,545\n \n; and \n \nEP 102,324\n \n. Ordinarily the liposomes are of the small (about 200-800 Angstroms) unilamelar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mol. % cholesterol, the selected proportion being adjusted for the optimal antibody therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IFN-α antibody can also be administered by inhalation. Commercially available nebulizers for liquid formulations, including jet nebulizers and ultrasonic nebulizers are useful for administration. Liquid formulations can be directly nebulized and lyophilized powder can be nebulized after reconstitution. Alternatively, anti-IFN-α antibody can be aerosolized using a fluorocarbon formulation and a metered dose inhaler, or inhaled as a lyophilized and milled powder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"effective amount\" of anti-IFN-α antibody to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic objectives, the route of administration, the type of anti-IFN-α antibody employed, and the condition of the patient. Accordingly, it will be necessary for the therapist to titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. Typically, the clinician will administer the anti-IFN-α antibody until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe patients to be treated with the anti-IFN-α antibody of the invention include preclinical patients or those with recent onset of immune-mediated disorders, and particularly autoimmune disorders. Patients are candidates for therapy in accord with this invention until such point as no healthy tissue remains to be protected from immune-mediated destruction. For example, a patient suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) can benefit from therapy with an anti-IFN-α antibody of the invention until the patient's pancreatic islet cells are no longer viable. It is desirable to administer an anti-IFN-α antibody as early as possible in the development of the immune-mediated or autoimmune disorder, and to continue treatment for as long as is necessary for the protection of healthy tissue from destruction by the patient's immune system. For example, the IDDM patient is treated until insulin monitoring demonstrates adequate islet response and other indicia of islet necrosis diminish (e.g. reduction in anti-islet antibody titers), after which the patient can be withdrawn from anti-IFN-α antibody treatment for a trial period during which insulin response and the level of anti-islet antibodies are monitored for relapse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the treatment and prevention of an immune-mediated or autoimmune disorder by an anti-IFN-α antibody, the antibody composition will be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the antibody, the particular type of antibody, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The \"therapeutically effective amount\" of antibody to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat the disorder, including treating chronic autoimmune conditions and immunosuppression maintenance in transplant recipients. Such amount is preferably below the amount that is toxic to the host or renders the host significantly more susceptible to infections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a general proposition, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of the antibody administered parenterally will be in the range of about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of antibody used being 0.3 to 20 mg/kg/day, more preferably 0.3 to 15 mg/kg/day. The desired dosage can be delivered by a single bolus administration, by multiple bolus administrations, or by continuous infusion administration of antibody, depending on the pattern of pharmacokinetic decay that the practitioner wishes to achieve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, however, these suggested amounts of antibody are subject to a great deal of therapeutic discretion. The key factor in selecting an appropriate dose and scheduling is the result obtained, as indicated above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the immune-mediated or autoimmune disorder in question. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, the antibody may be given in conjunction with a glucocorticosteroid. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of anti-IFN-α antibody present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99% of the heretofore employed dosages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther details of the invention can be found in the following example, which further defines the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. The examples are provided so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the compounds, compositions, and methods of the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention. Efforts have been made to insure accuracy with respect to numbers used (e.g. amounts, temperature, etc.) but some experimental errors and deviation should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, temperature is in degrees C, and pressure is at or near atmospheric.\n\n\n \nExample 1. \nGeneration and characterization of a broad reactive mouse anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibody\n \n\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n\n\n \nA murine monoclonal antibody with broad reactivity against IFN-\nα \nsubtypes\n \n\n\n \n \n \nA pan-IFN-α neutralizing antibody was developed by sequentially immunizing mice with the mixture of human IFN-α subtypes, generating a large number of candidate mAbs, and then screening for binding and activity. In particular, Balb/c mice were immunized into each hind footpad 9 times (at two week intervals) with 2.5 :g of lymphoblastoid hIFN-∀ (Product No I-9887 of Sigma, St. Louis, MO) resuspended in MPL-TDM (Ribi Immunochemical Research, Inc., Hamilton, MT). Three days after the final boost, popliteal lymph node cells were fused with murine myeloma cells P3X63Ag8.U.1 (ATCC CRL1597), using 35% polyethylene glycol. Hybridomas were selected in HAT medium. Ten days after the fusion, hybridoma culture supernatants were first screened for mAbs binding to the various species of hIFN-α in an ELISA. The selected hybridoma culture supernatants were then tested for their ability to inhibit the anti-viral cytophathic effect of IFN on human lung carcinoma cell line A549 cells as described below. As indicated in \nFig. 1\n, three mAbs obtained from 1794 fusion wells were able to neutralize a diverse set of IFN-a subtypes. These three mAbs were subcloned and re-analyzed.\n\n\n \n \nNeutralization of antiviral activity of IFN-\nα\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of a candidate antibody to neutralize the antiviral activity of IFN-α was assayed as described by \nYousefi, S., et al., Am. J. Clin. Pathol., 83: 735-740 (1985\n). Briefly, the assay was performed using human lung carcinoma A549 cells challenged with encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus. Serial dilutions of mAbs were incubated with various units of type I interferons for one hour at 37EC in a total volume of 100 :1. These mixtures were then incubated with 5x10\n5\n A549 cells in 100 :1 of cell culture medium for 24 hours. Cells were then challenged with 2x10\n5\n pfu of EMC virus for an additional 24 hours. At the end of the incubation, cell viability was determined by visual microscopic examination or crystal violet staining. The neutralizing antibody titer (EC50) was defined as the concentration of antibody which neutralizes 50% of the anti-viral cytopathic effect by 100 units/ml of type I IFNs. The units of type I IFNs used in this study were determined using NIH reference recombinant human IFN-α2 as a standard. The specific activities of the various type I IFNs tested were as follows: IFN-α2/-α1 (IFN-α2 residues 1.62/-α1 residues 64-166) (2x10\n7\n IU/mg), IFN-α1 (3x10\n7\n IU/mg), IFN-α2 (2x10\n7\n IU/mg), IFN-α5 (8x10\n7\n IU/mg), IFN-α8 (19x10\n7\n IU/mg), and IFN-α10 (1.5x10\n5\n IU/mg). The leukocyte IFN tested was Sigma Product No. I-2396. The lymphoblastoid IFN tested was NIH reference standard Ga23-901-532. The data shown in \nFig. 3B\n was obtained using the above-described assay format in experiments performed by Access Biomedical (San Diego, CA) at the behest of applicant.\n\n\n \n\n\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMost of the immediate actions of IFN have been linked to activation of latent cytoplasmic signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins to produce a multiprotein complex, interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3), which induces transcription from target promoter interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). ISGF3 is composed of three protein subunits; STAT1, STAT2 and p48/ISGF3γ. The p48 protein belongs to the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family, and is a DNA-binding protein that directly interacts with ISRE. Thus, monitoring ISRE specific cellular DNA-binding complex in response to IFN treatment provides a simple, rapid and convenient method to assess the effect of IFN on target cells. One of the convenient formats to carry out such an analysis is electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), wherein the induction of an ISRE-binding activity by IFN treatment results in the shift in the electrophoretic mobility of a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the consensus sequence of ISRE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay was carried out essentially as described by \nKurabayashi et al., Mol. Cell Biol., 15: 6386 (1995\n). Briefly, 5 ng of a specific IFN-α subtype plus various concentrations (5-100 µg/ml) of anti-IFN-α mAbs were incubated with 5x10\n5\n HeLa cells in 200 µl of DMEM for 30 minutes at 37°C. Cells were preincubated with antibody for 15 minutes at 4°C before the addition of the hIFN-α. Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in 125 µl buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCI, 0.1 mM ETDA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin). After a 15 minute incubation on ice, cells were lysed by the addition of 0.025% NP40. The nuclear pellet was obtained by centrifugation and was resuspended in 50 µl buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, I mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin) and kept on ice for 30 min. The nuclear fraction was cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant stored at - 70°C until use. Double-stranded probes were prepared from single-stranded oligonucleotides (ISG15 top : 5'-GATCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC-3' [SEQ ID NO. 13], ISG15 bottom: 5'-GATCGGCTTCAGTTTCGGTTTCCCTTTC CC-3' [SEQ ID NO. 14]) utilizing a DNA polymerase I Klenow filling reaction with \n32\nP- dATP (3,000 Ci/mM, Amersham). Labeled oligonucleotides were purified from unincorporated radioactive nucleotides using BIO-Spin 30 columns (Bio-Rad). Binding reactions containing 5 µl nuclear extract, 25,000 cpm of labeled probe and 2 µg of non-specific competitor poly (dI-dC)-poly (dI-dC) in 15 µl binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, I mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 15% glycerol) were incubated at RT for 30 minutes. DNA-protein complexes were resolved in 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by autoradiograph. The specificity of the assay was determined by the addition of 350 ng of unlabeled ISG 15 probe in separate reaction mixtures. Formation of an ISGF3 specific complex was confirmed by a super shift assay with anti-STAT1 antibody.\n\n\n \n \nCloning of a gene encoding 9F3 anti-IFN-\nα \nmonoclonal antibody\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe murine anti-human IFN-α mAb 9F3 was generated, cloned and sequenced. The plasmid pEMX1 used for expression and mutagenesis of F(ab)s in E. \ncoli\n has been described previously (\nWerther et al., J. Immunol. 157: 4986-4995 [1996\n]). Briefly, the plasmid contains a DNA fragment encoding a consensus \nhuman κ subgroup\n 1 light chain (VLκI-CL) and a consensus human subgroup III heavy chain (VHIII-CH1) and an alkaline phosphatase promoter. The use of the consensus sequences for VL and VH has been described previously (\nCarter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 4285-4289 [1992\n]).\n\n\n \n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWe have previously shown that there is a wide spectrum of IFN-α subtypes expressed by the islets of patients with IDDM (\nHuang et al., Diabetes 44: 658-664 [1995\n]). We also demonstrated that there is no obvious association between IDDM and the expression of either IFN-β or IFN-γ (Huang \net al.\n, [1995] \nsupra\n). While the specific IFN-α subtypes expressed as part of the SLE pathology have not been defined, as with IDDM, the association is with IFN-α and not with either of IFN-β or IFN-γ (\nHooks, et al., Arthritis & Rheumatism 25: 396-400 [1982\n]; \nKim, et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 70: 562-569 [1987\n]; \nLacki, et al., J. Med. 28: 99-107 [1997\n]; \nRobak, et al., Archivum Immunologiae et Therapiae Experimentalis 46: 375-380 [1998\n]; \nShiozawa, et al., Arthritis & Rheumatism 35: 417-422 [1992\n]; \nvon Wussow, et al., Rheumatology International 8: 225-230 [1988\n]). These observations led us to propose that a candidate antibody for therapeutic intervention in IDDM or SLE would need to neutralize a majority of the IFN-α subtypes while leaving intact the activities of other interferons (β, γ and ω) and interleukins that may be required for host defense.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of them (9F3) was able to neutralize a wide spectrum of recombinant interferon α subtypes and was further characterized. As shown in \nFig. 2A\n, 9F3 was able to neutralize the anti-viral activity of seven recombinant interferons, IFN-α - 2, 4, 5, 8 and 10 (\nFig. 2\n) and IFN-\nα\n 1 and 21 (Table 2 and \nFig. 6\n). These IFN-α subtypes cover the full spectrum of sequences as projected in a type I interferon sequence dendrogram. More importantly, the 9F3 mAb that neutralized the IFN-α subtypes was unable to neutralize IFN-β (\nFig. 2\n, Table 2) or IFN-(. The small increase in activity shown in \nFig. 2\n for IFN-β was not reproducible in other assays and appears to be the result of assay variation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther mAbs that are neutralizing toward IFN-α have been developed (\nTsukui et al., Microbiol. Immunol. 30: 1129-1139 [1986\n]; \nBerg, J. Interferon Res. 4: 481-491 [1984\n]; \nMeager and Berg, J. Interferon Res. 6:729-736 [1986\n]; \n \nUS Patent No. 4,902,618\n \n; and \n \nEP publication No. 0,139,676 B1\n \n). However, these antibodies neutralize only a limited number of recombinant IFN-α subtypes and are unable to neutralize a wide spectrum of IFN-α subtypes such as those produced by activated leukocytes. In contrast, 9F3 Mab was able to neutralize at least 95% of the anti-viral activity in the heterogeneous collection of IFN-α subtypes produced by activated leukocytes (\nFig. 3A\n). Similarly, 9F3 mAb was also able to block the anti-viral activity of an independent preparation of lymphoblastoid IFN (NIH reference standard) as determined in an independent experiment (\nFig. 3B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of 9F3 mAb to neutralize IFN-α was also tested using an alternative bioassay. The assay was based on the ability of IFN-α to activate the binding of the signaling molecule, interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), to an oligonucleotide derived from the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) in a DNA binding assay known as electrophoretic mobility shift assay (\nHorvath et al., Genes Dev. 9: 984-994 [1995\n]). The transduction of type I interferon signals to the nucleus relies on activation of a protein complex, ISGF3, involving two signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins, STAT1 and STAT2, and the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) protein, p48/ISGF3y (\nWathelet et al., Mol. Cell 1: 507-518 [1998\n]). The latter is a DNA sequence recognition subunit of ISGF3 and directly interacts with ISRE (\nMcKendry et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 11455-11459 [1991\n]; \nJohn et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 11: 4189-4195 [1991\n]). The treatment of COS cells with either IFN-α or IFN-β led to the appearance of a complex corresponding to the binding of ISGF3 to the ISRE derived probe. The appearance of the IFN-α-induced but not the IFN-β-induced complex was blocked by 9F3 mAb (\nFig. 4\n). Furthermore, 9F3 mAb was able to neutralize the activity of six recombinant IFN-α subtypes that were tested in this assay (Table 2).\n\n \n \nTable 2\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of ISGF3 formation induced by type I IFNs by mAb 9F3\n \n \n \nmAb\n \nIFN-α2/1\n \nIFN-α1\n \nIFN-α2\n \nIFN-α5\n \nIFN-α8\n \nIFN-α21\n \nIFN-β\n \n \n \n \n9F3.18.5\n \n+++\n \n+++\n \n+++\n \n+\n \n+++\n \n+++\n \n-\n \n \n \nIgG 1\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n\nThe extent of inhibition of the IFN induced complex by 9F3 is indicated where - indicates that the induced band was not altered; + indicates that the band was partially lost and +++ indicates that the induced band was largely abolished. mAb was used at 10 µg/ml; IFN-α was used at 25 ng/ml\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHaving established that 9F3 was able to neutralize both a wide variety of recombinant IFN-α subtypes and the mixture of IFN-α subtypes produced by activated leukocytes, we cloned and sequenced the cDNAs encoding both the heavy and light chains of 9F3 mAb. The heavy and light chains were purified and the N terminal amino acid sequences derived were used to design degenerate 5' primers corresponding to the N terminus, and the 3' primers were designed corresponding to the constant domain of mouse κ light chain and IgG2 heavy chain. The corresponding cDNAs were cloned using conventional PCR technique and the nucleotide sequence of the inserts was determined. \nFigure 5\n shows sequence alignment of VL (5A) and VH (5B) domains of a murine 9F3 monoclonal antibody, a humanized version (V 13) and consensus sequence of the human heavy chain subgroup III and the human κ light chain subgroup III. In order to ensure that the cDNAs that were cloned encoded the correct Mab reflecting the specificity and characteristics of 9F3 mAb, recombinant chimeric proteins were generated that utilized the mouse cDNA sequences shown in \nFig. 5\n and a human CH1 domain. The resultant chimera (CH8-2) was able to fully neutralize various recombinant IFN-α subtypes (\nFig. 6\n). The amino acid sequences for the heavy and light chains were then used to generate a humanized antibody.\n\n\n \nExample 2. \nHumanization of 9F3 pan-IFN-\nα \nneutralizing monoclonal antibody\n \n\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction of Humanized F(ab)s\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo construct the first F(ab) variant of humanized 9F3, site-directed mutagenesis (\nKunkel, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82: 488-492 [1985\n]) was performed on a deoxyuridine-containing template of pEMX1. The six CDRs were changed to the murine 9F3 sequence (\nFig. 5\n); the residues included in each CDR were from the sequence-based CDR definitions (Kabat \net al.,\n (1991) \nsupra).\n F-1 therefore consisted of a complete human framework (\nVL κ subgroup\n 1 and VH subgroup III) with the six complete murine CDR sequences. Plasmids for all other F(ab) variants were constructed from the plasmid template of F-1. Plasmids were transformed into \nE\n. \ncoli\n strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) for preparation of double- and single-stranded DNA using commercial kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For each variant, DNA coding for light and heavy chains was completely sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (Sequenase, U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Plasmids were transformed into \nE\n. \ncoli\n strain 16C9, a derivative of MM294, plated onto Luria broth plates containing 50 µg/ml carbenicillin, and a single colony selected for protein expression. The single colony was grown in 5 ml Luria broth-100 µg/ml carbenicillin for 5-8 h at 37°C. The 5 ml culture was added to 500 ml AP5 medium containing 50 µg/ml carbenicillin and allowed to grow for 20 h in a 4 L baffled shake flask at 30°C. AP5 medium consists of: 1.5 g glucose, 11.0 g Hycase SF, 0.6 g yeast extract (certified), 0.19 g MgSO\n4\n (anhydrous), 1.07 g NH\n4\nCl, 3.73 g KCl, 1.2 g NaCl, 120 ml 1 M triethanolamine, pH 7.4, to 1 L water and then sterile filtered through 0.1 µm Sealkeen filter. Cells were harvested by centrifugation in a 1 L centrifuge bottle at 3000xg and the supernatant removed. After freezing for 1 h, the pellet was resuspended in 25 ml cold 10 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA-20% sucrose, pH 7.5, 250 µl of 0.1 M benzamidine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to inhibit proteolysis. After gentle stirring on ice for 3 h, the sample was centrifuged at 40,000xg for 15 min. The supernatant was then applied to a Protein G-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) column (0.5 ml bed volume) equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. The column was washed with 10 ml of 10 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, and eluted with 3 ml 0.3 M glycine, pH 3.0, into 1.25 ml I M Tris, pH, 8.0. The F(ab) was then buffer exchanged into PBS using a Centricon-30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and concentrated to a final volume of 0.5 ml. SDS-PAGE gels of all F(ab)s were run to ascertain purity and the molecular weight of each variant was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. F(ab) concentrations were determined using quantitative amino acid analysis.\n\n\n \n\n\nConstruction of Chimeric and Humanized 1gG\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor generation of human IgG2 versions of chimeric and humanized 9F3, the appropriate murine or humanized VL and VH (F-13, Table 3) domains were subcloned into separate previously described pRK vectors (\nEaton et al., Biochemistry 25: 8343-8347 [1986\n]) that contained DNA coding for human IgG2 CH1-Fc or human light chain CL domain. The DNA coding for the entire light and the entire heavy chain of each variant was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The chimeric IgG consists of the entire murine 9F3 VH domain fused to a human CH1 domain at amino acid SerHI 13 and the entire murine 9F3 VL domain fused to a human CL domain at amino acid LysL 10.7.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeavy and light chain plasmids were co-transfected into an adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line, 293 (\nGraham et al., J. Gen. Virol. 36: 59-74 [1977\n]), using a high efficiency procedure (\nGorman et al., DNA Prot. Eng. Tech. 2: 3-10 [1990\n]). Media was changed to serum-free and harvested daily for up to five days. Antibodies were purified from the pooled supernatants using Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia). The eluted antibody was buffer exchanged into PBS using a Centricon-30 (Amicon), concentrated to 0.5 ml, sterile filtered using a Millex-GV (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stored at 4°C. IgG2 concentrations were determined using quantitative amino acid analysis.\n\n\n \n \nIFN-\nα \nBinding Assay\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn the ELISA, 96 well microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated by adding 50 µl of 0.1 µg/ml IFN-α in PBS to each well and incubated at 4°C overnight. The plates were then washed three times with wash buffer (PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20). The wells in microtiter plates were then blocked with 200 µl of SuperBlock (Pierce) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The plates were then washed again three times with wash buffer. After washing step, 100 µl of serial dilutions of humanized mAb starting at 10 µg/ml were added to designated wells. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour on a shaker apparatus and then washed three times with wash buffer. Next, 100 µl of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human Fab specific (Cappel), diluted at 1:1000 in assay buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 in PBS), was added to each well. The plates were incubated at room temperature on a shaker apparatus and then washed three times with wash buffer, followed by addition of 100 µl of substrate (TMB, 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine; Kirkegaard & Perry) to each well and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 µl of stop solution (from Kirkegaard & Perry) to each well, and absorbance at 450 nm was read in an automated microtiter plate reader.\n\n\n \n \nBIAcore\n™ \nBiosensor Assay\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIFN-α binding of the humanized F(ab)s, chimeric and humanized IgG2 antibodies were measured using a BIACore™ biosensor (\nKarlsson et al., Methods: A. companion to Methods in Enzymology 6: 97-108 [1994\n]). The IFN-α was immobilized on the sensor chip at 60 µg/ml in 50 mM MES buffer, pH 6.3. Antibodies were exposed to the chip at 75 µg/ml (500 nM) in phosphate-buffered saline/1% Tween-20. The antibody on-rate (k\non\n) was measured.\n\n\n \n\n\nComputer Graphics Modes of Murine and Humanized F(ab)s\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSequences of the VL and VH domains (\nFig. 5A\n and \nB\n) were used to construct a computer graphics model of the murine 9F3 VL-VH domains (\nFig. 7\n). This model was used to determine which framework residues should be incorporated into the humanized antibody. A model of the humanized F(ab) was also constructed to verify correct selection of murine framework residues. Construction of models was performed as described previously (Carter \net al.\n, [1992] \nsupra\n; Werther \net al.\n, [1996] \nsupra\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe consensus sequence for the human heavy chain subgroup III and the light chain subgroup I were used as the framework for the humanization as shown in \nFig. 5\n (Kabat \net al.,\n (1991), \nsupra).\n This framework has been successfully used in the humanization of other murine antibodies (\nCarter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 4285-4289 [1992\n]; \nPresta et al., J. Immunol. 151: 2623-2632 [1993\n]; \nEigenbrot et al., Proteins 18: 49-62 [1994\n]; \nWerther et al., J. Immunol. 157: 4986-4995 [1996\n]). All humanized variants were initially made and screened for binding as F(ab)s expressed in \nE\n. \ncoli.\n Typical yields from 500 ml shake flasks were 0.1-0.4 mg F(ab).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe complementarity determining region (CDR) residues have been defined either based on sequence hypervariability (Kabat \net al.\n, (1991) \nsupra)\n or crystal structure of F(ab)-antigen complexes (\nChothia et al., Nature 342: 877-883 [1989\n]). Although the sequence-based CDRs are larger than the structure-based CDRs, the two definitions are generally in agreement except for CDR-H1. According to the sequence-based definition, CDR-H1 includes residues H31-H35, whereas the structure-based system defines residues H26-H32 as CDR-H1 (light chain residue numbers are prefixed with L; heavy chain residue numbers are prefixed with H). For the present study, CDR-H1 was defined as a combination of the two, i.e. including residues H26-H35. The other CDRs were defined using the sequence-based definition (Kabat \net al.\n, (1991) \nsupra\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the initial variant, F-1, the CDR residues were transferred from the murine antibody to the human framework. In addition, F(ab)s which consisted of the chimeric heavy chain with F-1 light chain (Ch-1) and F-1 heavy chain with chimeric light chain (Ch-2) were generated and tested for binding. F-1 bound IFN-α poorly (Table 3). Comparing the binding affinities of Ch-1 and Ch-2 (Table 3) suggested that framework residues in the F-1 VH domain needed to be altered in order to increase binding.\n\n \n \nTable 3\n \n \n \n \nHumanized Anti-IFN-α Versions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOD\n450nm\n at 10 µg/ml\n \n \n \nVersion\n \nTemplate\n \nChanges\na\n \n \nMean\n \nSD\n \nN\n \n \n \n \nCh-1\n \nF-1 VL/ Murine VH\n \n \n \n1.45\n \n0.11\n \n3\n \n \n \nCh-2\n \nMurine VL/ F-2 VH\n \n \n \n.024\n \n0.04\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-1\n \nHuman FR/ CDR swap\n \n \n \n0.06\n \n0.00\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-2\n \nF-1\n \nArgH71\nLeu\n;\n \n0.08\n \n0.01\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAsnH73\nL\nys\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nF-3\n \nF-2\n \nPheH67\nAla\n;\n \n0.14\n \n0.02\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIleH69\nLeu\n;\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLeuH78\nAla\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nF-4\n \nF-3\n \nArgH94\nSer\n \n \n0.495\n \n0.02\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-5\n \nF-4\n \nAlaH24\nThr\n \n \n0.545\n \n0.03\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-6\n \nF-5\n \nValH48\nIle\n;\n \n0.527\n \n0.02\n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlaH49\nGly\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nF-7\n \n \n \nF-5\n \n \n \n \nAla\nH78Leu\n \n \n0.259\n \n0.02\n \n2\n \n \n \n \nF-8\n \n \n \nF-5\n \n \n \n \nLeu\nH69Ile\n \n \n0.523\n \n0.05\n \n3\n \n \n \n \nF-9\n \n \n \nF-5\n \n \n \n \nAla\nH67Phe\n \n \n0.675\n \n0.09\n \n3\n \n \n \n \nF-10\n \n \n \nF-9\n \n \n \n \nLeu\nH69Ile\n \n \n0.690\n \n0.03\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-11\n \nF-10\n \nLysH75\nSer\n \n \n0.642\n \n0.06\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-12\n \nF-10\n \nAsnH76\nArg\n \n \n0.912\n \n0.05\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-13\n \nF-12\n \nLeuL46\nVal\n \n \n1.050\n \n0.16\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTyrL49Ser\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nF-14\n \n \n \nF-13\n \n \n \nLeuH71Arg\n \n \n0.472\n \n0.06\n \n3\n \n \n \n \nF-15\n \n \n \nF-13\n \n \n \nLysH73Asn\n \n \n0.868\n \n0.32\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \na\nMurine residues are in bold; residue numbers are according to Kabat et al. (1991). Standard text indicates a change from a human framework residue to mouse. Italic text indicates a change from a mouse framework residue to human. Fab binding to IFN-α was assayed by ELISA and results are provided as OD\n450nm\n at 10 µg/ml. SD, standard deviation; n, number of experimental replicates.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrevious humanizations (\nXiang et al., J. Mol. Biol. 253: 385-390 [1995\n]; Werther \net al.\n, [1996] \nsupra)\n as well as studies of F(ab)-antigen crystal structures (Chothia \net al.\n, [1989] \nsupra\n; \nTramontano et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215: 175-182 [1990\n]) have shown that residues H71 and H73 can have a profound effect on binding, possibly by influencing the conformations of CDR-H1 and CDR-H2. Changing the human residues at positions H71 and H73 to their murine counterparts improved binding only slightly (version F-2, Table 3). Further simultaneous changes at positions H67, H69 and H78 (version F-3) followed by changes ArgH94Ser (version F-4) and AlaH24Thr (version F-5) significantly improved binding (Table 3). Since positions H67, H69 and H78 had been changed simultaneously, each was individually altered back to the human consensus framework residue; versions F-7, F-8, F-9, and F-10 show that the human residue is preferred at position H67, position H69 does not show any preference for the human or murine residue, and the murine residue is preferred at position H78.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe have found during previous humanizations that residues in a framework loop, FR-3 (Kabat \net al.\n, (1991) \nsupra\n), adjacent to CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 can affect binding (Eigenbrot \net al.,\n (1994) \nsupra).\n Accordingly, two residues in this loop were changed to their murine counterparts: LysH75 to murine Ser (version F-11) and AsnH76 to murine Arg (version F-12). Only the AsnH76Arg change effected an improvement in binding (Table 3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInspection of the models of the murine and humanized F(ab)s suggested that residue L46, buried at the VL-VH interface and interacting with CDR-H3, might also play a role either in determining the conformation of CDR-H3 and/or affecting the interactions between the VL and VH domains. Similarly, L49 position which is adjacent to CDR-L2 differs between the human consensus (Tyr) and the 9F3 (Ser) sequence. Therefore, LeuL46Val and TyrL49Ser residues were simultaneously substituted, which resulted in a variant (F-13) with further improvement in the binding (Table 3). Based on its best binding among all the variants generated, F-13 was chosen as the final humanized version.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA humanized recombinant anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibody (V13IgG2) was generated by fusing VH and VL domains derived from F-13 to human IgG2 CH1-Fc and human CL domains respectively. The K\nON\n rates and K\nD\n values of V13IgG2 were then compared with a chimeric IgG2 or murine 9F3. BIACore™ measurement of V13IgG2 and chimeric IgG2 binding to immobilized IFN-α showed that their K\nON\n rates were similar (Table 4). Affinity measurement using Kinexa™ technology showed that the affinity of V13IgG2 for IFNα was reduced by 2-fold compared to the parental murine 9F3 antibody (Table 4).\n\n \n \nTable 4\n \n \n \n \nBIACore™ and Kinexa™ Data for Anti-IFNα Antibodies\n \n \n \nAntibody\na\n \n \nK\non\n(µM/sec)\n \nKd (nM)\nb\n \n \nMethod\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0.14\n \nBIACore™\n \n \n \nChIgG2\n \n3.9\n \n \n \nBIACore™\n \n \n \nV13IgG2\n \n3.3\n \n \n \nBIACore™\n \n \n \nV13Fab\n \n \n \n4.1\n \nBIACore™\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody\na\n \n \nK\nD\n(pM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmurine 9F3\n \n1.5\n \n \n \nKinexa™\n \n \n \nV13Fab\n \n3.4\n \n \n \nKinexa™\n \n \n \n \n \n \na\nV13IgG2 is F-13 VH domain joined to human IgG2 CH1-Fc and F-13 VL domain joined to a human CL domain; ChIgG2 is mouse 9F3 VH domain joined to human IgG2 CH1-Fc and mouse 9F3 VL domain joined to human CL domain. \nb\nKoff/Kon.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nDeposit of Material\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following materials have been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, VA 20110-2209, USA (ATCC):\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMaterial\n \nATCC Dep.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMany chronic and acute conditions are associated with perturbation of the inflammatory response. A large number of cytokines participate in this response, including, but not limited to, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα. Although these cytokines are normally expressed in response to many physiological stimuli, excess, unregulated, or excess and unregulated production of these cytokines often leads to inflammation and tissue damage. This is one mechanism by which diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis mediate morbidity (\nKeffer, J., et al, EMBO J., 13: 4025-4031, 1991\n, \nFeldmann, M., et al, Annu. Rev. Immunol., 14: 397-440, 1996\n and \nBingham, C. O., J. Rheumatol. Suppl., 65: 3-9; 2002\n). Currently there are several therapeutic agents that aim to reduce systemic levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα (\nPugsley, M. K. Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 2: 1725-1731, 2001\n and \nBondeson, J., and Maini, R. N., J. Clin. Pract., 55: 211-216, 2001\n), thus ameliorating the disease. These therapeutics act directly to reduce circulating levels or neutralize activity of the cytokine. However, these therapeutics do not directly block intracellular proteins that regulate the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines or regulate the expression of other mediators of inflammation and tissue destruction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe p38 MAP Kinase (p38, also known as CSBP or SAPK) signaling pathway has been reported to be responsible for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are elevated in many inflammatory and auto-immune diseases (see, e.g., \nDong, C., et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol., 20: 55-72, 2002\n and references cited therein). Thus, inhibitors of any part of the p38 MAP Kinase pathway or inhibitors of pathways that regulate the p38 MAP Kinase pathway may be useful as therapeutics for diseases or conditions in which inflammation or auto-immune responses are involved. (\nLee, J. C., et al, Immunopharm, 47: 185-201, 2000\n). This pathway has been shown to be activated by cellular stressors, such as osmotic shock, UV light, free radicals, bacterial toxins, viruses, cytokines, and chemokines, to name a few, and in response, mediates the expression of several cytokines including, but not limited to, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα (\nOno, K. and Han, J., Cellular Signalling, 12: 1-13, 2000\n and references cited therein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically the p38 MAP kinase pathway is directly or indirectly activated by cell surface receptors, such as receptor tyrosine kinases, chemokine or G protein-coupled receptors, which have been activated by a specific ligand, e.g., cytokines, chemokines or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding to a cognate receptor. Subsequently, p38 MAP kinase is activated by phosphorylation on residues threonine 180 and tyrosine 182. After activation, p38 MAP kinase can phosphorylate other intracellular proteins, including protein kinases, and can be translocated to the cell nucleus, where it phosphorylates and activates transcription factors leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other proteins that contribute to the inflammatory response, cell adhesion, and proteolytic degradation. For example, in cells of myeloid lineage, such as macrophages and monocytes, both IL-1 and TNFα are transcribed in response to p38 activation. Subsequent translation and secretion of these and other cytokines initiates a local or systemic inflammatory response in adjacent tissue and through infiltration of leukocytes. While this response is a normal part of physiological responses to cellular stress, acute or chronic cellular stress leads to the excess, unregulated, or excess and unregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This, in turn, leads to tissue damage, often resulting in pain and debilitation. The fact that there are four known isoforms of p38 MAP kinase (p38α, p38β, p38δ and p38γ), each showing different expression levels, tissue distributions and regulation, support the concept that they are involved in the etiology or sequelae of many diseases and physiological disturbances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndeed, many autoimmune diseases and diseases associated with chronic inflammation, as well as acute responses, have been linked to activation of p38 MAP kinase and overexpression or dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines. These diseases include, but are not limited to: rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatoid spondylitis; osteoarthritis; gout, other arthritic conditions; sepsis; septic shock; endotoxic shock; gram-negative sepsis; toxic shock syndrome; asthma; adult respiratory distress syndrome; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic pulmonary inflammation; inflammatory bowel disease; Crohn's disease; psoriasis; eczema; ulcerative colitis; pancreatic fibrosis; hepatic fibrosis; acute and chronic renal disease; irritable bowel syndrome; pyresis; restenosis; cerebral malaria; stroke and ischemic injury; neural trauma; Alzheimer's disease; Huntington's disease; Parkinson's disease; acute and chronic pain; allergic rhinitis; allergic conjunctivitis; chronic heart failure; acute coronary syndrome; cachexia; malaria; leprosy; leishmaniasis; Lyme disease; Reiter's syndrome; acute synovitis; muscle degeneration, bursitis; tendonitis; tenosynovitis; herniated, ruptures, or prolapsed intervertebral disk syndrome; osteopetrosis; thrombosis; cancer; restenosis; silicosis; pulmonary sarcosis; bone resorption diseases, such as osteoporosis; graft-versus-host reaction; and auto-immune diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis, lupus and fibromyalgia; AIDS and other viral diseases such as Herpes Zoster, Herpes Simplex I or II, influenza virus and cytomegalovirus; and diabetes mellitus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany studies have shown that reducing the activity of \np3\n 8 MAP kinase, its upstream activators or its downstream effectors, either through genetic or chemical means, blunts the inflammatory response and prevents or minimizes tissue damage (see, e.g., \nEnglish, J. M. and Cobb, M. H., Trends in Pharmacol. Sci., 23: 40-45, 2002\n; and \nDong, C., et al, Annu. Rev. Immunol., 20: 55-72,2002\n). Thus, inhibitors of p38 activity, which also inhibit excess or unregulated cytokine production and may inhibit more than a single pro-inflammatory cytokine, may be useful as anti-inflammatory agents and therapeutics. Furthermore, the large number of diseases associated with p38 MAP kinase-associated inflammatory responses indicates that there is a need for effective methods for treating these conditions. However, as of the filing date of the present application, there are no approved drugs available that are known to directly inhibit the p38 MAP kinase family of enzymes, and those approved drugs that act by reducing or neutralizing cytokine levels through binding to the cytokine are generally not orally bioavailable and must therefore be administered by techniques such as injection. \n \nWO 03/000682\n \n discloses certain imidazo[2,1-b] thirazole derivatives whitch are suitable as p38 inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, new compounds and methods for treating p38- and cytokine-associated conditions are needed.\n\n\n \n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides compounds represented by Formula I:\n\n \n \n\nin which:\n\n \n \n \nX is O Y is OR\n4\n, or NR\n4\nR\n5\n; n is 2; R\n1\n represents 1 or 2 substituents independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, -CN, -COOH, halogen, C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkyl, C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkoxy; C\n3\n - C\n6\n cycloalkyl, C\n3\n - C\n6\n cycloalkyloxy, aryl, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkylcarbonyl, and C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkoxycarbonyl; Ar is an aryl group Ar is an aryl group containing between 1 and 3 rings, containing optionally from 1-4 heteroatoms, selected from nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen, and optionally substituted with one or more substituents independently selected from hydroxyl group, halogen, thiol, cyano, nitro, amino, -NR\n12\nR\n13\n, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkylthio, arylthio, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylcarbonyloxy, arylcarbonyloxy, C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkyloxy, C\n2\n-C\n6\n alkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\n akynyl, aryl, carboxylate, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkylcarbonyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkylcarbonyl, heterocyclylcarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkoxycarbonyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkyloxycarbonyl , heterocyclyloxycarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl , C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkoxycarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl and a heterocyclyl group, R\n3\n represents 1-2 substituents independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen; halogen, amino, C\n1\n- C\n6\n alkyl, C\n1\n- C\n6\n alkoxy, C\n3\n- C\n6\n cycloalkyl, C\n3\n- C\n6\n cycloalkyloxy, aryl, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n- C\n6\n alkylcarbonyl, and C\n1\n- C\n6\n alkoxycarbonyl; R\n4\n and R\n5\n are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C\n1\n- C\n6\n alkyl, C\n3\n- C\n6\n cycloalkyl, aryl, and heterocyclyl; or R\n4\n and R\n5\n, taken together with the N atom to which they are attached, form a heterocyclic ring having from 3 to 8 atoms in the ring R\n12\n is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl, and aryl;\n\nR\n13\n is selected from the group consisting of -C(O)-C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl, -C(O)-C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkyl, -C(O)-aryl, -C(O)-heterocyclyl, -C(O)O-C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl, -C(O)O-C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkyl, -C(O)O-aryl, -C(O)O-heterocyclyl, -C(O)-amino, -SO\n2\n-C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl, -SO\n2\n-C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkyl, - SO\n2\n-aryl, and - SO\n2\n-heterocyclyl; or a, solvate, or salt (preferably a pharmaceutically acceptable salt) thereof;\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, Ar is phenyl or naphthyl, most preferably phenyl; in preferred embodiments, the phenyl group may be substituted with 1-3 halogen or trifluoromethyl substituents.

Such labeled compounds can be used in methods for detecting or determining the presence of \np3\n 8 in a cell or a tissue type.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, compounds of Formula I are selected to preserve the desired activity of the compounds (e.g., inhibition of cytokine activity, including inhibition of TNFα. activity and IL-1 activity, or inhibition of p38 activity).

Furthermore, all geometric isomers, such as E- and Z-configurations at a double bond, are within the scope of the invention unless otherwise stated. Certain compounds of this invention may exist in tautomeric forms. All such tautomeric forms of the compounds are considered to be within the scope of this invention unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds and compositions of the invention can also include metabolites.

As used herein, the term \"solvate\" refers to a complex formed by a solute (in this invention, a compound of Formula I and a solvent. Such solvents for the purpose of the invention preferably should not interfere with the biological activity of the solute. Solvents may be, by way of example, water, ethanol, or acetic acid.\n\n\n \n\n\nII. Methods and Intermediates for Preparing Compounds of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention can be prepared in a variety of ways, some of which are known in the art. For example, a method for synthesis of pyrimidyl-substituted imidazothiazoles has been described in \n \nPCT patent publication WO 03/00682\n \n. In general, the compounds of the present invention can be prepared from commercially available starting materials, compounds known in the literature, or from readily-prepared intermediates, by employing standard synthetic methods and procedures known to those skilled in the art, or which will be apparent to the skilled artisan in light of the teachings herein. Standard synthetic methods and procedures for the preparation of organic molecules and functional group transformations and manipulations can be obtained from the relevant scientific literature or from standard textbooks in the field. Although not limited to any one or several sources, classic texts such as \nSmith, M. B.; March, J. March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, 5th ed.; John Wiley & Sons: New York, 2001\n; and \nGreene, T.W.; Wuts, P.G. M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd.; John Wiley & Sons: New York, 1999\n are useful and recognized reference textbooks of organic synthesis known to those in the art. The following descriptions of synthetic methods are designed to illustrate, but not limit, general procedures for the preparation of compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, the invention includes intermediate compounds. For example, the present invention provides novel compounds represented by Formula II:\n\n \n \n\nin which:\n\n \n \n \nR\n1\n is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, -CN, -COOH, halogen, C\n1\n- C\n6\n alkyl, C\n1\n- C\n6\n alkoxy, C\n3\n- C\n6\n cycloalkyl, C\n3\n- C\n6\n cycloalkyloxy, aryl, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n- C\n6\n alkylcarbonyl, and C\n1\n- C\n6\n alkoxycarbonyl; and Ar is an aryl group; or a salt thereof. As the skilled artisan will recognize from the teachings herein, compounds of Formula II are useful, \ninter alia,\n for the synthesis of the imidazooxazole compounds of Formula I. For example, as shown in \nFigure 1\n, compounds of Formula II, such as 4, can be reacted with an appropriate halopyrimidine compound (such as 5) under Heck reaction conditions, typically using a palladium catalyst (such as Pd(OAc)\n2\n), to provide compounds of Formula I or precursors to such compounds. In preferred embodiments of compounds of Formula II, Ar is phenyl or naphthyl, most preferably phenyl; in certain preferred embodiments, the phenyl group is substituted, e.g., with 1-3 halogen, trifluoromethyl, or C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkoxy substituents. In certain preferred embodiments, the phenyl group is selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted phenyl, 4-fluorophenyl, 3-methoxyphenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl, 3,4-difluorophenyl, 4-methylphenyl, 4-bromophenyl, 3-fluorophenyl, and 4-trifluoromethylphenyl. A most preferred phenyl group is 4-fluorophenyl. In preferred embodiments, R\n1\n is H. In a most preferred embodiment, R\n1\n is H and Ar is 4-fluorophenyl.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn yet another aspect, the invention provides compounds of Formula III:\n\n \n \n\nin which: .\n\n \n \n \nX is O is 0,1, or 2; p is 1 or 2; R\n1\n is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, -CN, -COOH, halogen, C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkyl, C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkoxy, C\n3\n - C\n6\n cycloalkyl, C\n3\n - C\n6\n cycloalkyloxy, aryl, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkylcarbonyl, and C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkoxycarbonyl; Ar is an aryl group Ar is an aryl group containing between 1 and 3 rings, containing optionally from 1-4 heteroatoms, selected from nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen, and optionally substituted with one or more substituents independently selected from hydroxyl group, halogen, thiol, cyano, nitro, amino, -NR\n12\nR\n13\n, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkylthio, arylthio, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylcarbonyloxy, arylcarbonyloxy, C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkyloxy, C\n2\n-C\n6\n alkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\n akynyl, aryl, carboxylate, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkylcarbonyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkylcarbonyl, heterocyclylcarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkoxycarbonyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkyloxycarbonyl, heterocyclyloxycarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl , C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkoxycarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl and a heterocyclyl group, R\n3\n is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, amino, C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkyl, C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkoxy, C\n3\n - C\n6\n cycloalkyl, C\n3\n - C\n6\n cycloalkyloxy, aryl, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n- C\n6\n alkylcarbonyl, and C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkoxycarbonyl; and L is a C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkyl group or an aryl group; or a salt thereof. Compounds of Formula III are useful, for example, for preparing additional compounds of Formula I, as described herein. For example, the group S(O)\nn\nL in which n is 2 is generally a leaving group suitable for displacement by an nucleophile, including oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles known in the art. For compounds of Formula III in which n is 0 or 1, oxidation of the thioalkyl sulfur atom can be accomplished, preferably in a selective manner, to provide compounds suitable for nucleophilic displacement. As described herein, Oxone™ is a preferred oxidant for this purpose. Salts forms of compounds of Formula III may include phamaceutically-acceptable salts such as those described hereinbelow.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of Formula III can be prepared by the methods described herein, or by other methods that will be apparent to the ordinarily-skilled artisan. For example, as described herein, compounds of Formula III can be prepared by reaction of a compound of Formula II with a 4-halo-2-alkylthiopyrimidine under Heck conditions. The metal catalyst for the Heck reaction is typically a palladium catalyst, such as Pd(OAc)\n2\n. Preferably, additives such as triphenyl phosphine or bases such as cesium carbonate can be used to facilitate the reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the reaction of a compound of Formula III with a nucleophile of the formula HOR\n4\n or HNR\n4\nR\n5\n, it is generally convenient to perform the reaction in the presence of a base to act as a proton sponge; hindered amine bases such as Hunig's base are useful for this purpose when an amine nucleophile is to be used for displacing the sulfone moiety of the compound of Formula III. Other hindered amine bases such as 2,6-lutidine may also be useful for this purpose. If oxygen nucleophiles are used for the displacement reaction, other bases, such as potassium carbonate (see, e.g., Example 3, \ninfra\n), can be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, the invention provides methods for making compounds of Formula III. The method includes reacting a compound represented by Formula IV:\n\n \n \n\nin which:\n\n \n \n \nX is O; n is 1 or 2; R\n1\n is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, -CN, -COOH, halogen, C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkyl, C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkoxy, C\n3\n - C\n6\n cycloalkyl, C\n3\n - C\n6\n cycloalkyloxy, aryl, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkylcarbonyl, and C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkoxycarbonyl; and Ar is an aryl group Ar is an aryl group containing between 1 and 3 rings, containing optionally from 1-4 heteroatoms, selected from nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen, and optionally substituted with one or more substituents independently selected from hydroxyl group, halogen, thiol, cyano, nitro, amino, NR\n12\nR\n13\n, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkylthio, arylthio, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylcarbonyloxy, arylcarbonyloxy, C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkyloxy, C\n2\n-C\n6\n alkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\n akynyl, aryl, carboxylate, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkylcarbonyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkylcarbonyl, heterocyclylcarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkoxycarbonyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkyloxycarbonyl , heterocyclyloxycarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkoxycarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl and a heterocyclyl group; or a salt thereof,\n \nwith a compound represented by Formula V:\n\n \n \n\nin which:\n \nZ is selected from the group consisting of halogen, triflate, mesylate, or another suitable group; p is 1 or 2; R\n3\n is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, amino, C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkyl, C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkoxy, C\n3\n - C\n6\n cycloalkyl, C\n3\n - C\n6\n cycloalkyloxy, aryl, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n- C\n6\n allcylcarbonyl, and C\n1\n- C\n6\n alkoxycarbonyl; Y is S(O)\nn\nL; n is 0, 1, or 2; and L is a C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkyl group; or a salt thereof, in the presence of a metal catalyst and under conditions such that the compound of Formula III is formed, thereby preparing the compound of Formula III. The compounds of Formula IV can be prepared as described herein (e.g., as shown in \nFigures 1\n and \n2\n and described in Examples 1 and 2), or may be prepared according to methods that are known or will be apparent to the skilled artisan in light of the teachings herein. In preferred embodiments of Formula IV, X is O; Ar is phenyl or naphthyl, most preferably phenyl; in certain preferred embodiments, the phenyl group is substituted, e.g., with 1-3 halogen, trifluoromethyl, or C\n1\n - C\n6\n alkoxy substituents. In certain preferred embodiments, the phenyl group is selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted phenyl, 4-fluorophenyl, 3-methoxyphenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl, 3,4-difluorophenyl, 4-methylphenyl, 4-bromophenyl, 3-fluorophenyl, and 4-trifluoromethylphenyl. A most preferred phenyl group is 4-fluorophenyl. In preferred embodiments, R\n1\n is H for all occurrences. In a most preferred embodiment, X is O, R\n1\n is H and Ar is 4-fluorophenyl. Compounds of Formula V have been reported in the literature (e.g., 4-iodo-2-methylthio pyrimidine; see, e.g., \n \nPCT publication WO 02/04447 (2002\n \n)). Additional compounds of Formula V can be prepared by the skilled artisan in light of the teachings herein using no more than routine experimentation.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nA method for preparing imidazooxazole compounds of the invention is described in the Examples below and illustrated in \nFigure 1\n. In \nFigure 1\n, step a, a suitably substituted α-haloketone 1 (in which Ar is an aryl moiety) is reacted with an optionally substituted 2-\naminooxazole\n 2. This reaction is typically conducted in inert organic solvent such as acetonitrile or similar at room temperature. The \nproduct\n 3 is typically isolated from the reaction mixture as a solid hydrogen bromide salt by filtration. The cyclization of \ncompound\n 3 to yield the \nimidazooxazole compound\n 4, indicated as step b in \nFigure 1\n, is conveniently performed by the addition of a dehydrating regent, such as titanium tetrachloride, to the product from step a. This reaction, following appropriate pH modification of the resulting reaction mixture, provides 4. Coupling of 4 with a suitably substituted \npyrimidine\n 5 to produce \ncompound\n 6 is most frequently conducted with palladium catalysis as shown in step c of \nFigure 1\n. Palladium catalysts suitable for Heck-type reactions are generally preferred. This reaction is typically carried out at elevated temperatures in anhydrous solvents, most conveniently dimethylformamide. A preferred pyrimidine reagent is 4-iodo-2-thiomethylpyrimidine, although other 4-halo-pyrimidines can be employed. Because the Heck-type reaction of \n \ncompounds\n \n 4 and 5 to provide 6 does not always go to completion, a mixture of 4 and 6 may be taken through the next step together, with separation (and preferably recovery and recycling) of the \nunreacted starting material\n 4 at a later stage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe oxidation step d (\nFigure 1\n) can be conducted with a variety of standard oxidants known in the literature. One preferred method is to employ an aqueous solution of Oxone™ at room temperature. Displacement of the sulfone leaving group of 7 in step e with an oxygen or nitrogen nucleophile to provide additional compounds of the invention 8 (in which Y is a group as defined in Formula I) can be carried out using a number of standard procedures depending upon the nature of the new bond being created. In the case of amine nucleophiles, for instance, one preferred method is to conduct the reaction with a salt of a primary or secondary amine in a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution together with a hindered organic base, such as diisopropylethylamine, at an elevated temperature with shaking. Another preferred method is to use the amine free base in excess in hot dimethylsulfoxide with either shaking or stirring. The \ncompounds\n 8 can then be isolated and purified using standard techniques. Further functionalization of \ncompounds\n 8 can be performed, if desired. For example, deprotection to yield an unprotected compound can be performed as is routine to one of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., a protecting group such a t-butoxycarbonyl group can be removed from a protected amine to yield the unprotected amine). Alternatively, formation of amides or sulfonamides can be achieved by acylation of a primary or secondary amine (see, e.g., compounds CCLXXVIII and CCLXXIX of Table 1, prepared from compound CCLXXX).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn analogous method for preparing imidazothiazole compounds of the invention is shown in \nFigure 2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFigure 2\n, step a, a suitably substituted α-haloketone 9 (in which Ar is an aryl moiety) is reacted with an optionally-substituted 2-\naminothiazole\n 10 to yield the fused \nheterocycle\n 11. This reaction is typically conducted in inert organic solvent such as ethanol or the like, optionally at elevated temperatures. Coupling of 11 with a suitably substituted \npyrimidine\n 5 to yield 12 is most frequently conducted with palladium catalysis as in step b, \nFigure 2\n. This reaction is typically carried out at elevated temperatures in anhydrous solvents, most preferably dimethylformamide. A preferred pyrimidine reagent is 4-iodo-2-thiomethylpyrimidine, although other halopyrimidines may be employed. The thiomethyl group of \n12\n can be oxidized in step c to provide a sulfone group suitable for displacement reaction in step d. The oxidation step c can be conducted with a variety of standard oxidants known in the literature. A preferred method is to employ an aqueous solution of Oxone™ at room temperature, which advantageously does not cause excessive oxidation of the imidazothiazole sulfur atom. Displacement of the leaving group of \n13\n in step d with an oxygen or nitrogen nucleophile to provide additional compounds of the invention \n14\n (in which Y is a group as defined in Formula I) can be carried out using a number of standard procedures depending upon the nature of the new bond being created. In the case of amine nucleophiles, for instance, one preferred method is to conduct the reaction of \n13\n with a salt of a primary or secondary amine, in a dimethylsulfoxide solution together with a hindered organic base, such as diisopropylethylamine, at an elevated temperature with shaking. Another preferred method is to use the amine free base in excess in hot dimethylsulfoxide with either shaking or stirring. As described above, further functionalization of \nproducts\n \n14\n can then be performed if desired.\n\n\n \n\n\nIII.

Again, the compound of the invention is preferably a compound of Formula I. Alternatively, the compound may be a compound of Formula II, Formula III, Formula IV, or Formula V, or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"p38-associated condition\" means a disease or other deleterious condition in which the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway is implicated, whether directly or indirectly. This includes, but is not limited to, conditions caused by IL-1, TNFα, IL-6 or IL-8 dysregulation or overexpression resulting from sustained, prolonged, enhanced or elevated levels of p38 activity.

In a preferred embodiment, the p38-associated condition is a condition associated with p38α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"modulating p38 activity\" means increasing or decreasing p38 activity, whether \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo.\n Modulating p38 activity preferably means decreasing (inhibiting) p38 activity. In certain preferred embodiments, p38 activity in a cell is inhibited by at least 20%, more preferably at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 99% compared to the p38 activity of an untreated control cell. In preferred embodiments, p38 activity in a cell (or tissue) is restored to a normal range for the cell (or tissue) type upon treatment according to the methods of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention considers methods for treating disease conditions associated with a cytokine or cytokines. The method includes administering a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of the invention to a subject in need thereof. Again, the compound of the invention is preferably a compound of Formula I. Alternatively, the compound may be a compound of Formula II, Formula III, Formula IV, or Formula V, or any combination thereof. In a preferred embodiment, at least one of the cytokine or cytokines is preferably selected from the group consisting of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα. In a more preferred embodiment, all of the cytokine or cytokines are selected from the group consisting of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα. By way of non-limiting example, the methods include administering to a subject in need of treatment (e.g., a mammal in need of such treatment) an effective amount of a compound of the invention. A subject may include one or more cells or tissues, or organisms. A preferred subject is a mammal. A mammal may include any mammal. As a non-limiting example, preferred mammals include cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, horses, camels, buffalo, cats, dogs, rats, mice, and humans. A highly preferred subject mammal is a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA condition associated with altered cytokine activity, as used herein, refers to a condition in which cytokine activity is altered compared to a non-diseased state. This includes, but is not limited to, conditions caused by IL-1, TNFα, IL-6 or IL-8 overproduction or dysregulation resulting in sustained, prolonged, enhanced or elevated levels of cytokine activity, which may be associated with p38 activity. Such conditions include, without limitation, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone disorders, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, allergies, reperfusion/ischemia in stroke, heart attacks, angiogenic disorders, organ hypoxia, vascular hyperplasia, cardiac hypertrophy, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, and conditions associated with the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase signaling pathways, such as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2. A cytokine-associated condition can include any condition associated with or mediated by IL-1 (particularly IL-1 β), TNFα, IL-6 or IL-8, or any other cytokine which can be regulated by p38. In preferred embodiments, the cytokine-associated condition is a condition associated with TNFα.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"therapeutically effective amount\" and \"prophylactically effective amount\", as used herein, refer to an amount of a compound of the invention sufficient to treat, ameliorate, or prevent the identified disease or condition, or to exhibit a detectable therapeutic, prophylactic, or inhibitory effect. The effect can be detected by, for example, the assays disclosed in the following examples. The precise effective amount for a subject will depend upon the subject's body weight, size, and health; the nature and extent of the condition; and the therapeutic or combination of therapeutics selected for administration. Therapeutically and prophylactically effective amounts for a given situation can be determined by routine experimentation that is within the skill and judgment of the clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor any compound, the therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays, e.g., of neoplastic cells, or in animal models, usually rats, mice, rabbits, dogs, or pigs. The animal model may also be used to determine the appropriate concentration range and route of administration. Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans. Therapeutic/prophylactic efficacy and toxicity may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., ED\n50\n (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population) and LD\n50\n (the dose lethal to 50% of the population). The dose ratio between therapeutic and toxic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can be expressed as the ratio, ED\n50\n/LD\n50\n. Pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies may be used in formulating a range of dosage for human use. The dosage contained in such compositions is preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include an ED\n50\n with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed, sensitivity of the patient, and the route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore specifically, the initial target plasma concentration may range from approximately 5 µg/mL to approximately 100 µg/mL, preferably from approximately 10 µg/mL to approximately 100 µg/mL, more preferably from approximately 20 µg/mL to approximately 100 µg/mL. To achieve such plasma concentrations, the compounds of the invention may be administered at doses that vary from 0.1 µg to 100,000 mg, depending upon the route of administration. Guidance as to particular dosages and methods of delivery is provided in the literature and is generally available to practitioners in the art. In general the dose will be in the range of about 1mg/day to about 10g/day, or about 0.1 g to about 3g/day, or about 0.3g to about 3g/day, or about 0.5g to about 2g/day, in single, divided, or continuous doses for a patient weighing between about 40 to about 100 kg (which dose may be adjusted for patients above or below this weight range, particularly children under 40 kg).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe exact dosage will be determined by the practitioner, in light of factors related to the subject that requires treatment. Dosage and administration are adjusted to provide sufficient levels of the active agent(s) or to maintain the desired effect. Factors which may be taken into account include the severity of the disease state, general health of the subject, age, weight, and gender of the subject, diet, time and frequency of administration, drug combination(s), reaction sensitivities, and tolerance/response to therapy. Long-acting pharmaceutical compositions may be administered every 3 to 4 days, every week, or once every two weeks depending on half-life and clearance rate of the particular formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above methods can also be used to treat autoimmune diseases and diseases associated with acute and chronic inflammation. These diseases include, but are not limited to: rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatoid spondylitis; osteoarthritis; gout, other arthritic conditions; sepsis; septic shock; endotoxic shock; gram-negative sepsis; toxic shock syndrome; myofacial pain syndrome (MPS); Shigellosis; asthma; adult respiratory distress syndrome; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic pulmonary inflammation; inflammatory bowel disease; Crohn's disease; psoriasis; eczema; ulcerative colitis; glomerular nephritis; scleroderma; chronic thyroiditis; Grave's disease; autoimmune gastritis; myasthenia gravis; autoimmune hemolytic anemia; autoimmune neutropenia; thrombocytopenia; pancreatic fibrosis; chronic active hepatitis including hepatic fibrosis; acute and chronic renal disease; irritable bowel syndrome; pyresis; restenosis; cerebral malaria; stroke and ischemic injury; neural trauma; Alzheimer's disease; Huntington's disease; Parkinson's disease; acute and chronic pain; allergies, including allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis; cardiac hypertrophy, chronic heart failure; acute coronary syndrome; cachexia; malaria; leprosy; leishmaniasis; Lyme disease; Reiter's syndrome; acute synovitis; muscle degeneration, bursitis; tendonitis; tenosynovitis; herniated, ruptured, or prolapsed intervertebral disk syndrome; osteopetrosis; thrombosis; silicosis; pulmonary sarcosis; bone resorption diseases, such as osteoporosis or multiple myeloma-related bone disorders; cancer, including but not limited to metastatic breast carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, malignant melanoma, gastric cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer; graft-versus-host reaction; and auto-immune diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis, lupus and fibromyalgia; AIDS and other viral diseases such as Herpes Zoster, Herpes Simplex I or II, influenza virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and cytomegalovirus; and diabetes mellitus.

A preferred route of administration is oral administration. Administration may take the form of single dose administration, or the compound of the invention can be administered over a period of time, either in divided doses or in a continuous-release formulation or administration method (e.g., a pump). However the compounds of the invention are administered to the subject, the amounts of compound administered and the route of administration chosen should be selected to permit efficacious treatment of the disease condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods also include the use of a compound or compounds of the invention together with one or more additional therapeutic agents for the treatment of disease conditions. Thus, for example, in certain embodiments, considered is the use of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, in combination with other pharmaceutically active agents in the treatment of disease. Pharmaceutically active agents include any pharmaceutical agents that are useful for the treatment of any disease condition. In one non-limiting example, the compounds of the invention are pharmaceutically active agents that can be combined with other pharmaceutically active agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Such other pharmaceutically active agents include, but are not limited to: matrix metalloprotease inhibitors and other DMARDs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, penicillamine, cyclosporin A, gold sodium thiomalate, auroanofin and aurothioglucose; CD8 antagonists; anti-TNFα agents; immunosuppressants and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatories).

When delivered in alternation therapy, the methods of the invention may comprise administering or delivering the active ingredients sequentially, e.g., in separate solution, emulsion, suspension, tablets, pills or capsules, or by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in simultaneous therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together. Various sequences of intermittent combination therapy may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, methods are provided for inhibiting the activity of p38 in a cell, \nin vitro or in vivo\n. The methods include contacting a cell or tissue containing p38 with an effective p38-inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention, under conditions such that p38 activity in the cell or tissue is inhibited. Contacting a cell refers to a condition in which a compound or other composition of matter is in direct contact with a cell or tissue, or is close enough to induce a desired biological effect in a cell or tissue. For example, contacting a cell or tissue containing p38 with a compound of the invention may be conducted by any means that permits an interaction between p38 and the compound of the invention, resulting in the desired biological effect in a cell. Contacting a cell or tissue may be accomplished, for example, by introduction of a compound of the invention such as a Formula I compound, prodrug or intermediate. Contacting a cell or tissue may be accomplished by introduction of a pharmaceutical composition. Contacting a cell or tissue may be accomplished by direct introduction of the active compound to the cell or tissue containing p38. Alternatively, for example, contacting a cell or tissue may be accomplished by introducing a compound in a manner that the compound will be targeted, directly or indirectly, to a cell or tissue containing p38. Contacting a cell or tissue may be accomplished under conditions such that a compound of the invention, preferably Formula I, can bind to p38 protein. Such conditions may include proximity of the compound and p38-containing cell or tissue, pH, temperature, or any condition that affects the binding of a compound of the invention to p38 protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, considered is a method for modulating p38 activity in a cell or secreted by a cell. The method includes contacting a cell containing p38 with an effective p38-inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention, under conditions such that p38 activity in the cell is modulated (more preferably, inhibited). In certain embodiments, the cell is contacted with the compound of the invention \nin vitro;\n in other embodiments, the cell is contacted with the compound of the invention \nin vivo.\n In certain embodiments, the compound of the invention is provided in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier., ,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, considered is a method for modulating cytokine activity or levels in a cell. The method includes contacting a cell containing cytokines with an effective cytokine-inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention, under conditions such that cytokine activity or levels in the cell are modulated (more preferably, inhibited). In certain embodiments, the cell is contacted with the compound of the invention \nin vitro;\n in other embodiments, the cell is contacted with the compound of the invention \nin vivo.\n In certain embodiments, the compound of the invention is provided in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, considered are methods for determining whether a compound of Formula I is potentially useful as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of p38- or cytokine-associated conditions. In some embodiments, the methods comprise contacting p38 with a compound of the invention, and determining whether the compound of the invention modulates (preferably, inhibits) the activity of p38. In some embodiments, the methods comprise contacting p38 with a compound of the invention, and determining whether the compound of the invention modulates (preferably, inhibits) the activity of cytokines. In preferred embodiments, the contacting step takes place \nin vitro;\n in certain preferred embodiments, the contacting step comprises contacting a cell comprising p38 with a compound of Formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above methods have many uses. For example, methods of inhibiting p38 activity \nin vitro\n may be useful, e.g., in developing screening assays (e.g., as a positive control), or as a research or diagnostic tool for studying the role of p38 in cellular function (e.g., inhibiting p38 to determine the effect of such inhibition on other functions in the cell). Especially useful for this purpose are compounds of the invention in which the compounds contain a label or tag such as a radioisotope or a fluorescent label. Such labeled compounds can be used in methods for detecting or determining the presence, activity or distribution of p38 in a cell or a tissue type, e.g., by contacting a cell or tissue with a labeled compound of the invention, and then detecting the presence or absence of the label in the cell or tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, diagnostic tests are contemplated. For example, a tissue biopsy sample can be taken from a subject suffering from a p38-associated or cytokine-associated condition. The biopsy sample can be tested to determine the level of p38 activity (or cytokine levels) present in the sample; the sample can then be contacted with a compound of the invention, and the p38 activity (or cytokine levels) measured to determine whether the compound of Formula I has a desired effect (e.g., inhibition of p38 or cytokine activity). Such a test could be used to determine whether treatment with a compound of the invention is likely to be effective in that subject. Alternatively, the sample could be contacted with a labeled compound of the invention (e.g., a fluorescently-labeled compound) and the sample then examined (e.g., under a confocal microscope) to determine the distribution of p38 in the tissue sample. Repeated biopsy samples taken during a course of treatment could also be used to study the efficacy of the treatment. Other diagnostic tests using the compounds of the invention will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings of this specification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, for example, the invention considers methods for determining the presence, location, or quantity, or any combination thereof of p38 protein in a cell or tissue sample. The methods include a) contacting the cell or tissue sample with a compound of the invention under conditions such that the compound can bind to p38 protein; and b) determining the presence, location, or quantity, or any combination thereof of the compound of the invention in the cell or tissue sample, thereby determining the presence, location, or quantity, or any combination thereof of p38 protein in the cell or tissue sample. Determining the presence, location, or quantity, or any combination thereof of the compound of the invention in the cell or tissue sample may be conducted by any means that reveals the presence, location, or quantity, or any combination thereof of the compound in the cell or tissue. For example, as described previously, radioactive or fluorescent labeling methods may be used. Additional methods of determining the presence, location, or quantity, or any combination thereof of a compound of the invention will be apparent to a skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, considered are methods for determining (1) whether a compound of the invention will be a useful therapeutic agent for treatment of a subject suffering from a p38-associated condition, or (2) the severity of disease or (3) the course of disease during treatment with a disease-modifying agent. The methods include: a) obtaining a cell or tissue sample from the subject before, during and after termination of treatment with a compound of the invention or another disease-modifying agent; b) contacting the sample with a compound of the invention; and c) determining the amount of the compound of the invention that binds to the sample, wherein binding to p38 protein by the compound is related to the amount of p38 protein in the sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, considered are methods for determining (1) whether a compound of the invention will be a useful therapeutic agent for treatment of a subject suffering from a cytokine-associated condition, or (2) the severity of disease or (3) the course of disease during treatment with a disease-modifying agent. The methods include: a) obtaining a cell or tissue sample from the subject before, during and after termination of treatment with a compound of the invention or another disease-modifying agent; b) contacting the sample with a compound of the invention and c) determining the amount of the compound of the inventionthat binds to the sample, wherein binding to p38 protein by the compound is related to the amount of p38 protein in the sample, and the amount of p38 in the sample is related to the quantity of cytokines released. In an exemplary embodiment, such a method may be conducted by obtaining cells from a cancer cell line, contacting cells from the cancer cell line, such as, for example, cells from a metastatic breast carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, malignant melanoma, gastric cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer line with a compound of the present invention and determining the binding.\n\n\n \n\n\nIV.

As such, in yet another aspect of the invention, pharmaceutical compositions useful in the methods of the invention are provided. More particularly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be useful, \ninter alia,\n for treating conditions associated with p38 activity or cytokine activity or any combination thereof.

When intended for oral use for example, tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, non-aqueous solutions, dispersible powders or granules (including micronized particles or nanoparticles), emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups or elixirs may be prepared. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions, and such compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable excipients particularly suitable for use in conjunction with tablets include, for example, inert diluents, such as celluloses, calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium phosphate; disintegrating agents, such as croscarmellose sodium, cross-linked povidone, maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as povidone, starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for oral use may be also presented as hard gelatin capsules where the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example celluloses, lactose, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with non-aqueous or oil medium, such as glycerin, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be formulated as suspensions comprising a compound of the present invention in admixture with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient suitable for the manufacture of a suspension.

Biol. Chem., 270: 7420-7426, 1995\n, \nBrinkman, M. N., et al, J. Bil. Chem. 274: 30882-30886, 1999\n and \nFuchs, S. Y. et al, J. Biol. Chem. 275: 12560-12564, 2000\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMaterials:\n All kinases and the substrate ATF2 are acquired from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). p38 MAP Kinases are recombinant human full-length proteins with an amino-terminal GST fusion, expressed in and purified from \nE. coli.\n ATF2 is a GST fusion protein containing amino acids 19-96 of human ATF2 expressed in \nE\n. \ncoli.\n All proteins were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMethods:\n p38 MAP Kinase assays are performed using an assay buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 2 mM DTT, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 40 µM ATP and 1.25 µM of ATF2, together with 6ng of p38α protein, 12ng p38β protein, 1.5ng p38γ, or 0.4ng JNK2α2. Compounds are serially diluted in DMSO and 2 µL of test compound at 25x final concentration is used. The vehicle control receives DMSO only. Test compounds are pre-incubated with 20 µl of enzyme in kinase buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 2 mM DTT, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate and 0.1 mM Na\n3\n VO\n4\n) at room temperature for 15 minutes. Reactions are initiated by addition of 30 µl substrate solution to yield a final concentration of 40 µM ATP and 1.25 µM ATF2 in kinase buffer. The reactions are incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 18 µl of 200 mM EDTA. An ELISA method is used to measure the phosphorylation of ATF2 at Thr 69. High binding 96-well plates (Corning 3369) are coated with 50 µl of kinase reaction for 1 hour at 37 °C. The coated plates are washed with 200 µl washing buffer (25 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mM glycine, 0.1%SDS and 0.05% Tween-20) three times. The plates are then washed three times with SuperBlock in TBS (Pierce, 37535). After blocking, plates are incubated with 50 µl of rabbit anti-phospho-ATF2 antibody (Cell Signaling, 9221L, 1:500) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Plates are washed three times with washing buffer prior to incubation with 50 µl HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling, 7074, 1:500) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Plates are then washed three times with washing buffer before incubation with 50 µl of Ultra TMB-ELISA (Pierce, 34028) for 8 minutes at room temperature. Finally, 50 µl of phosphoric acid (1 M) is added to stop reactions and plate absorbance is read at 450 nm on a SpectraMax 250 plate reader.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nResults:\n The results of the p38α assay for certain compounds of the invention are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. It is found that compounds of the invention inhibit the phosphorylation of ATF2 in this \nin vitro\n assay. Preferred compounds exhibit IC\n50\n values of less than 500 nM, more preferably less than 100 nM, and still more preferably less than 20 nM.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are screened for the ability to inhibit TNFα and IL-1β release from THP-1 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) \nin vitro.\n The ability of compounds to inhibit TNFα and IL-1β release in this \nin vitro\n assay is correlated with the inhibition of p38 activity and TNFα and IL-1β expression \nin vivo,\n and is therefore an indicator of potential \nin vivo\n therapeutic activity (\nLee J. C. et al, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 696: 149-170, 1993\n and \nNature, 372: 739-746, 1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMaterials:\n THP-1 cells from ATCC (TIB202) are maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO\n2\n in RPMI 1640 media (MediaTech, Herndon, VA) containing 4.5 g/L glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 50 µM β-mercaptoethanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMethods:\n Test compounds are initially dissolved in RPMI media with 1% DMSO (v/v). Compounds are then serially diluted in RPMI media for all subsequent dilutions. The assay is performed under sterile conditions. THP-1 cells at a culture density of 6-8 \nx\n 10\n5\n cells/ml are collected and resuspended in the RPMI media at 10\n6\n cells/ml. 100 µl of resuspended cells are added to each well, which contain 100 µl of a test compound. Test compounds are prepared at twice the final concentration. Final DMSO concentration is no more than 0.5 % (v/v). Cells are preincubated with compound for 30 minutes at 37°C, 5% CO\n2\n prior to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma L-2880, 4 mg/ml stock in PBS). The final LPS concentration in each well is 10 or 30 µg/ml for TNFα and IL-1β release, respectively. Unstimulated control cell suspensions receive PBS vehicle only. Cell mixtures are incubated for 18 or 48 hours for TNFα and IL-1β release, respectively. 150 µl of supernatants are taken and transferred to a fresh plate and stored at -20°C until further analysis. TNFα and IL-1β levels are measured using ELISA kits (Biosource (KHC3012 for TNFα ; KAC1192 for IL-1β). A SpectraMAX 250 is used as the plate reader. Analysis is performed by non-linear regression to generate a dose response curve. The calculated IC\n50\n value is the concentration of the test compound that causes a 50 % decrease in TNFα or IL-1β levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nResults:\n Compounds of the invention inhibit the release of TNFα, IL-1β or both TNFα, and IL-1β in this \nin vitro\n assay. The TNFα inhibition data for certain compounds of the invention are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Preferred compounds exhibit IC\n50\n values for TNFα and/or IL-1β of less than 500 nM, more preferred compounds less than 200 nM, still more preferred compounds less than 100 nM, and even still more preferred compounds less than 20 nM.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are screened for the ability to inhibit TNFα release from primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) \nin vitro.\n The ability of compounds to inhibit TNFα release in this \nin vitro\n assay is correlated with the inhibition of p38 activity and is therefore an indicator of potential \nin vivo\n therapeutic activity (\nOsteoarthritis & Cartilage, 10: 961-967, 2002\n and \nLaufer, S. A. and Wagner, G. K., J. Med. Chem. 45: 2733-2740, 2002\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMaterials and Methods:\n Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are isolated by differential centrifugation through a Ficoll-HyPaque density gradient from pooled serum of 3-8 individual blood donors. Isolated PBMC contain approximately 10% CD-14 positive monocytes, 90% lymphocytes and <1% granulocytes and platelets. PBMC (10\n6\n/ml) are cultured in polystyrene plates and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 50 ng/ml; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in the presence and absence of compound, in duplicate, for 24 hr at 37°C in GIBCO\n™\n RPMI medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) without serum. The TNFα level in cell supernatants is determined by ELISA using a commercially available kit (MDS Panlabs # 309700).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nResults\n: Preferred compounds of the invention inhibit the release of TNFα in this assay with an IC\n50\n value of less than 500 nM, more preferably less than 100nM, and still more preferably less than 20nM.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are screened for the ability to inhibit the release of TNFα in an \nin vivo\n animal model.

Thirty minutes following end of infusion or bolus injection, and 1-2 hr following oral administration, lipopolysaccharide \nE. coli\n/0127:B8 (0.8 mg/kg) is administered IV. Blood samples are collected 1.5 hours post-treatment with LPS. Serum TNFα levels are determined using the ELISA kit from Biosource (KRC3011C) and compared to that from vehicle-treated control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nResults\n: Preferred compounds of the invention inhibit the release of TNFα in this \nin vivo\n assay. Preferred compounds delivered intravenously exhibit an ED\n50\n value of less than 20 mg/kg, more preferably less than 5mg/kg, and still more preferably less than 1 mg/kg.

The p38β, p38γ, and JNK2α2 assays are described in Example 4. The Src\np60\n assay measure the ability of compounds to inhibit Src\np60\n-catalyzed phosphorylation of a peptide substrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMethods\n: Compounds are serially diluted in DMSO and 1 µL of test compound at 25x final concentration is used. The vehicle control receives DMSO only. Test compounds are pre-incubated with 10 µL of water containing 5.3 units of Src\np60\n enzyme (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) at room temperature for 15 minutes.

Female Lewis rats (0.16-0.2 kg) are injected subcutaneously at the base of the tail and two sites on the back on \n \nday\n \n 0 and 6 with 300 µl of Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant containing 2 mg/ml of Bovine Type II Collagen. On \nday\n 9 of the study, caliper measurements of both hind leg ankle joints are performed. This measurement is considered the normal, pre-disease measurement. When ankle swelling is clearly established in at least one hind paw (caliper measurement increase from 0.263 to 0.282 inches), rats are enrolled into the treatment phase of the study. This occurs on \n \nday\n \n 10 or 11 of the study and is considered to be \nday\n 1 of arthritis. Enrolled animals are randomized and administered vehicle control or compound (1, 3.3, 10, or 30 mg/kg, bid), unless otherwise indicated, or dexamethasone (0.0375 mg/kg, bid) via oral gavage on days 1-7 of arthritis (treatment days). Ankle diameters are measured on each day of treatment. Mean increases in ankle diameter for 7 lead compounds are shown below in \nFigures 3-9\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing sacrifice on \nday\n 7, both hind paws are removed from each animal and weighed. Knees and ankles from all animals in all groups are preserved, decalcified in 5% formic acid and trimmed into two approximately equal longitudinal (ankles) or frontal (knees) haves, dehydrated, cleared, infiltrated, and embedded in paraffin. Blocks are sectioned and stained with Toluidine Blue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTissues are examined microscopically and scored for knee and ankle inflammation (cellular infiltration), pannus formation and infiltration, cartilage damage (loss of Toluidine staining and collagen disruption) and bone resorption. Scoring is on a scale from 0-5, where a score of 0 is normal and a score of 5 indicates severe damage or evidence of disease or both.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nResults\n: Tested compounds show dose-dependent inhibition of clinical and histopathologic parameters of arthritis, including inflammation and bone damage.

Description\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to carbazole derivatives, solvates thereof, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as well as medical compositions and medicines containing such compounds. To be more specific, the present invention relates to novel carbazole derivatives, solvates thereof, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and the like having an excellent adipose tissue weight reducing effect, hypoglycemic effect, and hypolipidemic effect, which are useful as a preventive and/or therapeutic agent for fatty liver, obesity, lipid metabolism abnormality, visceral adiposity, diabetes, hyperlipemia, impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and the like.\n\n\n \nBackground Art\n\n\n \n \n \nIn recent years, lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity and diabetes are brought in question. Accordingly, transcription factors related to expression inductions of adipocyte differentiation marker genes are gaining attention. A peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (hereinafter, also referred to as \"PPAR\") is known to be related to a lot of physiological and/or pathological phenomena such as fat metabolism, regulation of inflammation, cell differentiation, and functional regulation, thereby gaining special attention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PPAR is a nuclear receptor belonging to a steroid/retinoid receptor superfamily of ligand responsive transcription factors (\nCurr. Opin. Chem. Biol., (1997), 1, 235-241\n; \nCell, (1995), 83, 841-850\n). cDNAs of PPAR are cloned from various animal species and several isoform genes of PPAR are found. Among mammals, three subtypes, PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARδ, are known (\nJ. Steroid Biochem. Molec. Biol., (1994), 51, 157\n; \nGene Expression, (1995), 4, 281\n; \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., (1996), 224, 431\n; \nMol. Endocrinol., (1992), 6, 1634\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PPARγ is known to be expressed mainly in the adipose tissue, immune organ, adrenal gland, spleen, small intestine, skeletal muscle, and liver. On the other hand, the PPARα is known to be expressed mainly in the liver, heart, kidney, adrenal gland, skeletal muscle, and retina. Also, the PPARδ is known to be universally expressed without tissue specificity. Each of the PPARs forms a stable heterodimer with a retinoid X receptor (RXR), and bind with a specific DNA recognition sequence (PPRE) of the target gene for control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PPARγ is induced at a very early phase of an adipocyte differentiation and plays an important role in the adipocyte differentiation as a key regulating (controlling) factor. The first chemical identified as a direct ligand of PPAR was BRL49653, the thiazolidinediones (TZDs) having an antidiabetic effect on type II diabetes. Also, pioglitazone and ciglitazone that are antidiabetic drugs for type II diabetes and are TZD-type (\nLehmann, J.M., J. (1995) Biol.Chem. 270, 12953-12956\n (non-patent document 1), as well as 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 that is a kind of prostaglandin metabolite (\nCell, (1995), 83, 803-812\n; \nCell, (1995), 83, 813-819\n (non-patent document 2)) are known as candidates for intrinsic ligands of PPARγ. Moreover, thiazolidinedione derivative that is an insulin sensitizer has been proved to increase the transcription activity of the PPARγ, and known to have an insulin resistance improving effect, hypoglycemic effect, and antihyperlipidemic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, since adipocyte hypertrophy, fat accumulation and expression of insulin resistance are suppressed in a PPARγ hetero deficient mouse, a model that the PPARγ mediates adipocyte hypertrophy, fat accumulation and insulin resistance has been proposed (\nMol. Cell, (1999), 4, 597 \n(non-patent document 3)). On the other hand, a thiazolidinedione (TZD) derivative that is a PPARγ agonist is reported to have adipocyte differentiation inductive effect and to increase the number of adipose cells and the weight of adipose tissues (\nJ. Clin. Invest., (1996), 98, 1004-1009\n (non-patent document 4)). Therefore, while the TZD derivative is useful as a curative medicine for diabetes, possibility of promoting obesity is a concern. Also, while leptin is known as an antiobesity factor, the expression level of leptin is reported to decrease when the TZD derivative is administered (\nJ. Biol. Chem., (1996), 271, 9455-9459\n (non-patent document 5)). Based on these backgrounds, the PPARγ antagonist is expected to control the differentiation of the adipose cell while simultaneously increasing the expression level of leptin, thereby acting as an antiobesity agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds that are PPARγ receptor binder having the PPARγ antagonist effect are disclosed by \n \nWO01/30343\n \n, \n \nWO02/060388\n \n, \n \nWO03/000685\n \n, \n \nWO2004/024705\n \n, and the like. These compounds are supposed to have an antiobesity effect, an adipose tissue weight reducing effect, a hypoglycemic effect, a hypolipidemic effect, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, \n \nWO01/26653\n \n, \n \nWO02/00255\n \n, \n \nWO02/00256\n \n, \n \nWO02/00257\n \n, and \n \nWO02/074342\n \n (patent documents 1-5) disclose the following compound as a carbazole derivative.

expressed in the transient transfection of reporter plasmid (see reference 5a) were washed once with PBS(100 µL/well), and then supplemented with 100 µL/well of DMEM medium including 10% of fetal bovine serum to which test compounds at final concentrations of 10 nM, 30 nM, 100 nM, 300 nM, 1 µM, and 3 µM, as well as pioglitazone (not limited to pioglitazone shown as an example, but may be any PPARγ agonist) at a final concentration of 1 µM as a stimulant were added, and incubated in a 5% CO\n2\n incubator at 37 °C for 24 hours. After removing the medium, the CV-1 cells were washed once with PBS(100 µL/well), and supplemented with 60 µL/well of 1×Passive Lysis Buffer (manufactured by Promega Corporation). The CV-1 cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes, stirred, and then by using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (manufactured by Promega Corporation), luciferase activities of firefly and renilla were measured using 1420 ARVO Multilabel Counter (manufactured by Wallac Oy). Also, the same experiments as that described above were respectively carried out for the cases where only the above-mentioned stimulants (100 nM, 1 µM, 10 µM) were used, where only the above-mentioned test compounds were used, or where neither was used (nonsupplemented), and luciferase activities of firefly and renilla were measured. Values corrected by dividing the firefly luciferase activities by the renilla luciferase activities were calculated as specific activies and used for evaluations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman PPARγ2 antagonist activities of the test compounds were evaluated by using a percentage (inhibition) where the specific activity in case only 1 µM stimulant was added is regarded as 0% and the specific activity in case the test compound and the stimulant were not added is regarded as 100%. Moreover, the concentration of the test compound indicating the inhibition rate of 50% was calculated as the IC\n50\n value. The results are shown in Table 2. Also, human PPARγ2 agonist activities of the test compounds were evaluated by using a percentage (activity) where the specific activity when nonsupplemented is regarded as 0% and the specific activity in case only 10 µM stimulant was added is regarded as 100%, from the specific activity in case only the test compound is used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n          Table. 2 Human PPARγ antagonist activities\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest compound example\n\n\nInhibition IC50(nM)\n\n\nTest compound example\n\n\nInhibition IC\n50\n(nM)\n\n\nTest compound example\n\n\nInhibition IC\n50\n (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n3150\n\n\n21\n\n\n5065\n\n\n41\n\n\n220\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n47.4 % (at 10µM)\n\n\n22\n\n\n122\n\n\n42\n\n\n484\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n420\n\n\n23\n\n\n93\n\n\n43\n\n\n1116\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n939\n\n\n24\n\n\n71\n\n\n44\n\n\n462\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n353\n\n\n25\n\n\n430\n\n\n45\n\n\n596\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n905\n\n\n26\n\n\n546\n\n\n46\n\n\n992\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n1905\n\n\n27\n\n\n688\n\n\n47\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n545\n\n\n28\n\n\n398\n\n\n48\n\n\n2489\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n5139\n\n\n29\n\n\n2463\n\n\n49\n\n\n1051\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n400\n\n\n30\n\n\n983\n\n\n50\n\n\n471\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n281\n\n\n31\n\n\n406\n\n\n51\n\n\n2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n725\n\n\n32\n\n\n422\n\n\n52\n\n\n173\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n5870\n\n\n33\n\n\n1385\n\n\n53\n\n\n382\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n-\n\n\n34\n\n\n85\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n5975\n\n\n35\n\n\n509\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n38.2 % (at 10µM)\n\n\n36\n\n\n596\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n320\n\n\n37\n\n\n354\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n829\n\n\n38\n\n\n330\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n882\n\n\n39\n\n\n617\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n1604\n\n\n40\n\n\n308\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs seen from Table. 2, the compounds of the present invention have excellent PPARγ antagonist activities.\n\n\n \nTest example 2 Compound evaluation by human PPARα antagonist and agonist assay\n\n\n \n \n \nCV-1 cells (96 well plate), where human PPARα and RXRα has expressed in the transient transfection of reporter plasmid (see reference 6a) were washed once with PBS(100 µL/well), and then supplemented with 100 µL/well of DMEM medium including 10% of fetal bovine serum to which test compounds at final concentrations of 10 nM, 30 nM, 100 nM, 300 nM, 1 µM, and 3 µM, as well as GW7647 (not limited to GW7647 shown as an example, but may be any PPARα agonist) at a final concentration of 1 nM as a stimulant were added, and incubated in a 5% CO\n2\n incubator at 37 °C for 24 hours.
