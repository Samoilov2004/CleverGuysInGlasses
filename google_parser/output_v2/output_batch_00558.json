It will be understood that the invention encompasses all optical isomers of the compounds of formula (I) and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions and lipid compositions comprising such compounds, and to such compounds for use as medicaments or for use in therapy, in particular for the treatment of diseases related to the cardiovascular, metabolic and inflammatory disease area.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nUp to date, there has been a lot of research on fatty acid analogues and their effects on diverse physiological processes impacting normal health and chronic diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been shown to regulate plasma lipid levels, cardiovascular and immune functions, insulin action, and neuronal development and visual function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA) is a modified fatty acid which has a number of powerful effects demonstrable both in-vivo and in-vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTTA has properties very similar to natural fatty acids, the main difference being that it cannot be oxidised by the mitochondrial β-oxidation, but significantly increases the oxidation of other fatty acids. Despite the fact that TTA is not able to undergo β-oxidation, it is metabolised in most ways as a normal saturated fatty acid.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTTA affects oxidative status at different levels by having the potential of changing the antioxidant defence system, in addition to being an antioxidant itself through its free radical scavenging capacity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition of TTA may prevent the oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles in plasma and reduce the generation of lipid peroxides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral polyunsaturated fatty acid derivatives with sulfur in 3-position have been prepared (Flock et al, Acta Chemica Scand., 1999, 53, 436). Methyl (all-Z)-3-thia-6,9,12,15-octadecatetraenoate was tested in a Wistar rat model, and the effects were compared to the effects of TTA. The results suggest that both the saturated and the unsaturated fatty acids lowered plasma triglycerides to a similar extent (Willumsen et al, J. Lipid Mediators Cell Signalling, 1997, 17, 115)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has surprisingly been found that novel fatty acid derivatives represented by the general formula (I) have higher affinities for the receptors PPARα and PPARγ compared to TTA and (all-Z)-3-thia-6,9,12,15-octadecatetraenoic acid.

\n \nThe compounds of categories A-E above, were R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare different, are capable of existing in stereoisomeric forms, i.e. all optical isomers of the compounds and mixtures thereof are encompassed. Hence, the said compounds may be present as diastereomers, racemates and enantiomers.\n\n\n \nGeneral Synthetic Methods for the Compounds Described Herein\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of general formula (I) can be prepared by the following general procedures:\n\n\n \nMethod I\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMethod II\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alcohols described in method I and II may be prepared directly from the carboxylic esters of, for example, naturally occurring fatty acids; e.g. alpha-linolenic acid, conjugated linoleic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), etc. by reduction with a reducing agent like lithium aluminiumhydride or diisobutylaluminiumhydride at −10 to 0° C. The alcohols can also be prepared by degradation of the polyunsaturated fatty acids EPA and DHA, as described by Holmeide et al. (\nJ. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. \n1, 2000, 2271). In this case one can start with purified EPA or DHA, but it is also possible to start with fish oil containing EPA and DHA in mixture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (X) and (XI) are commercially available, or they are known in the literature, or they are prepared by standard processes known in the art. The leaving group (LG) present in compounds of formula (XI) may, for example, be mesylate, tosylate or a suitable halogen, such as bromine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing method I, the resulting alcohols can be converted, using functional group interconversion, by methods familiar to persons skilled in the art (step I), to compounds where the terminal hydroxy group have been transformed into a suitable leaving group (LG). Suitable leaving groups include bromine, mesylate and tosylate. These compounds can be reacted further (step II) in a substitution reaction with the appropriately substituted thiol acetic acid derivatives (X), in the presence of base.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing method II, the alcohols can be converted to the corresponding thiols (step IV) by methods familiar to persons skilled in the art. The thiols can then be reacted further (step V) in a substitution reaction with compounds of formula (XI), in the presence of base in an appropriate solvent system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe corresponding sulfoxides and sulfones (Y=SO or SO\n2\n) can be prepared by oxidation of the thioethers (Y=S) with a suitable oxidising agent (step III). Examples of oxidising agents are m-chloro-perbenzoic acid (MCPBA), hydrogen peroxide (H\n2\nO\n2\n) and oxone (potassium peroxymonosulfate). By using 1 equivalent or less of the oxidising agent, the main product will be the sulfoxide. By using an excess oxidising agent, the main product will be the sulfone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the acid derivatives used are carboxylic esters, hydrolysis can be performed to obtain the free fatty acids. An esterifying group such as a methyl of an ethyl group may be removed, for example, by alkaline hydrolysis using a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example LiOH, NaOH or KOH or by using an organic base, for example Et\n3\nN together with an inorganic salt, for example LiCl in an appropriate solvent system. A tert-butyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or formic acid in an appropriate solvent system. An arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon in an appropriate solvent system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation of compounds of formula I, according to method I or II, may result in mixtures of stereoisomers. If required, these isomers may be separated by means of chiral resolving agents and/or by chiral column chromatography through methods known to the person skilled in the art.\n\n\n \nMethod III\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) wherein X is a carboxylic acid and in the form of a phospholipid can be prepared through the following processes.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcylation of sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (GPC) with an activated fatty acid, such as fatty acid imidazolides, is a standard procedure in phosphatidylcholine synthesis. It is usually carried out in the presence of DMSO anion with DMSO as solvent (Hermetter; \nChemistry and Physics of lipids, \n1981, 28, 111). Sn-Glycero-3-phosphocholine, as cadmium (II) adduct can also be reacted with the imidazolide activated fatty acid in the presence of DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene) to prepare the phosphatidylcholine of the respective fatty acid (International application number PCT/GB2003/002582). Enzymatic transphosphatidylation can effect the transformation of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine (Wang et al, \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc., \n1993, 115, 10487).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhospholipids may also be prepared by enzymatic esterification and transesterification of phospholipids or enzymatic transphosphatidylation of phospholipids. (Hosokawa, \nJ. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. \n1995, 1287, Lilja-Hallberg, \nBiocatalysis, \n1994, 195).\n\n\n \nMethod IV\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) wherein X is a carboxylic acid in the form of a triglyceride can be prepared through the following process. Excess of the fatty acid can be coupled to glycerol using dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphate (HBTU).\n\n\n \nMethod V\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) wherein X is a carboxylic acid in the form of a diglyceride can be prepared by reaction of the fatty acid (2 equivalents) with glycerol (1 equivalent) in the presence of 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbondiimide (DCC) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).\n\n\n \nMethod VI\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) wherein X is a carboxylic acid and in the form of a monoglyceride can be prepared through the following processes.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcylation of 1,2-O-isopropylidene-sn-glycerol with a fatty acid using DCC and DMAP in chloroform gives a monodienoylglycerol. Deprotection of the isopropylidene group can be done by treating the protected glycerol with an acidic (HCl, acetic acid etc.) (O'Brian, \nJ. Org. Chem., \n1996, 5914).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are several synthetic methods for the preparation of monoglycerides with the fatty acid in 2-position. One method utilizes esterification of the fatty acid with glycidol in the presence of 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimidehydrochloride (EDC) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to produce a glycidyl derivative. Treatment of the glycidyl derivative with trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) prior to trans-esterification the monoglyceride is obtained (Parkkari et al, \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. \n2006, 2437).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther methods for the preparation of mono-, di- and tri-glycerides of fatty acid derivatives are described in international patent application, PCT/FR02/02831.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible to use enzymatic processes (lipase reactions) for the transformation of a fatty acid to a mono-, di-, tri-glyceride. A 1,3-regiospecific lipase from the fungus \nMucor miehei \ncan be used to produce triglycerides or diglycerides from polyunsaturated fatty acids and glycerol. A different lipase, the non-regiospecific yeast lipase from \nCandida antartica \nis highly efficient in generating triglycerides from polyunsaturated fatty acids (Haraldsson, \nPharmazie, \n2000, 3).\n\n\n \nPreparation, Characterisation and Biological Testing of Specific Fatty Acid Derivatives of Formula (I)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention will now be further described by the following non-limiting examples, in which standard techniques known to the skilled chemist and techniques analogous to those described in these examples may be used where appropriate.

They are structurally unique proteins that are distinct from classical G protein-coupled receptors, ionotropic receptors, or receptor tyrosine kinases. With two subtypes currently known, they modulate cell survival and excitability, and subserve many critical functions in the body. Endogenous ligands for these receptors are unknown, though current clues point to neurosteroids.\n3 \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe two subtypes, σ-1 and σ-2, were delineated by studies examining their respective molecular weights, distribution in tissue and drug selectivity profiles. The 223 amino acid σ-1 protein with two transmembrane spanning regions has been purified and cloned from several animal species including mouse, rat, guinea pig, and human.\n4-8 \nTo date, the σ-1 receptor is well studied and known because of the receptor sequence information and availability of selective σ-1 ligands. But, the protein corresponding to σ-2 sites has not yet been cloned. Also, σ-2 receptor-selective ligands are less common, with tritiated DTG (1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine) being accepted as a radioligand in the presence of (+)-pentazocine (to block binding to σ-1 sites). Due to the lack of availability of detailed protein structural information and truly selective σ-2 ligands, the pharmacological characterization of the σ-2 subtype has been very limited. There is clearly a need for a selective σ-2 ligand which can not only act as a probe to explore unknown biochemical mechanisms, but also be used as a radioligand in σ-2 receptor binding assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe abuse of drugs is a serious social, economic and health problem worldwide. Some of the opiates, cocaine, amphetamines and phencyclidine (PCP) are the drugs of abuse with significant affinities for a receptors. Current treatments for drugs of abuse are limited and there is a need to develop novel and effective agents to combat this problem.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCocaine use and abuse has been reported as early as the late 1500s.\n9 \nThe historical use has been associated with the chewing of leaves from the \nErythroxylon coca \nbush, from which cocaine was isolated in 1860,\n10 \nto eliminate fatigue in workers. Indeed, cocaine is a powerful and addictive psychostimulant. Cocaine abuse is widespread and is responsible for more serious intoxications and deaths than any other illicit drug. However, the invigorating effects of cocaine have caused it to become a major recreational drug of abuse throughout the world with an estimated 13 million people using the drug. In 2004, 34.2 million Americans aged 12 and over reported lifetime use of cocaine with approximately 5.6 million reporting annual use and an estimated 2 million reporting current use of the drug. In 2004 alone, there were an estimated 1 million new users of cocaine amounting to ˜2,700 per day. Despite a decline between 2002 and 2003 which is thought to potentially be due to increases in usage of other stimulants such as methamphetamine, data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health showed near a 70% increase in the number of people receiving treatment for cocaine addiction from 276,000 in 2003 to 466,000 in 2004.\n11 \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCurrently, there are no approved medications to treat cocaine abuse or addiction. An effective strategy used to develop an anti-cocaine agent was the development of antagonists that compete with cocaine for its target proteins. For years, treatment approaches have targeted the dopaminergic system which is known to be involved in the actions and rewards of cocaine use. Many compounds were generated and tested that targeted the dopamine transporter which was identified as a primary site of action of cocaine. These compounds were met with very limited success as many of them just substituted for cocaine.\n12 \nAfter many years of investigation at the dopamine transporter as well as the dopamine receptors, researchers have been challenged to envision novel mechanisms that may afford new therapeutic interventions for cocaine addiction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough many other mechanisms are under investigation, the a receptor system has been demonstrated and validated as a legitimate target for the attenuation of cocaine effects. The ability of cocaine to bind to the sigma receptors was discovered and first documented in 1988.\n13 \nIt was reported that cocaine had micromolar affinity to the sigma receptor, and this interaction corresponded to micromolar levels that were achievable by cocaine in the body.\n14 \nAdditional studies have indicated that reducing brain sigma receptor levels with antisense oligonucleotides attenuates the convulsive and locomotor stimulant actions of cocaine. Synthetic small molecule antagonists for sigma receptors have also been shown to mitigate the actions of cocaine in animal models. From prior work, the role of the σ-1 subtype has been clearly linked to the actions of cocaine. However, the role of the σ-2 receptor has been suggested, but is less clear due to the lack of truly selective ligands for this subtype.\n\n\n \nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compounds useful as sigma receptors of the following formula I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nWherein R\n1 \ncan be an optionally substituted nitrogen-containing heterocycle radical such as, for example, radicals of optionally substituted piperidines, optionally substituted piperazines, optionally substituted tetrahydropyridines, optionally substituted azepanes, tertiary amines (cyclic or acyclic), isoindoline-1,3-dione, or optionally substituted tetrahydroisoquinolones (aromatically substituted): R\n2,3,4,5,6 \ncan each independently be any one or combinations of the following moieties, such as, for example, cyano, nitro, acyl, alkyl, amido, azido, isothiocyanate, isocyanate anilino (unsubstituted or substituted), halogens (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromide and iodine), ethers, sulfonamides, thioacyl, nitro, aromatic, heterocyclic, olefinic, acetylenic, deuterium, or tritium; Y can be either CH, CH\n2\n, O, S, OCH\n2\n, N—R, N—Ar, C—R, C—Ar where Ar is an optionally substituted aryl.

It has been demonstrated that one can substitute the template molecule through several synthetic routes. These routes which can be easily performed utilizing parallel synthesis methodology, can be easily varied to obtain multiple novel ligands. Initial studies focused on exploring the following changes to the molecules through parallel methodologies: 1) varying the methylene spacer between the tertiary amine and heterocycle; 2) modifying substituents to the piperazine nitrogen above the template; 3) modifying the piperazine ring to substitute piperidines, tetrahydropyridines, azepanes and diazepines; 4) modifying the order of heteroatoms in the heterocycle portion of the molecule as well as the connectivity pattern; and 5) substitution on the benzo portion of the heterocycle to probe the space and physicochemical requirements of the σ receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds were analyzed after purification using standard techniques (NMR, IR, LC/MS, HPLC) and converted into hydrochloride salts for water solubility.

The compounds were tested in competition binding assays using rat brain homogenates as previously published. Briefly, the radioligands to label the sites of interest and compounds to define non-specific binding were as follows: dopamine transporters (0.5 nM [\n3\nH]WIN35,428, 50 μM cocaine), serotonin transporters (0.2 nM [\n3\nH]paroxetine, 1.5 μM imipramine), norepinephrine transporters (0.5 nM [\n3\nH]nisoxetine, 4 μM desipramine), opioid receptors (2 nM [\n3\nH]bremazocine, 10 μM levollorphan), NMDA receptors (5 nM [\n3\nH]TCP, 10 μM cyclazocine), dopamine D\n2 \nreceptors (5 nM [\n3\nH](−)-sulpiride, 1 μM haloperidol), and 5-HT\n2 \nreceptors (2 nM [\n3\nH]ketanserin, 1 μM mianserin). The results were reported as K\ni \nin nM.

Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can, for example, be in unit dose form, such as dragees, tablets, capsules, suppositories or ampoules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are manufactured in a manner known per se, for example, by means of conventional mixing, granulating, confectioning, dissolving or lyophilizing processes. Pharmaceutical compositions for oral use can be obtained by combining the active substance with one or more solid carriers, if desired, granulating a resulting mixture and processing the mixture or granulate, if desired or necessary after the addition of suitable adjuncts, to form tablets or dragee cores. In so doing, they can also be incorporated into plastics carriers which release the active substances or allow them to diffuse in controlled amounts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable carriers are especially fillers such as sugars, for example, lactose, saccharose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, for example, tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, also binders such as starches, for example, corn, wheat, rice or potato starch, gelatine, tragacanth, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or, if desired, disintegrators such as the above-mentioned starches, also carboxymethyl starch, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar, alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. Adjuncts are especially flow-regulating and lubricating agents, for example, silica, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof such as magnesium or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings that are, if desired, resistant to gastric juice, there being used, inter alia, concentrated sugar solutions which optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions in suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures or, for the manufacture of coatings that are resistant to gastric juice, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate. Coloring substances or pigments can be added to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example for the purpose of identification or for indicating different doses of active substance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther orally administrable pharmaceutical compositions are dry-filled capsules made of gelatin and also soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer such as glycerol or sorbitol. The dry-filled capsules may contain the active ingredient in the form of a granulate, for example, in admixture with fillers such as corn starch, binders and/or glidants such as talc or magnesium stearate and optionally stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active ingredient is preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids or wax-like substances such as fatty oils, paraffin oil or polyethylene glycols, it being possible also for stabilizers to be added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther forms of oral administration are, for example, syrups prepared in a customary manner that contain the active ingredient in, for example, suspended form in a concentration that provides a suitable single dose when administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther suitable dosage forms for parenteral administration are sterile aqueous solutions of an active ingredient in water-soluble form, for example, a water-soluble salt, or sterile aqueous injection suspensions which contain substances increasing the viscosity, for example, sodium, carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran, and optionally stabilizers. In addition, the active ingredient, with or without adjuvants, can also be in lyophilized form and brought into solution prior to parenteral administration by the addition of suitable solvents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to a method of treatment of pathological conditions in a mammal, especially human, which as has been described hereinabove, which method comprises administering, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the formula I or of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe examples provided in the present application serve to illustrate the invention, but should not be construed as a limitation thereof.\n\n\n \nREFERENCES CITED\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n1.
