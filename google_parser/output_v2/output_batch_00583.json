Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims priority to the following: U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/073,193 filed on Jun. 17, 2008, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/078,165 filed Jul. 3, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/090,415 filed on Aug. 20, 2008. The disclosure of each application is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nPre-proglucagon is a 158 amino acid precursor polypeptide that is processed in different tissues to form a number of different proglucagon-derived peptides, including glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) and oxyntomodulin (OXM), that are involved in a wide variety of physiological functions, including glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, gastric emptying, and intestinal growth, as well as the regulation of food intake. Glucagon is a 29-amino acid peptide that corresponds to amino acids 33 through 61 of pre-proglucagon, while GLP-1 is produced as a 37-amino acid peptide that corresponds to amino acids 72 through 108 of pre-proglucagon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHypoglycemia occurs when blood glucose levels drops too low to provide enough energy for the body's activities. In adults or children older than 10 years, hypoglycemia is uncommon except as a side effect of diabetes treatment, but it can result from other medications or diseases, hormone or enzyme deficiencies, or tumors. When blood glucose begins to fall, glucagon, a hormone produced by the pancreas, signals the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose, causing blood glucose levels to rise toward a normal level. Thus, glucagon's most recognized role in glucose regulation is to counteract the action of insulin and maintain blood glucose levels. However for diabetics, this glucagon response to hypoglycemia may be impaired, making it harder for glucose levels to return to the normal range.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHypoglycemia is a life threatening event that requires immediate medical attention. The administration of glucagon is an established medication for treating acute hypoglycemia and it can restore normal levels of glucose within minutes of administration. When glucagon is used in the acute medical treatment of hypoglycemia, a crystalline form of glucagon is solubilized with a dilute acid buffer and the solution is injected intramuscularly. While this treatment is effective, the methodology is cumbersome and dangerous for someone that is semi-conscious. Accordingly, there is a need for a glucagon analog that maintains the biological performance of the parent molecule but is sufficiently soluble and stable, under relevant physiological conditions, that it can be pre-formulated as a solution, ready for injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, diabetics are encouraged to maintain near normal blood glucose levels to delay or prevent microvascular complications. Achievement of this goal usually requires intensive insulin therapy. In striving to achieve this goal, physicians have encountered a substantial increase in the frequency and severity of hypoglycemia in their diabetic patients. Accordingly, improved pharmaceuticals and methodologies are needed for treating diabetes that are less likely to induce hypoglycemia than current insulin therapies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described herein, high potency glucagon agonists are provided that exhibit enhanced biophysical stability and aqueous solubility at physiological pH in pharmaceutical compositions suitable for commercial use. Native glucagon is neither soluble, nor stable in the physiological pH range and thus must be manufactured as a dry product that requires reconstitution and immediate use. The glucagon analogs described herein have enhanced physical properties that render them superior for use in current medicinal settings where the native hormone is currently employed. These compounds can be used in accordance with one embodiment to prepare pre-formulated solutions ready for injection to treat hypoglycemia. Alternatively, the glucagon agonists can be co-administered with insulin to buffer the effects of insulin to allow for a more stable maintenance of blood glucose levels. In addition, other beneficial uses of compositions comprising the modified glucagon peptides disclosed herein are described in detail below.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the invention provides glucagon peptides that retain glucagon receptor activity and exhibit improved solubility relative to the native glucagon peptide (SEQ ID NO: 1). Native glucagon exhibits poor solubility in aqueous solution, particularly at physiological pH, with a tendency to aggregate and precipitate over time. In contrast, the glucagon peptides of one embodiment of the invention exhibit at least 2-fold, 5-fold, or even higher solubility compared to native glucagon at a pH between 6 and 8, or between 6 and 9, for example, at \npH\n 7 after 24 hours at 25° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the glucagon peptides retain at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75% activity, 80% activity, 85% activity, or 90% of the activity of native glucagon (calculated as the inverse ratio of EC50s for the glucagon peptide vs. glucagon, e.g., as measured by cAMP production using the assay generally described in Example 13). In one embodiment, the glucagon peptides of the present invention have the same or greater activity (used synonymously with the term “potency” herein) than glucagon. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides retain up to about 100%, 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon normally has about 1% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor. GLP-1 (7-36) amide (SEQ ID NO: 57) or GLP-1 (7-37)acid (SEQ ID NO: 58) are biologically potent forms of GLP-1, that demonstrate essentially equivalent activity at the GLP-1 receptor. Glucagon is also 10- to 20-fold more selective for the glucagon receptor compared to GLP-1 receptor (selectivity calculated as the inverse ratio of EC50 of glucagon for the glucagon receptor vs. for the GLP-1 receptor). For example, for an assay in which glucagon's EC50 at the glucagon receptor is 0.22 nM and glucagon's EC50 at the GLP-1 receptor is 3.85 nM, the calculated selectivity is 17.5-fold. Activity can be measured, e.g., by cAMP production using the assay generally described in Example 13. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides of the present invention exhibit less than about 5%, 4%, 3%, 2% or 1% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor and/or a greater than about 5-fold, 10-fold, or 15-fold selectivity for glucagon receptor compared to GLP-1 receptor. For example, in some embodiments, the glucagon peptides of the present invention exhibit less than 5% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor and exhibit a greater than 5-fold selectivity for glucagon receptor compared to GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the glucagon peptides of the invention may additionally exhibit improved stability and/or reduced degradation, for example, retaining at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides of the invention exhibit improved stability, such that at least 75% (e.g., at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, more than 95%, up to 100%) of a concentration of the peptide or less than about 25% (e.g., less than 20%, less than 15%, less than 10%, less than 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, down to 0%) of degraded peptide is detectable at 280 nm by an ultraviolet (UV) detector after 1 or more weeks (e.g., 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 1 month, two months, four months, six months, eight months, ten months, twelve months) in solution at a temperature of at least 20° C. (e.g., 21° C., 22° C., 23° C., 24° C., 25° C., 26° C., at least 27.5° C., at least 30° C., at least 35° C., at least 40° C., at least 50° C.) and less than 100° C., less than 85° C., less than 75° C., or less than 70° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment a glucagon peptide is provided with improved solubility, wherein the peptide is modified by amino acid substitutions and/or additions that introduce a charged amino acid into the C-terminal portion of the peptide, and in one embodiment at a position C-terminal to position 27 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Optionally, one, two or three charged amino acids may be introduced within the C-terminal portion, and in one embodiment C-terminal to position 27. In accordance with one embodiment the native amino acid(s) at positions 28 and/or 29 are substituted with a charged amino acid, and/or one to three charged amino acids are added to the C-terminus of the peptide, after position 29. In exemplary embodiments, one, two or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. Additional modifications, e.g. conservative substitutions, may be made to the glucagon peptide that still allow it to retain glucagon activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one exemplary embodiment the glucagon peptide comprises an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 11, or an analog thereof that contains 1 to 3 further amino acid modifications relative to native glucagon, or a glucagon agonist analog thereof. SEQ ID NO: 11 represents a modified glucagon peptide wherein the asparagine residue at position 28 of the native protein has been substituted with an aspartic acid. In another exemplary embodiment the glucagon peptide comprises an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 38, wherein the asparagine residue at position 28 of the native protein has been substituted with glutamic acid. Other exemplary embodiments include glucagon peptides of SEQ ID NOS: 24, 25, 26, 33, 35, 36 and 37.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with another embodiment, glucagon peptides are provided that have enhanced potency at the glucagon receptor, wherein the peptides comprise an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1). By way of nonlimiting example, such enhanced potency can be provided by substituting the naturally occurring serine at \nposition\n 16 with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid, or a charged amino acid having a side chain containing at least one heteroatom, (e.g. N, O, S, P) and with a side chain length of about 4 (or 3-5) atoms. Substitution of serine at \nposition\n 16 with glutamic acid enhances glucagon activity at least 2-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold and up to 10-fold greater at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, glucagon peptide retains selectivity for the glucagon receptor relative to the GLP-1 receptors, e.g., at least 5-fold, 10-fold, or 15-fold selectivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solubility of any of the foregoing compounds can be further improved by attaching a hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. Introduction of such groups also increases duration of action, e.g. as measured by a prolonged half-life in circulation. In one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain or other water soluble polymer that is covalently linked to the side chain of an amino acid residue at one or more of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 17, 21, 24, 29, 40 of said glucagon peptide, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid. In some embodiments, the native amino acid at that position is substituted with an amino acid having a side chain suitable for crosslinking with hydrophilic moieties, to facilitate linkage of the hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. Exemplary amino acids include Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, or acetyl phenylalanine (Ac-Phe). In other embodiments, an amino acid modified to comprise a hydrophilic group is added to the peptide at the C-terminus. The polyethylene glycol chain in accordance with one embodiment has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 40,000 Daltons. In one embodiment the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 5,000 Daltons. In another embodiment the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight of about 10,000 to about 20,000 Daltons. In yet other exemplary embodiments the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight of about 20,000 to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are modified to comprise an acyl group or alkyl group, e.g., an acyl or alkyl group which is non-native to a naturally-occurring amino acid. Acylation or alkylation can increase the half-life of the glucagon peptides in circulation, can advantageously delay the onset of action and/or extend the duration of action at the glucagon and/or GLP-1 receptors and/or improve resistance to proteases such as DPP-IV. Acylation or alkylation may also enhance solubility of the peptide at neutral pH. As shown herein, the activity at the glucagon receptor and GLP-1 receptor of the glucagon peptide is maintained if not enhanced after acylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some aspects, the glucagon peptide is covalently attached to an acyl or alkyl group via a spacer, e.g., an amino acid, dipeptide, tripeptide, hydrophilic bifunctional spacer, or hydrophobic bifunctional spacer. In certain aspects, an enhancement in activity at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors is observed upon acylation of the peptide with a spacer. In selected aspects, such as, for example, when the peptide lacks an intramolecular bridge (e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge), a further enhancement in activity at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors is observed upon acylation of the peptide with a spacer, as compared to an acylated peptide, wherein the acyl group is attached to the peptide without a spacer. In accordance with some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid or dipeptide having an amino acid or peptide backbone structure that is 3 to 10 atoms (e.g., 6 to 10 atoms) in length. In accordance with certain specific embodiments, the total length of the spacer and acyl or alkyl group is 14 to 28 atoms, e.g., 17 to 28, 19 to 26 atoms, 19 to 21 atoms. Suitable spacers for purposes of enhancing glucagon activity are further described herein. In some embodiments, the acylated or alkylated peptides described herein further comprise a modification which selectively decreases activity at the GLP-1 receptor, e.g., a modification of the Thr at \nposition\n 7, such as a substitution of the Thr at \nposition\n 7 with an amino acid lacking a hydroxyl group, e.g., aminobutyric acid (Abu) or Ile; deletion of the amino acid(s) C-terminal to the amino acid at position 27 or 28 (e.g., deleting one or both of the amino acids at positions 28 and 29), yielding a peptide 27 or 28 amino acids in length).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon peptides may be acylated or alkylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the invention provides a glucagon peptide modified to comprise an acyl group or alkyl group covalently linked to the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide. The glucagon peptide may further comprise a spacer between the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide and the acyl group or alkyl group. In some embodiments, the acyl group is a fatty acid or bile acid, or salt thereof, e.g. a C4 to C30 fatty acid, a C8 to C24 fatty acid, cholic acid, a C4 to C30 alkyl, a C8 to C24 alkyl, or an alkyl comprising a steroid moiety of a bile acid. The spacer is any moiety with suitable reactive groups for attaching acyl or alkyl groups. In exemplary embodiments, the spacer comprises an amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a hydrophilic bifunctional, e.g., an amino poly(alkyloxy)carboxylate, or a hydrophobic bifunctional spacer. In some embodiments, the spacer is selected from the group consisting of: Trp, Glu, Asp, Cys and a spacer comprising NH\n2\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)n(CH\n2\n)\nm\nCOOH, wherein m is any integer from 1 to 6 and n is any integer from 2 to 12. Such acylated or alkylated glucagon peptides may also further comprise a hydrophilic moiety, optionally a polyethylene glycol. Any of the foregoing glucagon peptides may comprise two acyl groups or two alkyl groups, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further encompasses pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said glucagon agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other exemplary embodiments, any of the foregoing compounds can be further modified to alter its pharmaceutical properties by the addition of a second peptide to the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide. In one embodiment a glucagon peptide is covalently bound through a peptide bond to a second peptide, wherein the second peptide comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 20, SEQ ID NO: 21 and SEQ ID NO: 22.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, modifications at \n \nposition\n \n 1 or 2 can increase the peptide's resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) cleavage. For example, the amino acid at \nposition\n 2 may be substituted with D-serine, D-alanine, valine, glycine, N-methyl serine, N-methyl alanine, or amino isobutyric acid. Alternatively, or in addition, the amino acid at \nposition\n 1 may be substituted with D-histidine (D-His), desaminohistidine, hydroxyl-histidine, acetyl-histidine, homo-histidine, N-methyl histidine, alpha-methyl histidine, imidazole acetic acid, or alpha, alpha-dimethyl imidiazole acetic acid (DMIA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was observed that modifications at position 2 (e.g. AIB at position 2) and in some cases modifications at position 1 (e.g. DMIA at position 1) may reduce glucagon activity, sometimes significantly; surprisingly, this reduction in glucagon activity can be restored by stabilization of the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (around amino acids 12-29). In some embodiments, stabilization is via a covalent bond between amino acids at positions “i” and “i+4”, wherein i is any integer from 12 to 25. In some specific embodiments, “i” and “i+4” are 12 and 16, 16 and 20, or 20 and 24, or 24 and 28. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is a lactam bridge between a glutamic acid at \nposition\n 16 and a lysine at \nposition\n 20. In exemplary embodiments, the bridge or linker is about 8 (or about 7-9) atoms in length. In other embodiments, stabilization is via a covalent bond between amino acids at positions “j” and “j+3,” wherein j is any integer between 12 and 27. In exemplary embodiments, the bridge or linker is about 6 (or about 5-7) atoms in length. In yet other embodiments, stabilization is via a covalent bond between amino acids at positions “k” and “k+7,” wherein k is any integer between 12 and 22. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods (i.e., means of forming a covalent intramolecular bridge) include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur-containing bridge formation, the use of α, ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the helix is stabilized by non-covalent bonds (i.e., non-covalent intramolecular bridges), including but not limited to hydrogen-bonding, ionic interactions, and salt bridges.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments of the invention, stabilization of the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29) is achieved through purposeful introduction of one or more α, α-disubstituted amino acids at positions that retain the desired activity. In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 of a glucagon peptide is substituted with an α, α-disubstituted amino acid. For example, substitution of \nposition\n 16 of a glucagon peptide with amino iso-butyric acid (AIB) provides a stabilized alpha helix in the absence of a salt bridge or lactam. Such peptides are considered herein as a peptide lacking an intramolecular bridge. In specific aspects, stabilization of the alpha-helix is accomplished by introducing one or more α, α-disubstituted amino acids without introduction of a covalent intramolecular bridge, e.g., a lactam bridge, a disulfide bridge. Such peptides are considered herein as a peptide lacking a covalent intramolecular bridge. In some embodiments, one, two, three or more of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in some embodiments the invention provides a glucagon peptide with glucagon agonist activity, comprising the amino acid sequence:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nX1-X2-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Z (SEQ ID NO: 39) with 1 to 3 amino acid modifications thereto,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein X1 and/or X2 is a non-native amino acid that reduces susceptibility of (or increases resistance of) the glucagon peptide to cleavage by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein Z is selected from the group consisting of —COOH (the naturally occurring C-terminal carboxylate), -Asn-COOH, Asn-Thr-COOH, and Y—COOH, wherein Y is 1 to 2 amino acids, and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein an intramolecular bridge, preferably a covalent bond, connects the side chains of an amino acid at position i and an amino acid at position i+4, wherein i is 12, 16, 20 or 24.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is a lactam bridge. In some embodiments, the amino acids at positions i and i+4 of SEQ ID NO: 39 are Lys and Glu, e.g., Glu16 and Lys20. In some embodiments, X1 is selected from the group consisting of: D-His, N-methyl-His, alpha-methyl-His, imidazole acetic acid, desamino-His, hydroxyl-His, acetyl-His, homo-His, and alpha, alpha-dimethyl imidiazole acetic acid (DMIA). In other embodiments, X2 is selected from the group consisting of: D-Ser, D-Ala, Gly, N-methyl-Ser, Val, and alpha, amino isobutyric acid (AIB). In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is covalently linked to a hydrophilic moiety at any of amino acid positions 16, 17, 20, 21, 24, 29, 40, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid. In exemplary embodiments, this hydrophilic moiety is covalently linked to a Lys, Cys, Orn, homocysteine, or acetyl-phenylalanine residue at any of these positions. Exemplary hydrophilic moieties include polyethylene glycol (PEG), for example, of a molecular weight of about 1,000 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons, or about 20,000 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the invention provides a glucagon peptide with glucagon agonist activity, comprising the amino acid sequence:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 39)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX1-X2-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrp-Leu-Met-Z,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein X1 and/or X2 is a non-native amino acid that reduces susceptibility of (or increases resistance of) the glucagon peptide to cleavage by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein one, two, three, four or more of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 20, 21, and 24 of the glucagon peptide is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein Z is selected from the group consisting of —COOH (the naturally occurring C-terminal carboxylate), -Asn-COOH, Asn-Thr-COOH, and Y—COOH, wherein Y is 1 to 2 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary further amino acid modifications to the foregoing glucagon peptides or analogs include substitution of Thr at position 7 with an amino acid lacking a hydroxyl group, e.g., Abu or Ile, optionally, in combination with substitution or addition of an amino acid comprising a side chain covalently attached (optionally, through a spacer) to an acyl or alkyl group, which acyl or alkyl group is non-native to a naturally-occurring amino acid, substitution of Lys at position 12 with Arg; substitution of Asp at position 15 with Glu; substitution of Ser at position 16 with Thr or AIB; substitution of Gln at position 20 with Ser, Thr, Ala or AIB; substitution of Asp at position 21 with Glu; substitution of Gln at position 24 with Ser, Thr, Ala or AIB; substitution of Met at position 27 with Leu or Nle; substitution of Asn at position 28 with a charged amino acid; substitution of Asn at position 28 with a charged amino acid selected from the group consisting of Lys, Arg, His, Asp, Glu, cysteic acid, and homocysteic acid; substitution at position 28 with Asn, Asp, or Glu; substitution at position 28 with Asp; substitution at position 28 with Glu; substitution of Thr at position 29 with a charged amino acid; substitution of Thr at position 29 with a charged amino acid selected from the group consisting of Lys, Arg, His, Asp, Glu, cysteic acid, and homocysteic acid; substitution at position 29 with Asp, Glu, or Lys; substitution at position 29 with Glu; insertion of 1-3 charged amino acids after position 29; insertion at position 30 (i.e., after position 29) of Glu or Lys; optionally with insertion at position 31 of Lys; addition of SEQ ID NO: 20 to the C-terminus, optionally, wherein the amino acid at position 29 is Thr or Gly; substitution or addition of an amino acid covalently attached to a hydrophilic moiety; or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet further exemplary embodiments, any of the foregoing peptides can be further modified to improve stability by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 15 of SEQ ID NO: 1 to reduce degradation of the peptide over time, especially in acidic or alkaline buffers. In exemplary embodiments, Asp at \nposition\n 15 is substituted with a Glu, homo-Glu, cysteic acid, or homo-cysteic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, any of the glucagon peptides described herein can be further modified to improve stability by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 16 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In exemplary embodiments, Ser at \nposition\n 16 is substituted with Thr or AIB, or any of the amino acids substitutions described above which enhance potency at the glucagon receptor. Such modifications reduce cleavage of the peptide bond between Asp15-Ser16.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaintained or enhanced activity at the glucagon receptor may be achieved by modifying the Gln at \nposition\n 3 with a glutamine analog. For example, a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at \nposition\n 3 may exhibit about 5%, about 10%, about 20%, about 50%, or about 85% or greater the activity of native glucagon (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 1) at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at \nposition\n 3 may exhibit about 20%, about 50%, about 75%, about 100%, about 200% or about 500% or greater the activity of a corresponding glucagon peptide having the same amino acid sequence as the peptide comprising the glutamine analog, except for the modified amino acid at position 3 (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 69 or SEQ ID NO: 70) at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at \nposition\n 3 exhibits enhanced activity at the glucagon receptor, but the enhanced activity is no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon or of a corresponding glucagon peptide having the same amino acid sequence as the peptide comprising the glutamine analog, except for the modified amino acid at \nposition\n 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the glutamine analog is a naturally occurring or a non-naturally occurring amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure I, II or III:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein R\n1 \nis C\n0-3 \nalkyl or C\n0-3 \nheteroalkyl; R\n2 \nis NHR\n4 \nor C\n1-3 \nalkyl; R\n3 \nis C\n1-3 \nalkyl; R\n4 \nis H or C\n1-3 \nalkyl; X is NH, O, or S; and Y is NHR\n4\n, SR\n3\n, or OR\n3\n. In some embodiments, X is NH or Y is NHR\n4\n. In some embodiments, R\n1 \nis C\n0-2 \nalkyl or C\n1 \nheteroalkyl. In some embodiments, R\n2 \nis NHR\n4 \nor C\n1 \nalkyl. In some embodiments, R\n4 \nis H or C\n1 \nalkyl. In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure I is provided where, R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n—S, X is NH, and R\n2 \nis CH\n3 \n(acetamidomethyl-cysteine, C(Acm)); R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n, X is NH, and R\n2 \nis CH\n3 \n(acetyldiaminobutanoic acid, Dab(Ac)); R\n1 \nis C\no \nalkyl, X is NH, R\n2 \nis NHR\n4\n, and R\n4 \nis H (carbamoyldiaminopropanoic acid, Dap(urea)); or R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n, X is NH, and R\n2 \nis CH\n3 \n(acetylornithine, Orn(Ac)). In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure II is provided where, R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n, Y is NHR\n4\n, and R\n4 \nis CH\n3 \n(methylglutamine, Q(Me)); In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure III is provided where, R\n1 \nis CH\n2 \nand R\n4 \nis H (methionine-sulfoxide, M(O)); In specific embodiments, the amino acid at \nposition\n 3 is substituted with Dab(Ac). For example, glucagon agonists can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 63, SEQ ID NO: 69, SEQ ID NO: 71, SEQ ID NO: 72, SEQ ID NO: 73, and SEQ ID NO: 74.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the glucagon receptor of the glucagon peptide also may be achieved by covalently attaching an acyl or alkyl group, e.g., an acyl or alkyl group which is non-native to a naturally occurring amino acid (e.g., a C4 to C30 fatty acyl group, a C4 to C30 alkyl group), to the side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon peptide. In some embodiments, the acylated or alkylated glucagon peptides lack an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a lactam). In certain aspects, the acyl or alkyl group is attached to the side chain of the amino acid of the glucagon peptide through a spacer, e.g., a spacer which is 3 to 10 atoms in length. In some embodiments, the acyl or alkyl group is attached to the side chain of the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide through a spacer. In specific embodiments, the acylated or alkylated glucagon peptides further comprise a modification which selectively decreases the activity of the peptide at the GLP-1 receptor. For example, the acylated or alkylated glucagon peptide may comprise a C-terminal alpha carboxylate, a substitution of the Thr at \nposition\n 7 with an amino acid lacking a hydroxyl group, e.g., Abu or Ile, a deletion of the amino acid(s) C-terminal to the amino acid at position 27 or 28, yielding a 27- or 28-amino acid peptide, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, any of the glucagon peptides described herein can be further modified to reduce degradation at various amino acid positions by modifying any one, two, three, or all four of \n \npositions\n \n 20, 21, 24, or 27. Exemplary embodiments include substitution of Gln at \nposition\n 20 with Ala or AIB, substitution of Asp at position 21 with Glu, substitution of Gln at \nposition\n 24 with Ala or AIB, substitution of Met at position 27 with Leu or Nle. Removal or substitution of methionine reduces degradation due to oxidation of the methionine. Removal or substitution of Gln or Asn reduces degradation due to deamidation of Gln or Asn. Removal or substitution of Asp reduces degradation that occurs through dehydration of Asp to form a cyclic succinimide intermediate followed by isomerization to iso-aspartate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, any of the glucagon peptides described herein can be modified without adversely affecting activity at the glucagon receptor, while retaining at least partial glucagon receptor activity. For example, conservative or non-conservative substitutions, additions or deletions may be carried out at any of \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28 or 29. In exemplary embodiments, Lys at \nposition\n 12 is substituted with Arg. In other exemplary embodiments amino acids at positions 29 and/or 28, and optionally at position 27, are deleted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the glucagon peptides described herein may exhibit an EC50 at the human glucagon receptor of about 100 nM, 75 nM, 50 nM, 40 nM, 30 nM, 20 nM, 10 nM, 5 nM, 1 nM or less when tested for cAMP induction in HEK293 cells over-expressing glucagon receptor, e.g. using the assay of Example 13. Typically pegylated peptides will exhibit a higher EC50 compared to the unpegylated peptide. For example, the glucagon peptides described herein, when unpegylated, may exhibit activity at the glucagon receptor which is at least 20% (e.g., at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90% at least 95%, at least 98%, at least 99%, 100%, 150%, 200%, 400%, 500% or more) of the activity of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) at the glucagon receptor. In certain embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit the indicated % activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, when lacking a hydrophilic moiety, but exhibit a decreased % activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, when comprising a hydrophilic moiety. For example, the glucagon peptides described herein, when pegylated, may exhibit activity at the glucagon receptor which is at least 2% (e.g. at least 3%, at least 4%, at least 5%, at least 6%, at least 7%, at least 8%, at least 9%, or at least 10% of the activity of native glucagon. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein may exhibit any of the above indicated activities but no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, the glucagon peptide comprises (a) an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 1 and/or 2 that confers DPP-IV resistance, e.g., substitution with DMIA at \nposition\n 1, or AIB at \nposition\n 2, (b) an intramolecular bridge within positions 12-29, e.g. at \n \npositions\n \n 16 and 20, or one or more substitutions of the amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 20, 21, and 24 with an α,α disubstituted amino acid, optionally (c) linked to a hydrophilic moiety such as PEG, e.g., through Cys at \nposition\n 24, 29 or at the C-terminal amino acid, optionally (d) an amino acid modification at position 27 that substitutes Met with, e.g., Nle, optionally (e) amino acid modifications at \n \npositions\n \n 20, 21 and 24 that reduce degradation, and optionally (0 linked to SEQ ID NO: 20. When the glucagon peptide is linked to SEQ ID NO: 20, the amino acid at position 29 in certain embodiments is Thr or Gly. In other specific embodiments, the glucagon peptide comprises (a) Asp28Glu29, or Glu28Glu29, or Glu29Glu30, or Glu28Glu30 or Asp28Glu30, and optionally (b) an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 16 that substitutes Ser with, e.g. Thr or AIB, and optionally (c) an amino acid modification at position 27 that substitutes Met with, e.g., Nle, and optionally (d) amino acid modifications at \n \npositions\n \n 20, 21 and 24 that reduce degradation. In a specific embodiment, the glucagon peptide is T16, A20, E21, A24, Nle27, D28, E29.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glucagon peptide may be part of a dimer, trimer or higher order multimer comprising at least two, three, or more peptides bound via a linker, wherein at least one or both peptides is a glucagon peptide. The dimer may be a homodimer or heterodimer. In some embodiments, the linker is selected from the group consisting of a bifunctional thiol crosslinker and a bi-functional amine crosslinker. In certain embodiments, the linker is PEG, e.g., a 5 kDa PEG, 20 kDa PEG. In some embodiments, the linker is a disulfide bond. For example, each monomer of the dimer may comprise a Cys residue (e.g., a terminal or internally positioned Cys) and the sulfur atom of each Cys residue participates in the formation of the disulfide bond. In some aspects of the invention, the monomers are connected via terminal amino acids (e.g., N-terminal or C-terminal), via internal amino acids, or via a terminal amino acid of at least one monomer and an internal amino acid of at least one other monomer. In specific aspects, the monomers are not connected via an N-terminal amino acid. In some aspects, the monomers of the multimer are attached together in a “tail-to-tail” orientation in which the C-terminal amino acids of each monomer are attached together.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA conjugate moiety may be covalently linked to any of the glucagon peptides described herein, including a dimer, trimer or higher order multimer. Fusion peptides comprising the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 20 to 22 are also contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the modifications described above which increase glucagon receptor activity, retain partial glucagon receptor activity, improve solubility, increase stability, or reduce degradation can be applied to glucagon peptides individually or in combination. Thus, glucagon peptides can be prepared that retain at least 20% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, and which are soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retain at least 95% of the original peptide (e.g. 5% or less of the original peptide is degraded or cleaved) after 24 hours at 25° C. Alternatively, high potency glucagon peptides can be prepared that exhibit at least about 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 350%, 400%, 450%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%, 900% or 10-fold or more of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, and optionally are soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide (e.g. 5% or less of the original peptide is degraded or cleaved) after 24 hours at 25° C.

The term also encompasses any of the agents approved by a regulatory agency of the US Federal government or listed in the US Pharmacopeia for use in animals, including humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to salts of compounds that retain the biological activity of the parent compound, and which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. Many of the compounds disclosed herein are capable of forming acid and/or base salts by virtue of the presence of amino and/or carboxyl groups or groups similar thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be prepared from inorganic and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases, include by way of example only, sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium and magnesium salts. Salts derived from organic bases include, but are not limited to, salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared from inorganic and organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Salts derived from organic acids include acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluene-sulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “treating” includes prophylaxis of the specific disorder or condition, or alleviation of the symptoms associated with a specific disorder or condition and/or preventing or eliminating said symptoms. For example, as used herein the term “treating diabetes” will refer in general to altering glucose blood levels in the direction of normal levels and may include increasing or decreasing blood glucose levels depending on a given situation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an “effective” amount or a “therapeutically effective amount” of a glucagon peptide refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the peptide to provide the desired effect. For example one desired effect would be the prevention or treatment of hypoglycemia, as measured, for example, by an increase in blood glucose level. The amount that is “effective” will vary from subject to subject, depending on the age and general condition of the individual, mode of administration, and the like. Thus, it is not always possible to specify an exact “effective amount.” However, an appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term, “parenteral” means not through the alimentary canal but by some other route such as subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraspinal, or intravenous.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “purified” and like terms relate to the isolation of a molecule or compound in a form that is substantially free of contaminants normally associated with the molecule or compound in a native or natural environment. As used herein, the term “purified” does not require absolute purity; rather, it is intended as a relative definition. The term “purified polypeptide” is used herein to describe a polypeptide which has been separated from other compounds including, but not limited to nucleic acid molecules, lipids and carbohydrates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “isolated” requires that the referenced material be removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally-occurring polynucleotide present in a living animal is not isolated, but the same polynucleotide, separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “native glucagon” refers to a peptide consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, and the term “native GLP-1” is a generic term that designates GLP-1(7-36)amide (consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 57), GLP-1(7-37)acid (consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 58) or a mixture of those two compounds. As used herein, a general reference to “glucagon” or “GLP-1” in the absence of any further designation is intended to mean native glucagon or native GLP-1, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “glucagon peptide” as used herein includes any peptide comprising, either the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or any analog of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, including amino acid substitutions, additions, or deletions, or post translational modifications (e.g. methylation, acylation, ubiquitination and the like) of the peptide, wherein the analog stimulates glucagon or GLP-1 receptor activity, e.g., as measured by cAMP production using the assay described in Example 13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “glucagon agonist” refers to a complex comprising a glucagon peptide that stimulates glucagon receptor activity, e.g., as measured by cAMP production using the assay described in Example 13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a “glucagon agonist analog” is a glucagon peptide comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12 and SEQ ID NO: 13 or analog of such a sequence that has been modified to include one or more conservative amino acid substitutions at \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28 or 29.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an amino acid “modification” refers to a substitution, addition or deletion of an amino acid, and includes substitution with or addition of any of the 20 amino acids commonly found in human proteins, as well as atypical or non-naturally occurring amino acids. Throughout the application, all references to a particular amino acid position by number (e.g. position 28) refer to the amino acid at that position in native glucagon (SEQ ID NO:1) or the corresponding amino acid position in any analogs thereof. For example, a reference herein to “position 28” would mean the corresponding position 27 for a glucagon analog in which the first amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 1 has been deleted. Similarly, a reference herein to “position 28” would mean the corresponding position 29 for a glucagon analog in which one amino acid has been added before the N-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an amino acid “substitution” refers to the replacement of one amino acid residue by a different amino acid residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “conservative amino acid substitution” is defined herein as exchanges within one of the following five groups:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nI. Small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar residues:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAla, Ser, Thr, Pro, Gly;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nII. Polar, negatively charged residues and their amides:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAsp, Asn, Glu, Gln, cysteic acid and homocysteic acid;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIII.

Large, aliphatic, nonpolar residues:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMet, Leu, Ile, Val, Cys, Norleucine (Nle), homocysteine\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nV. Large, aromatic residues:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPhe, Tyr, Trp, acetyl phenylalanine\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein the general term “polyethylene glycol” or “PEG”, refers to mixtures of condensation polymers of ethylene oxide and water, in a branched or straight chain, represented by the general formula H(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\nOH, wherein n is at least 9. Absent any further characterization, the term is intended to include polymers of ethylene glycol with an average total molecular weight selected from the range of 500 to 40,000 Daltons. “polyethylene glycol” or “PEG” is used in combination with a numeric suffix to indicate the approximate average molecular weight thereof. For example, PEG-5,000 refers to polyethylene glycol having a total molecular weight average of about 5,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “pegylated” and like terms refers to a compound that has been modified from its native state by linking a polyethylene glycol polymer to the compound. A “pegylated glucagon peptide” is a glucagon peptide that has a PEG chain covalently bound to the glucagon peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a general reference to a peptide is intended to encompass peptides that have modified amino and carboxy termini. For example, an amino acid chain comprising an amide group in place of the terminal carboxylic acid is intended to be encompassed by an amino acid sequence designating the standard amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a “linker” is a bond, molecule or group of molecules that binds two separate entities to one another. Linkers may provide for optimal spacing of the two entities or may further supply a labile linkage that allows the two entities to be separated from each other. Labile linkages include photocleavable groups, acid-labile moieties, base-labile moieties and enzyme-cleavable groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a “dimer” is a complex comprising two subunits covalently bound to one another via a linker. The term dimer, when used absent any qualifying language, encompasses both homodimers and heterodimers. A homodimer comprises two identical subunits, whereas a heterodimer comprises two subunits that differ, although the two subunits are substantially similar to one another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “pH stabilized glucagon peptide” refers to a glucagon agonist analog that exhibits superior stability and solubility, relative to native glucagon, in aqueous buffers in the broadest pH range used for pharmacological purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “charged amino acid” refers to an amino acid that comprises a side chain that is negatively charged (i.e., de-protonated) or positively charged (i.e., protonated) in aqueous solution at physiological pH. For example negatively charged amino acids include aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteic acid, homocysteic acid, and homoglutamic acid, whereas positively charged amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine. Charged amino acids include the charged amino acids among the 20 amino acids commonly found in human proteins, as well as atypical or non-naturally occurring amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-naturally occurring amino acids refer to amino acids that do not naturally occur in vivo but which, nevertheless, can be incorporated into the peptide structures described herein. Commercial sources of atypical amino acids include Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis.), ChemPep Inc. (Miami, Fla.), and Genzyme Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, Mass.). Atypical amino acids may be purchased from commercial suppliers, synthesized de novo, or chemically modified or derivatized from other amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “acidic amino acid” refers to an amino acid that comprises a second acidic moiety, including for example, a carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkyl” refers to a linear or branched hydrocarbon containing the indicated number of carbon atoms. Exemplary alkyls include methyl, ethyl, and linear propyl groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroalkyl” refers to a linear or branched hydrocarbon containing the indicated number of carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom in the backbone of the structure. Suitable heteroatoms for purposes herein include but are not limited to N, S, and O.\n\n\n \nEmbodiments\n\n\nEnhanced Solubility\n\n\n \n \n \nApplicants have discovered that native glucagon can be modified by introducing charge at its carboxy terminus to enhance the solubility of the peptide while retaining the agonist properties of the peptide. The enhanced solubility allows for the preparation and storage of glucagon solutions at near neutral pH. Formulating glucagon solutions at relatively neutral pHs (e.g. pH of about 6.0 to about 8.0) improves the long term stability of the glucagon peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, one embodiment of the present invention is directed to a glucagon agonist that has been modified relative to the wild type peptide of His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr (SEQ ID NO: 1) to improve the peptide's solubility in aqueous solutions, particularly at a pH ranging from about 5.5 to about 8.0, while retaining the native peptide's biological activity. In one embodiment charge is added to the peptide by the substitution of native non-charged amino acids with charged amino acids selected from the group consisting of lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid, or by the addition of charged amino acids to the amino or carboxy terminus of the peptide. Surprisingly, applicants have discovered that substituting the normally occurring amino acid at position 28 and/or 29 with charged amino acids, and/or the addition of one to two charged amino acids at the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide, enhances the solubility and stability of the glucagon peptides in aqueous solutions at physiologically relevant pHs (i.e., a pH of about 6.5 to about 7.5) by at least 5-fold and by as much as 30-fold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, glucagon peptides of one embodiment of the invention retain glucagon activity and exhibit at least 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 25-fold, 30-fold or greater solubility relative to native glucagon at a given pH between about 5.5 and 8, e.g., pH 7, when measured after 24 hours at 25° C. Any of the glucagon peptides disclosed herein may additionally exhibit improved stability at a pH within the range of 5.5 to 8, for example, retaining at least 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25-C. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides of the invention exhibit improved stability, such that at least 75% (e.g., at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, more than 95%, up to 100%) of a concentration of the peptide or less than about 25% (e.g., less than 20%, less than 15%, less than 10%, less than 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, down to 0%) of degraded peptide is detectable at 280 nm by an ultraviolet (UV) detector after about 1 or more weeks (e.g., about 2 weeks, about 4 weeks, about 1 month, about two months, about four months, about six months, about eight months, about ten months, about twelve months) in solution at a temperature of at least 20° C. (e.g., 21° C., 22° C., 23° C., 24° C., 25° C., 26° C., at least 27.5° C., at least 30° C., at least 35° C., at least 40° C., at least 50° C.) and less than 100° C., less than 85° C., less than 75° C., or less than 70° C. The glucagon peptides may include additional modifications that alter its pharmaceutical properties, e.g. increased potency, prolonged half-life in circulation, increased shelf-life, reduced precipitation or aggregation, and/or reduced degradation, e.g., reduced occurrence of cleavage or chemical modification after storage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment a glucagon peptide with improved solubility may be prepared, for example, by introducing one, two, three or more charged amino acid(s) to the C-terminal portion of native glucagon, and in one embodiment at a position C-terminal to position 27. Such a charged amino acid can be introduced, for example by substituting a native amino acid with a charged amino acid, e.g. at positions 28 or 29, or alternatively by adding a charged amino acid, e.g. after position 27, 28 or 29. In exemplary embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. In other embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are positively charged. In specific exemplary embodiments, the glucagon peptide may comprise any one or two of the following modifications: substitution of N28 with E; substitution of N28 with D; substitution of T29 with D; substitution of T29 with E; insertion of E after position 27, 28 or 29; insertion of D after position 27, 28 or 29. For example, D28E29, E28E29, E29E30, E28E30, D28E30.\n\n\n \nFurther Modifications and Combinations\n\n\n \n \n \nAdditional modifications may be made to the glucagon peptide which may further increase solubility and/or stability and/or glucagon activity. The glucagon peptide may alternatively comprise other modifications that do not substantially affect solubility or stability, and that do not substantially decrease glucagon activity.

For example substitution at \nposition\n 3 with glutamic acid, ornithine, or norleucine substantially reduces or destroys glucagon receptor activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaintained or enhanced activity at the glucagon receptor may be achieved by modifying the Gln at \nposition\n 3 with a glutamine analog. For example, a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at \nposition\n 3 may exhibit about 5%, about 10%, about 20%, about 50%, or about 85% or greater the activity of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at \nposition\n 3 may exhibit about 20%, about 50%, about 75%, about 100%, about 200% or about 500% or greater the activity, of a corresponding glucagon peptide having the same amino acid sequence as the peptide comprising the glutamine analog, except for the modified amino acid at position 3 (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 69 or SEQ ID NO:70). In some embodiments, a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at \nposition\n 3 exhibits enhanced activity at the glucagon receptor, but the enhanced activity is no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon or of a corresponding glucagon peptide having the same amino acid sequence as the peptide comprising the glutamine analog, except for the modified amino acid at \nposition\n 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the glutamine analog is a naturally occurring or a non-naturally occurring amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure I, II or III:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein R\n1 \nis C\n0-3 \nalkyl or C\n0-3 \nheteroalkyl; R\n2 \nis NHR\n4 \nor C\n1-3 \nalkyl; R\n3 \nis C\n1-3 \nalkyl; R\n4 \nis H or C\n1-3 \nalkyl; X is NH, O, or S; and Y is NHR\n4\n, SR\n3\n, or OR\n3\n. In some embodiments, X is NH or Y is NHR\n4\n. In some embodiments, R\n1 \nis C\n0-2 \nalkyl or C\n1 \nheteroalkyl. In some embodiments, R\n2 \nis NHR\n4 \nor C\n1 \nalkyl. In some embodiments, R\n4 \nis H or C\n1 \nalkyl. In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure I is provided where, R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n—S, X is NH, and R\n2 \nis CH\n3 \n(acetamidomethyl-cysteine, C(Acm)); R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n, X is NH, and R\n2 \nis CH\n3 \n(acetyldiaminobutanoic acid, Dab(Ac)); R\n1 \nis C\no \nalkyl, X is NH, R\n2 \nis NHR\n4\n, and R\n4 \nis H (carbamoyldiaminopropanoic acid, Dap(urea)); or R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n, X is NH, and R\n2 \nis CH\n3 \n(acetylornithine, Orn(Ac)). In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure II is provided where, R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n, Y is NHR\n4\n, and R\n4 \nis CH\n3 \n(methylglutamine, Q(Me)); In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure III is provided where, R\n1 \nis CH\n2 \nand R\n4 \nis H (methionine-sulfoxide, M(O)); In specific embodiments, the amino acid at \nposition\n 3 is substituted with Dab(Ac). For example, glucagon agonists can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 63, SEQ ID NO: 69, SEQ ID NO: 71, SEQ ID NO: 72, SEQ ID NO: 73, and SEQ ID NO: 74.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by replacing the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester. Conversely, retaining the native carboxylic acid at the C-terminus of the peptide maintains the relatively greater selectivity of the glucagon peptide for glucagon receptor vs. GLP-1 receptor (e.g., greater than about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20-fold).\n\n\n \nDPP-IV Resistance\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are further modified at \n \nposition\n \n 1 or 2 to reduce susceptibility to cleavage by dipeptidyl peptidase IV. More particularly, in some embodiments, \nposition\n 1 of the analog peptide is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D-histidine, alpha, alpha-dimethyl imidiazole acetic acid (DMIA), N-methyl histidine, alpha-methyl histidine, imidazole acetic acid, desaminohistidine, hydroxyl-histidine, acetyl-histidine and homo-histidine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, in some embodiments, \nposition\n 2 of the analog peptide is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D-serine, D-alanine, valine, amino N-butyric acid, glycine, N-methyl serine and aminoisobutyric acid. In one \nembodiment position\n 2 of the analog peptide is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D-serine, D-alanine, glycine, N-methyl serine and aminoisobutyric acid. In another \nembodiment position\n 2 of the analog peptide is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D-serine, glycine, and aminoisobutyric acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere substitutions or modifications or derivatization at \n \npositions\n \n 1 or 2 reduce activity at the glucagon receptor, an intramolecular bridge in the C-terminal portion (amino acids 12-29) of the peptide (e.g., a lactam bridge between side chains of amino acids at positions “i” and “i+4”, wherein i is an integer from 12 to 25), can improve glucagon activity at the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \nAddition of Hydrophilic Moieties\n\n\n \n \n \nHydrophilic moieties such as PEG groups can be attached to the glucagon peptides under any suitable conditions used to react a protein with an activated polymer molecule. Any means known in the art can be used, including via acylation, reductive alkylation, Michael addition, thiol alkylation or other chemoselective conjugation/ligation methods through a reactive group on the PEG moiety (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group) to a reactive group on the target compound (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group). Activating groups which can be used to link the water soluble polymer to one or more proteins include without limitation sulfone, maleimide, sulfhydryl, thiol, triflate, tresylate, azidirine, oxirane, 5-pyridyl. and alpha-halogenated acyl group (e.g., alpha-iodo acetic acid, alpha-bromoacetic acid, alpha-chloroacetic acid). If attached to the peptide by reductive alkylation, the polymer selected should have a single reactive aldehyde so that the degree of polymerization is controlled.

Drug Delivery Rev. \n16: 157-182 (1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect of the invention, an amino acid residue on the glucagon peptide having a thiol is modified with a hydrophilic moiety such as PEG. In some embodiments, the thiol is modified with maleimide-activated PEG in a Michael addition reaction to result in a PEGylated peptide comprising the thioether linkage shown below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some embodiments, the thiol is modified with a haloacetyl-activated PEG in a nucleophilic substitution reaction to result in a PEGylated peptide comprising the thioether linkage shown below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable hydrophilic moieties include polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., POG), polyoxyethylated sorbitol, polyoxyethylated glucose, polyoxyethylated glycerol (POG), polyoxyalkylenes, polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, mono-(C1-C10) alkoxy- or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, polyacetals, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1,3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, poly (β-amino acids) (either homopolymers or random copolymers), poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers (PPG) and other polyakylene oxides, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide copolymers, colonic acids or other polysaccharide polymers, Ficoll or dextran and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polyethylene glycol chain in accordance with some embodiments has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 40,000 Daltons. In one embodiment the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 5,000 Daltons, or about 1,000 to about 5,000 Daltons. In another embodiment the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight of about 10,000 to about 20,000 Daltons. In yet other exemplary embodiments the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight of about 20,000 to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDextrans are polysaccharide polymers of glucose subunits, predominantly linked by α1-6 linkages. Dextran is available in many molecular weight ranges, e.g., about 1 kD to about 100 kD, or from about 5, 10, 15 or 20 kD to about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90 kD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLinear or branched polymers are contemplated. Resulting preparations of conjugates may be essentially monodisperse or polydisperse, and may have about 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.2, 1.5 or 2 polymer moieties per peptide.\n\n\n \nAcylation\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group, e.g., an acyl group which is not naturally-occurring on an amino acid (e.g., an acyl group which is non-native to a naturally-occurring amino acid). The addition of an acyl group causes the peptide to have one or more of a prolonged half-life in circulation, a delayed onset of action, an extended duration of action, an improved resistance to proteases, such as DPP-IV, and increased potency at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors. As shown herein, acylation of the glucagon peptide does not lead to decreased activity at the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors. Rather, in some instances, acylation actually increases the activity at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors. Accordingly, the potency of the acylated analogs is comparable to the unacylated versions of the glucagon co-agonist analogs, if not enhanced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group which is attached to the glucagon peptide via an ester, thioester, or amide linkage for purposes of prolonging half-life in circulation and/or delaying the onset of and/or extending the duration of action and/or improving resistance to proteases such as DPP-IV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcylation can be carried out at any position within the glucagon peptide, including any of positions 1-29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the C-terminal amino acid, provided that glucagon and/or GLP-1 activity is retained, if not enhanced. Nonlimiting examples include \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28, or 29. In specific embodiments, acylation occurs at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide and the glucagon peptide lacks an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a lactam bridge). Such acylated peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge demonstrate enhanced activity at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors as compared to the corresponding non-acylated peptides lacking a covalent intramolecular bridge and in comparison to the corresponding peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge acylated at a position other than \nposition\n 10. As shown herein, acylation at \nposition\n 10 can even transform a glucagon analog having little activity at the glucagon receptor to a glucagon analog having activity at both the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors. Accordingly, the position at which acylation occurs can alter the overall activity profile of the glucagon analog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon peptides may be acylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position. Nonlimiting examples include acylation at \nposition\n 10 and pegylation at one or more positions in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide, e.g., \nposition\n 24, 28 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminus (e.g., through adding a C-terminal Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe acyl group can be covalently linked directly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide, or indirectly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide via a spacer, wherein the spacer is positioned between the amino acid of the glucagon peptide and the acyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group by direct acylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon peptide. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is directly acylated through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of an amino acid. In some embodiments, acylation is at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, or 29. In this regard, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, and 29 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol. In some specific embodiments of the invention, the direct acylation of the glucagon peptide occurs through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of the amino acid at \nposition\n 10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine is an amino acid of Formula I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula I, is the amino acid wherein n is 4 (Lys) or n is 3 (Orn).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain hydroxyl is an amino acid of Formula II:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula II is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Ser).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain thiol is an amino acid of Formula III:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula III is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol is a disubstituted amino acid comprising the same structure of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III, except that the hydrogen bonded to the alpha carbon of the amino acid of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III is replaced with a second side chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the acylated glucagon peptide comprises a spacer between the peptide and the acyl group. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is covalently bound to the spacer, which is covalently bound to the acyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid to which the spacer is attached can be any amino acid (e.g., a singly α-substituted amino acid or an α, α-disubstituted amino acid) comprising a moiety which permits linkage to the spacer. For example, an amino acid comprising a side chain NH\n2\n, —OH, or —COOH (e.g., Lys, Orn, Ser, Asp, or Glu) is suitable. In this respect, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, and 29 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or carboxylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol, or a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through an amine group of a spacer, the acylation can occur through the alpha amine of the amino acid or a side chain amine. In the instance in which the alpha amine is acylated, the amino acid of the spacer can be any amino acid. For example, the amino acid of the spacer can be a hydrophobic amino acid, e.g., Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Trp, Met, Phe, Tyr, 6-amino hexanoic acid, 5-aminovaleric acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid. Alternatively, the amino acid of the spacer can be an acidic residue, e.g., Asp and Glu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the instance in which the side chain amine of the amino acid of the spacer is acylated, the amino acid of the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, e.g., an amino acid of Formula I (e.g., Lys or Orn). In this instance, it is possible for both the alpha amine and the side chain amine of the amino acid of the spacer to be acylated, such that the glucagon peptide is diacylated. Embodiments of the invention include such diacylated molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through a hydroxyl group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula II. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Ser.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through a thiol group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula III. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Cys.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is a hydrophilic bifunctional spacer. In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises two or more reactive groups, e.g., an amine, a hydroxyl, a thiol, and a carboxyl group or any combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises a hydroxyl group and a carboxylate. In other embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises an amine group and a carboxylate. In other embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises a thiol group and a carboxylate. In specific embodiments, the spacer comprises an amino poly(alkyloxy)carboxylate. In this regard, the spacer can comprise, for example, NH\n2\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n(CH\n2\n)\nm\nCOOH, wherein m is any integer from 1 to 6 and n is any integer from 2 to 12, such as, e.g., 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid, which is commercially available from Peptides International, Inc.

In specific aspects, the long chain alkane comprises an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol group (e.g. octadecylamine, tetradecanol, and hexadecanethiol) which reacts with a carboxyl group, or activated form thereof, of the glucagon peptide. The carboxyl group, or activated form thereof, of the glucagon peptide can be part of a side chain of an amino acid (e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid) of the glucagon peptide or can be part of the peptide backbone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group by acylation of the long chain alkane by a spacer which is attached to the glucagon peptide.

Suitable spacers comprising a carboxyl group, or activated form thereof, are described herein and include, for example, amino acids, dipeptides, tripeptides, hydrophilic bifunctional spacers and hydrophobic bifunctional spacers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “activated form of a carboxyl group” refers to a carboxyl group with the general formula R(C═O)X, wherein X is a leaving group and R is the glucagon peptide or the spacer. For example, activated forms of a carboxyl groups may include, but are not limited to, acyl chlorides, anhydrides, and esters. In some embodiments, the activated carboxyl group is an ester with a N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS) leaving group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to these aspects of the invention, in which a long chain alkane is acylated by the glucagon peptide or the spacer, the long chain alkane may be of any size and can comprise any length of carbon chain.

In some embodiments, the long chain alkane comprises a C8 to C20 alkane, e.g., a C14 alkane, C16 alkane, or a C18 alkane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, in some embodiments, an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol group of the glucagon peptide is acylated with a cholesterol acid. In a specific embodiment, the glucagon peptide is linked to the cholesterol acid through an alkylated des-amino Cys spacer, i.e., an alkylated 3-mercaptopropionic acid spacer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe acylated glucagon peptides described herein can be further modified to comprise a hydrophilic moiety. In some specific embodiments the hydrophilic moiety can comprise a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain. The incorporation of a hydrophilic moiety can be accomplished through any suitable means, such as any of the methods described herein. In this regard, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise SEQ ID NO: 1, including any of the modifications described herein, in which at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, and 29 comprise an acyl group and at least one of the amino acids at \n \nposition\n \n 16, 17, 21, 24, or 29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the C-terminal amino acid are modified to a Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, or Ac-Phe, and the side chain of the amino acid is covalently bonded to a hydrophilic moiety (e.g., PEG). In some embodiments, the acyl group is attached to position 10, optionally via a spacer comprising Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, or Ac-Phe, and the hydrophilic moiety is incorporated at a Cys residue at \nposition\n 24.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise a spacer, wherein the spacer is both acylated and modified to comprise the hydrophilic moiety. Nonlimiting examples of suitable spacers include a spacer comprising one or more amino acids selected from the group consisting of Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, and Ac-Phe.\n\n\n \nAlkylation\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an alkyl group, e.g., an alkyl group which is not naturally-occurring on an amino acid (e.g., an alkyl group which is non-native to a naturally-occurring amino acid). Without being held to any particular theory, it is believed that alkylation of glucagon peptides will achieve similar, if not the same, effects as acylation of the glucagon peptides, e.g., a prolonged half-life in circulation, a delayed onset of action, an extended duration of action, an improved resistance to proteases, such as DPP-IV, and increased potency at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlkylation can be carried out at any position within the glucagon peptide, including any of positions 1-29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the C-terminal amino acid, provided that the glucagon activity is retained. Nonlimiting examples include \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28, or 29. The alkyl group can be covalently linked directly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide, or indirectly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide via a spacer, wherein the spacer is positioned between the amino acid of the glucagon peptide and the alkyl group. Glucagon peptides may be alkylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position. Nonlimiting examples include alkylation at \nposition\n 10 and pegylation at one or more positions in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide, e.g., \nposition\n 24, 28 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminus (e.g., through adding a C-terminal Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an alkyl group by direct alkylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon peptide. In some embodiments, alkylation is at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, or 29. In this regard, the alkylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, and 29 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol. In some specific embodiments of the invention, the direct alkylation of the glucagon peptide occurs through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of the amino acid at \nposition\n 10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine is an amino acid of Formula I. In some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula I, is the amino acid wherein n is 4 (Lys) or n is 3 (Orn).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain hydroxyl is an amino acid of Formula II. In some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula II is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Ser).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain thiol is an amino acid of Formula III. In some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula III is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol is a disubstituted amino acid comprising the same structure of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III, except that the hydrogen bonded to the alpha carbon of the amino acid of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III is replaced with a second side chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the alkylated glucagon peptide comprises a spacer between the peptide and the alkyl group. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is covalently bound to the spacer, which is covalently bound to the alkyl group. In some exemplary embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an alkyl group by alkylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a spacer, which spacer is attached to a side chain of an amino acid at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, or 29 of the glucagon peptide. The amino acid to which the spacer is attached can be any amino acid (e.g., a singly α-substituted amino acid or an α,α-disubstituted amino acid) comprising a moiety which permits linkage to the spacer. For example, an amino acid comprising a side chain NH\n2\n, —OH, or —COOH (e.g., Lys, Orn, Ser, Asp, or Glu) is suitable. In this respect, the alkylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, and 29 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or carboxylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol or a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen alkylation occurs through an amine group of a spacer, the alkylation can occur through the alpha amine of an amino acid or a side chain amine. In the instance in which the alpha amine is alkylated, the amino acid of the spacer can be any amino acid. For example, the amino acid of the spacer can be a hydrophobic amino acid, e.g., Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Trp, Met, Phe, Tyr, 6-amino hexanoic acid, 5-aminovaleric acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid. Alternatively, the amino acid of the spacer can be an acidic residue, e.g., Asp and Glu, provided that the alkylation occurs on the alpha amine of the acidic residue. In the instance in which the side chain amine of the amino acid of the spacer is alkylated, the amino acid of the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, e.g., an amino acid of Formula I (e.g., Lys or Orn). In this instance, it is possible for both the alpha amine and the side chain amine of the amino acid of the spacer to be alkylated, such that the glucagon peptide is dialkylated. Embodiments of the invention include such dialkylated molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen alkylation occurs through a hydroxyl group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula II. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Ser.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen alkylation occurs through a thiol group of spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula III. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Cys.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is a hydrophilic bifunctional spacer.

Nonlimiting examples of suitable spacers include a spacer comprising one or more amino acids selected from the group consisting of Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, and Ac-Phe.\n\n\n \n \nModifications that Reduce GLP-1 Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the glucagon peptide, or analog thereof, comprises an amino acid modification which selectively reduces GLP-1 activity. For example, the acylated or alkylated glucagon peptide, or analog thereof, comprises a C-terminal alpha carboxylate group; a substitution of the Thr at \nposition\n 7 with an amino acid lacking a hydroxyl group, e.g., Abu or Ile; deletion of the amino acid(s) C-terminal to the amino acid at position 27 or 28 (e.g., deletion of the amino acid at position 28, deletion of the amino acid at positions 28 and 29) to yield a peptide 27 or 28 amino acids in length, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \nConjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses other conjugates in which glucagon peptides of the invention are linked, optionally via covalent bonding and optionally via a linker, to a conjugate moiety. Linkage can be accomplished by covalent chemical bonds, physical forces such electrostatic, hydrogen, ionic, van der Waals, or hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions. A variety of non-covalent coupling systems may be used, including biotin-avidin, ligand/receptor, enzyme/substrate, nucleic acid/nucleic acid binding protein, lipid/lipid binding protein, cellular adhesion molecule partners; or any binding partners or fragments thereof which have affinity for each other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide can be linked to conjugate moieties via direct covalent linkage by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the peptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues of these targeted amino acids. Reactive groups on the peptide or conjugate moiety include, e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group. Derivatizing agents include, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride or other agents known in the art. Alternatively, the conjugate moieties can be linked to the peptide indirectly through intermediate carriers, such as polysaccharide or polypeptide carriers. Examples of polysaccharide carriers include aminodextran. Examples of suitable polypeptide carriers include polylysine, polyglutamic acid, polyaspartic acid, co-polymers thereof, and mixed polymers of these amino acids and others, e.g., serines, to confer desirable solubility properties on the resultant loaded carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteinyl residues are most commonly are reacted with α-haloacetates (and corresponding amines), such as chloroacetic acid, chloroacetamide to give carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Cysteinyl residues also are derivatized by reaction with bromotrifluoroacetone, alpha-bromo-β-(5-imidozoyl) propionic acid, chloroacetyl phosphate, N-alkylmaleimides, 3-nitro-2-pyridyl disulfide, methyl 2-pyridyl disulfide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, or chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHistidyl residues are derivatized by reaction with diethylpyrocarbonate at pH 5.5-7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para-bromophenacyl bromide also is useful; the reaction is preferably performed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLysinyl and amino-terminal residues are reacted with succinic or other carboxylic acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing alpha-amino-containing residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate, pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxal, chloroborohydride, trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, O-methylisourea, 2,4-pentanedione, and transaminase-catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nArginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional reagents, among them phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginine residues requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions because of the high pK\na \nof the guanidine functional group. Furthermore, these reagents may react with the groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon-amino group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specific modification of tyrosyl residues may be made, with particular interest in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly, N-acetylimidizole and tetranitromethane are used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro derivatives, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) are selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides (R—N═C═N—R′), where R and R′ are different alkyl groups, such as 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-4-ethyl) carbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl) carbodiimide. Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the alpha-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W.H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 (1983)), deamidation of asparagine or glutamine, acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and/or amidation or esterification of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of covalent modification involves chemically or enzymatically coupling glycosides to the peptide. Sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine, (b) free carboxyl groups, (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine, (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e) aromatic residues such as those of tyrosine, or tryptophan, or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO87/05330 published 11 Sep. 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306 (1981).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary conjugate moieties that can be linked to any of the glucagon peptides described herein include but are not limited to a heterologous peptide or polypeptide (including for example, a plasma protein), a targeting agent, an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region), a diagnostic label such as a radioisotope, fluorophore or enzymatic label, a polymer including water soluble polymers, or other therapeutic or diagnostic agents. In one embodiment a conjugate is provided comprising a glucagon peptide of the present invention and a plasma protein, wherein the plasma protein is selected from the group consisting of albumin, transferin, fibrinogen and globulins. In one embodiment the plasma protein moiety of the conjugate is albumin or transferin. In some embodiments, the linker comprises a chain of atoms from 1 to about 60, or 1 to 30 atoms or longer, 2 to 5 atoms, 2 to 10 atoms, 5 to 10 atoms, or 10 to 20 atoms long. In some embodiments, the chain atoms are all carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the chain atoms in the backbone of the linker are selected from the group consisting of C, O, N, and S. Chain atoms and linkers may be selected according to their expected solubility (hydrophilicity) so as to provide a more soluble conjugate. In some embodiments, the linker provides a functional group that is subject to cleavage by an enzyme or other catalyst or hydrolytic conditions found in the target tissue or organ or cell. In some embodiments, the length of the linker is long enough to reduce the potential for steric hindrance. If the linker is a covalent bond or a peptidyl bond and the conjugate is a polypeptide, the entire conjugate can be a fusion protein. Such peptidyl linkers may be any length. Exemplary linkers are from about 1 to 50 amino acids in length, 5 to 50, 3 to 5, 5 to 10, 5 to 15, or 10 to 30 amino acids in length. Such fusion proteins may alternatively be produced by recombinant genetic engineering methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, in some embodiments, the glucagon peptides are conjugated, e.g., fused to an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region). Known types of immunoglobulins (Ig) include IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD or IgM. The Fc region is a C-terminal region of an Ig heavy chain, which is responsible for binding to Fc receptors that carry out activities such as recycling (which results in prolonged half-life), antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, according to some definitions the human IgG heavy chain Fc region stretches from Cys226 to the C-terminus of the heavy chain. The “hinge region” generally extends from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgG1 (hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by aligning the cysteines involved in cysteine bonding). The Fc region of an IgG includes two constant domains, CH2 and CH3. The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 231 to amino acid 341. The CH3 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 342 to 447. References made to amino acid numbering of immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, or regions, are all based on Kabat et al. 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Public Health, Bethesda, Md. In a related embodiments, the Fc region may comprise one or more native or modified constant regions from an immunoglobulin heavy chain, other than CH1, for example, the CH2 and CH3 regions of IgG and IgA, or the CH3 and CH4 regions of IgE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable conjugate moieties include portions of immunoglobulin sequence that include the FcRn binding site. FcRn, a salvage receptor, is responsible for recycling immunoglobulins and returning them to circulation in blood. The region of the Fc portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn receptor has been described based on X-ray crystallography (Burmeister et al. 1994, Nature 372:379). The major contact area of the Fc with the FcRn is near the junction of the CH2 and CH3 domains. Fc-FcRn contacts are all within a single Ig heavy chain. The major contact sites include amino acid residues 248, 250-257, 272, 285, 288, 290-291, 308-311, and 314 of the CH\n2 \ndomain and amino acid residues 385-387, 428, and 433-436 of the CH3 domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome conjugate moieties may or may not include FcγR binding site(s). FcγR are responsible for ADCC and CDC. Examples of positions within the Fc region that make a direct contact with FcγR are amino acids 234-239 (lower hinge region), amino acids 265-269 (B/C loop), amino acids 297-299 (C′/E loop), and amino acids 327-332 (F/G) loop (Sondermann et al., Nature 406: 267-273, 2000). The lower hinge region of IgE has also been implicated in the FcRI binding (Henry, et al., Biochemistry 36, 15568-15578, 1997). Residues involved in IgA receptor binding are described in Lewis et al., (J. Immunol. 175:6694-701, 2005). Amino acid residues involved in IgE receptor binding are described in Sayers et al. (J Biol. Chem. 279(34):35320-5, 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid modifications may be made to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. Such variant Fc regions comprise at least one amino acid modification in the CH3 domain of the Fc region (residues 342-447) and/or at least one amino acid modification in the CH2 domain of the Fc region (residues 231-341). Mutations believed to impart an increased affinity for FcRn include T256A, T307A, E380A, and N434A (Shields et al. 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Other mutations may reduce binding of the Fc region to FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, and/or FcγRIIIA without significantly reducing affinity for FcRn. For example, substitution of the Asn at position 297 of the Fc region with Ala or another amino acid removes a highly conserved N-glycosylation site and may result in reduced immunogenicity with concomitant prolonged half-life of the Fc region, as well as reduced binding to FcγRs (Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847; Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68:1632; Shields et al. 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591) Amino acid modifications at positions 233-236 of IgG1 have been made that reduce binding to FcγRs (Ward and Ghetie 1995, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77 and Armour et al. 1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613). Some exemplary amino acid substitutions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,355,008 and 7,381,408, each incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses glucagon fusion peptides or proteins wherein a second peptide or polypeptide has been fused to a terminus, e.g., the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide. Exemplary candidates for C-terminal fusion include SEQ ID NO: 20 (GPSSGAPPPS), SEQ ID NO: 21 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 22 (KRNR) linked to amino acid 29 of the glucagon peptide.\n\n\n \nStabilization of the Alpha-Helix Structure\n\n\n \n \n \nReduction in glucagon activity upon modification of the amino acids at \nposition\n 1 and/or \nposition\n 2 of the glucagon peptide can be restored by stabilization of the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29). The alpha helix structure can be stabilized by, e.g., formation of a covalent or non-covalent intramolecular bridge, substitution and/or insertion of amino acids around positions 12-29 with an alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid (e.g., an α,α-disubstituted amino acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acid side chains to stabilize the three dimensional structure of the carboxy terminal portion (e.g., amino acids 12-29) of the glucagon peptide. The two amino acid side chains can be linked to one another through non-covalent bonds, e.g., hydrogen-bonding, ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds. When the two amino acid side chains are linked to one another through one or more covalent bonds, the peptide may be considered herein as comprising a covalent intramolecular bridge. When the two amino acid side chains are linked to one another through non-covalent bonds, e.g., hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, the peptide may be considered herein as comprising a non-covalent intramolecular bridge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 3 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions i and i+4, wherein i is any integer between 12 and 25 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25). More particularly, the side chains of the amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24 or 24 and 28 (amino acid pairs in which i=12, 16, 20, or 24) are linked to one another and thus stabilize the glucagon alpha helix. Alternatively, i can be 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, wherein the amino acids at positions i and i+4 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 8 atoms, or about 7-9 atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are two amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions j and j+3, wherein j is any integer between 12 and 26 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26). In some specific embodiments, j is 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, wherein amino acids at positions j and j+3 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 6 atoms, or about 5 to 7 atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 6 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions k and k+7, wherein k is any integer between 12 and 22 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22). In some specific embodiments, k is 12, 13, or 17. In an exemplary embodiment, k is 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of amino acid pairings that are capable of covalently bonding to form a six-atom linking bridge include Orn and Asp, Glu and an amino acid of Formula I, wherein n is 2, and homoglutamic acid and an amino acid of Formula I, wherein n is 1, wherein Formula I is:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of amino acid pairing that are capable of covalently bonding to form a seven-atom linking bridge include Orn-Glu (lactam ring); Lys-Asp (lactam); or Homoser-Homoglu (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form an eight-atom linker include Lys-Glu (lactam); Homolys-Asp (lactam); Orn-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Asp (lactam); or Tyr-Asp (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form a nine-atom linker include Homolys-Glu (lactam); Lys-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Glu (lactam); or Tyr-Glu (lactone). Any of the side chains on these amino acids may additionally be substituted with additional chemical groups, so long as the three-dimensional structure of the alpha-helix is not disrupted. One of ordinary skill in the art can envision alternative pairings or alternative amino acid analogs, including chemically modified derivatives, that would create a stabilizing structure of similar size and desired effect. For example, a homocysteine-homocysteine disulfide bridge is 6 atoms in length and may be further modified to provide the desired effect. Even without covalent linkage, the amino acid pairings described above or similar pairings that one of ordinary skill in the art can envision may also provide added stability to the alpha-helix through non-covalent bonds, for example, through formation of salt bridges or hydrogen-bonding interactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe size of a lactam ring can vary depending on the length of the amino acid side chains, and in one embodiment the lactam is formed by linking the side chains of a lysine amino acid to a glutamic acid side chain. Further exemplary embodiments include the following pairings, optionally with a lactam bridge: Glu at \nposition\n 12 with Lys at \nposition\n 16; native Lys at \nposition\n 12 with Glu at \nposition\n 16; Glu at \nposition\n 16 with Lys at \nposition\n 20; Lys at \nposition\n 16 with Glu at \nposition\n 20; Glu at \nposition\n 20 with Lys at \nposition\n 24; Lys at \nposition\n 20 with Glu at \nposition\n 24; Glu at \nposition\n 24 with Lys at position 28; Lys at \nposition\n 24 with Glu at position 28. Alternatively, the order of the amide bond in the lactam ring can be reversed (e.g., a lactam ring can be formed between the side chains of a Lys12 and a Glu16 or alternatively between a \nGlu\n 12 and a Lys16).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntramolecular bridges other than a lactam bridge can be used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon analog peptides. In one embodiment, the intramolecular bridge is a hydrophobic bridge. In this instance, the intramolecular bridge optionally is between the side chains of two amino acids that are part of the hydrophobic face of the alpha helix of the glucagon analog peptide. For example, one of the amino acids joined by the hydrophobic bridge can be the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 10, 14, and 18.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific aspect, olefin metathesis is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide using an all-hydrocarbon cross-linking system. The glucagon peptide in this instance can comprise α-methylated amino acids bearing olefinic side chains of varying length and configured with either R or S stereochemistry at the i and i+4 or i+7 positions. For example, the olefinic side can can comprise (CH\n2\n)\nn\n, wherein n is any integer between 1 to 6. In one embodiment, n is 3 for a cross-link length of 8 atoms. Suitable methods of forming such intramolecular bridges are described in the art. See, for example, Schafmeister et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n122: 5891-5892 (2000) and Walensky et al., \nScience \n305: 1466-1470 (2004). Alternatively, the glucagon peptide can comprise O-allyl Ser residues located on adjacent helical turns, which are bridged together via ruthenium-catalyzed ring closing metathesis. Such procedures of cross-linking are described in, for example, Blackwell et al., \nAngew, Chem., Int. Ed. \n37: 3281-3284 (1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another specific aspect, use of the unnatural thio-dialanine amino acid, lanthionine, which has been widely adopted as a peptidomimetic of cystine, is used to cross-link one turn of the alpha helix. Suitable methods of lanthionine-based cyclization are known in the art. See, for instance, Matteucci et al., \nTetrahedron Letters \n45: 1399-1401 (2004); Mayer et al., \nJ. Peptide Res. \n51: 432-436 (1998); Polinsky et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n35: 4185-4194 (1992); Osapay et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n40: 2241-2251 (1997); Fukase et al., \nBull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. \n65: 2227-2240 (1992); Harpp et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n36: 73-80 (1971); Goodman and Shao, \nPure Appl. Chem. \n68: 1303-1308 (1996); and Osapay and Goodman, \nJ. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. \n1599-1600 (1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, α, ω-diaminoalkane tethers, e.g., 1,4-diaminopropane and 1,5-diaminopentane) between two Glu residues at positions i and i+7 are used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Such tethers lead to the formation of a bridge 9-atoms or more in length, depending on the length of the diaminoalkane tether. Suitable methods of producing peptides cross-linked with such tethers are described in the art. See, for example, Phelan et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n119: 455-460 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment of the invention, a disulfide bridge is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Alternatively, a modified disulfide bridge in which one or both sulfur atoms are replaced by a methylene group resulting in an isosteric macrocyclization is used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Suitable methods of modifying peptides with disulfide bridges or sulfur-based cyclization are described in, for example, Jackson et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n113: 9391-9392 (1991) and Rudinger and Jost, \nExperientia \n20: 570-571 (1964).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide is stabilized via the binding of metal atom by two His residues or a His and Cys pair positioned at i and i+4. The metal atom can be, for example, Ru(III), Cu(II), Zn(II), or Cd(II). Such methods of metal binding-based alpha helix stabilization are known in the art. See, for example, Andrews and Tabor, \nTetrahedron \n55: 11711-11743 (1999); Ghadiri et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n112: 1630-1632 (1990); and Ghadiri et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n119: 9063-9064 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alpha helix of the glucagon peptide can alternatively be stabilized through other means of peptide cyclizing, which means are reviewed in Davies, \nJ. Peptide. Sci. \n9: 471-501 (2003). The alpha helix can be stabilized via the formation of an amide bridge, thioether bridge, thioester bridge, urea bridge, carbamate bridge, sulfonamide bridge, and the like. For example, a thioester bridge can be formed between the C-terminus and the side chain of a Cys residue. Alternatively, a thioester can be formed via side chains of amino acids having a thiol (Cys) and a carboxylic acid (e.g., Asp, Glu). In another method, a cross-linking agent, such as a dicarboxylic acid, e.g. suberic acid (octanedioic acid), etc. can introduce a link between two functional groups of an amino acid side chain, such as a free amino, hydroxyl, thiol group, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide is stabilized through the incorporation of hydrophobic amino acids at positions i and i+4. For instance, i can be Tyr and i+4 can be either Val or Leu; i can be Phe and i+4 can be Cys or Met; I can be Cys and i+4 can be Met; or i can be Phe and i+4 can be Ile. It should be understood that, for purposes herein, the above amino acid pairings can be reversed, such that the indicated amino acid at position i could alternatively be located at i+4, while the i+4 amino acid can be located at the i position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with other embodiments of the invention, the alpha helix is stabilized through incorporation (either by amino acid substitution or insertion) of one or more alpha helix-stabilizing amino acids at the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29). In a specific embodiment, the alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid is an α, α-disubstituted amino acid, including, but not limited to any of amino iso-butyric acid (AIB), an amino acid disubstituted with the same or a different group selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, and n-butyl, or with a cyclooctane or cycloheptane (e.g., 1-aminocyclooctane-1-carboxylic acid). In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 of the glucagon peptide is substituted with an α, α-disubstituted amino acid. In a specific embodiment, one, two, three or all of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 20, 21, and 24 are substituted with AIB. For example, the glucagon peptide can comprise a substitution of \nposition\n 16 with AIB in the absence of an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a non-covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a salt bridge) or a covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a lactam). Such peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge are advantageously easy to prepare.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptide lacking an intramolecular bridge comprises one or more substitutions within amino acid positions 12-29 with an α, α-disubstituted amino acid and an acyl or alkyl group covalently attached to the side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon peptide, e.g., the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide. In specific embodiments, the acyl or alkyl group is non-native to a naturally occurring amino acid. In certain aspects, the acyl or alkyl group is non-native to the amino acid at \nposition\n 10. Such acylated or alkylated glucagon peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge exhibit enhanced activity at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors as compared to the non-acylated counterpart peptides. Further enhancement in activity at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors can be achieved by the acylated glucagon peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge by incorporating a spacer between the acyl or alkyl group and the side chain of the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the peptide.

Anti-diabetic agents known in the art or under investigation include insulin, sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide (Orinase), acetohexamide (Dymelor), tolazamide (Tolinase), chlorpropamide (Diabinese), glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide (Diabeta, Micronase, Glynase), glimepiride (Amaryl), or gliclazide (Diamicron); meglitinides, such as repaglinide (Prandin) or nateglinide (Starlix); biguanides such as metformin (Glucophage) or phenformin; thiazolidinediones such as rosiglitazone (Avandia), pioglitazone (Actos), or troglitazone (Rezulin), or other PPARγ inhibitors; alpha glucosidase inhibitors that inhibit carbohydrate digestion, such as miglitol (Glyset), acarbose (Precose/Glucobay); exenatide (Byetta) or pramlintide; Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors such as vildagliptin or sitagliptin; SGLT (sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1) inhibitors; glucokinase activators (GKA); glucagon receptor antagonists (GRA); or FBPase (\nfructose\n 1,6-bisphosphatase) inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-obesity agents known in the art or under investigation include appetite suppressants, including phenethylamine type stimulants, phentermine (optionally with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine), diethylpropion (Tenuate®), phendimetrazine (Prelu-2®, Bontril®), benzphetamine (Didrex®), sibutramine (Meridia®, Reductil®); rimonabant (Acomplia®), other cannabinoid receptor antagonists; oxyntomodulin; fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac); Qnexa (topiramate and phentermine), Excalia (bupropion and zonisamide) or Contrave (bupropion and naltrexone); or lipase inhibitors, similar to xenical (Orlistat) or Cetilistat (also known as ATL-962), or GT 389-255.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a pre-formulated aqueous solution of the presently disclosed glucagon agonist for use in treating hypoglycemia. The improved stability and/or solubility of the agonist compositions described herein allow for the preparation of pre-formulated aqueous solutions of glucagon for rapid administration and treatment of hypoglycemia. Accordingly, in one embodiment a solution comprising a glucagon agonist of the present invention is provided for administration to a patient suffering from hypoglycemia. In one embodiment a solution comprising a pegylated glucagon agonist as disclosed herein is provided for administration to a patient suffering from hypoglycemia, wherein the total molecular weight of the PEG chains linked to the pegylated glucagon agonist is between about 500 to about 5,000 Daltons. In one embodiment the pegylated glucagon agonist comprises a peptide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18 and SEQ ID NO: 19, and glucagon agonist analogs of thereof, wherein the side chain of an amino acid residue at \n \nposition\n \n 16, 17, 21, 24 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid of said glucagon peptide is covalently bound to the polyethylene glycol chain. In one embodiment, the pegylated glucagon agonist comprises the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 16, wherein the amino acid residue at position 21 of the peptide is covalently linked to polyethylene glycol. In one embodiment, the pegylated glucagon agonist comprises the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 17, wherein the amino acid residue at \nposition\n 24 of the peptide is covalently linked to polyethylene glycol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe treatment methods in accordance with the present invention including but not limited to treatment of hypoglycemia, may comprise the steps of administering the presently disclosed glucagon agonists to a patient using any standard route of administration, including parenterally, such as intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously or intramuscularly, intrathecally, transdermally, rectally, orally, nasally or by inhalation. In one embodiment the composition is administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. In one embodiment, the composition is administered parenterally and the glucagon composition is prepackaged in a syringe. In another embodiment, the composition is prepackaged in an inhaler or other aerosolized drug deliver device. Advantageously, the aqueous stable glucagon analogs disclosed herein exhibit superior stability and solubility in aqueous buffers in the broadest pH range used for pharmacological purposes, relative to native glucagon. The use of the stabilized glucagon analogs disclosed herein allow for the preparation and storage of glucagon agonist solutions at physiological pH for long periods of time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApplicants have discovered that pegylated glucagon peptides can be prepared that retain the parent peptide's bioactivity and specificity. However, increasing the length of the PEG chain, or attaching multiple PEG chains to the peptide, such that the total molecular weight of the linked PEG is greater than 5,000 Daltons, begins to delay the time action of the modified glucagon. In accordance with one embodiment, a glucagon peptide of SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 13, or a glucagon agonist analog thereof, is provided wherein the peptide comprises one or more polyethylene glycol chains, wherein the total molecular weight of the linked PEG is greater than 5,000 Daltons, and in one embodiment is greater than 10,000 Daltons, but less than 40,000 Daltons. Such modified glucagon peptides have a delayed time of activity but without loss of the bioactivity. Accordingly, such compounds can be administered prophylactically to extend the effect of the administered glucagon peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon peptides that have been modified to be covalently bound to a PEG chain having a molecular weight of greater than 10,000 Daltons can be administered in conjunction with insulin to buffer the actions of insulin and help to maintain stable blood glucose levels in diabetics. The modified glucagon peptides of the present disclosure can be co-administered with insulin as a single composition, simultaneously administered as separate solutions, or alternatively, the insulin and the modified glucagon peptide can be administered at different time relative to one another. In one embodiment the composition comprising insulin and the composition comprising the modified glucagon peptide are administered within 12 hours of one another. The exact ratio of the modified glucagon peptide relative to the administered insulin will be dependent in part on determining the glucagon levels of the patient, and can be determined through routine experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment a composition is provided comprising insulin and a modified glucagon peptide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5 and glucagon agonist analogs thereof, wherein the modified glucagon peptide further comprises a polyethylene glycol chain covalently bound to an amino acid side chain at \n \nposition\n \n 16, 17, 21, 24, 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid. In one embodiment the composition is an aqueous solution comprising insulin and the glucagon analog. In embodiments wherein the glucagon peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 13, the peptide may further comprise a polyethylene glycol chain covalently bound to an amino acid side chain at \n \nposition\n \n 16, 17, 21, 24, 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid. In one embodiment the molecular weight of the PEG chain of the modified glucagon peptide is greater than 10,000 Daltons. In one embodiment the pegylated glucagon peptide comprises a peptide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11 and SEQ ID NO: 13 wherein the side chain of an amino acid residue at \nposition\n 21 or 24 of said glucagon peptide is covalently bound to the polyethylene glycol chain. In one embodiment the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight of about 10,000 to about 40,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment the modified glucagon peptides disclosed herein are used to induce temporary paralysis of the intestinal tract. This method has utility for radiological purposes and comprises the step of administering an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pegylated glucagon peptide, a glucagon peptide comprising a c-terminal extension or a dimer of such peptides. In one embodiment the glucagon peptide comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12 and SEQ ID NO: 13. In one embodiment the glucagon peptide further comprises a PEG chain, of about 1,000 to 40,000 Daltons is covalently bound to an amino acid residue at \nposition\n 21, 24 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid. In one embodiment the glucagon peptide is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16 and SEQ ID NO: 17. In one embodiment the PEG chain has a molecular weight of about 500 to about 5,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the composition used to induce temporary paralysis of the intestinal tract comprises a first modified glucagon peptide and a second modified glucagon peptide, wherein the first modified peptide comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11 and SEQ ID NO: 13, optionally linked to a PEG chain of about 500 to about 5,000 Daltons, and the second peptide comprises a covalently linked PEG chain of about 10,000 to about 40,000 Daltons. In this embodiment the PEG chain of each peptide is covalently bound to an amino acid residue at either \nposition\n 21, 24 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid, of the respective peptide, and independent of one another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOxyntomodulin, a naturally occurring digestive hormone found in the small intestine, has been reported to cause weight loss when administered to rats or humans (see Diabetes 2005; 54:2390-2395). Oxyntomodulin is a 37 amino acid peptide that contains the 29 amino acid sequence of glucagon (i.e. SEQ ID NO: 1) followed by an 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 23 (KRNRNNIA). Accordingly, applicants believe that the bioactivity of oxyntomodulin can be retained (i.e. appetite suppression and induced weight loss/weight maintenance), while improving the solubility and stability of the compound and improving the pharmacokinetics, by substituting the glucagon peptide portion of oxyntomodulin with the modified glucagon peptides disclosed herein. In addition applicants also believe that a truncated oxyntomodulin molecule comprising a glucagon peptide of the invention, having the terminal four amino acids of oxyntomodulin removed, will also be effective in suppressing appetite and inducing weight loss/weight maintenance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention also encompasses the modified glucagon peptides of the present invention that have a carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 21 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 22. In accordance with one embodiment a glucagon agonist analog of SEQ ID NO: 33, further comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 21 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 22 linked to amino acid 29 of the glucagon peptide, is administered to individuals to induce weight loss or prevent weight gain. In accordance with one embodiment a glucagon agonist analog of SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 13, further comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 21 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 22 linked to amino acid 29 of the glucagon peptide, is administered to individuals to induce weight loss or prevent weight gain.

In one embodiment the glucagon peptide segment of the glucagon agonist is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18 and SEQ ID NO: 19, wherein a PEG chain of about 1,000 to 40,000 Daltons is covalently bound to an amino acid residue at \n \nposition\n \n 16, 17, 21, 24, or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExendin-4 is a peptide made up of 39 amino acids. It is a powerful stimulator of a receptor known as GLP-1. This peptide has also been reported to suppress appetite and induce weight loss. Applicants have found that the terminal sequence of Exendin-4 when added at the carboxy terminus of glucagon improves the solubility and stability of glucagon without compromising the bioactivy of glucagon. In one embodiment the terminal ten amino acids of Exendin-4 (i.e. the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20 (GPSSGAPPPS)) are linked to the carboxy terminus of a glucagon peptide of the present disclosure. In specific aspects, the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20 is linked to the C-terminus of the glucagon peptide and the amino acid at position 29 is either Thr or Gly. These fusion proteins are anticipated to have pharmacological activity for suppressing appetite and inducing weight loss/weight maintenance. In one embodiment the terminal amino acid of the SEQ ID NO: 20 extension comprises an amide group in place of the carboxy group (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 23) and this sequence is linked to the carboxy terminus of a glucagon peptide of the present disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment a method of reducing weight gain or inducing weight loss in an individual comprises administering an effective amount of a composition comprising a glucagon agonist comprising a glucagon peptide of SEQ ID NO: 33 wherein amino acid 29 of the glucagon peptide is bound to a second peptide through a peptide bond, and said second peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20 (GPSSGAPPPS) or SEQ ID NO: 23.

In one embodiment the glucagon peptide of the glucagon agonist is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11 and SEQ ID NO: 13. In one embodiment the glucagon peptide segment of the fusion peptide is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16 and SEQ ID NO: 17, wherein the molecular weight of the PEG chain is selected from the range of 500 to 40,000 Daltons. More particularly, in one embodiment the glucagon peptide of the fusion peptide is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 16 and SEQ ID NO: 17 wherein the molecular weight of the PEG chain is selected from the range of 1,000 to 5,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment a composition is administered to a patient to suppress appetite, prevent weight gain and/or induce weight loss by the administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a first pegylated glucagon peptide and a second pegylated glucagon peptide, wherein the first and second peptide are fusion peptides comprising a c-terminal peptide extension comprising SEQ ID NO: 20 (GPSSGAPPPS) or SEQ ID NO: 23. The first pegylated glycogen peptide comprising a covalently linked PEG of about 500 to about 10,000 Daltons and the second pegylated glucagon peptide comprising a covalently linked PEG chain of about 10,000 to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses multimers of the modified glucagon peptides disclosed herein. Two or more of the modified glucagon peptides can be linked together using standard linking agents and procedures known to those skilled in the art. For example, dimers can be formed between two modified glucagon peptides through the use of bifunctional thiol crosslinkers and bi-functional amine crosslinkers, particularly for the glucagon peptides that have been substituted with cysteine, lysine ornithine, homocysteine or acetyl phenylalanine residues (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 4 and SEQ ID NO: 5). The dimer can be a homodimer or alternatively can be a heterodimer. In one embodiment the dimer comprises a homodimer of a glucagon fusion peptide wherein the glucagon peptide portion comprises an agonist analog of SEQ ID NO: 11 and an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20 (GPSSGAPPPS), SEQ ID NO: 21 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 22 (KRNR) linked to amino acid 29 of the glucagon peptide. In another embodiment the dimer comprises a homodimer of a glucagon agonist analog of SEQ ID NO: 11, wherein the glucagon peptide further comprises a polyethylene glycol chain covalently bound to \nposition\n 21, 24, 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid of the glucagon peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment a dimer is provided comprising a first glucagon peptide bound to a second glucagon peptide via a linker, wherein the first glucagon peptide comprises a peptide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 10 and SEQ ID NO: 11 and the second glucagon peptide comprises SEQ ID NO: 33. Furthermore, with regards to the second glucagon peptide, when the amino acid at position 28 is asparagine and the amino acid at position 29 is threonine, the second glucagon peptide further comprises one to two amino acids (independently selected from the group consisting of Lys, Arg, His, Asp or Glu), added to the carboxy terminus of the second glucagon peptide, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said glucagon polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with another embodiment a dimer is provided comprising a first glucagon peptide bound to a second glucagon peptide via a linker, wherein said first glucagon peptide is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12 and SEQ ID NO: 13 and the second glucagon peptide is independently selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11 and SEQ ID NO: 13, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said glucagon polypeptides.

Boc amino acids and HBTU were obtained from Midwest Biotech (Fishers, Ind.). Side chain protecting groups used were: Arg(Tos), Asn(Xan), Asp(OcHex), Cys(pMeBzl), His(Bom), Lys(2Cl—Z), Ser(OBzl), Thr(OBzl), Tyr(2Br—Z), and Trp(CHO). The side-chain protecting group on the N-terminal His was Boc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach completed peptidyl resin was treated with a solution of 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide to remove the formyl group from the tryptophan. Liquid hydrogen fluoride cleavages were performed in the presence of p-cresol and dimethyl sulfide. The cleavage was run for 1 hour in an ice bath using an HF apparatus (Penninsula Labs). After evaporation of the HF, the residue was suspended in diethyl ether and the solid materials were filtered. Each peptide was extracted into 30-70 ml aqueous acetic acid and a diluted aliquot was analyzed by HPLC [Beckman System Gold, 0.46×5 cm Zorbax C8, 1 ml/min, 45 C, 214 nm, A buffer=0.1% TFA, B=0.1% TFA/90% acetonitrile, gradient of 10% to 80% B over 10 min].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification was done on a FPLC over a 2.2×25 cm Kromasil C18 column while monitoring the UV at 214 nm and collecting 5 minute fractions. The homogeneous fractions were combined and lyophilized to give a product purity of >95%. The correct molecular mass and purity were confirmed using MALDI-mass spectral analysis.\n\n\n \nGeneral Pegylation Protocol: (Cys-maleimido)\n\n\n \n \n \nTypically, the glucagon Cys analog is dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (5-10 mg/ml) and 0.01M ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid is added (10-15% of total volume). Excess (2-fold) maleimido methoxyPEG reagent (Nektar) is added and the reaction stirred at room temp while monitoring reaction progress by HPLC. After 8-24 hrs, the reaction mixture, is acidified and loaded onto a preparative reverse phase column for purification using 0.1% TFA/acetonitrile gradient. The appropriate fractions were combined and lyophilized to give the desired pegylated analogs.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nSynthesis of Glucagon Cys\n17\n(1-29) and Similar MonoCys Analogs\n\n\n \n \n \n0.2 mmole Boc Thr(OBzl) Pam resin (SynChem Inc) in a 60 ml reaction vessel and the following sequence was entered and run on a modified Applied Biosystems 430A Peptide Synthesizer using FastBoc HBTU-activated single couplings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHSQGTFTSDYSKYLDSCRAQDFVQWLMNT\n \n(SEQ ID NO: 27)\n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe following side chain protecting groups were used: Arg(Tos), Asp(OcHex), Asn(Xan), Cys(pMeBzl), Glu(OcHex), His(Boc), Lys(2Cl—Z), Ser(Bzl), Thr(Bzl), Trp(CHO), and Tyr(Br—Z).

Serial 3-fold dilutions of the peptides made in scintillation proximity assay buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin) were mixed in 96 well white/clear bottom plate (Corning Inc., Acton, Mass.) with 0.05 nM (3-iodotyrosyl) Tyr10 glucagon (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.), 1-6 micrograms per well, plasma membrane fragments prepared from cells over-expressing human glucagon receptor, and 1 mg/well polyethyleneimine-treated wheat germ agglutinin type A scintillation proximity assay beads (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Upon 5 min shaking at 800 rpm on a rotary shaker, the plate was incubated 12 h at room temperature and then read on MicroBeta1450 liquid scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.). Non-specifically bound (NSB) radioactivity was measured in the wells with 4 times greater concentration of “cold” native ligand than the highest concentration in test samples and total bound radioactivity was detected in the wells with no competitor. Percent specific binding was calculated as following: % Specific Binding=((Bound-NSB)/(Total bound-NSB))×100. IC\n50 \nvalues were determined by using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, Mass.).\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nFunctional Assay-cAMP Synthesis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of glucagon analogs to induce cAMP was measured in a firefly luciferase-based reporter assay. HEK293 cells co-transfected with either glucagon- or GLP-1 receptor and luciferase gene linked to cAMP responsive element were serum deprived by culturing 16 h in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) supplemented with 0.25% Bovine Growth Serum (HyClone, Logan, Utah) and then incubated with serial dilutions of either glucagon, GLP-1 or novel glucagon analogs for 5 h at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nin 96 well poly-D-Lysine-coated “Biocoat” plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). At the end of the \nincubation\n 100 microliters of LucLite luminescence substrate reagent (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.) were added to each well. The plate was shaken briefly, incubated 10 min in the dark and light output was measured on MicroBeta-1450 liquid scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.). The luminescent light output indicates activation of the luciferase reporter gene, which in turn is a measure of the activation of the receptor. Effective 50% concentrations (“EC50”) were calculated by using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, Mass. Results are shown in Tables 2 and 3. EC50 is the concentration of the peptide that produces 50% of the peptide's maximum activation response at the indicated receptor. A relatively lower EC50 indicates that a peptide is relatively more potent at that receptor, while a higher EC50 indicates that a peptide is less potent.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncAMP Induction by Glucagon Analogs with C-Terminus Extension\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncAMP Induction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlucagon Receptor\n\n\nGLP-1 Receptor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nEC\n50\n, nM\n\n\nN*\n\n\nEC\n50\n, nM\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon\n\n\n0.22 ± 0.09\n\n\n14\n\n\n3.85 ± 1.64\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGLP-1\n\n\n2214.00 ± 182.43 \n\n\n2\n\n\n0.04 ± 0.01\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon Cex\n\n\n0.25 ± 0.15\n\n\n6\n\n\n2.75 ± 2.03\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxyntomodulin\n\n\n3.25 ± 1.65\n\n\n5\n\n\n2.53 ± 1.74\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxyntomodulin KRNR\n\n\n2.77 ± 1.74\n\n\n4\n\n\n3.21 ± 0.49\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon R12\n\n\n0.41 ± 0.17\n\n\n6\n\n\n0.48 ± 0.11\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon R12 Cex\n\n\n0.35 ± 0.23\n\n\n10\n\n\n1.25 ± 0.63\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon R12 K20\n\n\n0.84 ± 0.40\n\n\n5\n\n\n0.82 ± 0.49\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon R12 K24\n\n\n1.00 ± 0.39\n\n\n4\n\n\n1.25 ± 0.97\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon R12 K29\n\n\n0.81 ± 0.49\n\n\n5\n\n\n0.41 ± 0.24\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon Amide\n\n\n0.26 ± 0.15\n\n\n3\n\n\n1.90 ± 0.35\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxyntomodulin C24\n\n\n2.54 ± 0.63\n\n\n2\n\n\n5.27 ± 0.26\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxyntomodulin C24\n\n\n0.97 ± 0.04\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.29 ± 0.11\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPEG 20K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*number of experiments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncAMP Induction by Pegylated Glucagon Analogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncAMP Induction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlucagon Receptor\n\n\nGLP-1 Receptor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nEC\n50\n, nM\n\n\nN*\n\n\nEC\n50\n, nM\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon\n\n\n0.33 ± 0.23\n\n\n18\n\n\n12.71 ± 3.74\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon C17 PEG 5K\n\n\n0.82 ± 0.15\n\n\n4\n\n\n55.86 ± 1.13\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon C21 PEG 5K\n\n\n0.37 ± 0.16\n\n\n6\n\n\n11.52 ± 3.68\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon C24 PEG 5K\n\n\n0.22 ± 0.10\n\n\n12\n\n\n13.65 ± 2.95\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon C29 PEG 5K\n\n\n0.96 ± 0.07\n\n\n2\n\n\n12.71 ± 3.74\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon C24 PEG 20K\n\n\n0.08 ± 0.05\n\n\n3\n\n\nNot determined\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon C24 Dimer\n\n\n0.10 ± 0.05\n\n\n3\n\n\nNot determined\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGLP-1\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n \n\n\n 0.05 ± 0.02\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*number of experiments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData for additional glucagon analogs is presented in \nFIGS. 6-9\n and in Table 4\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nObserved EC50s (nM) in Cells Overexpressing\n \n \n \nthe \nGlucagon Receptor\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTest\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1\n \n \nTest\n 2\n \n \nTest3\n \n \nTest\n \n 4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGlucagon standard\n \n0.12\n \n0.04\n \n0.05\n \n0.11\n \n \n \n \n \nK29\n \n0.35\n \n \n \n \n \n0.22\n \n \n \n \n \nK30\n \n0.22\n \n0.06\n \n \n \n \n \nK29, K30\n \n0.89\n \n \n \n \n \nK30, K31\n \n \n \n0.12\n \n \n \n \n \nD28\n \n \n \n0.05\n \n \n \n0.17\n \n \n \n \n \nE28\n \n \n \n \n \n0.14\n \n \n \n \n \nE29\n \n \n \n0.05\n \n0.04\n \n \n \n \n \nE30\n \n \n \n0.04\n \n \n \n \n \nD28, E29\n \n \n \n \n \n0.03\n \n \n \n \n \nD28, E30\n \n \n \n \n \n0.05\n \n \n \n \n \nD28, E15\n \n \n \n \n \n0.15\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 11\n displays data on cAMP induction at the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors for a glucagon analog with the following modifications: T16, A20, E21, A24, Nle27, D28, and E29 (SEQ ID NO: 56).

After adjusting the pH (4, 5, 6, 7), the samples were incubated over a specified time period at 37° C. and re-analyzed by HPLC to determine the integrity of the peptide. The concentration of the specific peptide of interest was determined and the percent remaining intact was calculated relative to the initial analysis. Results for Glucagon Cys\n21\n-maleimidoPEG\n5K \nare shown in \nFIGS. 1 and 2\n.\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\nSynthesis of Glucagon Lactams\n\n\n \n \n \n285 mg (0.2 mmole) methoxybenzhydrylamine resin (Midwest Biotech) was added to a 60 mL reaction vessels and the following sequence was assembled on a modified Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer using Boc DEPBT-activated single couplings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following side chain protecting groups were used: Arg(Tos), Asp(OcHx), Asn(Xan), Glu(OFm), His(BOM), Lys(Fmoc), Ser(Bzl), Thr(Bzl), Trp(CHO), Tyr(Br—Z). As an example, Lys(Cl—Z) was used to protect the native Lys at \nposition\n 12 if lactams were constructed from 16-20, 20-24, or 24-28. The completed peptidyl resin was treated with 20% piperidine/dimethylformamide for one hour with rotation to remove the Trp formyl group as well as the Fmoc and OFm protection from \nLys\n 12 and Glu16. Upon confirmation of removal by a positive ninhydrin test, the resin was washed with dimethylformamide, followed by dichloromethane and than again with dimethylformamide. The resin was treated with 520 mg (1 mmole) Benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) in dimethylformamide and diisopropylethylamine (DIEA). The reaction proceeded for 8-10 hours and the cyclization was confirmed by a negative ninhydrin reaction. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide, followed by dichloromethane and subsequently treated with trifluoroacetic acid for 10 minutes. The removal of the Boc group was confirmed by a positive ninhydrin reaction. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide and dichloromethane and dried before being transferred to a hydrofluoric acid (HF) reaction vessel. 500 μL p-cresol was added along with a magnetic stir bar. The vessel was attached to the HF apparatus (Peninsula Labs), cooled in a dry ice/methanol bath, evacuated, and approximately 10 mL of liquid hydrofluoric acid was condensed into the vessel. The reaction was stirred for 1 hour in an ice bath and the HF was subsequently removed in vacuo. The residue was suspended in ethyl ether; the solids were filtered, washed with ether, and the peptide was solubilized with 150 \nmL\n 20% acetonitrile/1% acetic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn analytical HPLC analysis of the crude solubilized peptide was conducted under the following conditions [4.6×30 mm Xterra C8, 1.50 mL/min, 220 nm, A buffer 0.1% TFA/10% ACN, B buffer 0.1% TFA/100% ACN, gradient 5-95% B over 15 minutes]. The extract was diluted twofold with water and loaded onto a 2.2×25 cm Vydac C4 preparative reverse phase column and eluted using an acetonitrile gradient on a Waters HPLC system (A buffer of 0.1% TFA/10% ACN, B buffer of 0.1% TFA/10% CAN and a gradient of 0-100% B over 120 minutes at a flow of 15.00 ml/min HPLC analysis of the purified peptide demonstrated greater than 95% purity and electrospray ionization mass spectral analysis confirmed a mass of 3506 Da for the 12-16 lactam.

For example, T16, A20, E21, A24, Nle27, D28, E29 (SEQ ID NO: 56) was constructed.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA glucagon peptide with the following modifications from SEQ ID NO: 1 was constructed generally as described herein: DMIA1, E16, K20-glucagon-COOH (C24-PEG, E16 to K20 lactam). Its sequence is set forth below: DMIA-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Cys*-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr-COOH, in which the Cys* at \nposition\n 24 was Cys attached to a PEG of about 40,000 dalton molecular weight, and in which the Glu at \nposition\n 16 and the Lys at \nposition\n 20 were linked via a lactam bridge (SEQ ID NO: 40). This peptide was tested for activity at the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors generally according to Example 13. The peptide exhibited 27.7% of the potency of native glucagon and 1.1% of the potency of native GLP-1.\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\nPreparation of Acylated and/or PEGylated Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nAcylated and/or PEGylated peptides are prepared as follows. Peptides are synthesized on a solid support resin using either a CS Bio 4886 Peptide Synthesizer or Applied Biosystems 430A Peptide Synthesizer. In situ neutralization chemistry is used as described by Schnolzer et al., \nInt. J. Peptide Protein Res. \n40: 180-193 (1992). For acylated peptides, the target amino acid residue to be acylated (e.g., position ten) is substituted with an N ε-FMOC lysine residue. Treatment of the completed N-terminally BOC protected peptide with 20% piperidine in DMF for 30 minutes removes FMOC/formyl groups. Coupling to the free s-amino Lys residue is achieved by coupling a ten-fold molar excess of either an FMOC-protected spacer amino acid (ex. FMOC-(N—BOC)-Tryptophan-OH) or acyl chain (ex. C17-COOH) and PyBOP or DEPBT coupling reagent in DMF/DIEA. Subsequent removal of the spacer amino acid's FMOC group is followed by repetition of coupling with an acyl chain. Final treatment with 100% TFA results in removal of any side chain protecting groups and the N-terminal BOC group. Peptide resins are neutralized with 5% DIEA/DMF, are dried, and then are cleaved from the support using HF/p-cresol, 95:5, at 0° C. for one hour. Following ether extraction, a 5% HOAc solution is used to solvate the crude peptide. A sample of the solution is then verified to contain the correct molecular weight peptide by ESI-MS. Correct peptides are purified by RP-HPLC using a linear gradient of 10% CH\n3\nCN/0.1% TFA to 0.1% TFA in 100% CH\n3\nCN. A Vydac C18 22 mm×250 mm protein column is used for the purification. Acylated peptide analogs generally complete elution by a buffer ratio of 20:80. Portions are pooled together and checked for purity on an analytical RP-HPLC. Pure fractions are lyophilized yielding white, solid peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a peptide comprises a lactam bridge and target residues to be acylated, acylation is carried out as described above upon addition of that amino acid to the peptide backbone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor peptide pegylation, 40 kDa methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) maleimido-propionamide (Chirotech Technology Ltd.) is reacted with a molar equivalent of peptide in 7M Urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer using the minimal amount of solvent needed to dissolve both peptide and PEG into a clear solution (generally less than 2 mL for a reaction using 2-3 mg peptide). Vigorous stirring at room temperature commences for 4-6 hours and the reaction is analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC. PEGylated products appear distinctly from the starting material with decreased retention times. Purification is performed on a Vydac C4 column with conditions similar to those used for the initial peptide purification. Elution typically occurs around buffer ratios of 50:50. Fractions of pure PEGylated peptide are collected and lyophilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides are assayed for biological activity as described above in Example 13.\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\nChanges in Serum Glucose Concentration in Beagle Dogs after Administration of Glucagon Analogs\n\n\n \n \n \nCanine/Beagle dogs of 8-12 kg, being of 8-16 months of age and good health were used to determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glucagon action. Every animal was fasted overnight and bled at the following time points after each dose: 0 hr. (pre-dose), 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 240 minutes post dose. Six animals were used for each dose group and approximately 1-2 ml of whole blood was withdrawn at each time point. About 1.0 ml whole blood was added to K\n2 \nEDTA tubes containing a sufficient volume of Trasylol (aprotinin) to yield at least 500 KIU/mL of whole blood. Approximately 500 uL plasma was collected after centrifuging the samples in a refrigerated centrifuge at about 1,500-3,000×g for 10-15 min The samples were transferred to plastic vials and stored frozen at −70° C., or below. The remaining 1.0 mL of whole blood was converted into serum by placing blood sample into an empty tube, letting sit at ambient temperature for 15-20 min, then centrifuging at 1,500-3,000×g for 10-15 min. in a refrigerated centrifuge. The samples were transferred to plastic vials and stored frozen at −70° C., or below. Glucagon and the analogs were dissolved in 0.01N HCl at a concentration of 0.1667 mg/ml and the animals were dosed at 0.03 ml/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe animals were administered a 0.005 mg/kg dose intramuscularly of either glucagon, a glucagon analog comprising glucagon with the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 31 linked to the carboxy terminus of glucagon (glucagon-CEX) or a glucagon analog comprising an aspartic acid substitution at amino acid 28 (glucagon-Asp28) SEQ ID NO: 11.

As shown in these figures, the stability of the peptides was greatest for the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 71 and was least for the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 78, although 90% of the peptide at 30 deg. C. was detected after 2 months time. No significant loss in peak area was observed with SEQ ID NO: 71, indicating good chemical and biophysical stabilities of the peptide.\n\n\n \nExample 27\n\n\n \n \n \nDIO mice (8 mice per group), each with an average bodyweight of 48.7 g, were subcutaneously injected daily for seven days with vehicle only, with 30 nmol/kg or 100 nmol/kg of an acylated glucagon analog peptide, or with the long-acting GLP-1 analog, Liraglutide (Novo Nordisk, Denmark). The acylated glucagon analogs were as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“(C16) Glucagon Amide” comprised the amino acid sequence of wild-type glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) with the Tyr at position 10 modified to an acylated Lys residue, wherein the acylated Lys comprised a C16 fatty acyl group, and the C-terminal carboxylate replaced with an amide group;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“γE-γE-C16 Glucagon Amide” comprised the same structure of C16 Glucagon Amide, except that the C16 fatty acyl group was attached to the Lys at position 10 through a gamma-Glu-gamma-Glu dipeptide spacer (see structure of acylated Lys below);\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“AA-C16 Glucagon Amide” comprised the same structure of C16 Glucagon Amide, except that the C16 fatty acyl group was attached to the Lys at \nposition\n 10 through an Ala-Ala dipeptide spacer; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“βAβA-C16 Glucagon Amide” comprised the same structure of C16 Glucagon Amide, except that the C16 fatty acyl group was attached to the Lys at \nposition\n 10 through an β-Ala-β-Ala dipeptide spacer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe body weight of the mice was monitored daily and the total change in body weight (%) is shown in \nFIG. 15\n. As shown in \nFIG. 15\n, most of the acylated glucagon peptides at each dose caused a reduction in body weight. While Liraglutide demonstrated an approximate 12% decrease in body weight, the glucagon analog peptide γE-γE-C16 Glucagon Amide exhibited the greatest ability to cause weight loss in mice at the matched dose. Even the lower dose of γE-γE-C16 Glucagon Amide caused a substantial decrease in body weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fat mass of the mice was measured on \nDay\n 7 of the study. As shown in \nFIG. 16\n, the mice which were administered 100 nmol/kg γE-γE-C16 Glucagon Amide exhibited the lowest fat mass.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood glucose levels of the mice were also monitored during the course of the assay. As shown in \nFIG. 17\n, the glucagon analog peptide γE-γE-C16 Glucagon Amide at the higher dose worked as well as Liraglutide to decrease blood glucose levels in mice.\n\n\n \nExample 28\n\n\n \n \n \nGlucagon analog peptides were made by solid-phase peptide synthesis as described herein and were acylated at either \n \nposition\n \n 10 or 30 of the peptide.

In an exemplary embodiment, the heteroatoms can be selected from the group consisting of B, O, N and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) B, O, N and S may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—N(CH\n3\n)—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—S—CH\n2\n—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n, —S(O)—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—S(O)\n2\n—CH\n3\n, —CH═CH—O—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH═N—OCH\n3\n, and —CH═CH—N(CH\n3\n)—CH\n3\n. Up to two heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, —CH\n2\n—NH—OCH\n3\n. Similarly, the term “heteroalkylene” by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—S—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— and —CH\n2\n—S—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—CH\n2\n—. For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula —C(O)\n2\nR′— represents both —C(O)\n2\nR′— and —R′C(O)\n2\n—.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “cycloalkyl” and “heterocycloalkyl”, by themselves or in combination with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of “alkyl” and “heteroalkyl”, respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, 1-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl, tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1-piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “halo” or “halogen,” by themselves or as part of another substituent, mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally, terms such as “haloalkyl,” are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For example, the term “halo(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl” is mean to include, but not be limited to, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “aryl” means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, aromatic, substituent that can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from 1 or 2 or 3 rings), which are fused together or linked covalently. The term “heteroaryl” refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain from one to four heteroatoms. In an exemplary embodiment, the heteroatom is selected from B, N, O, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1-isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl, and 6-quinolyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor brevity, the term “aryl” when used in combination with other terms (e.g., aryloxy, arylthioxy, arylalkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above. Thus, the term “arylalkyl” is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (e.g., a methylene group) has been replaced by, for example, an oxygen atom (e.g., phenoxymethyl, 2-pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(1-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the above terms (e.g., “alkyl,” “heteroalkyl,” “aryl” and “heteroaryl”) are meant to include both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred substituents for each type of radical are provided below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals (including those groups often referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) are generically referred to as “alkyl group substituents,” and they can be one or more of a variety of groups selected from, but not limited to: —R′, —OR′, ═O, ═NR′, ═N—OR′, —NR′R″, —SR′, -halogen, —SiR′R″R′″, —OC(O)R′, —C(O)R′, —CO\n2\nR′, —CONR′R″, —OC(O)NR′R″, —NR″C(O)R′, —NR′—C(O)NR″R′″, —NR″C(O)\n2\nR′, —NR′″″—C(NR′R″R′″)═NR″″, —NR′″—C(NR′R″)═NR′″, —S(O)R′, —S(O)\n2\nR′, —S(O)\n2\nNR′R″, —NR″SO\n2\nR′, —CN, —NO\n2\n, —N\n3\n, —CH(Ph)\n2\n, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, and fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to (2 m′+1), where m′ is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical. R′, R″, R′″, R″″ and R′″″ each preferably independently refer to hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, e.g., aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R′, R″, R′″, R″″ and R′″″ groups when more than one of these groups is present. When R′ and R″ are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, —NR′R″ is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term “alkyl” is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., —CF\n3 \nand —CH\n2\nCF\n3\n) and acyl (e.g., —C(O)CH\n3\n, —C(O)CF\n3\n, —C(O)CH\n2\nOCH\n3\n, and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for the aryl and heteroaryl groups are generically referred to as “aryl group substituents.” The substituents are selected from, for example: —R′, —OR′, ═O, ═NR′, ═N—OR′, —NR′R″, —SR′, -halogen, —SiR′R″R′″, —OC(O)R′, —C(O)R′, —CO\n2\nR′, —CONR′R″, —OC(O)NR′R″, —NR″C(O)R′, —NR′—C(O)NR″R′″, —NR″C(O)\n2\nR′, —NR′″″—C(NR′R″R′″)═NR″″, —NR″″—C(NR′R″)═NR′″, —S(O)R′, —S(O)\n2\nR′, —S(O)\n2\nNR′R″, —NR″SO\n2\nR′, —CN, —NO\n2\n, —N\n3\n, —CH(Ph)\n2\n, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, and fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and where R′, R″, R′″, R″″ and R′″″ are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R′, R″, R′″, R″″ and R′″″ groups when more than one of these groups is present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -T-C(O)—(CRR′)\nq\n—U—, wherein T and U are independently —NR—, —O—, —CRR′— or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 3. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -A-(CH\n2\n)\nr\nB—, wherein A and B are independently —CRR′—, —O—, —NR—, —S—, —S(O)—, —S(O)\n2\n—, —S(O)\n2\n—NR′— or a single bond, and r is an integer of from 1 to 4. One of the single bonds of the new ring so formed may optionally be replaced with a double bond. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula —(CRR′)\ns\n—X—(CR″R′″)\nd\n—, where s and d are independently integers of from 0 to 3, and X is —O—, —NR′—, —S—, —S(O)—, —S(O)\n2\n—, or —S(O)\n2\nNR′—. The substituents R, R′, R″ and R′″ are preferably independently selected from hydrogen or substituted or unsubstituted C\n1 \nor C\n2 \nor C\n3 \nor C\n4 \nor C\n5 \nor C\n6 \nalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Ring” as used herein, means a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, or substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. A ring includes fused ring moieties. The number of atoms in a ring is typically defined by the number of members in the ring. For example, a “5- to 7-membered ring” means there are 5 or 6 or 7 atoms in the encircling arrangement. Unless otherwise specified, the ring optionally includes a heteroatom. Thus, the term “5- to 7-membered ring” includes, for example phenyl, pyridinyl and piperidinyl. The term “5- to 7-membered heterocycloalkyl ring”, on the other hand, would include pyridinyl and piperidinyl, but not phenyl. The term “ring” further includes a ring system comprising more than one “ring”, wherein each “ring” is independently defined as above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “heteroatom” includes atoms other than carbon (C) and hydrogen (H). Examples include oxygen (O), nitrogen (N) sulfur (S), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), aluminum (Al) and boron (B).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “leaving group” means a functional group or atom which can be displaced by another functional group or atom in a substitution reaction, such as a nucleophilic substitution reaction. By way of example, representative leaving groups include triflate, chloro, bromo and iodo groups; sulfonic ester groups, such as mesylate, tosylate, brosylate, nosylate and the like; and acyloxy groups, such as acetoxy, trifluoroacetoxy and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe symbol “R” is a general abbreviation that represents a substituent group that is selected from substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl and substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “effective” amount of a drug, formulation, or permeant is meant a sufficient amount of an active agent to provide the desired local or systemic effect. A “Topically effective,” “pharmaceutically effective,” or “therapeutically effective” amount refers to the amount of drug needed to effect the desired therapeutic result.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Topically effective” refers to a material that, when applied to the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof produces a desired pharmacological result either locally at the place of application or systemically as a result of transdermal passage of an active ingredient in the material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” is meant to include a salt of a compound of the invention which is prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino (such as choline or diethylamine or amino acids such as d-arginine, 1-arginine, d-lysine, 1-lysine), or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When compounds of the invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts”, Journal of Pharmaceutical Science 66: 1-19 (1977)). Certain specific compounds of the invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe neutral forms of the compounds are preferably regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compounds in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to salt forms, the invention provides compounds which are in a prodrug form. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the invention. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of the invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are encompassed within the scope of the invention. Certain compounds of the invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of the invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers and individual isomers are encompassed within the scope of the invention. The graphic representations of racemic, ambiscalemic and scalemic or enantiomerically pure compounds used herein are taken from Maehr, \nJ. Chem. Ed. \n1985, 62: 114-120. Solid and broken wedges are used to denote the absolute configuration of a stereocenter unless otherwise noted. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention can exist in particular geometric or stereoisomeric forms. The invention contemplates all such compounds, including cis- and trans-isomers, (−)- and (+)-enantiomers, (R)- and (S)-enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)-isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, such as enantiomerically or diastereomerically enriched mixtures, as falling within the scope of the invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms can be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptically active (R)- and (S)-isomers and d and/isomers can be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. If, for instance, a particular enantiomer of a compound of the invention is desired, it can be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, or by derivatization with a chiral auxiliary, where the resulting diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic functional group, such as an amino group, or an acidic functional group, such as a carboxyl group, diastereomeric salts can be formed with an appropriate optically active acid or base, followed by resolution of the diastereomers thus formed by fractional crystallization or chromatographic means known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantiomers. In addition, separation of enantiomers and diastereomers is frequently accomplished using chromatography employing chiral, stationary phases, optionally in combination with chemical derivatization (e.g., formation of carbamates from amines).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (\n3\nH), iodine-125 (\n125\nI) or carbon-14 (\n14\nC). The compounds may also be labeled with stable isotopes such as deuterium. All isotopic variations of the compounds of the invention, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” or “pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle” refers to any formulation or carrier medium that provides the appropriate delivery of an effective amount of an active agent as defined herein, does not interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active agent, and that is sufficiently non-toxic to the host or patient. Representative carriers include water, oils, both vegetable and mineral, cream bases, lotion bases, ointment bases and the like. These bases include suspending agents, thickeners, penetration enhancers, and the like. Their formulation is well known to those in the art of cosmetics and topical pharmaceuticals. Additional information concerning carriers can be found in \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n21st Ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins (2005) which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Pharmaceutically acceptable topical carrier” and equivalent terms refer to pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, as described herein above, suitable for topical application. An inactive liquid or cream vehicle capable of suspending or dissolving the active agent(s), and having the properties of being nontoxic and non-inflammatory when applied to the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof is an example of a pharmaceutically-acceptable topical carrier. This term is specifically intended to encompass carrier materials approved for use in topical cosmetics as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable additive” refers to preservatives, antioxidants, fragrances, emulsifiers, dyes and excipients known or used in the field of drug formulation and that do not unduly interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active agent, and that is sufficiently non-toxic to the host or patient. Additives for topical formulations are well-known in the art, and may be added to the topical composition, as long as they are pharmaceutically acceptable and not deleterious to the epithelial cells or their function. Further, they should not cause deterioration in the stability of the composition. For example, inert fillers, anti-irritants, tackifiers, excipients, fragrances, opacifiers, antioxidants, gelling agents, stabilizers, surfactant, emollients, coloring agents, preservatives, buffering agents, other permeation enhancers, and other conventional components of topical or transdermal delivery formulations as are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “enhancement,” “penetration enhancement” or “permeation enhancement” relate to an increase in the permeability of the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof to a drug, so as to increase the rate at which the drug permeates through the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof. The enhanced permeation effected through the use of such enhancers can be observed, for example, by measuring the rate of diffusion of the drug through animal skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof using a diffusion cell apparatus. A diffusion cell is described by Merritt et al. Diffusion Apparatus for Skin Penetration, \nJ of Controlled Release, \n1 (1984) pp. 161-162. The term “permeation enhancer” or “penetration enhancer” intends an agent or a mixture of agents, which, alone or in combination, act to increase the permeability of the skin, nail, hair or hoof to a drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “excipients” is conventionally known to mean carriers, diluents and/or vehicles used in formulating drug compositions effective for the desired use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “topical administration” refers to the application of a pharmaceutical agent to the external surface of the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof, such that the agent crosses the external surface of the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof and enters the underlying tissues. Topical administration includes application of the composition to intact skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof, or to a broken, raw or open wound of skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof. Topical administration of a pharmaceutical agent can result in a limited distribution of the agent to the skin and surrounding tissues or, when the agent is removed from the treatment area by the bloodstream, can result in systemic distribution of the agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “transdermal delivery” refers to the diffusion of an agent across the barrier of the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof resulting from topical administration or other application of a composition. The stratum corneum acts as a barrier and few pharmaceutical agents are able to penetrate intact skin. In contrast, the epidermis and dermis are permeable to many solutes and absorption of drugs therefore occurs more readily through skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof that is abraded or otherwise stripped of the stratum corneum to expose the epidermis. Transdermal delivery includes injection or other delivery through any portion of the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof or mucous membrane and absorption or permeation through the remaining portion. Absorption through intact skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof can be enhanced by placing the active agent in an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle before application to the skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof. Passive topical administration may consist of applying the active agent directly to the treatment site in combination with emollients or penetration enhancers. As used herein, transdermal delivery is intended to include delivery by permeation through or past the integument, i.e. skin, nail, hair, claw or hoof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “effective amount” or a “therapeutically effective amount” of a drug or pharmacologically active agent refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the drug or agent to provide the desired effect. In the oral dosage forms of the present disclosure, an “effective amount” of one active of the combination is the amount of that active that is effective to provide the desired effect when used in combination with the other active of the combination. The amount that is “effective” will vary from subject to subject, depending on the age and general condition of the individual, the particular active agent or agents, and the appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrases “active ingredient”, “therapeutic agent”, “active”, or “active agent” mean a chemical entity which can be effective in treating a targeted disorder, disease or condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” means moieties or compounds that are, within the scope of medical judgment, suitable for use in humans without causing undesirable biological effects such as undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “oral dosage form” means any pharmaceutical composition administered to a subject via the oral cavity. Exemplary oral dosage forms include tablets, capsules, films, powders, sachets, granules, solutions, solids, suspensions or as more than one distinct unit (e.g., granules, tablets, and/or capsules containing different actives) packaged together for co-administration, and other formulations known in the art. An oral dosage form can be one, two, three, four, five or six units. When the oral dosage form has multiple units, all of the units are contained within a single package, (e.g. a bottle or other form of packaging such as a blister pack). When the oral dosage form is a single unit, it may or may not be in a single package. In a preferred embodiment, the oral dosage form is one, two or three units. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the oral dosage form is one unit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “unit”, as used herein, refers to the number of discrete objects to be administered which comprise the dosage form. In some embodiments, the dosage form includes a compound of the invention in one capsule. This is a single unit. In some embodiments, the dosage form includes a compound of the invention as part of a therapeutically effective dosage of a cream or ointment. This is also a single unit. In some embodiments, the dosage form includes a compound of the invention and another active ingredient contained within one capsule, or as part of a therapeutically effective dosage of a cream or ointment. This is a single unit, whether or not the interior of the capsule includes multiple discrete granules of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, the dosage form includes a compound of the invention in one capsule, and the active ingredient in a second capsule. This is a two unit dosage form, such as two capsules or tablets, and so such units are contained in a single package. Thus the term ‘unit’ refers to the object which is administered to the animal, not to the interior components of the object.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term, “prodrug”, as defined herein, is a derivative of a parent drug molecule that exerts its pharmacological effect only after chemical and/or enzymatic conversion to its active form in vivo. Prodrugs include those designed to circumvent problems associated with delivery of the parent drug. This may be due to poor physicochemical properties, such as poor chemical stability or low aqueous solubility, and may also be due to poor pharmacokinetic properties, such as poor bioavailability or poor half-life. Thus, certain advantages of prodrugs may include improved chemical stability, absorption, and/or PK properties of the parent carboxylic acids. Prodrugs may also be used to make drugs more “patient friendly,” by minimizing the frequency (e.g., once daily) or route of dosing (e.g., oral), or to improve the taste or odor if given orally, or to minimize pain if given parenterally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the prodrugs are chemically more stable than the active drug, thereby improving formulation and delivery of the parent drug, compared to the drug alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrugs for carboxylic acid analogs of the invention may include a variety of esters. In an exemplary embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include a carboxylic acid ester. In an exemplary embodiment, the prodrug is suitable for treatment/prevention of those diseases and conditions that require the drug molecule to cross the blood brain barrier. In an exemplary embodiment, the prodrug enters the brain, where it is converted into the active form of the drug molecule. In one embodiment, a prodrug is used to enable an active drug molecule to reach the inside of the eye after topical application of the prodrug to the eye. Additionally, a prodrug can be converted to its parent compound by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, a prodrug can be slowly converted to its parent compound when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Antibiotic”, as used herein, is a compound which can kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. The term antibiotic is broad enough to encompass acids, bases, salt forms (such as pharmaceutically acceptable salts), prodrugs, solvates and hydrates of the antibiotic compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Antiprotozoal” or “antiprotozoa”, as used herein, is a compound which can kill or inhibit the growth of protozoa. The term antiprotozoal or antiprotozoa is broad enough to encompass acids, bases, salt forms (such as pharmaceutically acceptable salts), prodrugs, solvates and hydrates of the antiprotozoal or antiprotozoa compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “microbial infection” or “infection by a microorganism” refers to any infection of a host by an infectious agent including, but not limited to, viruses, bacteria, mycobacteria, fungus and parasites (see, e.g., Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, pp. 93-98 (Wilson et al., eds., 12th ed. 1991); Williams et al., \nJ. of Medicinal Chem. \n42:1481-1485 (1999), herein each incorporated by reference in their entirety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Biological medium,” as used herein refers to both in vitro and in vivo biological milieus. Exemplary in vitro “biological media” include, but are not limited to, cell culture, tissue culture, homogenates, plasma and blood. In vivo applications are generally performed in mammals, preferably humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Inhibiting” and “blocking,” are used interchangeably herein to refer to the partial or full blockade of an enzyme, such as a beta-lactamase or a leucyl t-RNA synthetase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoron is able to form additional covalent or dative bonds with oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen under some circumstances in this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmbodiments of the invention also encompass compounds that are poly- or multi-valent species, including, for example, species such as dimers, trimers, tetramers and higher homologs of the compounds of use in the invention or reactive analogues thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Salt counterion”, as used herein, refers to positively charged ions that associate with a compound of the invention when the boron is fully negatively or partially negatively charged. Examples of salt counterions include H\n+\n, H\n3\nO\n+\n, ammonium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, organic amino (such as choline or diethylamine or amino acids such as d-arginine, 1-arginine, d-lysine, 1-lysine), and sodium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds comprising a boron bonded to a carbon and three heteroatoms (such as three oxygens described in this section) can optionally contain a fully negatively charged boron or partially negatively charged boron. Due to the negative charge, a positively charged counterion may associate with this compound, thus forming a salt. Examples of positively charged counterions include H\n+\n, H\n3\nO\n+\n, ammonium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, organic amino (such as choline or diethylamine or amino acids such as d-arginine, 1-arginine, d-lysine, 1-lysine), and sodium. These salts of the compounds are implicitly contained in descriptions of these compounds.\n\n\n \nII. Introduction\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides novel boron compounds.

In general, higher than about 90% enantiomeric or diastereomeric excess is particularly preferred, e.g., those compositions with greater than about 95%, greater than about 97% and greater than about 99% ee or de.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a first compound and a second compound are present in a composition, and the first compound is a non-superimposable mirror image of the second compound, and the first compound is present in the composition in a greater amount than the second compound, then the first compound is referred to herein as being present in “enantiomeric excess”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “enantiomeric excess” of a compound z, as used herein, is defined as:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nee\n\n\nz\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconc\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nz\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconc\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconc\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nz\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconc\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein z is a first compound in a composition, y is a second compound in the composition, and the first compound is a non-superimposable mirror image of the second compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “enantiomeric excess” is related to the older term “optical purity” in that both are measures of the same phenomenon. The value of ee will be a number from 0 to 100, zero being racemic and 100 being enantiomerically pure. A composition which in the past might have been called 98% optically pure is now more precisely characterized by 96% ee. A 90% ee reflects the presence of 95% of one enantiomer and 5% of the other(s) in the material in question.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a first compound and at least one additional compound are present in a composition, and the first compound and each of the additional compounds are stereoisomers, but not mirror images, of one another, and the first compound is present in the composition in a greater amount than each of the additional compounds, then the first compound is referred to herein as being present in “diastereomeric excess”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen dealing with mixtures of diastereomers, the term “diastereomeric excess” or “de” is defined analogously to enantiomeric excess.

For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; and dispersing or wetting agents, which may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredients in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide palatable oral preparations. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions and water-in-oil emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth; naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol; anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate; and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSyrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative, and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical formulations may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents, which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe composition of the invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories, e.g., for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the compositions can be administered parenterally in a sterile medium. The drug, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as local anesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor administration to non-human animals, the composition containing the therapeutic compound may be added to the animal's feed or drinking water. Also, it will be convenient to formulate animal feed and drinking water products so that the animal takes in an appropriate quantity of the compound in its diet. It will further be convenient to present the compound in a composition as a premix for addition to the feed or drinking water. The composition can also added as a food or drink supplement for humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage levels of the order of from about 5 mg to about 250 mg per kilogram of body weight per day and more preferably from about 25 mg to about 150 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a unit dosage form will vary depending upon the condition being treated and the particular mode of administration. Unit dosage forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrequency of dosage may also vary depending on the compound used and the particular disease treated. However, for treatment of most disorders, a dosage regimen of 4 times daily or less is preferred. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration and rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an exemplary embodiment, the unit dosage form contains from about 1 mg to about 800 mg of a compound of the invention.

Penetration of the blood brain barrier for compounds used to treat CNS disorders is necessary, while low brain levels of compounds used to treat peripheral disorders are often preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays may be used to predict these desirable pharmacological properties. Assays used to predict bioavailability include transport across human intestinal cell monolayers, including Caco-2 cell monolayers. Toxicity to cultured hepatocycles may be used to predict compound toxicity. Penetration of the blood brain barrier of a compound in humans may be predicted from the brain levels of laboratory animals that receive the compound intravenously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum protein binding may be predicted from albumin binding assays. Such assays are described in a review by Oravcova, et al. (Journal of Chromatography B (1996) volume 677, pages 1-27).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound half-life is inversely proportional to the frequency of dosage of a compound. In vitro half-lives of compounds may be predicted from assays of microsomal half-life as described by Kuhnz and Gieschen (Drug Metabolism and Disposition, (1998) volume 26, pages 1120-1127).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the composition required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular compound selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician.\n\n\n \nVI. a) Testing\n\n\n \n \n \nPreferred compounds for use in the pharmaceutical formulations described herein will have certain pharmacological properties. Such properties include, but are not limited to, low toxicity, low serum protein binding and desirable in vitro and in vivo half-lives. Assays may be used to predict these desirable pharmacological properties. Assays used to predict bioavailability include transport across human intestinal cell monolayers, including Caco-2 cell monolayers. Serum protein binding may be predicted from albumin binding assays. Such assays are described in a review by Oravcova et al. (1996, \nJ. Chromat\n. B677: 1-27). Compound half-life is inversely proportional to the frequency of dosage of a compound. In vitro half-lives of compounds may be predicted from assays of microsomal half-life as described by Kuhnz and Gleschen (Drug Metabolism and Disposition, (1998) volume 26, pages 1120-1127).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED\n50 \n(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD\n50 \nand ED\n50\n. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED\n50 \nwith little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the unit dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. (See, e.g. Fingl et al., 1975, in “The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics”, Ch. 1, p. 1).\n\n\n \nVI. b) Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nFor any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays, as disclosed herein. For example, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating concentration range that includes the EC\n50 \n(effective dose for 50% increase) as determined in cell culture, i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of protozoa cell growth. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the compounds prepared by the methods, and from the intermediates, described herein will be administered in a therapeutically or cosmetically effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The drug can be administered from once or twice a day, or up to 3 or 4 times a day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage amount and interval can be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active moiety that are sufficient to maintain protozoa cell growth inhibitory effects. Usual patient dosages for systemic administration range from 0.1 to 1000 mg/day, preferably, 1-500 mg/day, more preferably 10-200 mg/day, even more preferably 100-200 mg/day. Stated in terms of patient body surface areas, usual dosages range from 50-91 mg/m\n2\n/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the compound in a formulation can vary within the full range employed by those skilled in the art. Typically, the formulation will contain, on a weight percent (wt %) basis, from about 0.01-10 wt % of the drug based on the total formulation, with the balance being one or more suitable pharmaceutical excipients. Preferably, the compound is present at a level of about 0.1-3.0 wt %, more preferably, about 1.0 wt %.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary embodiments are summarized herein below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an exemplary embodiment, the invention provides a compound having a structure according to the following formula:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein X is selected from the group consisting of substituted phenyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl and unsubstituted cycloalkyl; R\n3a \nis selected from the group consisting of H, unsubstituted C\n1 \nor C\n2 \nor C\n3 \nor C\n4 \nor C\n5 \nor C\n6 \nalkyl and unsubstituted C\n3 \nor C\n4 \nor C\n5 \nor C\n6 \ncycloalkyl; R\n3b \nis selected from the group consisting of H, unsubstituted C\n1 \nor C\n2 \nor C\n3 \nor C\n4 \nor C\n5 \nor C\n6 \nalkyl and unsubstituted C\n3 \nor C\n4 \nor C\n5 \nor C\n6 \ncycloalkyl; with the proviso that R\n3a \nand R\n3b\n, along with the atom to which they are attached, are optionally joined to form a 3 to 6 membered ring with the proviso that R\n3a \nand R\n3b \ncannot both be H, or a salt thereof.

Room temperature means 20 to 25° C. Reagents were purchased from commercial sources or prepared following standard literature procedures. Unless otherwise noted, reactions were carried out under a positive pressure of nitrogen. Reaction vessels were sealed with either rubber septa or Teflon screw caps. Nitrogen was introduced through Tygon tubing, fitted with a large bore syringe needle. Concentration under vacuum refers to the removal of solvent on a Büchi Rotary Evaporator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalytical HPLC was performed using a Supelco discovery C\n18 \n15 cm×4.6 mm/5 μm column coupled with an Agilent 1050 series VWD UV detector at 210 nm. Conditions: Solvent A: H\n2\nO/1% acetonitrile/0.1% HCO\n2\nH; Solvent B: methanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProton magnetic resonance ('H NMR) spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA NMR spectrometer [400 MHz (\n1\nH) or 500 MHz (\n1\nH)]. All spectra were determined in the solvents indicated. Although chemical shifts are reported in ppm downfield of tetramethylsilane, they are referenced to the residual proton peak of the respective solvent peak for \n1\nH NMR. Interproton coupling constants are reported in Hertz (Hz).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLCMS spectra were obtained using a ThermoFinnigan AQA MS ESI instrument utilizing a Phenomenex Aqua 5 micron C\n18 \n125 Å 50×4.60 mm column. The spray setting for the MS probe was at 350 μL/min with a cone voltage at 25 mV and a probe temperature at 450° C. The spectra were recorded using ELS and UV (254 nm) detection. Alternatively, LCMS spectra were obtained using an Agilent 1200SL HPLC equipped with a 6130 mass spectrometer operating with electrospray ionization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSilica gel chromatography was carried out on either a Teledyne ISCO CombiFlash Companion or Companion Rf Flash Chromatography System with a variable flow rate from 5-100 mL/min. The columns used were Teledyne ISCO RediSep Disposable Flash Columns (4, 12, 40, 80, or 120 g prepacked silica gel), which were run with a maximum capacity of 1 g crude sample per 10 g silica gel. Samples were preloaded on Celite in Analogix Sample Loading Cartridges with fits (1/in, 1/out). The eluent was 0-100% EtOAc in heptane or 0-10% MeOH in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nas a linear gradient over the length of the run (14-20 minutes). Peaks were detected by variable wavelength UV absorption (200-360 nm). The resulting fractions were analyzed, combined as appropriate, and evaporated under reduced pressure to provide purified material.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\n1 4-Fluoro-N-(1-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,3-dihydro-benzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-6-yl-2-trifluoromethyl benzamide\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo a solution of 2-acetylphenylboronic acid (1.00 g, 6.1 mmol) in 40 ml 3:1 i-PrOH:H\n2\nO, sodium borohydride (941.0 mg, 24.3 mmol 4.0 eq.) was added in portions. The reaction solution was allowed to stir for 2.5 hrs at room temperature then the reaction was quenched by dropwise addition of 6M HCl until gas evolution ceased and the reaction mixture reach pH=1-2. Once the pH was established, the aqueous solution was allowed to stir for an additional 0.5 hr. The aqueous solution was then extracted with DCM and the combined DCM extracts were dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n. The DCM was evaporated and the remaining clear, colorless oil was subjected to SiO\n2 \nchromatography using 3:7 EtOAc:heptane as the eluent. The desired product was recovered as clear, colorless, thick oil. Amount obtained, 741 mg, (82% yield).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo 4.0 ml fuming HNO\n3 \nat −45° C. was added a solution of 3-methyl-3H-benzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-1-ol (616 mg, 4.1 mmol) in 1.0 ml nitrobenzene slowly via a syringe while maintaining the reaction temperature between −40 to −45° C. Once the addition was complete the resulting solution was allowed to stir at −45° C. for an additional 45 min before poured into crushed ice (20 g). The ice mixture was allowed to melt and the aqueous solution was extracted with dichloromethane. The combined dichloromethane extracts were dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4 \nthen evaporated. The crude oil remaining was mixed with one liter 1:1 DCM:heptane. The volume of the solution was reduced on a rotovap by half and the resulting solution was allowed to stand overnight in a −20° C. freezer overnight. The precipitate formed was filtered out, washed with heptanes and vacuum dried to give the titled compound as a white solid. \n1\nH NMR (DMSO-d\n6\n) δ: 9.49 (br. s., 1H), 8.53 (d, J=2.2 Hz, 1H), 8.30 (dd, J=8.4, 2.3 Hz, 1H), 7.67 (d, J=8.4 Hz, 1H), 5.33 (q, J=6.7 Hz, 1H), 1.43 (d, J=6.7 Hz, 3H).

Parasites were cultured in T-25 vented cap flasks and kept in humidified incubators at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. The parasite culture media was complete HMI-9 medium (c.f. Hirumi, Journal of Parasitology 1989, Volume 75, page 985 et seq) containing 10% FBS, 10% Serum Plus medium and penicillin/streptomycin. To ensure log growth phase, trypanosomes were sub-cultured at appropriate dilutions every 2-3 days.\n\n\n \nIn Vitro Drug Sensitivity Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nApproximately 50 microliters of log phase cultures were diluted 1:10 in HMI-9 and 10 uL of the diluted culture was removed and counted using a hemocytometer to determine parasite concentration. Parasites were diluted by addition of an appropriate volume of HMI-9 to achieve a final parasite concentration of 2×10\n5\n/mL. Compounds to be tested were serially diluted in DMSO and 0.5 uL added to 49.5 uL HMI-9 in triplicate 96-well plates using a Biomek NX liquid handler. Parasites from the diluted stock were added to each well (50 uL) using a Multidrop 384 dispenser to give a final concentration of 1.0×105/ml parasites in 0.4% for DMSO. Trypanosomes were incubated with compounds for 72 hrs at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2\n. Resazurin (20 uL of 12.5 mg/ml stock) from Sigma-Aldrich was added to each well and plates were incubated for an additional 2-4 hrs. Assay plates were read using an EnVision plate reader at an excitation wavelength of 544 nm and emission of 590 nm. Triplicate data points were averaged to generate sigmoidal dose response curve and determine IC\n50 \nvalues using XLfit curve fitting software from IDBS (Guildford, UK).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological data for exemplary compounds of the invention is provided in FIG. 1.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nMethod for Estimation of Kinetic Solubility of Compounds of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe kinetic solubilities of compounds were estimated using a nephelometric (light scattering) method. Briefly, compounds were serially diluted in DMSO, followed by dilution in PBS pH 7.4. After incubation, the amount of light scattered by a compound at each concentration was measured. Clear solutions of soluble compounds do not scatter a light beam passed through the sample well and produce no signal. At concentrations above the solubility limit, the compound precipitates and the precipitant in the well scatters the light, generating a signal. Higher levels of precipitant in a well scatter more light and produce a stronger signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA stock solution of compound (25 mM in DMSO) was prepared, and was serially diluted in DMSO in two-fold increments in a row of a 96 well plate to a lowest concentration of 24 μM. A duplicate plate was prepared by transfer of half of the volume of each well to a new plate. Each well containing DMSO solution of the test compound was then diluted further (1:100) with phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) to provide aqueous solutions of compound at the following final concentrations: 250, 125, 62.5, 31.3, 15.6, 7.8, 3.9, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.2 μM. All liquid handling stages were performed on a Beckman Coulter Biomek NX Laboratory Automation Workstation. Each compound was diluted and tested in duplicate, providing four separate wells at each test concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe test solutions of compound were incubated at room temperature for 90 minutes and then analyzed using a Thermoskan Ascent nephelometric plate reader. The nephelometer protocol included two steps: first, the plate was shaken for 60 seconds at 1200 rpm, then each well of the plate was read in succession with an 800 ms settling delay between measurements. The total measurement time for a single plate was less than 4 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe four values (in nephelometric units) obtained for each compound at each concentration were averaged and plotted on a log scale versus concentration. The concentration at which the nephelometric signal is >110% of the value obtained for a DMSO/PBS blank is reported as the limit of solubility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological data for exemplary compounds of the invention is provided in FIG. 1.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nL929 Cells and Cultivation\n\n\n \n \n \nFor evaluation of compound effects on mammalian cells, L929 mouse fibroblast cells were used. Cells were maintained as adherent cultures in T-25 vented cap flasks in a humidified incubator at 37° C. in the presence of 5% CO\n2\n. Culture media was D-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. L929 cells were maintained below confluent levels by sub-culturing at 1:10 dilution twice weekly using 0.05% trypsin for detachment.\n\n\n \nCytotoxicity Evaluation\n\n\n \n \n \nSub-confluent L929 cells were trypsinized, resuspended in fresh media and 10 uL was counted using hemocytometer to determine cell concentration. Cells were diluted to 1×10\n4\n/mL in DMEM, dispensed (100 uL) into 96-well plates using a Multidrop 384 dispenser and allowed to attach overnight. Spent media was replaced with 99.5 uL fresh D-MEM and compounds to be tested were serially diluted in DMSO and 0.5 uL added using a Biomek NX liquid handler. Plates were incubated with compounds for 72 hrs at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2\n. Resazurin (20 uL of 12.5 mg/ml stock) from Sigma-Aldrich was added to each well and plates were incubated for an additional 3-4 hrs. Assay plates were read using an EnVision plate reader at an excitation wavelength of 544 nm and emission of 590 nm.

N=3 mice/group. Mice were monitored for 30 days for survival. Pentamidine at 2 mg/kg IP was used as the positive control. After 10 days, 0% of the untreated mice were parasite free. After 10 days, 0% of mice treated with 6-(4-chlorophenylsulfinyl)benzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-1(3H)-ol were parasite free. After 30 days, 100% of mice treated with 10 mg/kg BID of N-(1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydrobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-6-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzamide were parasite free. These results indicate that N-(1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydrobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-6-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzamide can prevent the development of diseases associated with \nT. b. brucei\n.

Twenty one days post-infection mice were treated with a dose of between 6 and 100 mg/kg of the compound, either BID or QD for 7 days intraperitoneally (IP) or orally (PO). Positive control mice were treated with Diminazene (10 mg/kg, IP) on Day 4 post-infection. Negative control mice were treated with Diminazene (10 mg/kg, PO) on Day 21. Since Diminazene is not able to penetrate the CNS, mice treated at Day 21 are not able to cure the infection. Starting 1 week after the end of treatment, mice are monitored for parasitemia and sacrificed if parasites are detected in the blood. Mice that survive 6 months are considered “cured.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, treatment with 75 mg/kg of 4-fluoro-N-(1-hydroxy-3,3-dimethyl-1,3-dihydro-benzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-6-yl-2-trifluoromethyl)benzamide BID for 7 days, starting at Day 21 post-infection, resulted in absence of blood parasites through Day 84 in 100% of the mice. In contrast, all animals treated on Day 21 with the non-CNS penetrant drug Diminazene relapsed to exhibit blood parasitemia by Day 49. These results indicate that 4-fluoro-N-(1-hydroxy-3,3-dimethyl-1,3-dihydro-benzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-6-yl-2-trifluoromethyl benzamide has potential for development to treat late-stage HAT.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nPharmacokinetic Studies in Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nMale CD-1 mice weighing approximately 25 g received the test article (E19 or 82 or E14 or 69) by either intravenous (IV), oral gavage (OG) or intra-peritoneal (IP) routes. Animals in IV group (6-10 animals, 1-2 per time point) received a single bolus injection of approximately 2 mg/kg of the test article. Animals receiving extra-vascular doses were administered the test article as either single OG doses (6-10 animals, 1-2 per time point) of approximately 8 mg/kg, or as 4 repeat doses (over 2 days) of approximately 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg by the IP route (6-10 animals, 1-2 per time point).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll doses were administered as clear colorless solutions in either: 50% (v/v) PEG400:20% (v/v) ethanol:30% (v/v) carboxymethylcellulose (0.5% w/v in sterile water for injection, WFI), or as in situ sodium salts in 5% (m/v) dextrose:2% (v/v) ethanol in DWI. All dose solutions were delivered at 4 mL/kg. Animals were fasted for at least 4 hours before dosing, and for 2 hours after dosing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood samples and brain tissue were sampled from 1 or 2 animals/timepoint/group immediately before dosing and approximately 0.17, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 24 hr after dosing for full pharmacokinetic and tissue analysis, or at 0.5, 2 and 4 hours post dosing to assess early-phase CNS disposition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBioanalysis for test article in whole blood, plasma or brain tissue was performed by HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS). Whole blood and plasma samples were treated with 3 volumes of either acetonitrile or methanol to precipitate plasma proteins. Treated samples were centrifuged and supernatants removed for analysis. Brain tissues were weighed and homogenized mechanically in the presence of 1 volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The resulting tissue suspensions were then diluted with a further volume of PBS, and then treated in the same manner as whole blood or plasma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExtracted samples were assayed for test article by means of LC-MSMS employing reversed-phase chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer employing electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode. The analytical column was a Phenomenex Luna 3μ C8 50×2 mm, with an online sample purification step performed on a Phenomenex Synergi 4μ Polar RP 50×2 mm column.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest articles were eluted using a binary mobile phase gradient comprising 5 mM Ammonium Acetate: 0.1% formic acid in either MeOH or H\n2\nO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-compartmental analysis of plasma test article concentration versus time was performed in Microsoft Excel to generate pharmacokinetic parameters including: area under the curve (AUC), clearance (as Cl or Cl/F), volume of distribution (Vdss), half-life (t½), and bioavailability (F).\n\n\n \nPharmacokinetic Studies in Rats:\n\n\n \n \n \nMale Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately 200 g received test article (E19 or 82) as a single oral gavage (OG) dose of approximately 25 mg/kg (approximately 10 animals per group).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll doses were administered as clear colorless solutions as in situ sodium salts in 5% (m/v) dextrose:2% (v/v) ethanol in DWI. All dose solutions were delivered at 2 mL/kg. Animals were fasted for at least 4 hours before dosing, and for 2 hours after dosing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood and CSF samples and brain tissue were sampled from 1 animal/timepoint/group immediately before dosing and approximately 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 24 hr after dosing for full pharmacokinetic (plasma and CSF) and tissue (Brain) analysis.\n\n\n \nResults:\n\n\n \n \n \nAll compounds demonstrate good plasma PK, but 82 is distinguished from E19, and 69 is distinguished from E14, based on higher concentrations, and extended exposure in CNS compartments.\n\n\n \nPlasma PK:\n\n\n \n \n \nBoth E19 and 82 display good exposure (AUC and C\nmax\n), promising bioavailability, prolonged half-life, and low clearance when administered to rodents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n82 is superior to E19 in that it achieves 2-4 fold improved plasma exposure (based on AUC) following matched oral doses to either rats or mice.\n\n\n \nCNS Disposition:\n\n\n \n \n \nPK data obtained demonstrate the efficacy of both E19 and 82 shown in the murine chronic HAT model. However, in both mouse and rat, total brain concentrations of E19 decrease rapidly to levels below the MIC within a few hours after dosing. Elimination from the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is more rapid than clearance from plasma, suggesting transporter or disposition mediated loss from central nervous system (CNS) compartments. In contrast, 82 achieved higher concentrations in the brain and CSF, and maintains concentrations above the MIC for extended time periods. The data indicates that 82 is less susceptible to the mechanism(s) driving elimination from CNS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter a nominal single oral dose of 25 mg/kg to rats 82 maintains levels in brain and CSF above the in vitro MIC for approximately 12 hours, and would be expected to sustain this level for >24 hrs on repeat daily administration. In contrast, E19 concentrations in brain and CSF exceed the MIC for only 4 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExposure of 82 in mouse and rat brain tissue is approximately 6-12 fold improved over E19, and approximately 4 fold improved in rat CSF.\n\n\n \nDose Proportionality:\n\n\n \n \n \nE19 and 82 afford generally dose-proportional increases in brain exposure following oral delivery to mice. Plasma exposure also increases with dose, although it becomes greater than proportional at doses above 20 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn rats, exposure of E19 in plasma, brain and CSF compartments increase in a generally proportional manner with dose.

Parasites were cultured in T-25 vented cap flasks and kept in humidified incubators at 37° C. and 5% CO2. The axenic parasite culture media was RPMI-1640/MES/pH 5.5 formulated and prepared as described by Debrabant et. al. (International Journal for Parasitology 2004, Volume 34, page 205-217). To ensure log growth phase, axenic amastigotes were sub-cultured at appropriate dilutions every 2-3 days.\n\n\n \nIn Vitro Drug Sensitivity Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nCultures of axenic amastigotes growing in the log phase were passed through a 22 gauge blunt needle to break up the clumps, diluted 1:10 in RPMI-1640/MES medium and counted using hemocytometer to determine parasite concentration. Amastigotes were diluted to 2×10\n5\n/mL in RPMI-1640/MES medium to generate a 2-fold working concentration for assay. Compounds to be tested were serially diluted in DMSO and 0.5 μL added to 50 μL HMI-9 in triplicate 96-well plates using a Biomek NX liquid handler. Parasites from the diluted stock were added to each well (50 μL) using a Multidrop 384 dispenser to give a final concentration of 1.0×10\n5\n/ml parasites in 0.5% for DMSO. Amastigotes were incubated with compounds for 72 hrs at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2\n. Resazurin (10 μL of 12.5 mg/ml stock) from Sigma-Aldrich was added to each well and plates were incubated for an additional 2-3 hrs. Assay plates were read using an EnVision plate reader at an excitation wavelength of 544 nm and emission of 590 nm. Triplicate data points were averaged to generate sigmoidal dose response curve and determine IC\n50 \nvalues using XLfit curve fitting software from IDBS (Guildford, UK).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological data for exemplary compounds of the invention is provided in FIG. 1.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nActivity Against \nTrypanosoma brucei rhodesiense \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThis stock was isolated in 1982 from a human patient in Tanzania and after several mouse passages cloned and adapted to axenic culture conditions (Baltz et al (1985) \nEMBO Journal \n4:1273-1277; Thuita et al (2008) \nActa Tropica \n108:6-10.) Minimum Essential Medium (50 μl) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 1 g/l additional glucose, 1% MEM non-essential amino acids (100×), 0.2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM Na-pyruvate and 15% heat inactivated horse serum can be added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate. Serial drug dilutions of seven 3-fold dilution steps covering a range from 90 to 0.123 μg/m\n1 \ncan be prepared. Then 10\n4 \nbloodstream forms of \nT. b. rhodesiense \nSTIB 900 in 50 μA can be added to each well and the plate can be incubated at 37° C. under a 5% CO\n2 \natmosphere for 72 h. 10 μA Alamar Blue (resazurin, 12.5 mg in 100 ml double-distilled water) can be then added to each well and incubation continued for a further 2-4 h (Raz et al. (1997) \nActa Trop \n68:139-47). Then the plates can be read with a Spectramax Gemini XS microplate fluorometer (Molecular Devices Cooperation, Sunnyvale, Calif., USA) using an excitation wave length of 536 nm and an emission wave length of 588 nm. Data can be analyzed using the microplate reader software Softmax Pro (Molecular Devices Cooperation, Sunnyvale, Calif., USA).\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nActivity Against \nT. cruzi \n \n\n\n \n \n \nRat skeletal myoblasts (L-6 cells) can be seeded in 96-well microtitre plates at 2000 cells/well in 100 μL RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS and 2 mM 1-glutamine. After 24 h the medium can be removed and replaced by 100 μl per well containing 5000 trypomastigote forms of \nT. cruzi \nTulahuen strain C2C4 containing the β-galactosidase (Lac Z) gene (Buckner et al. (1996) Efficient technique for screening drugs for activity against \nTrypanosoma cruzi \nusing parasites expressing beta-galactosidase, p. 2592-2597, vol. 40). After 48 h the medium can be removed from the wells and replaced by 100 μl fresh medium with or without a serial drug dilution of seven 3-fold dilution steps covering a range from 90 to 0.123 μg/ml. After 96 h of incubation the plates can be inspected under an inverted microscope to assure growth of the controls and sterility. Then the substrate CPRG/Nonidet (50 μl) can be added to all wells. A color reaction can be within 2-6 h and can be read photometrically at 540 nm. Data can be transferred into the graphic programme Softmax Pro (Molecular Devices), to calculated IC\n50 \nvalues.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nLiver S9 Metabolism Assay Conditions\n\n\n \n \n \nTest System: Liver S9 fractions from male CD1 mice were purchased from XenoTech LLC (Lenexa, Kans.) and stored at −70° C. until use. The activity profile of the major metabolic enzymes, as provided by the vendor for each lot, was stored with the raw data.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of Test Compound Solutions: a stock solution of each compound was prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Stock solutions were further diluted in DMSO to a concentration of 100 μM for use in the assay. The final assay concentration of test compound in each incubation mixture was 1 μM and the final concentration of DMSO was 1%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncubation Conditions: Incubations of test compound with CD1 mouse liver S9 fractions were carried out in duplicate at a final concentration of 1 μM. The incubation mixtures included 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with the following cofactors: 1.14 mM β-NADPH, 1.43 mM glucose-6-phosphate, 1.43 mM uridine 5′-diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA), 9.42 mM potassium chloride, and 2.28 mM magnesium chloride (final assay concentration). The reactions were initiated by the addition of the cofactors to the incubation mixtures. The total incubation contained an S9 protein concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. Incubations were performed at 37° C. in an oxygen and humidity enriched atmosphere with shaking (200 rpm), for time periods of 0, 15, 30, and 60 minutes. At the end of each time period, an aliquot was taken and transferred to a clean 96-well plate containing three volumes of ice cold methanol. Samples were centrifuged at 4200×g for 20 minutes at 15° C. and the supernatants were transferred to new plates. Samples were analyzed by means of reversed-phase LC-MS/MS using the conditions summarized below. Peak areas were measured to calculate the percent of parent compound remaining and the half life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid Chromatography Settings\n\n \n \n \nColumn: Phenomenex Luna C8(2), 3μ, 100 A, 50×2 mm, P/N 00B-4248-B0 with C8 guard cartridge, P/N AJO-4289\n\n\nColumn temp: 60° C.\n\n \n\n\nMobile Phase:\n\n\n \n \n \nAqueous (A): 10 mM ammonium acetate in H\n2\nO\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrganic (B): 10 mM ammonium acetate in methanol\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFlow: 600 μL/minute\n\n\n \nGradient Conditions:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime (Min)\n\n\n% A\n\n\n% B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n80\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.25\n\n\n80\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.50\n\n\n10\n\n\n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.00\n\n\n10\n\n\n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.10\n\n\n80\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.60\n\n\n80\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Run Time: 4.60 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAutosampler Settings:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Temp: ambient\n\n\nInjection Volume: 10 μL (20 μL injected on a 10 μL sample loop)\n\n\nWash 1: ACN/H\n2\nO (80:20, v/v)\n\n\nWash 2: MeOH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTypical Mass Spectrometer Settings:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMass spectrometer:\n\n\nApplied Biosystems API 4000 QTRAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMode:\n\n\nMultiple Reaction Monitoring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInterface:\n\n\nTurbo IonSpray\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPolarity:\n\n\nNegative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIonSpray Voltage\n\n\n−4200 V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResolution:\n\n\nUnit/Low\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTemperature:\n\n\n450° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCUR:\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCAD:\n\n\nHigh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGS1:\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGS2:\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical conditions are given.
