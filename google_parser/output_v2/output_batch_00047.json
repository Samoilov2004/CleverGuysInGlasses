Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to substituted pyrazolidinone compounds, and methods of treatment and pharmaceutical compositions that utilize or comprise one or more such compounds. Compounds of the invention are useful for a variety of therapies, including treatment of preterm labor, dysmenorrhea, asthma, hypertension, infertility or fertility disorder, undesired blood clotting, preeclampsia or eclampsia, an eosinophil disorder, sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis and other destructive bone disease or disorders, and other diseases and disorders associated with the prostaglandin EP2 and/or EP4 receptors.\n\n\n2. Background\n\n\nCertain prostanoid receptors and modulators of those receptors have been reported. See generally \nEicosanoids: From Biotechnology to Therapeutic Applications \n(Plenum Press, New York); \nJournal of Lipid Mediators and Cell Signalling \n14: 83-87 (1996); \nThe British Journal of Pharmacology, \n112: 735-740 (1994); PCT applications WO 96/06822, WO 97/00863, WO 97/00864, and WO 96/03380; EP 752421; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,211,197 4,211,876 and 3,873,566; and Bennett et al. \nJ. Med. Chem., \n19(5): 715-717 (1976).\n\n\nPhysiological action of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is reported to be mediated through interaction with the prostaglandin E receptor(s). Four subtypes of the prostaglandin EP receptor have been identified: EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4. The prostaglandin EP2 receptor including the cloning thereof has been reported. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,814 and 5,759,789. Binding of PGE2 to the EP2 receptor protein has been reported to result in an increase in cAMP levels, which can cause smooth muscle relaxation. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,814. Binding of PGE2 to the EP4 receptor also causes increases in cAMP levels leading to smooth muscle relaxation.\n\n\nIt also has been reported that genetic deletion of the EP2 receptor indicates a key role in normal female fertility and control of blood pressure. See \nJournal of Clinical Investigation, \n103(ii):1539-1545 (1999).\n\n\nIt would be desirable to have new compounds and methods for treatment of diseases and disorders associated with the prostaglandin EP2 and/or EP4 receptors. It also would be desirable to have new compounds for treatment of diseases and disorders associated with inappropriate activation of the EP2 and/or EP4 receptors.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nWe have now found substituted pyrazolidinone-type compounds that are useful for a variety of therapies, including alleviating, preventing and/or treating preterm labor, dysmenorrhea, asthma, hypertension, sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis and other destructive bone disease or disorder, inflammation, and other diseases and disorders associated with the prostaglandin EP2 and/or EP4 receptors.\n\n\nPreferred compounds of the invention have fully substituted pyrazolidinone ring nitrogens, with one or two optional non-hydrogen substituents at other ring positions (i.e. nuclear carbon positions).\n\n\nGenerally preferred for use in the therapeutic methods of the invention are substituted pyrazolidinone compounds of the following Formula I:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare each independently hydrogen or a non-hydrogen substituent, preferably where one or both of R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare non-hydrogen substituents such as optionally substituted alkyl preferably having 1 to about 20 carbons; optionally substituted alkenyl preferably having from 2 to about 20 carbons; optionally substituted alkynyl preferably having from 2 to about 20 carbons; optionally substituted heteroalkyl preferably having from 1 to about 20 carbons; optionally substituted heteroalkenyl preferably having from 2 to about 20 carbons; optionally substituted heteroalkynyl preferably having from 2 to about 20 carbons; optionally substituted aralkyl; optionally substituted heteroarylalkyl; and optionally substituted heteroalicyclicalkyl; Preferably, at least one of R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nis not H.\n\n\n\nR\n3 \nand R\n4 \nindependently each may be hydrogen or a non-hydrogen substituent such as defined above for R\n1 \nand R\n2\n, or optionally substituted carbocyclic aryl, optionally substituted heteroalicyclic, or optionally substituted heteroaryl; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.\n\n\nPreferred compounds of the invention include those that have substitution only at one or both of the nitrogen ring atoms (i.e. the nuclear carbons are unsubstituted), such as compounds of the following Formula II:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare the same as defined in Formula I above, and preferably one or both of R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare other than hydrogen; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.\n\n\nPreferred nitrogen ring substituents include a saturated or unsaturated carbon chain, e.g. a C\n1-20 \nalkyl, C\n2-20 \nalkenyl, or C\n2-20 \nalkynyl chain, preferably a chain having 2, 3 or 4 to about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 carbons; zero, one, two or more carbon-carbon multiple bonds; and one or more additional substitutents on the carbon chain, such as hydroxy, C\n1-12\nalkoxy, optionally substituted carbocyclic aryl, optionally substituted heteroalicyclic, or optionally substituted heteroaryl.
