Description\n\n\n\n\n INHIBITORS OF DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE \n\n\nField of the Invention \n\n\nThe present invention relates to certain heterocyclic compounds useful as \n\n\ndiacylglycerol acyltransferase (\"DGAT\") inhibitors, especially diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (\"DGAT1\") inhibitors, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treatment using the compounds and compositions to treat or prevent various diseases including cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, obesity and diabetes (e.g., Type 2 diabetes). \n\n\nBackground of the Invention \n\n\n There is a need for additional ways of treating diseases associated with metabolic syndrome such as, for example, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes (e.g., Type 2 diabetes). \n\n\n Triglycerides or triacylglycerols are the major form of energy storage in eukaryotic organisms. In mammals, these compounds are primarily synthesized in three tissues: the small intestine, liver, and adipocytes. Triglycerides or triacylglycerols support the major functions of dietary fat absorption, packaging of newly synthesized fatty acids and storage in fat tissue (see Subauste and Burant, Current Drug Targets- Immune, Endocrine & Metabolic Disorders (2003) 3, pp. 263-270). \n\n\n Diacylglycerol O -acyltransferase, also known as diglyceride acyltransferase or DGAT, is a key enzyme in triglyceride synthesis. DGAT catalyzes the final and rate-limiting step in the triacylglycerol synthesis from 1 ,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and long chain fatty acyl CoA as substrates. Thus, DGAT plays an essential role in the metabolism of cellular diacylglycerol and is critically important for triglyceride production and energy storage homeostasis (see Mayorek et al, European Journal of Biochemistry (1989) 182, pp. 395-400). \n\n\n Two forms of DGAT have been cloned and are designated DGAT1 and DGAT2 [see Cases et al, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, USA (1998) 95, pp. 13018- 13023, Lardizabal et al, Journal of Biological Chemistry (2001) 276, pp. 38862-38869 and Cases et al, Journal of Biological Chemistry (2001) 276, pp. 38870-38876]. Although both enzymes utilize the same substrates, there is no homology between DGAT1 and DGAT2, Both enzymes are widely expressed however some differences do exist in the relative abundance of expression in various tissues. \n\n Disorders or imbalances in triglyceride metabolism, both absorption as well as de novo synthesis, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of disease risks. These include obesity, insulin resistance syndrome, Type II diabetes, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome (syndrome X) and coronary heart disease [see Kahn, Nature Genetics (2000) 25, pp. 6-7, Yanovski and Yanovski, New England Journal of Medicine (2002) 346, pp. 591-602, Lewis et al, Endocrine Reviews (2002) 23, pp. 201, Brazil, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery\n\n\n(2002) 1, pp. 408, Malloy and Kane, Advances in Internal Medicine (2001) 47, pp. 11 1 , Subauste and Burant, Current Drug Targets - Immune, Endocrine & Metabolic Disorders\n\n\n(2003) 3, pp. 263-270 and Yu and Ginsberg, Annals of Medicine (2004) 36, pp. 252-261]. Compounds that can decrease the synthesis of triglycerides from diacyl glycerol by inhibiting or lowering the activity of the DGAT enzyme would be of value as therapeutic agents for the treatment of diseases associated with abnormal metabolism of triglycerides. \n\n\n Known inhibitors of DGAT include: dibenzoxazepinones (see Ramharack et al, EP121971 and Burrows et al, 26th National Medicinal Chemistry Symposium (1998) poster C-22), substituted amino-pyrimidino-oxazines (see Fox et al, WO2004047755), chalcones such as xanthohumol (see Tabata et al, Phytochemistry (1997) 46, pp. 683-687 and Casaschi et al, Journal of Nutrition (2004) 134, pp. 1340-1346), substituted benzyl -phosphonates (see Kurogi et al, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (1996) 39, pp. 1433-1437, Goto et al, \n\n\nChemistry and Pharmaceutical Bulletin (1996) 44, pp. 547-551, Ikeda et al, Thirteenth International Symposium on Athersclerosis (2003), abstract 2P-0401, and Miyata et al, JP 2004067635), aryl alkyl acid derivatives (see Smith et al, WO2004100881 and \n\n\nUS20040224997), furan and thiophene derivatives (see WO2004022551), \n\n\npyrrolo[l,2b]pyridazine derivatives (see Fox et al, WO2005103907), and substituted sulfonamides (see Budd Haeberlein and Buckett, WO20050442500). \n\n\n Also known to be inhibitors of DGAT are: 2-bromo-palmitic acid (see Colman et al,\n\n\nBiochimica et Biophysica Acta (1992) pp. 1125, 203-9), 2-bromo-octanoic acid (see Mayorek and Bar-Tana, Journal of Biological Chemistry (1985) 260, pp. 6528-6532), roselipins (see Noriko et al, (Journal of Antibiotics (1999) 52, pp. 815-826), amidepsin (see Tomoda et al, Journal of Antibiotics (1995) 48, pp. 42-7), isochromophilone, prenylflavonoids (see Chung et al, Planta Medica (2004) 70, v58-260), polyacetylenes (see Lee et al, Planta Medica (2004) 70, pp. 97-200), cochlioquinones (see Lee et al, Journal of Antibiotics (2003) 56, pp. 967- 969), tanshinones (see Ko et al, Archives of Pharmaceutical Research (2002) 25, pp. 446- 448), gemfibrozil (see Zhu et al, Atherosclerosis (2002) 164, pp. 221-228), and substituted quinolones (see Ko et al, Planta Medica (2002) 68, pp. 1131-1 133). Also known to be \n\n modulators of DGAT activity are antisense oligonucleotides (see Monia and Graham, US20040185559). \n\n\n Particular mention is made to PCT publication WO 2007/060140 (published May 31 2007; applicant: F.

Suitable protecting groups will be recognized by those with ordinary skill in the art as well as by reference to standard textbooks such as, for example, T. W. Greene et ah Protective Groups in organic Synthesis (1991), Wiley, New York. \n\n\n When any variable (e.g., aryl, heterocycle, R , etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent or in Formula Ϊ, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. \n\n\n As used herein, the term, \"composition\" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. \n\n\n Prodrugs and solvates of the compounds of the invention are also contemplated herein. A discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems (1987) 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, (1987) Edward B. Roche, ed., American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press. The term \"prodrug\" means a compound (e.g, a drug precursor) that is transformed in vivo to yield a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound. The transformation may occur by various mechanisms (e.g., by metabolic or chemical processes), such as, for example, through hydrolysis in blood. A discussion of the use of prodrugs is provided by T. Higuchi and W. Stella, \"Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\" Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987. \n\n\n For example, if a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group, a prodrug can comprise an ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as, for example, (Ci-Cg)alkyl, ^-C^alkanoyloxymethyl, 1- (alkanoyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms, 1 -methyl- l-(alkanoyloxy)-ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, 1- \n\n (alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, 1 -methyl- 1- (alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, N-(alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, l-(N-(alkoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, 3-phthalidyl, 4-crotonolactonyl, gamma-butyrolacton-4-yl, di-N,N-(Ci- C2)alkylamino(C2-C\n3\n)alkyl (such as β-dimeraylaminoethyl), carbamoyl- (Ci-C\n2\n)alkyl, N,N-di (Ci-C2)alkylcarbamoyi-(Cl-C2)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidine- or morpholino(C\n2\n- C3)alkyl, and the like. \n\n\n Similarly, if a compound of Formula I contains an alcohol functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as, for example, (d-Ceialkanoyloxymethyl, l-((C\nr\nC\n6\n)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, l~methyl-l- ((C i -C6)alkanoyloxy)efhyl, (C i -C\n6\n)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N-(C i - C^alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (CpC\n6\n)alkanoyl, -amino(Ci-C4)aIkanyl, arylacyl and α-aminoacyl, or a-aminoacyl-a-aminoacyl, where each a-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(0)(OH)\n2\n, -P(0)(0(Cr C\n6\n)alkyl)2 or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate), and the like. \n\n\n If a compound of Formula I incorporates an amine functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as, for example, R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR'-carbonyl where R and R\n!\n are each independently (Ci-Cio)alkyl, (C3-C7) cycloalkyl, benzyl, or R-carbonyl is a natural a-aminoacyl or natural a- aminoacyl,— CtOH^C OY\n1\n wherein Y\n1\n is H, (C\nr\nC\n6\n)aIkyl or benzyl,— C(OY\n2\n)Y\n3\n wherein Y\n2\n is (C1-C4) alkyl and Y\n3\n is (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, carboxy (Ci-C\n6\n)alkyl, amino (d-C\n4\n)alkyl or mono- N— r di-N,N-(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkylaminoalkyl, -~-C(Y\n4\n)Y\n5\n wherein Y\n4\n is H or methyl and Y\n5\n is mono-N— or di-N,N-(C)-C(;)alkylamino morpholino, piperidin-l-yl or pyrrolidin-l-yl, and the like. \n\n\n One or more compounds of the invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms. \"Solvate\" means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. \"Solvate\" encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. Non-limiting \n\n examples of suitable solvates include ethanolates, methanolates, and the like. \"Hydrate\" is a solvate wherein the solvent molecule is H\n2\n0. \n\n\n One or more compounds of the invention may optionally be converted to a solvate. Preparation of solvates is generally known. Thus, for example, M. Caira et al, J. \n\n\nPharmaceutical Sci., (2004) 93(3), pp. 601-611 describe the preparation of the solvates of the antifungal fluconazole in ethyl acetate as well as from water. Similar preparations of solvates, hemisolvate, hydrates and. the like are described by E. C. van Tonder et al, AAPS \n\n\nPharmSciTech., (2004) 5(1), article 12; and A. L. Bingham et al, Chem. Commun., (2001) pp. 603-604. A typical, non-limiting, process involves dissolving the inventive compound in desired amounts of the desired solvent (organic or water or mixtures thereof) at a higher than ambient temperature, and cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals which are then isolated by standard methods. Analytical techniques such as, for example I. R. \n\n\nspectroscopy, show the presence of the solvent (or water) in the crystals as a solvate (or hydrate). \n\n\n The term \"effective\" or 'therapeutically effective\" is used herein, unless otherwise indicated, to describe an amount of a compound or composition which, in context, is used to produce or effect an intended result or therapeutic effect as understood in the common knowledge of those skilled in the art. \n\n\n The compounds of Formula I can form salts which are also within the scope of this invention. Reference to a compound of Formula I herein is understood to include reference to salts thereof, unless otherwise indicated. The term \"salt(s)\", as employed herein, denotes acidic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids, as well as basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic bases. In addition, when a compound of Formula I contains both a basic moiety, such as, but not limited to a pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety, such as, but not limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions (\"inner salts\") may be formed and are included within the term \"salt(s)\" as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful. Salts of the compounds of the Formula I may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of Formula I with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization. \n\n\n Exemplary acid addition salts include acetates, ascorbates, benzoates, \n\n\nbenzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates, fumarates, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, hydroiodides, lactates, maleaies, \n\n\nmefhanesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates, nitrates, oxalates, phosphates, propionates, \n\n salicylates, succinates, sulfates, tartarates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates (also known as tosylates,) and the like. Additionally, acids which are generally considered suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically useful salts from basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, for example, by P. Stahl et al, Camille G. (eds.) Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts. Properties, Selection and Use. (2002) Zurich: Wiley-VCH; S. Berge et al, Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences (1977) 66(1) pp. 1-19; P. Gould, InternationalJ. of Pharmaceutics (1986) (2001) 33 pp. 201-217; Anderson et al, The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry (1996), Academic Press, New York; and in The Orange Book (Food & Drug Administration, Washington, D.C. on their website). These disclosures are incorporated herein by reference thereto. \n\n\n Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases (for example, organic amines) such as dicyclohexylamines, t-butyl amines, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen- containing groups may be quarternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g. methyl, ethyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g. dimethyl, diethyl, and dibutyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g. decyl, lauryl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g. benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others. \n\n\n All such acid salts and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention. \n\n\n Pharmaceutically acceptable esters of the present compounds include the following groups: (1) carboxylic acid esters obtained by esterification of the groups, in which the non- carbonyl moiety of the carboxylic acid portion of the ester grouping is selected from straight or branched chain alkyl (for example, acetyl, n-propyl, t-butyl, or n-butyl), alkoxyalkyl (for example, methoxymethyl), aralkyl (for example, benzyl), aryloxyalkyl (for example, phenoxymethyl), aryl (for example, phenyl optionally substituted with, for example, halogen, C\n1-4\nalkyl, or Ci\n-4\nalkoxy or amino); (2) sulfonate esters, such as alkyl- or aralkylsulfonyl (for example, methanesulfonyl); (3) amino acid esters (for example, L-valyl or L-isoleucyl); (4) phosphonate esters and (5) mono-, di- or triphosphate esters. The phosphate esters may be further esterified by, for example, a Ci\n-20\n alcohol or reactive derivative thereof, or by a 2,3-di (C\n6-24\n)acyl glycerol. \n\n Compounds of Formula I, and salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs thereof, may exist in their tautomeric form (for example, as an amide or imino ether). All such tautomeric forms are contemplated herein as part of the present invention. \n\n\n The compounds of Formula I may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and, therefore, exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomer ic forms of the compounds of Fomiula I as well as mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. In addition, the present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example, if a compound of Formula I mcorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention. \n\n\n Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physieal chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of Formula I may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of chiral HPLC column. \n\n\n It is also possible that the compounds of Formula I may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are included in the invention. \n\n\n All stereoisomers (for example, geometric isomers, optical isomers and the like) of the present compounds (including those of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs of the compounds as well as the salts, solvates and esters of the prodrugs), such as those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on various substituents, including enantiomeric forms (which may exist even in the absence of asymmetric carbons), rotameric forms, atropisomers, and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention, as are positional isomers (such as, for example, 4-pyridyl and 3-pyridyl). (For example, if a compound of Formula I incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and transforms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are included in the invention.) Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may, for example, be \n\n substantially free of other isomers, or may be. admixed, for example, as racemates or with all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention can have the S or R configuration as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations. The use of the terms \"salt\", \"solvate\", \"ester\", \"prodrug\" and the like, is intended to equally apply to the salt, solvate, ester and prodrug of enantiomers, stereoisomers, rotamers, tautomers, positional isomers, racemates or prodrugs of the inventive compounds. \n\n\n The present invention also embraces isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine and chlorine, such as ¾ \n3\nH, \nB\nC, \n1\n C, \n15\nN, \n18\n0, \n17\n0, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \nl8\nF, and \n36\nC1, respectively. \n\n\n Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula Ϊ (e.g., those labeled with \n3\nH and \n14\nC) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., \n3\nH) and carbon-14 (i.e., \nI4\nC) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred, in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of Formula I can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples hereinbelow, by substituting an appropriate isotopically labelled reagent for a non- isotopically labelled reagent. \n\n\n Polymorphic forms of the compounds of Formula I, and of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs of the compounds of Formula I, are intended to be included in the present invention. \n\n\n The compounds according to the invention have pharmacological properties. The compounds of Formula I are inhibitors of DGAT, particularly DGAT1, and can be useful for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of diseases that are modulated by DGAT, particularly by DGAT1, such as, for example, metabolic syndrome, diabetes (e.g., Type 2 diabetes mellitus), obesity and the like. \n\n\n The invention also includes methods of treating diseases that are modulated by DGAT, particularly by DGAT! . \n\n The invention also includes methods of treating metabolic syndrome, diabetes (e.g., Type 2 diabetes mellitus), and obesity in a patient by administering at least one compound of Formula I to said patient. \n\n\n Diabetes refers to a disease process derived from multiple causative factors and is characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose, or hyperglycemia in the fasting state or after administration of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test. Persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated with alterations of the lipid, lipoprotein and apo lipoprotein metabolism and other metabolic and hemodynamic disease. As such, the diabetic patient is at especially increased risk of macrovascular and \n\n\nmicrovascular complications, including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Accordingly, therapeutic control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus. \n\n\n There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. In Type 1 diabetes, or insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), patients produce little or no insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. In Type 2 diabetes, or noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), patients often have plasma insulin levels that are the same or even elevated compared to nondiabetic subjects; however, these patients have developed a resistance to the insulin stimulating effect on glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissue (muscle, liver and adipose tissue), and the plasma insulin levels, while elevated, are insufficient to overcome the pronounced insulin resistance. \n\n\n Insulin resistance is not associated with a diminished number of insulin receptors but rather to a post-insulin receptor binding defect that is not well understood. This resistance to insulin responsiveness results in insufficient insulin activation of glucose uptake, oxidation and storage in muscle, and inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in the liver. \n\n\n The available treatments for Type 2 diabetes, which have not changed substantially in many years, have recognized limitations. While physical exercise and reductions in dietary intake of calories will dramatically improve the diabetic condition, compliance with this treatment is very poor because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption, especially of foods containing high amounts of saturated fat. Increasing the plasma level of insulin by administration of sulfonylureas (e.g. tolbutamide and glipizide) or meglitinide, which stimulate the pancreatic [beta] -cells to secrete more insulin, and/or by \n\n injection of insulin when sulfonylureas or meglitinide become ineffective, can result in insulin concentrations high enough to stimulate the very insulin-resistant tissues. However, dangerously low levels of plasma glucose can result from administration of insulin or insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas or meglitinide), and an increased level of insulin resistance due to the even higher plasma insulin levels can occur. The biguanides are a class of agents that can increase insulin sensitivity and bring about some degree of correction of hyperglycemia. However, the biguanides can induce lactic acidosis and nausea/diarrhea. \n\n\n The glitazones (i.e. 5-benzylthiazolidine-2,4-diones) are a separate class of compounds with potential for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. These agents increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of Type 2 diabetes, resulting in partial or complete correction of the elevated plasma levels of glucose without occurrence of hypoglycemia. The glitazones that are currently marketed are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), primarily the PPAR-gamma subtype. PPAR-gamma agonism is generally believed to be responsible for the improved insulin sensititization that is observed with the glitazones. Newer PPAR agonists that are being tested for treatment of Type 2 diabetes are agonists of the alpha, gamma or delta subtype, or a combination of these, and in many cases are chemically different from the glitazones (i.e., they are not thiazolidinediones). Serious side effects (e.g. liver toxicity) have been noted in some patients treated with glitazone drugs, such as troglitazone. \n\n\n Additional methods of treating the disease are currently under investigation. New biochemical approaches include treatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g. acarbose) and protein tyrosine phosphatase- IB (PTP-1B) inhibitors. \n\n\n Compounds that are inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) enzyme are also under investigation as drugs that may be useful in the treatment of diabetes, and particularly Type 2 diabetes. \n\n\n The invention includes compositions, e.g., pharmaceutical compositions, comprising at least one compound of Formula I. For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. The powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 95 percent active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are known in the art, e.g., magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar or lactose. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. Other carriers include Poloxamer, Povidone K17, Povidone K12, Tween 80, ethanol, \n\n Cremophor/ethanol, polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400, propylene glycol, Trappsol, alpha- cyclodextrin or analogs thereof, beta-cyclodextrin or analogs thereof, or gamma-cyclodextrin or analogs thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and methods of manufacture for various compositions may be found in A. Gennaro (ed.), Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18\nth\n Edition, (1990), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pennsylvania. \n\n\n The therapeutic agents of the present invention are preferably formulated in pharmaceutical compositions and then, in accordance with the methods of the invention, administered to a subject, such as a human subject, in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration. For example, the therapeutic agents may be formulated for intravenous administration. -The formulations may, however, include those suitable for oral, rectal, vaginal, topical, nasal, ophthalmic, or other parenteral administration (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intraperitoneal and intratumoral, in addition to intravenous) administration. \n\n\n Formulations suitable for parenteral administration conveniently include a sterile aqueous preparation of the active agent, or dispersions of sterile powders of the active agent, which are preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Parenteral administration of the therapeutic agents (e.g., through an I.V. drip) is an additional form of administration. Isotonic agents that can be included in the liquid preparation include sugars, buffers, and sodium chloride. Solutions of the active agents can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions of the active agent can be prepared in water, ethanol, a polyol (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, glycerol esters, and mixtures thereof. The ultimate dosage form is sterile, fluid, and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The necessary fluidity can be achieved, for example, by using liposomes, by employing the appropriate particle size in the case of dispersions, or by using surfactants. Sterilization of a liquid preparation can be achieved by any convenient method that preserves the bioactivity of the active agent, preferably by filter sterilization. Preferred methods for preparing powders include vacuum drying and freeze drying of the sterile injectible solutions. Subsequent microbial \n\n\ncontamination can be prevented using various antimicrobial agents, for example, \n\n\nantibacterial, antiviral and antifungal agents including parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. Absorption of the active agents over a prolonged period can be achieved by including agents for delaying, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. \n\n Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as tablets, troches, capsules, lozenges, wafers, or cachets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent as a powder or granules, as liposomes containing the first and/or second therapeutic agents, or as a solution or suspension in an aqueous liquor or non-aqueous liquid such as a syrup, an elixir, an emulsion, or a draught. Such compositions and preparations may contain at least about 0.1 wt-% of the active agent. The amounts of the therapeutic agents should be such that the dosage level will be effective to produce the desired result in the subject. \n\n\n Nasal spray formulations include purified aqueous solutions of the active agent with preservative agents and isotonic agents. Such formulations are preferably adjusted to a pH and isotonic state compatible with the nasal mucous membranes. Formulations for rectal or vaginal... administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable carrier such as cocoa butter, or hydrogenated fats or hydrogenated fatty carboxylic acids. Ophthalmic formulations are prepared by a similar method to the nasal spray, except that the pH and isotonic factors are preferably adjusted to match that of the eye. Topical formulations include the active agent dissolved or suspended in one or more media such as mineral oil, petroleum, polyhydroxy alcohols, or other bases used for topical pharmaceutical formulations. \n\n\n The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain one or more of the following: a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, com starch or gelatin; an excipient such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid, and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose, or aspartame; and a natural or artificial flavoring agent. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may further contain a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac, sugar, and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain one or more of a sweetening agent, a preservative such as methyl- or propylparaben, an agent to retard crystallization of the sugar, an agent to increase the solubility of any other ingredient, such as a polyhydric alcohol, for example glycerol or sorbitol, a dye, and flavoring agent. The material used in preparing any unit dosage form is substantially nontoxic in the amounts employed. The active agent may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices. \n\n\n Preferably the compound is administered orally, intraperitonealiy, or intravenously or intrathecally or some suitable combination(s) thereof. \n\n Methods of administering small molecule therapeutic agents are well-known in the art.\n\n\nThe therapeutic agents described in the present disclosure can be administered to a subject alone or together (coadministered, optionally but not necessarily, in a single formulation) with other active agents as described herein, and are preferably administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer. The therapeutic agents can be combined with a variety of physiological acceptable carriers, additives for delivery to a subject, including a variety of diluents or excipients known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, for parenteral administration, isotonic saline is preferred. For topical administration, a cream, including a carrier such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), or other agents typically found in topical creams that do not block or inhibit activity of the peptide, can be used. Other suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, alcohol, phosphate buffered saline, and other balanced salt solutions. \n\n\n The formulations may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Preferably, such methods include the step of bringing the therapeutic agent (i.e., the active agent) into association with a carrier that constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active agent into association with a liquid carrier, a finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulations. The methods of the invention include administering the therapeutic agents to a subject in an amount effective to produce the desired effect. The therapeutic agents can be administered as a single dose or in multiple doses. Useful dosages of the active agents can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity and the in vivo activity in animal models. \n\n\n The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage regimen for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day as required. \n\n\n The amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of the invention and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated. A typical recommended daily dosage regimen for oral administration can range from, about 1 mg/day to about 500 mg/day, preferably 1 mg/day to 200 mg/day, in two to four divided doses. \n\n Another aspect of this invention is a kit comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, ester or prodrug of said compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, vehicle or diluent. \n\n\n Another aspect of the invention includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of Formula I and at least one other therapeutic agent in combination. Non- limiting examples of such combination agents are described, below. The agents in the combination can be administered together as a joint administration (e.g., joint single pill), separately, one after the other in any order and the like as is well known in the art. \n\n\n In the combination therapies of the present invention, an effective amount can refer to each individual agent or to the combination as a whole, wherein the amounts of all agents administered are together effective, but wherein the component agent of the combination may not be present individually in an effective amount. \n\n\n Combination Therapy \n\n\n Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention provides methods for treating a Condition in a patient, the method comprising administering to the patient one or more\n\n\nCompounds of Formula I, or a phamiaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and at least one additional therapeutic agent that is not a Compound of Formula Ϊ, wherein the amounts administered are together effective to treat or prevent a Condition. \n\n\n When administering a combination therapy to a patient in need of such \n\n\nadministration, the therapeutic agents in the combination, or a pharmaceutical composition or compositions comprising the therapeutic agents, may be administered in any order such as, for example, sequentially, concurrently, together, simultaneously and the like. The amounts of the various actives in such combination therapy may be different amounts (different dosage amounts) or same amounts (same dosage amounts). \n\n\n In one embodiment, the one or more Compounds of Formula (Ϊ) is administered during a time when the additional therapeutic agent(s) exert their prophylactic or therapeutic effect, or vice versa. \n\n\n In another embodiment, the one or more Compounds of Formula (I) and the additional therapeutic agent(s) are administered in doses commonly employed when such agents are used as monotherapy for treating a Condition. \n\n\n In another embodiment, the one or more Compounds of Formula (I) and the additional therapeutic agent(s) are administered in doses lower than the doses commonly employed when such agents are used as monotherapy for treating a Condition. \n\n In still another embodiment, the one or more Compounds of Formula (I) and the additional therapeutic agent(s) act synergistically and are administered in doses lower than the doses commonly employed when such agents are used as monotherapy for treating a Condition. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the one or more Compounds of Formula (I) and the additional therapeutic agent(s) are present in the same composition. In one embodiment, this composition is suitable for oral administration. In another embodiment, this composition is suitable for intravenous administration. \n\n\n The one or more Compounds of Formula (I) and the additional therapeutic agent(s) can act additively or synergistically. A synergistic combination may allow the use of lower dosages of one or more agents and/or less frequent administration of one or more agents of a combination therapy. A lower dosage or less frequent administration of one or more agents may lower toxicity of the therapy without reducing the efficacy of the therapy. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the administration of one or more Compounds of Formula (I) and the additional therapeutic agent(s) may inhibit the resistance of a Condition to these agents. \n\n\n In one embodiment, when the patient is treated for diabetes, a diabetic complication, impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose, the other therapeutic is an \n\n\nantidiabetic agent which is not a Compound of Formula (I). \n\n\n In another embodiment, the other therapeutic agent is an agent useful for reducing any potential side effect of a Compound of Formula (I). Such potential side effects include, but are not limited to, nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, lethargy, muscle aches, diarrhea, general pain, and pain at an injection site. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the other therapeutic agent is used at its known therapeutically effective dose. In another embodiment, the other therapeutic agent is used at its normally prescribed dosage. In another embodiment, the other therapeutic agent is used at less than its normally prescribed dosage or its known therapeutically effective dose. \n\n\n Examples of antidiabetic agents useful in the present methods for treating diabetes or a diabetic complication include a sulfonylurea; an insulin sensitizer (such as a PPAR agonist, a DPP-IV inhibitor, a PTP-1B inhibitor and a glucokinase activator); a glucosidase inhibitor; an insulin secretagogue; a hepatic glucose output lowering agent;

When administered in combination, the Compound(s) of Formula (I) \n.\nand the other agent(s) for treating diseases or conditions listed above can be administered simultaneously or sequentially. This is particularly useful when the components of the combination are given on different dosing schedules, e.g., one component is administered once daily and another every six hours, or when the preferred pharmaceutical compositions are different, e.g. one is a tablet and one is a capsule. A kit comprising the separate dosage forms is therefore advantageous. \n\n\n Generally, a total daily dosage of the one or more Compounds of Formula (I) and the additional therapeutic agent(s) can, when administered as combination therapy, range from about 0.1 to about 2000 mg per day, although variations will necessarily occur depending on the target of the therapy, the patient and the route of administration.

In another embodiment, the dosage is from about 1 to about 500 mg/day, administered in a single dose or in 2-4 divided doses. In another embodiment, the dosage is from about 1 to about 200 mg/day,. administered in a single dose or in 2-4 divided doses. In still another embodiment, the dosage is from about 1 to about 100 mg/day, administered in a single dose or in 2-4 divided doses. In yet another embodiment, the dosage is from about 1 to about 50 mg/day, administered in a single dose or in 2-4 divided doses. In a further embodiment, the dosage is from about 1 to about 20 mg/day, administered in a single dose or in 2-4 divided doses. \n\n\n The compounds of the invention can be made according to the processes described below. The compounds of this invention are also exemplified in the examples below, which examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the disclosure. Alternative mechanistic pathways and analogous structures within the scope of the invention may be apparent to those skilled in the art. \n\n General Methods \n\n\n The general methods described in this paragraph were used unless stated otherwise in the examples below. All solvents and reagents were used as received. Proton NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian XL-400 (400 MHz) or a Bruker (500 MHz) instrument and were reported as parts per million (pprn) downfield from Me\n4\nSi. LCMS analysis was performed using a PE SCIEX API-150EX, single quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a Phenomenex column: Gemini C-18, 50 x 4.6 mm, 5 micron; mobile phase A: 0.05 % trifluoroacetic acid in water, B: 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in C¾CN; gradient: 90 % A and 10 % B to 5 % A and 95 % B in 5 minutes. Flash column chromatography was performed using Teledyne Isco RediSep Normal Phase Columns. Preparative TLC was performed using Analtech Silica gel GF plates. \n\n\nIntermediate A-3 \n\n\n -methyl- 5 -pheny lbenzofuran-2- carboxylic acid \n\n\n\n\n\n A-2 A-3 \n\n\n Step 1 : ethyl 3 -methy 1-5 -pheny lbenzofuran-2-carboxy late (A-2) \n\n\n To a solution of compound A-1 (1.00 g, 3.53 mmol) dissolved in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (11 mL) was added tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)paliadium (122 mg, 0.106 mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 mins then phenylboronic acid (0.470 g, 3.85 mmol) and sodium carbonate (8.5 mL, 1.0 M in water, 8.50 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was heated at reflux for 4 h then cooled. Water was added, and the aqueous solution was extracted with CH2CI2.

The reaction was initiated by the addition of the combined substrates l\ns\n2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol and [\n14\nC]-palmitoyl-Co A and incubated with test compounds and microsomal membranes for 2 hours at room temperature. The assay was stopped by adding 0.5 mg wheat germ agglutinin beads in assay buffer with \n\n1% Brij-35 and 1% 3-cholamidopropyldimethyl-ammonio-l -propane sulfonate. Plates were sealed with TopSeal and incubated for 18 hours to allow the radioactive triglyceride product to come into proximity with the bead. Plates were read on a TopCount instrument. \n\n\n Percent inhibition was calculated as the percent of (test compound inhibition minus non-specific binding) relative to (total binding minus non-specific binding). IC\n5\no values were determined by curve fitting the data to a Sigmoidal dose-response in GraphPad Prism utilizing the following equation: \n\n\n Y = A + (B-A)/(l+10\nA\n((LogIC\n5\no-X))), \n\n\nwhere A and B are the bottom and top of the curve (highest and lowest inhibition), respectively, and X is the logarithm of concentration. \n\n\nExample IC50 (n ) Example IC50 (nM) \n\n\n 1 25 50 2333 \n\n\n 2 625 51 28 \n\n\n 3 589 52 33 \n\n\n 4 46 53 27 \n\n\n 5 39 54 220 \n\n\n 6 24 55 78 \n\n\n \n7\n 42 \n■\n 57 240 \n\n\n 8 48 58 13 \n\n\n 9 49 59 9 \n\n\n 10 37 62 482 \n\n\n 11 95 63 774 \n\n\n 12 103 64 65 \n\n\n 13 282 65 454 \n\n\n 14 361 66 454 \n\n\n 17 125 68 2458 \n\n\n 18 52 69 204 \n\n\n 19 70 70 1087 \n\n\n 20 115 71 171 \n\n\n 21 566 72 13265 \n\n\n 24 59 73 108 \n\n\n 25 93 74 120 \n\n 26 59 75 31 1 \n\n\n 27 316 76 65 \n\n\n 29 134 \n77\n 152 \n\n\n 30 1420 78 156 \n\n\n 31 84 80 600 \n\n\n 33 93 81 1056 \n\n\n 35 38 82 104 \n\n\n 36 90 84 344 \n\n\n 37 106 86 305 \n\n\n 38 1009 87 22 \n\n\n 39 55 90 194 \n\n\n 40 100 91 84 \n\n\n 41 145 93 56 \n\n\n 42 55 94 71 \n\n\n 43 51 95 6 \n\n\n 44 60 \n\n\n 45 40 \n\n\n 46 84 \n\n\nThe present invention is not to be limited by the specific embodiments disclosed in the examples that are intended as illustrations of a few aspects of the invention and any embodiments that are functionally equivalent are within the scope of this invention.
