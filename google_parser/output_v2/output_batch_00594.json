Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to the discovery of particular heterocyclic compounds, and further to particular salts of these heterocycles, possessing increased activity as mGluR5 antagonists.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nUnsaturated heterocylic compounds find a wide variety of uses. For example, compounds of this class find uses as modulators of physiological processes that are mediated by ligand-activated receptors. Receptors that are activated by ligands are located throughout the nervous, cardiac, renal, digestive and bronchial systems, among others. In the nervous system, for example, heterocyclic compounds are capable of functioning as agonists or antagonists of receptors for neurotransmitters, neurohormones and neuromodulators. Ligand-activated receptors have been identified in a wide variety of species, including humans, other mammals and vertebrates as well as in invertebrate species. Therefore, compounds of this class are also able to modulate receptor-mediated processes throughout phylogeny and find uses in a wide variety of applications, e.g., as pharmaceuticals, insecticides, fungicides and other uses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReceptors activated by excitatory amino acids, such as the amino acid L-glutamic acid (glutamate), are a major excitatory neurotransmitter receptor class in the mammalian central nervous system. Anatomical, biochemical and electrophysiological analyses suggest that glutamatergic systems are involved in a broad array of neuronal processes, including fast excitatory synaptic transmission, regulation of neurotransmitter release, long-term potentiation, long-term depression, learning and memory, developmental synaptic plasticity, hypoxic-ischemic damage and neuronal cell death, epileptiform seizures, visual processing, as well as the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders. See generally, \nNakanishi et al., Brain Research Reviews 26:230-235 (1998\n); \nMonaghan et al., Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 29:365-402 (1980\n). This extensive repertoire of functions, especially those related to learning, neurotoxicity, and neuropathology, has stimulated recent attempts to describe and define the mechanisms through which glutamate exerts its effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlutamate has been observed to mediate its effects through receptors that have been categorized into two main groups: ionotropic and metabotropic. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are generally divided into two classes: the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptors. Both classes of receptors are linked to integral cation channels and share some amino acid sequence homology. GluRI-4 are termed AMPA (a- amino-3-hydroxy-5 methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid) receptors because AMPA preferentially activates receptors composed of these subunits, while GluRS-7 and KA1-2 are termed kainate receptors as these are preferentially sensitive to kainic acid. Thus, an \"AMPA receptor\" is a non-NMDA receptor that can be activated by AMPA. AMPA receptors include the GluRl-4 family, which form homo-oligomeric and hetero-oligomeric complexes which display different current-voltage relations and calcium permeability. Polypeptides encoded by GluRl-4 nucleic acid sequences can form functional ligand gated ion channels. An AMPA receptor includes a receptor having a G1uR1, G1uR2, GIuR3 and/or G1uR4 subunit. A NMDA receptor includes a receptor having NMDARI, NMDAR2a, NMDAR2b, NMDAR2c, NMDAR2d and/or NMDAR3 subunits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabotropic glutamate receptors are divided into three groups based on amino acid sequence homology, transduction mechanism and pharmacological properties, namely Group I, Group II and Group III. Each Group of receptors contains one or more types of receptors. For example, Group I includes metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 and 5 (mG1uR1 and mG1uR5), Group II includes metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mG1uR2 and mG1uR3) and Group III includes metabotropic glutamate receptors 4, 6, 7 and 8 (mG1uR4, mG1uR6, mG1uR7 and mGluR8). Several subtypes of a particular mGluR type may exist. For example, subtypes of mGluR1 include mGluRla, mGluRlb, mGluRlc and mGluRld.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnatomical studies demonstrate a broad and selective distribution of metabotropic glutamate receptors in the mammalian nervous system. For example, mG1uR1 is expressed in the cerebellum, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, lateral septum, thalamus, globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, ventral pallidum and substantia nigra (\nPetralia et al., (1997) J. Chem. Neuroanat., 13:77-93\n; \nShigemoto et al., (1992) J. Comp. Neurol., 322:121-135\n). In contrast, mGluR5 is weakly expressed in the cerebellum, while higher levels of expression are found in the striatum and cortex (\nRomano et al., (1995) J. Comp. Neurol., 355:455-469\n). In the hippocampus, mGluR5 appears widely distributed and is diffusely expressed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabotropic glutamate receptors are typically characterized by seven putative transmembrane domains, preceded by a large putative extracellular amino-terminal domain and followed by a large putative intracelluar carboxy-terminal domain. The receptors couple to G- proteins and activate certain second messengers depending on the receptor group. Thus, for example, Group I mGluR's activate phospholipase C. Activation of the receptors results in the hydrolysis of membrane phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate to diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C, and inositol trisphosphate, which in turn activates the inositol trisphosphate receptor to promote the release of 20 intracellular calcium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of heterocyclic compounds having activity as mGluR5 antagonists have been described in our International Publication No. \n \nWO 01/16121\n \n and related national phase applications such as \n \n09/387,073\n \n (abandoned) and \n \n10/217,800\n \n, issued as United States Patent No. \n \n6, 774,138\n \n, for modulating the activity of the mGluR5 receptor and for use in the treatment of mGluR5 mediated conditions. Other publications disclosing mGluR5 ligands include: \n \nWO 2004/038374\n \n; \nCosford et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem.Lett, 13(3), 2003, 351-354\n; \nRoppe et al, ibid, 14(15), 2004, 3993-3996\n; and \nRoppe et al, J. Med. Chem. 47(19), 2004, 4645-4648\n. Because of the physiological and pathological significance of excitatory amino acid receptors generally, and metabotropic glutamate receptors in particular, there is a need to identify ever more effective methods of modulating excitatory amino acid receptor-mediated processes, as well as more effective therapeutic methods of treatment and methods for prevention of diseases. There is thus a continuing need in the art to identify new and increasingly potent members of a compound class that can modulate excitatory amino acid receptors.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe identification of a compound which falls within the scope of the group of compounds described and claimed in \n \nWO 01/16121\n \n and in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,744,138\n \n but which is not specifically disclosed therein, which compound possesses special advantages in terms of drug-like properties. That is, the compound described herein shows increased potential for use as a drug due to its possessing uniquely advantageous properties in terms of potency and/or selectivity and/or pharmacokinetic properties and/or in vivo receptor occupancy properties. Specifically, it has been discovered that the selection of a 1,3-thiazol-2-yl ring moiety linked by an ethynylene to the 3 position of a pyridyl ring, wherein the ring is substituted with selected substituents, results in a compound with superior drug-like properties. The invention also discloses pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of this heterocyclic compound, in particular chloride salts and trifluoroacetate salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventive compounds are useful for a wide variety of applications. For example these compounds can act to modulate physiological processes by functioning as antagonists of glutamate receptors in the nervous system. The inventive compounds may also act as insecticides and as fungicides. Pharmaceutical compositions containing invention compounds also have wide utility.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, there are provided a compound of the formula:\n\n \n \n\nwhere said compound does not comprise radioisotopes, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts therof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose of skill in the art will recognize that invention compounds may exist in polymorphic forms wherein a compound is capable of crystallizing in different forms.

In addition, receptors of this class also mediate inhibitory responses. Excitatory amino acid receptors are membrane spanning proteins that mediate the stimulatory actions of the amino acid glutamate and possibly other endogenous acidic amino acids. Excitatory amino acids are crucial for fast and slow neurotransmission and they have been implicated in a variety of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, stroke, schizophrenia, head trauma, epilepsy, and the like. In addition, excitatory amino acids are integral to the processes of long-term potentiation and depression which are synaptic mechanisms underlying learning and memory. There are three main subtypes of excitatory amino acid receptors: (I) the metabotropic receptors; (2) the ionotropic NMDA receptors; and (3) the non-NMDA receptors, which include the AMPA receptors and kainate receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs employed herein, the phrase \"modulating the activity of refers to altered levels of activity so that the activity is different with the use of the invention method when compared to the activity without the use of the invention method. Modulating the activity of excitatory amino acid receptors includes the suppression or augmentation of the activity of receptors. Suppression of receptor activity may be accomplished by a variety of means, including blocking of a ligand binding site, biochemical and/or physico-chemical modification of a ligand binding site, binding of agonist recognition domains, preventing ligand-activated conformational changes in the receptor, preventing the activated receptor from stimulating second messengers such as G-proteins, and the like. Augmentation of receptor activity may be accomplished by a variety of means including, stabilization of a ligand binding site, biochemical and/or physico-chemical modification of a ligand binding site, binding of agonist recognition domains, promoting ligand-activated conformational changes in the receptor, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExcitatory amino acid receptor activity can be involved in numerous disease states. Therefore modulating the activity of receptors also refers to a variety of therapeutic applications, such as the treatment of cerebral ischemia, chronic neurodegeneration, psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, mood disorders, emotion disorders, disorders of extrapyramidal motor function, obesity, disorders of respiration, motor control and function, attention deficit disorders, concentration disorders, pain disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, epilepsy, convulsive disorders, eating disorders, sleep disorders, sexual disorders, circadian disorders, drug withdrawal, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, anxiety, panic disorders, depressive disorders, skin disorders, retinal ischemia, retinal degeneration, glaucoma, disorders associated with organ transplantation, asthma, ischemia or astroytomas, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds contemplated for use in accordance with of invention modulatory methods are especially useful for the treatment of mood disorders such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, drug withdrawal, tobacco withdrawal, memory loss, cognitive impairment, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and the like; disorders of extrapyramidal motor function such as Parkinson's disease, progressive supramuscular palsy, Huntington's disease, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds contemplated for use in accordance with the invention are also especially useful for the treatment of pain disorders such as neuropathic pain, chronic pain, acute pain, painful diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, cancer-associated pain, pain associated with chemotherapy, pain associated with spinal cord injury, pain associated with multiple sclerosis, causalgia and reflex sympathetic dystrophy, phantom pain, post-stroke (central) pain, pain associated with HIV or AIDS, trigeminal neuralgia, lower back pain, myofacial disorders, migraine, osteoarthritic pain, postoperative pain, dental pain, post-burn pain, pain associated with systemic lupus, entrapment neuropathies, painful polyneuropathies, ocular pain, pain associated with inflammation, pain due to tissue injury, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, compounds contemplated for use in accordance with the invention are especially useful for the treatment of cerebral ischemia, chronic neurodegeneration, psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, mood disorders, emotion disorders, disorders of extrapyramidal motor function, obesity, disorders of respiration, motor control and function, attention deficit disorders, concentration disorders, pain disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, epilepsy, convulsive disorders, eating disorders, sleep disorders, sexual disorders, circadian disorders, drug withdrawal, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, anxiety, panic disorders, depressive disorders, skin disorders, retinal ischemia, retinal degeneration, glaucoma, disorders associated with organ transplantation, asthma, ischemia and astrocytomas.

Certain pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of heterocyclic compounds described herein, achieve higher solubility as compared with nonsalt forms. In addition, certain salt forms are more compatible with pharmaceutical uses. Characteristics of salt forms of compounds depend on the characteristics of the compound so treated, and on the particular salt employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother utility of the invention is a method of modulating the activity of metabotropic glutamate receptors, said method comprising contacting metabotropic glutamate receptors with a concentration of a heterocylic compound as described above sufficient to modulate the activity of said metabotropic glutamate receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrase \"metabotropic glutamate receptor\" refers to a class of cell-surface receptors which participates in the G-protein- coupled response of cells to glutamatergic ligands. Three groups of metabotropic glutamate receptors, identified on the basis of amino acid sequence homology, transduction mechanism and binding selectivity are presently known and each group contains one or more types of receptors.

Administration in the form of creams, lotions, tablets, capsules, pellets, dispersible powders, granules, suppositoiries, syrups, elixirs, lozenges, injectable solutions, sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions or emulsions, patches, and the like, is also contemplated. The active ingredients may be compounded with non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers including, glucose, lactose, gum acacia, gelatin, mannitol, starch paste, magnesium trisilicate, talc, corn starch, keratin, colloidal silica, potato starch, urea, dextrans, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor purposes of oral administration, tablets, capsules, troches, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups, elixirs and lozenges containing various excipients such as calcium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate, sodium phosphate, and the like may be employed along with various granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid, and the like, together with binding agents such as gum tragacanth, corn starch, gelatin, acacia, and the like. Lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc, and the like may also be added. Preparations intended for oral use may be prepared according to any methods known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations and such preparations may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose, saccharin, and the lake, flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, and the like, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically palatable preparations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations for oral use may also contain suitable carriers include emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and the like, optionally containing additives such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending 24 agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, and the like. Tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period of time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the preparation of fluids for parenteral administration, suitable carriers include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions. For parenteral administration, solutions for the practice of the invention may comprise sterile aqueous saline solutions, or the corresponding water soluble pharmaceutically acceptable metal salts, as previously described. For parenteral administration, solutions of the compounds used in the practice of the invention may also comprise non- aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, and the like. Examples of non- aqueous solvents or vehicles are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous solutions may also be suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal injection. The sterile aqueous media employed are all readily obtainable by standard techniques well known to those skilled in the art. They may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, by heating the compositions, and the like. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile water, or some other sterile medium capable of injection immediately before use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds contemplated for use in accordance with the present invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration. These compositions may be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient, such as cocoa butter, synthetic glyceride esters of polyethylene glycols, and the like, such materials being solid at ambient temperatures but liquify and/or dissolve in internal cavities to release the drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preferred therapeutic compositions for inocula and dosage will vary with the clinical indication. Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending upon the condition of the patient being treated, and the physician will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual patient. The effective amount of compound per unit dose depends, among other things, on the body weight, physiology, and chosen inoculation regimen. A unit dose of compound refers to the weight of compound without the weight of carrier (when carrier is used).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe route of delivery of compounds and compositions used for the practice of the invention is determined by the disease and the site where treatment is required. Since the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of compounds and compositions described herein will vary somewhat, the most preferred method for achieving a therapeutic concentration in a tissue is to gradually escalate the dosage and monitor the clinical effects. The initial dose, for such an escalating dosage regimen of therapy, will depend upon the route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with invention methods, the medicinal preparation can be introduced parenterally, by dermal application, and the like, in any medicinal form or composition. It is used as a solitary agent of medication or in combination with other medicinal preparations. Single and multiple therapeutic dosage regimens may prove useful in therapeutic protocols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs employed herein, the phrase \"a therapeutically effective amount\", when used in reference to invention methods employing heterocyclic compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, refers to a dose of compound sufficient to provide circulating concentrations high enough to impart a beneficial effect on the recipient thereof. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated, the severity of the disorder, the activity of the specific compound used, the route of administration, the rate of clearance of the specific compound, the duration of treatment, the drugs used in combination or coincident with the specific compound,- the age, body weight, sex, diet and general health of the patient, and like factors well known in the medical arts and sciences. Dosage levels typically fall in the range of about 0.001 up to 100 mg/kg/day; with levels in the range of about 0.05 up to 10 mg/kg/day being preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother utility of the invention is a method for preventing disease conditions in a subject at risk thereof, said method comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of the heterocyclic compound described above in accordance with invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrase \"preventing disease conditions\" refers to preventing a disease, disorder or condition from occurring in a subject who may be at risk for the disease, but has not yet been diagnosed as having the disease. Those of skill in the art will understand that a variety of methods may be used to determine a subject at risk for a disease, and that whether a subject is at risk for a disease will depend on a variety of factors known to those of skill in the art, including genetic make-up of the subject, age, body weight, sex, diet, general health, occupation, exposure to environmental conditions, marital status, and the like, of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose of skill in the art can readily identify a variety of assays that can be used to assess the activity of excitatory amino acid receptors. For receptor species that activate a second messenger pathway, assays that measure receptor-activated changes in intracellular second messengers can be employed to monitor receptor activity. For example, inhibition of G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptors using a radioligand binding assay. (See Example 3.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, activation of excitatory amino acid receptors that leads to the release of intracellular calcium or changes in intracellular calcium concentration can also be used to assess excitatory amino acid receptor activity. Methods of detection of transient increases in intracellular calcium concentration are well known in the art. (See e.g., \nIto et al., J. Neurochem. 56:531-540 (1991\n) and Example 108). G-protein coupled receptors are also coupled to other second messenger systems such as phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis (see, e.g., \nBerridge et al, (1982) Biochem. J. 206: 587-5950\n; and \nNakajima et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:2437-2442 (1992\n) and Example 4).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIntermediate 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-chloro-5-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2-Chloro-5-iodopyridine (40 mmol, 10.0 g), 2-methyl-4-[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]-1,3-thiazole (40 mmol, 7.8 g), dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) (2 mmol, 1.4 g), copper(I) iodide (4 mmol, 760 mg) and triethylamine (200 mmol, 28 mL) were added to deoxygenated DMF (200 mL) at room temperature. The reaction was then warmed to 60°C and tetrabutylammonium fluoride (40 mmol, 40 mL of 1.0 M solution in THF) was added dropwise via syringe. Stirring continued for 2.5 hrs and the reaction contents were then poured in to a separatory funnel and partitioned with 1:1 hexanes:EtOAc (1000 mL) and water (500 mL). The organic layer was then washed with 5 portions of 5% NaCl (250 mL each). The combined aqueous layers were back-extracted with 1:1 hexanes:EtOAc (500 mL).

See generally \nDaggett et al., Neuropharmacology 34:871-886 (1995\n). Receptor activity was detected by changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca\n2+\n]\ni\n) measured using the fluorescent calcium-sensitive dye, fura-2. hmGluR5a/L38-20 cells were plated onto 96-well plates, and loaded with 3 M fura-2 for 1 h. Unincorporated dye was washed from the cells, and the cell plate was transferred to a custom-built 96-channel fluorimeter (SIBIA-SAIC, La Jolla, CA) which is integrated into a fully automated plate handling and liquid delivery system. Cells were excited at 350 and 385 nm with a xenon source combined with optical filters. Emitted light was collected from the sample through a dichroic mirror and a 510 nm interference filter and directed into a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments). Image pairs were captured approximately every 1 s, and ratio images were generated after background subtraction. After a basal reading of 20 s, an EC\n80\n concentration of glutamate (10 M) was added to the well, and the response evaluated for another 60 s. The glutamate-evoked increase in [Ca\n2+\n]\ni\n in the presence of the screening compound was compared to the response of glutamate alone (the positive control).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n3\nH]-mGIuR5 Antagonist Binding to Rodent Brain Membranes\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with Anderson JJ, Rao SP, Rowe B, Giracello DR, Holtz G, Chapman DF, Tehrani L, Bradbury MJ, Cosford ND, Varney MA, [\n3\nH]Methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine binding to metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 in rodent brain: in vitro and in vivo characterization. \nJ Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2002 Dec;303(3):1044-51\n, membranes were prepared (as described in Ransom RW and Stec NL (1988) Cooperative modulation of [\n3\nH]MK-801 binding to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-ion channel complex by L-glutamate, glycine, and polyamines. \nJ Neurochem\n \n51\n:830-836) using whole rat brain, or mGlu5\n+/+\n or mGlu5\n-/-\n whole mouse brain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding assays were performed as described in \nSchaffhauser H, Richards JG, Cartmell J, Chaboz S, Kemp JA, Klingelschmidt A, Messer J, Stadler H, Woltering T and Mutel V (1998) In vitro binding characteristics of a new selective group II metabotropic glutamate receptor radioligand, [3H]LY354740, in rat brain.

Briefly, membranes were thawed and washed once with assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, pH 7.4), followed by centrifugation at 40,000 x g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in assay buffer and briefly homogenized with a Polytron.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor protein linearity experiments, increasing concentrations of membrane protein were added to 96-well plates in triplicate and binding was initiated by addition of 20 nM [\n3\nH]methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine. The assay was incubated for 2 h and non-specific binding was determined using 10 µM MPEP. The binding was terminated by rapid filtration through glass-fiber filters (Unifilter-96 GF/B plate, Packard) using a 96-well plate Brandel cell harvester. Following addition of scintillant, the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Protein measurements were performed by BioRad-DC Protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSaturation binding experiments were performed in triplicate with increasing concentrations of [\n3\nH]methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine (1 pM to 100 nM). The time course of association was measured by the addition of 10 nM [\n3\nH]methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine to the membranes at different time points (0 - 240 min), followed by filtration. Dissociation was measured by the addition of 100 µM unlabeled methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine at different time points to membranes previously incubated for 3 h with 10 nM [\n3\nH]methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine. For competition experiments, 100 µg membrane protein and 10 nM [\n3\nH]methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine was added to wells containing increasing concentration of the test compound in duplicate (methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine or MPEP).

Mouse fibroblast Ltk cells expressing hmGluR5 (hmGluR5/L38- 20 cells) were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 8x105 cells/well. One Ci of [\n3\nH]-inositol (Amersham PT6-271; Arlington Heights, Ill.; specific activity = 17.7 Ci/mmol) was added to each well and incubated for 16 h at 37°C. Cells were washed twice and incubated for 45 min in 0.5 ml of standard Hepes buffered saline buffer (HBS; 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.62 M MgSO\n4\n, 1.8 mM CaCl\n2\n, 20 mM HEPES, 6 mM glucose, pH to 7.4). The cells were washed with HBS containing 10 mM LiCl, and 400 ill buffer added to each well. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 20 min. For testing, 50 L, of 10x compounds used in the practice of the invention [made in HBS/LiCl (100 mM)] was added and incubated for 10 minutes. Cells were activated by the addition of 10 pM glutamate, and the plates left for 1 hour at 37°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe incubations were terminated by the addition of 1 mL ice-cold methanol to each well. In order to isolate inositol phosphates (IPs), the cells were scraped from wells, and placed in numbered glass test tubes. Chloroform (1 mL) was added to each tube, the tubes were mixed, and the phases separated by centrifugation. IPs were separated on Dowex anion exchange columns (AG 1-X8 100-200 mesh formate form). The upper aqueous layer (750 L) was added to the Dowex columns, and the \n \nPCT/US00/23923 109\n \n columns eluted with distilled water (3 mL). The eluents were discarded, and the columns were washed with 60 mM ammonium formate/5 mM Borax (10 mL), which was also discarded as waste. Finally the columns were eluted with 800 mM ammonium formate/0.1 M formic acid (4 mL), and the samples collected in scintillation vials. Scintillant was added to each vial, and the vials shaken, and counted in a scintillation counter after 2 hours. Phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in cells treated with certain exemplary compounds was compared to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in cells treated with control.
