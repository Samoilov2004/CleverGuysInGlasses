Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe technical field of this invention relates to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family members and TGF-β receptors, as well as methods of modulating the activities of TGF-β family members for the treatment of various disorders.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) family of proteins includes the transforming growth factors-β (TGF-β), activins, bone morphogenic proteins (BMP), nerve growth factors (NGFs), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and growth/ differentiation factors (GDFs). These family members are involved in the regulation of a wide range of biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and other functions. Activins were originally discovered as gonadal peptides involved in the regulation of follicle stimulating hormone synthesis, and are now believed to be involved in the regulation of a number of biological activities including control of section and expression of anterior pituitary hormones such as FSH, GH, and ACTH, neuron survival, hypothalamic oxytocin secretion, erythropoiesis, placental and gonadal steroidogenesis, early embryonic development, and proliferation of some types of tumors. Activins A, B and AB are the homodimers and heterdimer respectively of two polypeptide chains, ßA and ßB (\nVale et al. Nature 321, 776-779 (1986\n),\n Ling et al., Nature 321, 779-782 (1986\n)). These two β chains can also dimerize with a related a chain giving rise to inhibins A and B respectively (\nMason et al, Nature 318, 659-663 (1986\n)). It is well established that inhibins are necessary for maintaining normal function in many tissues, particularly those associated with reproductive functions. In these tissues inhibins oppose many, but not all, of the activin activities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGrowth/differentiation factor 8 (GDF-8), also referred to as myostatin, is a TGF-ß family member expressed for the most part in the cells of developing and adult skeletal muscle tissue. Myostatin appears to play an essential role in negatively controlling skeletal muscle growth (\nMcPherron et al. Nature (London) 387, 83-90 (1997\n)). Antagonizing myostatin has been shown to increase lean muscle mass in animals (McFerron et al, supra, \nZimmers et al, Science 296:1486 (2002\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother member of the TGF-β family of proteins is a related growth/differentiation factor, GDF-11. GDF-11 has approximately 90% identity of the amino acid sequence of myostatin. GDF-11 has a role in the axial patterning in developing animals (\nOh et al, Genes Dev 11:1812-26 (1997\n)), and also appears to play a role in skeletal muscle development and growth. However, the postnatal role of GDF-11 is not currently understood.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA family of transmembrane serine/threonine kinases are known to act as receptors for activins and other TGF-β family members. These receptors fall into two distinct subfamilies known as type I and type II receptors that act cooperatively to bind ligand and transduce signal (\nAttisano et al., Mol Cell Biol 16 (3), 1066-1073 (1996\n)). Most TGF-β ligands are believed bind first to a type II receptor and this ligand/type II receptor complex then recruits a type I receptor (\nMathews, LS, Endocr Rev 15:310-325 (1994\n); \nMassague, Nature Rev: Mol Cell Biol. 1, 169-178 (2000\n)). The type II receptor kinase then phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor kinase, which in turn phosphorylates the Smad proteins. Activins initially bind their type II receptors ActRIIA for activin A, or ActRIIB for activin B. This is followed by the recruitment, phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the type I receptor, activin-like kinase 4 (ALK4). On activation, ALK4 binds and then phosphorylates a subset of cytoplasmic Smad proteins (Smad2 and Smad3) that produce signal transduction for activins (\nDerynck, R et al. Cell 95, 737-740 (1998\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCross-linking studies have determined that myostatin is capable of binding the activin type II receptors ActRIIA and ActRIIB in vitro (\nLee et al. PNAS USA 98:9306-11 (2001\n)). There is also evidence that GDF-11 binds to both ActRIIA and ActRIIB (\nOh et al., Genes Dev 16:2749-54 (2002\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTGF-β proteins are known to be associated with a variety of disease states and antagonizing these proteins may be useful as therapeutic treatments for the disease states. In particular antagonizing several TGF-β proteins simultaneously may be particularly effective for treating certain diseases. The present invention provides a novel composition of matter and methods of using the composition of matter as a treatment for muscle-related and other disorders.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a protein comprising human activin receptor IIB5 (designated ActRIIB5) polypeptides as set out in the \nclaim\n 5.

This receptor is characterized by its ability to bind to three TGF-β proteins, myostatin (GDF-8), activin A, and GDF-11, and to inhibit the activities of these proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term \"TGF-β family members\" or \"TGF-β proteins\" refers to the structurally related growth factors of the transforming growth factor family including activins, and growth and differential factor (GDF) proteins (\nKinglsey et al. Genes Dev. 8: 133-146 (1994\n), \nMcPherron et al. Growth factors and cytokines in health and disease, Vol 1B, D. LeRoith and C.Bondy. ed., JAI Press Inc., Greenwich, Conn, USA: pp 357-393\n). GDF-8, also referred to as myostatin, is now know to be a negative regulator of skeletal muscle tissue (\nMcPherron et al. PNAS USA 94:12457-12461 (1997\n)). Myostatin is synthesized as an inactive preproprotein complex approximately 375 amino acids in length, having GenBank Accession No: AAB86694 for human. The precursor protein is activated by proteolytic cleavage at a tetrabasic processing site to produce an N-terminal inactive prodomain and an approximately 109 amino acid C-terminal protein which dimerizes to form a homodimer of about 25 kDa. This homodimer is the mature, biologically active protein (\nZimmers et al., Science 296,1486 (2002\n)). As used herein, the term \"prodomain\" or \"propeptide\" refers to the inactive N-terminal protein which is cleaved off to release the active C-terminal protein. As used herein the term \"myostatin\" or \"mature myostatin\" refers to the mature, biologically active C-terminal polypeptide, in monomer, dimer or other form, as well as biologically active fragments or related polypeptides including allelic variants, splice variants, and fusion peptides and polypeptides. The mature myostatin has been reported to have 100% sequence identity among many species including human, mouse, chicken, porcine, turkey, and rat (\nLee et al., PNAS 98, 9306 (2001\n)). As used herein GDF-11 refers to the BMP protein having SwissPro accession number 095390, as well as variants and species homologs of that protein. GDF-11 has approximately 90% identity to myostatin at the amino acid level. GDF-11 is involved in the regulation of anterior/posterior patterning of the axial skeleton (\nMcPherron et al, Natr Genet 22 (93): 260-264 (1999\n); \nGamer et al, Dev. Biol. 208 (1), 222-232 (1999\n)) but postnatal functions are unknown. Activin A is the homodimer of the polypeptide chains BA. As used herein the term \"activin A\" refers to the activin protein having GenBank Accession No: NM_002192, as well as variants and species homologs of that protein.\n\n\n \n\n\nActivin receptors\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"activin type II B receptor\" (ActRIIB) refers to the human precursor activin receptor having accession number NP_001097 for protein or any variants or homologs of this receptor. The human ActRIIB precursor polynucleotide and amino acid sequences are set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4 and 5 respectively. A variation of ActRIIB is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 6, wherein arginine at position 64 has been replaced with alanine. SEQ ID NO: 5 is referred to as the R form and SEQ ID NO: 6 is referred to as the A form. The extracellular domain of ActRIIB (ActRIIB-ECD) is represented by \namino acids\n 1 through 124 of SEQ ID NO: 5 and 6. Additional murine isoforms for this receptor have been identified as \nmuActRIIB\n 1, muActRIIB2, muActRIIB3 and muActRIIB4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a novel human activin receptor designated activin receptor IIB5 (ActRIIB5). This receptor is characterized by the C terminal sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3. The cDNA of this receptor was isolated as described in Example 1, and was found to be missing the 152 nucleotide bases corresponding to \nexon\n 4. This receptor is further characterized as missing the transmembrane region encoded by \nexon\n 4 of the ActRIIB. This receptor is further characterized as being a soluble, secreted instead of a membrane bound receptor. The receptor is further characterized as having the ability to bind and inhibit the activity of any one of activin A, myostatin, or GDF-11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides isolated proteins which comprise ActIIB5 receptor polypeptides. As used herein the term \"isolated\" refers to a nucleic acid molecule purified to some degree from endogenous material. In one embodiment, the protein comprises ActRIIB5 polypeptides having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, and variants and derivatives of this polypeptide, which retain the activity of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, as claimed. In one embodiment, the protein comprises a polypeptide having at least about 80% identity, at least about 85% identity, at least about 90% identity, at least about 95% identity, at least about 98% identity, or at least about 99% identity to the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, wherein the polypeptide retains the activity of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2. In another embodiment, the protein comprises the ActRIIB5 polypeptides described above wherein the polypeptide has a C terminal comprising the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3, and wherein the polypeptide retains the activity of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2. In another the embodiment, the protein comprises the ActRIIB5 polypeptides described above wherein the C terminal has an amino acid sequence having at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% identity to SEQ ID NO: 3, wherein the polypeptide retains the activity of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2. In one embodiment, the ActRIIB5 polypeptide lacks a signal sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, for example, \namino acids\n 1 to 17 of SEQ ID NO: 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term \"variant\" refers a polypeptide having one or more amino acid inserted, deleted or substituted into the original amino acid sequence, but having a sequence which remains substantially similar to SEQ ID NO: 2, and which retain the activities of ActRIIB5 polypeptides SEQ ID NO: 2. As used herein fragments of the polypeptides which retain the activity of the polypeptides are included in the term \"variants\". For the purposes of the present invention, \"substantially similar\" is at least about 80% identical to the amino acid sequence, at least about 85% identical, at least about 90% identical, at least about 95% identical, at least about 98% identical, at least about 99% identical to the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, and retain the biological activities of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2. Amino acid substitutions which are conservative substitutions are unlikely to affect biological activity are considered identical for purposes of this invention and include the following: Ala for Ser, Val for Ile, Asp for Glu, Thr for Ser, Ala for Gly, Ala for Thr, Ser for Asn, Ala for Val, Ser for Gly, Tyr for Phe, Ala for Pro, Lys for Arg, Asp for Asn, Leu for Ile, Leu for Val, Ala for Glu, Asp for Gly, and the reverse. (See, for example,\n Neurath et al., The Proteins, Academic Press, New York (1979\n)). Additional information regarding phenotypically silent amino acid exchanges can be found in\n Bowie et al., 1999, Science 247:1306-1310\n. Amino acid substitutions also include substitutions in SEQ ID NO: 2 of non-naturally occurring amino acids, D-amino acids, altered amino acids, or peptidomimetics. Amino acid substitutions also includes non-conservative amino acid substitutions, such as neutral hydrophobic for neutral polar, acidic for basic, and other class substitutions, provided that the substituted polypeptides retain the activities of the polypeptides having the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO: 2. Variants further include modifications to the C and N termini which arise from processing due to expression in various cell types such as mammalian cells, E. coli, yeasts and other recombinant host cells. Variants further include polypeptide fragments and polypeptides comprising inactivated N-glycosylation site(s), inactivated protease processing site(s), or conservative amino acid substitution(s), of the polypeptide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdentity and similarity of related peptides and polypeptides can be readily calculated by known methods. Such methods include, but are not limited to, those described in \nComputational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A.M., ed., Oxford University Press, New York (1988\n);\n Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D.W., ed., Academic Press, New York (1993\n); \nComputer Analysis of Sequence Data, \n); \nSequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press (1987\n); \nSequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M.

Methods of determining the relatedness or percent identity of two polypeptides are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Preferred computer program methods to determine identity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, the GCG program package, including GAP (\nDevereux et al., Nucl. Acid. Res., 12:387 (1984\n); Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA (\nAltschul et al., J. Mol. Biol, 215:403-410 (1990\n)). The BLASTX program is publicly available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and other sources (BLAST Manual, Altschul et aL NCB/NLM/NIH Bethesda, MD 20894; Altschul et al., supra (1990)). The well-known Smith Waterman algorithm may also be used to determine identity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term \"derivative\" of the ActRIIB5 polypeptides refers to the attachment of at least one additional chemical moiety, or at least one additional polypeptide to form covalent or aggregate conjugates such as glycosyl groups, lipids, acetyl groups, or C-terminal or N-terminal fusion proteins, conjugation to PEG molecules, and other modifications which are described more fully below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term an \"ActRIIB5 polypeptide activity\" or \"a biological activity of ActRIIB5 polypeptide\" refers to one or more in vitro or in vivo activities of the ActRIIB5 polypeptides including but not limited to those demonstrated in the Examples below. Activities of the ActRIIB5 polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the ability to bind to myostatin or activin A or GDF-11, the ability to reduce or neutralize an activity of myostatin or activin A or GDF-11. For example, pMARE C2C12 cell-based assay described in Example 3 below measures activin A neutralizing activity, myostatin neutralizing activity, and GDP-11 neutralizing activity. In vivo activities include but are not limited to increasing body weight, increasing lean muscle mass, and decreasing fat mass as demonstrated in animal models below. Biological activities further include reducing or preventing cachexia caused by certain types of tumors, and preventing metastasis of certain tumor cells. Further discussion of ActRIIB5 polypeptide activities is provided below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe proteins of the present invention further comprise heterologous proteins attached to the ActRIIB5 polypeptide either directly or through a linker sequence to form a fusion protein. As used herein the term \"fusion protein\" refers to a protein having a heterologous polypeptide attached via recombinant DNA techniques. Heterologous proteins include but are not limited to Fc polypeptides, his tags, and leucine zipper domains to promote oligomerization and stabilization of the ActRIIB5 polypeptides as described in, for example, \n \nWO 00/29581\n \n. As used herein the term \"Fc\" or \"Fc polypeptide\" refers to polypeptides containing the Fc domain of an antibody. The \"Fc domain\" refers to the portion of the antibody that is responsible for binding to antibody receptors on cells. An Fc domain can contain one, two or all of the following: the constant heavy 1 domain (C\nH\n1), the constant heavy 2 domain (C\nH\n2), the constant heavy 3 domain (C\nH\n3), and the hinge region. The Fc domain of the human IgG1, for example, contains the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 domain, and the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain and hinge region, but not the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domain. Truncated forms of such polypeptides containing the hinge region that promotes dimerization are also included. See, for example, \nC. A. Hasemann and J. Donald Capra, Immunoglobins: Structure and Function, in William E. Paul, ed\n. One Fc is a fully human Fc which may originate from any of the immunoglobulins, such as IgG1 and IgG2. However, Fc molecules that are partially human, or originate from non-human species are also included herein. Fc molecules may be made up of monomeric polypeptides that may be linked into dimeric or multimeric forms by covalent (i.e., disulfide bonds) and non-covalent association. The number of intermolecular disulfide bonds between monomeric subunits of native Fc molecules ranges from 1 to 4 depending on class (e.g., IgG, IgA, IgE) or subclass (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgA1, IgGA2). The term \"Fc\" as used herein is used to refer to the monomeric, dimeric, and multimeric forms. As used herein, the term \"Fc variant\" refers to a modified form of a native Fc sequence. Fc variants may be constructed for example, by substituting or deleting residues, inserting residues or truncating portions containing the site. The inserted or substituted residues may also be altered amino acids, such as peptidomimetics or D-amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe proteins of the present invention can optionally further comprise a \"linker\" group. Linkers serve primarily as a spacer between a polypeptide and a second heterologous protein or other type of fusion or between two or more ActRIIB5 polypeptides. In one embodiment, the linker is made up of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds, preferably from 1 to 20 amino acids linked by peptide bonds, wherein the amino acids are selected from the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. One or more of these amino acids may be glycosylated, as is understood by those in the art. In one embodiment, the 1 to 20 amino acids are selected from glycine, alanine, proline, asparagine, glutamine, and lysine. Preferably, a linker is made up of a majority of amino acids that are sterically unhindered, such as glycine and alanine. Exemplary linkers are polyglycines (particularly (Gly)\n5\n, (Gly)\n8\n, poly(Gly-Ala), and polyalanines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe linkers of the present invention are also non-peptide linkers. For example, alkyl linkers such as -NH-(CH\n2\n)s-C(O)-, wherein s = 2-20 can be used. These alkyl linkers may further be substituted by any non-sterically hindering group such as lower alkyl (e.g., C\n1\n-C\n6\n) lower acyl, halogen (e.g., Cl, Br), CN, NH\n2\n, phenyl, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe proteins of the present invention can also be attached to a non-protein molecule for the purpose of conferring desired properties such as reducing degradation and/or increasing half-life, reducing toxicity, reducing immunogenicity, and/or increasing the biological activity of the ActRIIB polypeptides. Exemplary molecules include but are not limited to linear polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polylysine, a dextran; a lipid; a cholesterol group (such as a steroid); a carbohydrate, or an oligosaccharide molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising polynucleotides encoding the ActRIIB5 polypeptides of the present invention. As used herein the term \"isolated\" refers to nucleic acid molecules purified to some degree from endogenous material. In one embodiment, the nucleotide acid molecule of the present invention comprises a polynucleotide encoding SEQ ID NO: 2. Due to the known degeneracy of the genetic code, wherein more than one codon can encode the same amino acid, a DNA sequence can vary from that shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, and still encode a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. Such variant DNA sequences can result from silent mutations occurring during production, or can be the product of deliberate mutagenesis of SEQ ID NO: 2. In another embodiment the nucleic acid molecule comprises a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide having at least about 80% identity to SEQ ID NO: 2, at least about 90% identity to SEQ ID NO: 2, at least about 95% identity to SEQ ID NO: 2, at least about 99% identity to SEQ ID NO: 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe percent identity may be determined by visual inspection and mathematical calculation. Alternatively, the percent identity of two nucleic acid sequences can be determined by comparing sequence information using the GAP computer program, version 6.0 described by (\nDevereux et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 12:387 (1984\n)) and available from the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (UWGCG). The preferred default parameters for the GAP program include: (1) a comparison matrix (containing a value of 1 for identities and 0 for non-identities) for nucleotides, and the weighted comparison matrix of (\nGribskov and Burgess, Nucl. Acids Res., 14:6745 (1986\n)), as described by (\nSchwartz and Dayhoff, eds., Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, National Biomedical Research Foundation, pp. 353-358 (1979\n)); (2) a penalty of 3.0 for each gap and an additional 0.10 penalty for each symbol in each gap; and (3) no penalty for end gaps. Other programs used by one skilled in the art of sequence comparison may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a polynucleotide having the polynucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, or the complementary strand of SEQ ID NO: 1. In another embodiment, the present invention provides nucleic acid molecules which hybridize under stringent or moderate conditions with the polypeptide-encoding regions of SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein the encoded polypeptide comprises a C terminal amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3, and wherein the encoded polypeptide maintains an activity of ActRIIB5 polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides nucleic acid molecules which hybridize under stringent or moderate conditions with the polypeptide-encoding regions of SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein the encoded polypeptide comprises a C terminal amino acid sequence having at least about 80% identity, at least about 85% identity, at least about 90% identity, at least about 95% identity, at least about 98% identity, at least about 99% identity to the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3, and wherein the encoded polypeptide has at least one activity of ActRIIB5 polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, conditions of moderate stringency can be readily determined by those having ordinary skill in the art based on, for example, the length of the DNA. The basic conditions are set forth by (\nSambrook et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2ed. Vol. 1, pp. 1.101-104, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, (1989\n)), and include use of a prewashing solution for the nitrocellulose filters 5X SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), hybridization conditions of about 50% formamide, 6X SSC at about 42°C (or other similar hybridization solution, such as Stark's solution, in about 50% formamide at about 42°C), and washing conditions of about 60°C, 0.5X SSC, 0.1% SDS. Conditions of high stringency can also be readily determined by the skilled artisan based on, for example, the length of the DNA. Generally, such conditions defined as \"highly stringent conditions\" for hybridization and washing are 0.015 M sodium chloride, 0.0015 M sodium citrate at 65-68°C or 0.015 M sodium chloride, 0.0015 M sodium citrate, and 50% formamide at 42°C. Other conditions include hybridizing and washing at approximately 68°C, 0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS. The skilled artisan will recognize that the temperature and wash solution salt concentration can be adjusted as necessary according to factors such as the length of the sequence. See \nSambrook, Fritsch & Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1989\n);\n Anderson et al., Nucleic Acid Hybridization: A Practical Approach, Ch. 4 (IRL Press Limited\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules of the invention include DNA in both single-stranded and double-stranded form, as well as the RNA complement thereof. DNA includes, for example, cDNA, genomic DNA, synthetic DNA, DNA amplified by PCR, and combinations thereof. Genomic DNA may be isolated by conventional techniques, such as by using the cDNA of SEQ ID NO:1, or a suitable fragment thereof, as a probe. Genomic DNA encoding ActRIIB5 polypeptides is obtained from genomic libraries which are available for a number of species. Synthetic DNA is available from chemical synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotide fragments followed by assembly of the fragments to reconstitute part or all of the coding regions and flanking sequences. RNA may be obtained from procaryotic expression vectors which direct high-level synthesis of mRNA, such as vectors using T7 promoters and RNA polymerase. cDNA is obtained from libraries prepared from mRNA isolated from various tissues that express ActRIIB5. The DNA molecules of the invention include full length genes as well as polynucleotides and fragments thereof. The full length gene may also include sequences encoding the N-terminal signal sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides methods of producing and identifying ActRIIB5 polynucleotides. The well-known polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure may be employed to isolate and amplify a DNA sequence encoding a desired protein fragment. Oligonucleotides that define the desired termini of the DNA fragment are employed as 5' and 3' primers. The oligonucleotides may additionally contain recognition sites for restriction endonucleases, to facilitate insertion of the amplified DNA fragment into an expression vector. PCR techniques are described in\n Saiki et al., Science, 239:487 (1988\n); \nWu et al., Recombinant DNA Methodology, eds., Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, pp. 189-196 (1989\n); and \nInnis et al., PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications, eds., Academic Press, Inc. (1990\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect of the present invention, expression vectors containing the nucleic acid sequences are also provided, and host cells transformed with such vectors and methods of producing the ActRIIB5 polypeptides are also provided. The term \"expression vector\" refers to a plasmid, phage, virus or vector for expressing a polypeptide from a polynucleotide sequence. Vectors for the expression of ActRII5 polypeptides contain at a minimum sequences required for vector propagation and for expression of the cloned insert. An expression vector comprises a transcriptional unit comprising an assembly of (1) a genetic element or elements having a regulatory role in gene expression, for example, promoters or enhancers, (2) a sequence that encodes ActRIIB5 polypeptides to be transcribed into mRNA and translated into protein, and (3) appropriate transcription initiation and termination sequences. These sequences may further include a selection marker. Vectors suitable for expression in host cells are readily available and the nucleic acid molecules are inserted into the vectors using standard recombinant DNA techniques. Such vectors can include promoters which function in specific tissues, and viral vectors for the expression of ActRIIB5 in targeted human or animal cells. Some exemplary expression vectors suitable for expression of ActRIIB5 include, but are not limited to, pDSRa, (described in \n \nWO 90/14363\n \n, herein incorporated by reference) and its derivatives, containing ActRIIB5 polynucleotides, and pDC323 or pDC324 vectors (described in\n Bianchi et al, Biotech and Bioengineering, Vol 84(4):439-444 (2003\n)) containing ActRII5 polynucleotides, as well as additional suitable vectors known in the art or described below, are provided by the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe application further provides methods of making ActRIIB5 polypeptides and proteins. A variety of other expression/host systems may be utilized. These systems include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria transformed with recombinant bacteriophage, plasmid or cosmid DNA expression vectors; yeast transformed with yeast expression vectors; insect cell systems infected with virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus); plant cell systems transfected with virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with bacterial expression vectors (e.g., Ti or pBR322 plasmid); or animal cell systems. Mammalian cells useful in recombinant protein productions include but are not limited to VERO cells, HeLa cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, COS cells (such as COS-7), W138, BHK, HepG2, 3T3, RIN, MDCK, A549, PC12, K562 and 293 cells. Mammalian host cells may be preferred when post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and polypeptide processing are important for activity. Mammalian expression allows for the production of secreted or soluble polypeptides which may be recovered from the growth medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing an appropriate host-vector system, ActRIIB5 proteins and polypeptides are produced recombinantly by culturing a host cell transformed with an expression vector containing the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention under conditions allowing for production. Transformed cells can be used for long-term, high-yield protein production. Once such cells are transformed with vectors that contain selectable markers as well as the desired expression cassette, the cells can be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media before they are switched to selective media. The selectable marker is designed to allow growth and recovery of cells that successfully express the introduced sequences. Resistant clumps of stably transformed cells can be proliferated using tissue culture techniques appropriate to the cell line employed. An overview of expression of recombinant proteins is found in \nMethods of Enzymology, v. 185, Goeddell, D.V., ed., Academic Press (1990\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, such as in expression using procaryotic systems, the expressed polypeptides of this invention may need to be \"refolded\" and oxidized into a proper tertiary structure and disulfide linkages generated in order to be biologically active. Refolding can be accomplished using a number of procedures well known in the art. Such methods include, for example, exposing the solubilized polypeptide to a pH usually above 7 in the presence of a chaotropic agent. The selection of chaotrope is similar to the choices used for inclusion body solubilization, however a chaotrope is typically used at a lower concentration. Exemplary chaotropic agents are guanidine and urea. In most cases, the refolding/oxidation solution will also contain a reducing agent plus its oxidized form in a specific ratio to generate a particular redox potential which allows for disulfide shuffling to occur for the formation of cysteine bridges. Some commonly used redox couples include cysteine/cystamine, glutathione/dithiobisGSH, cupric chloride, dithiothreitol DTT/dithiane DTT, and 2-mercaptoethanol (bME)/dithio-bME. In many instances, a co-solvent may be used to increase the efficiency of the refolding. Commonly used cosolvents include glycerol, polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, and arginine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe proteins and polypeptides of the present can be synthesized in solution or on a solid support in accordance with conventional techniques. Various automatic synthesizers are commercially available and can be used in accordance with known protocols. See, for example, Stewart and Young (supra); \nTam et al., J Am Chem Soc, 105:6442, (1983\n); \nMerrifield, Science 232:341-347 (1986\n); \nBarany and Merrifield, The Peptides, Gross and Meienhofer, eds, Academic Press, New York, 1-284\n; \nBarany et al., Int J Pep Protein Res, 30:705\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is necessary to purify the proteins and polypeptides of the present invention. Protein purification techniques are well known to those of skill in the art. These techniques involve, at one level, the crude fractionation of the proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous fractions. Having separated the peptide polypeptides from other proteins, the peptide or polypeptide of interest can be further purified using chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques to achieve partial or complete purification (or purification to homogeneity). Analytical methods particularly suited to the preparation of polypeptides or the present invention are ion-exchange chromatography, exclusion chromatography; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; isoelectric focusing. A particularly efficient method of purifying peptides is fast protein liquid chromatography or even HPLC. The term \"isolated polypeptide\" or \"purified polypeptide\" as used herein, is intended to refer to a composition, isolatable from other components, wherein the polypeptide is purified to any degree relative to its naturally-obtainable state. A purified polypeptide therefore also refers to a polypeptide that is free from the environment in which it may naturally occur. Generally, \"purified\" will refer to a polypeptide composition that has been subjected to fractionation to remove various other components, and which composition substantially retains its expressed biological activity. Where the term \"substantially purified\" is used, this designation will refer to a peptide or polypeptide composition in which the polypeptide or peptide forms the major component of the composition, such as constituting about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95% or more of the proteins in the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious methods for quantifying the degree of purification of polypeptide will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. These include, for example, determining the specific binding activity of an active fraction, or assessing the amount of peptide or polypeptide within a fraction by SDS/PAGE analysis. A preferred method for assessing the purity of a polypeptide fraction is to calculate the binding activity of the fraction, to compare it to the binding activity of the initial extract, and to thus calculate the degree of purification, herein assessed by a \"-fold purification number.\" The actual units used to represent the amount of binding activity will, of course, be dependent upon the particular assay technique chosen to follow the purification and whether or not the polypeptide or peptide exhibits a detectable binding activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques suitable for use in purification will be well known to those of skill in the art. These include, for example, precipitation with ammonium sulphate, PEG, antibodies (immunoprecipitation) and the like or by heat denaturation, followed by centrifugation; chromatography steps such as affinity chromatography (e.g., Protein-A-Sepharose), ion exchange, gel filtration, reverse phase, hydroxylapatite and affinity chromatography; isoelectric focusing; gel electrophoresis; and combinations of these techniques. As is generally known in the art, it is believed that the order of conducting the various purification steps may be changed, or that certain steps may be omitted, and still result in a suitable method for the preparation of a substantially purified polypeptide.\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention further includes antibodies which specifically bind to the ActRIIB5 receptor polypeptides of the present invention. As used herein the term \"specifically binds\" refers to antibodies having a binding affinity (Ka) for ActRIIB5 polypeptides of 10\n6\n M\n-1\n or greater. As used herein, the term \"antibody\" refers to intact antibodies including polyclonal antibodies (see, for example\n Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Harlow and Lane (eds), Cold Spring Harbor Press, (1988\n)), and monoclonal antibodies (see, for example, \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. RE 32,011\n \n, \n \n4,902,614\n \n, \n \n4,543,439\n \n, and \n \n4,411,993\n \n, and \nMonoclonal Antibodies: A New Dimension in Biological Analysis, Plenum Press, Kennett, McKearn and Bechtol (eds.) (1980\n)). As used herein, the term \"antibody\" also refers to a fragment of an antibody such as F(ab), F(ab'), F(ab')\n2\n, Fv, Fc, and single chain antibodies which are produced by recombinant DNA techniques or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. The term \"antibody\" also refers to bispecific or bifunctional antibodies, which are an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments. (See\n Songsivilai et al, Clin. Exp. Immunol. 79:315-321 (1990\n), \nKostelny et al., J. Immunol.148:1547-1553 (1992\n)). As used herein the term \"antibody\" also refers to chimeric antibodies, that is, antibodies having a human constant antibody immunoglobin domain coupled to one or more non-human variable antibody immunoglobin domain, or fragments thereof (see, for example, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,595,898\n \n and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,693,493\n \n). Antibodies also refers to \"humanized\" antibodies (see, for example, \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567\n \n and \n \nWO 94/10332\n \n), minibodies (\n \nWO 94/09817\n \n), maxibodies, and antibodies produced by transgenic animals, in which a transgenic animal containing a proportion of the human antibody producing genes but deficient in the production of endogenous antibodies are capable of producing human antibodies (see, for example, \nMendez et al., Nature Genetics 15:146-156 (1997\n), and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,300,129\n \n). The term \"antibodies\" also includes multimeric antibodies, or a higher order complex of proteins such as heterdimeric antibodies, and anti-idiotypic antibodies. \"Antibodies\" also includes anti-idiotypic antibodies. The antibodies against ActRIIB5 can be used, for example, to identify and quantitate ActRIIB5 in vitro and in vivo.\n\n\n \n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions containing the ActRIIB5 polypeptides and proteins of the present invention are also provided. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of the polypeptide in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable materials, and physiologically acceptable formulation materials. The pharmaceutical composition may contain formulation materials for modifying, maintaining or preserving, for example, the pH, osmolarity, viscosity, clarity, color, isotonicity, odor, sterility, stability, rate of dissolution or release, adsorption or penetration of the composition. Suitable formulation materials include, but are not limited to, amino acids (such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine); antimicrobials; antioxidants (such as ascorbic acid, sodium sulfite or sodium hydrogen-sulfite); buffers (such as borate, bicarbonate, Tris-HCl, citrates, phosphates, other organic acids); bulking agents (such as mannitol or glycine), chelating agents (such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)); complexing agents (such as caffeine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, beta-cyclodextrin or hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin); fillers; monosaccharides; disaccharides and other carbohydrates (such as glucose, mannose, or dextrins); proteins (such as serum albumin, gelatin or immunoglobulins); coloring; flavoring and diluting agents; emulsifying agents; hydrophilic polymers (such as polyvinylpyrrolidone); low molecular weight polypeptides; salt-forming counterions (such as sodium); preservatives (such as benzalkonium chloride, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, thimerosal, phenethyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, chlorhexidine, sorbic acid or hydrogen peroxide); solvents (such as glycerin, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol); sugar alcohols (such as mannitol or sorbitol); suspending agents; surfactants or wetting agents (such as pluronics, PEG, sorbitan esters, polysorbates such as polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80, triton, tromethamine, lecithin, cholesterol, tyloxapal); stability enhancing agents (sucrose or sorbitol); tonicity enhancing agents (such as alkali metal halides (preferably sodium or potassium chloride, mannitol sorbitol); delivery vehicles; diluents; excipients and/or pharmaceutical adjuvants. \n(\n \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, A.R. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Company, 1990\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe optimal pharmaceutical composition will be determined by one skilled in the art depending upon, for example, the intended route of administration, delivery format, and desired dosage. See for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \nsupra.\n Such compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the polypeptide. For example, suitable compositions may be water for injection, physiological saline solution for parenteral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe primary vehicle or carrier in a pharmaceutical composition may be either aqueous or non-aqueous in nature. For example, a suitable vehicle or carrier may be water for injection, physiological saline solution or artificial cerebrospinal fluid, possibly supplemented with other materials common in compositions for parenteral administration. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles. Other exemplary pharmaceutical compositions comprise Tris buffer of about pH 7.0-8.5, or acetate buffer of about pH 4.0-5.5, which may further include sorbitol or a suitable substitute therefore. In one embodiment of the present invention, compositions may be prepared for storage by mixing the selected composition having the desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra) in the form of a lyophilized cake or an aqueous solution. Further, the therapeutic composition may be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipients such as sucrose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations can be delivered in a variety of methods, for example, by inhalation therapy, orally, or by injection. When parenteral administration is contemplated, the therapeutic compositions for use in this invention may be in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution comprising the desired polypeptide in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. A particularly suitable vehicle for parenteral injection is sterile distilled water in which a polypeptide is formulated as a sterile, isotonic solution, properly preserved. Yet another preparation can involve the formulation of the desired molecule with an agent, such as injectable microspheres, bio-erodible particles, polymeric compounds (polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid), beads, or liposomes, that provides for the controlled or sustained release of the product which may then be delivered via a depot injection. Hyaluronic acid may also be used, and this may have the effect of promoting sustained duration in the circulation. Other suitable means for the introduction of the desired molecule include implantable drug delivery devices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, pharmaceutical formulations suitable for injectable administration may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks' solution, ringer's solution, or physiologically buffered saline. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils, such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate, triglycerides, or liposomes. Non-lipid polycationic amino polymers may also be used for delivery. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents to increase the solubility of the compounds and allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition may be formulated for inhalation. Inhalation solutions may also be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery. In yet another embodiment, solutions may be nebulized. Pulmonary administration is further described in PCT Application No. \n \nPCT/US94/001875\n \n, which describes pulmonary delivery of chemically modified proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also contemplated that certain formulations may be administered orally. In one embodiment of the present invention, molecules that are administered in this fashion can be formulated with or without those carriers customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. For example, a capsule may be designed to release the active portion of the formulation at the point in the gastrointestinal tract when bioavailability is maximized and pre-systemic degradation is minimized. Additional agents can be included to facilitate absorption of the therapeutic molecule. Diluents, flavorings, low melting point waxes, vegetable oils, lubricants, suspending agents, tablet disintegrating agents, and binders may also be employed. Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can also be formulated using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art in dosages suitable for oral administration. Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical compositions to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, and the like, for ingestion by the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained through combining active compounds with solid excipient and processing the resultant mixture of granules (optionally, after grinding) to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable auxiliaries can be added, if desired. Suitable excipients include carbohydrate or protein fillers, such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, and sorbitol; starch from corn, wheat, rice, potato, or other plants; cellulose, such as methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, or sodium carboxymethylcellulose; gums, including arabic and tragacanth; and proteins, such as gelatin and collagen. If desired, disintegrating or solubilizing agents may be added, such as the crosslinked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, and alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Dragee cores may be used in conjunction with suitable coatings, such as concentrated sugar solutions, which may also contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for product identification or to characterize the quantity of active compound, i.e., dosage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical preparations that can be used orally also include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a coating, such as glycerol or sorbitol. Push-fit capsules can contain active ingredients mixed with fillers or binders, such as lactose or starches, lubricants, such as talc or magnesium stearate, and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid, or liquid polyethylene glycol with or without stabilizers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those skilled in the art, including formulations involving polypeptides in sustained- or controlled-delivery formulations. Techniques for formulating a variety of other sustained- or controlled-delivery means, such as liposome carriers, bio-erodible microparticles or porous beads and depot injections, are also known to those skilled in the art. See for example, \n \nPCT/US93/00829\n \n that describes controlled release of porous polymeric microparticles for the delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. Additional examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices may include polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (\n \nU.S. 3,773,919\n \n, \n \nEP 58,481\n \n), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (\nSidman et al., Biopolymers, 22:547-556 (1983\n), poly (2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (\nLanger et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res., 15:167-277, (1981\n); \nLanger et al., Chem. Tech.,12:98-105(1982\n)), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra) or poly-D(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (\n \nEP 133,988\n \n). Sustained-release compositions also include liposomes, which can be prepared by any of several methods known in the art. See e.g., \nEppstein et al., PNAS (USA), 82:3688 (1985\n); \n \nEP 36,676\n \n; \n \nEP 88,046\n \n; \n \nEP 143,949\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition to be used for in vivo administration typically must be sterile. This may be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. Where the composition is lyophilized, sterilization using this method may be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. The composition for parenteral administration may be stored in lyophilized form or in solution. In addition, parenteral compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the pharmaceutical composition has been formulated, it may be stored in sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or a dehydrated or lyophilized powder. Such formulations may be stored either in a ready-to-use form or in a form (e.g., lyophilized) requiring reconstitution prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the present invention is directed to kits for producing a single-dose administration unit. The kits may each contain both a first container having a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous formulation. Also included within the scope of this invention are kits containing single and multi-chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and lyosyringes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for treatment will thus vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the indication for which the polypeptide is being used, the route of administration, and the size (body weight, body surface or organ size) and condition (the age and general health) of the patient. Accordingly, the clinician may titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. A typical dosage may range from about 0.1mg/kg to up to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. Polypeptide compositions may be preferably injected or administered intravenously. Long-acting pharmaceutical compositions may be administered every 3 to 4 days, every week, or biweekly depending on the half-life and clearance rate of the particular formulation. The frequency of dosing will depend upon the pharmacokinetic parameters of the polypeptide in the formulation used. Typically, a composition is administered until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The composition may therefore be administered as a single dose, or as multiple doses (at the same or different concentrations/dosages) over time, or as a continuous infusion. Further refinement of the appropriate dosage is routinely made. Appropriate dosages may be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is in accord with known methods, e.g. orally, through injection by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intra-parenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular, intra-ocular, intraarterial, intraportal, intralesional routes, intramedullary, intrathecal, intraventricular, transdermal, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal; as well as intranasal, enteral, topical, sublingual, urethral, vaginal, or rectal means, by sustained release systems or by implantation devices. Where desired, the compositions may be administered by bolus injection or continuously by infusion, or by implantation device. Alternatively or additionally, the composition may be administered locally via implantation of a membrane, sponge, or another appropriate material on to which the desired molecule has been absorbed or encapsulated. Where an implantation device is used, the device may be implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery of the desired molecule may be via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or continuous administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, the ActRIIB5 polypeptides of the present invention can be delivered by implanting certain cells that have been genetically engineered, using methods such as those described herein, to express and secrete the polypeptide. Such cells may be animal or human cells, and may be autologous, heterologous, or xenogeneic. Optionally, the cells may be immortalized. In order to decrease the chance of an immunological response, the cells may be encapsulated to avoid infiltration of surrounding tissues. The encapsulation materials are typically biocompatible, semi-permeable polymeric enclosures or membranes that allow the release of the protein product(s) but prevent the destruction of the cells by the patient's immune system or by other detrimental factors from the surrounding tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActRIIB5 gene therapy in vivo is also envisioned wherein a nucleic acid molecule encoding ActRIIB5, or a variant or derivative of ActRIIB5 is introduced directly into the subject. For example, a nucleic acid sequence encoding an ActRIIB5 is introduced into target cells via local injection of a nucleic acid construct with or without an appropriate delivery vector, such as an adeno-associated virus vector. Alternative viral vectors include, but are not limited to, retroviruses, adenovirus, herpes simplex, virus and papilloma virus vectors. Physical transfer of the virus vector may be achieved in vivo by local injection of the desired nucleic acid construct or other appropriate delivery vector containing the desired nucleic acid sequence, liposome-mediated transfer, direct injection (naked DNA), or microparticle bombardment (gene-gun).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUses of ActRIIB5 Compositions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides compositions for reducing or neutralizing the amount or activity of myostatin, activin A, or GDF-11 in vivo and in vitro by contacting the proteins with an ActRIIB5 protein. The Examples below demonstrate that the ActRIIB5 proteins have a high affinity for myostatin, activin A, and GDF-11, and are capable of reducing and inhibiting the biological activities of myostatin, activin A and GDF-11. The Examples demonstrate that ActRIIB5 have a higher activity compared with ActRIIB-ECD as demonstrated by the IC\n50\n values in Example 3, and the biological response in animals is superior for the ActRIIB5 animals compared with the ActRIIB-ECD animals as demonstrated in Examples 5 and 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides reagents for treating myostatin-related and/or activin A related disorders in a subject in need thereof by administering an effective dosage of an ActRIIB5 composition to the subject. As used herein the term \"subject\" refers to any animal, such as mammals including humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides for the use of the ActRIIB proteins in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of muscle-wasting, metabolic, and activin A related disorders listed below. In another aspect, the present invention provides for the use of ActRIIB nucleic acids and vectors in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of muscle-wasting, metabolic, and activin A related disorders listed below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention have been shown to increase lean muscle mass as a percentage of body weight and decreases fat mass as percentage of body weight in animal models as shown in the Examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disorders that can be treated by an ActRIIB5 composition include but are not limited to various forms of muscle wasting, as well as metabolic disorders such as diabetes and related disorders, and bone degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis. Muscle wasting 23 disorders include dystrophies such as Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, progressive muscular dystrophy, Becker's type muscular dystrophy, Dejerine-Landouzy muscular dystrophy, Erb's muscular dystrophy, and infantile neuroaxonal muscular dystrophy. Additional muscle wasting disorders arise from chronic diseases or disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, congestive obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, AIDS, renal failure, organ atrophy, androgen deprivation, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOver-expression of myostatin may contribute to cachexia, a severe muscle and fat wasting syndrome. In one example, serum and intramuscular concentrations of myostatin-immunoreactive protein was found to be increased in men exhibiting AIDS-related muscle wasting and was inversely related to fat-free mass (\nGonzalez-Cadavid et al., PNAS USA 95: 14938-14943 (1998\n)). Myostatin levels have also been shown to increase in response to bums injuries, resulting in a catabolic muscle effect (\nLang et al, \n)). Additional conditions resulting in muscle wasting may arise from inactivity due to disability such as confinement in a wheelchair, prolonged bed rest due to stroke, illness, spinal chord injury, bone fracture or trauma, and muscular atrophy in a microgravity environment (space flight). For example, plasma myostatin immunoreactive protein was found to increase after prolonged bed rest (\nZachwieja et al. J Gravit Physiol. 6(2):11(1999\n). It was also found that the muscles of rats exposed to a microgravity environment during a space shuttle flight expressed an increased amount of myostatin compared with the muscles of rats which were not exposed (\nLalani et al., J.Endocrin 167 (3):417-28 (2000\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, age-related increases in fat to muscle ratios, and age-related muscular atrophy appear to be related to myostatin. For example, the average serum myostatin-immunoreactive protein increased with age in groups of young (19-35 yr old), middle-aged (36-75 yr old), and elderly (76-92 yr old) men and women, while the average muscle mass and fat-free mass declined with age in these groups (\nYarasheski et al. J Nutr Aging 6(5):343-8 (2002\n)). In addition, myostatin has now been found to be expressed at low levels in heart muscle and expression is upregulated after cardiomyocytes after infarct (\nSharma et al., J Cell Physiol. 180 (1):1-9 (1999\n)). Therefore, reducing myostatin levels in the heart muscle may improve recovery of heart muscle after infarct.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMyostatin also appears to influence metabolic \ndisorders including type\n 2 diabetes, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, and obesity. For example, lack of myostatin has been shown to improve the obese and diabetic phenotypes of two mouse models (Yen et al. supra). It has been shown in the Examples below that administering AAV-ActRIIB5 vectors increases the muscle to fat ratio in an animal, in particular for obese animal models. Therefore, decreasing fat composition by administering the compositions of the present invention will improve diabetes, obesity, and hyperglycemic conditions in animals. In addition the Examples below and \nFigure 4B\n demonstrates that compositions containing ActRIIB5 may decrease food intake in obese individuals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, increasing muscle mass by reducing myostatin levels may improve bone strength and reduce osteoporosis and other degenerative bone diseases. It has been found, for example, that myostatin-deficient mice showed increased mineral content and density of the mouse humerus and increased mineral content of both trabecular and cortical bone at the regions where the muscles attach, as well as increased muscle mass (\nHamrick et al. Calcif Tissue Int 71(1):63-8 (2002\n)). In addition, the ActIIBR compositions of the present invention can be used to treat the effects of androgen deprivation such as androgen deprivation therapy used for the treatment of prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides compositions for increasing muscle mass in food animals by administering an effective dosage of the ActRIIB5 proteins to the animal. Since the mature C-terminal myostatin polypeptide is identical in all species tested, ActRIIB5 proteins would be expected to be effective for increasing muscle mass and reducing fat in any agriculturally important species including cattle, chicken, turkeys, and pigs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ActRIIB5 proteins and compositions of the present invention also antagonizes the activity of activin A. Activin A is known to be expressed in certain types of cancers, particularly gonadal tumors such as ovarian carcinomas, and to cause severe cachexia. (\nCiprano et al. Endocrinol 141 (7):2319-27 (2000\n), \nShou et al., Endocrinol 138 (11):5000-5 (1997\n); \nCoerver et al, Mol Endocrinol 10(5):534-43 (1996\n); \nIto et al. British J Cancer 82(8):1415-20 (2000\n),\n Lambert-Messerlian, et al, Gynecologic Oncology 74 91):93-7 (1999\n). Example 4 below shows that expression of activin A in the animal models results in a severe cachexia. Expression of the ActRIIB5/Fc in the animals counters that cachexia, as shown in Examples 5 and 6. Overexpression of myostatin is also thought to contribute to cachexia, as described above. Therefore the compositions can be used to treat conditions related to activin A overexpression, as well as myostatin overexpression, such as cachexia from certain cancers and the treatment of certain gonadal type tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention may be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents to enhance their therapeutic effects or decrease potential side effects. These properties include increased activity, increased solubility, reduced degradation, increased half-life, reduced toxicity, and reduced immunogenicity. Thus the compositions of 25 the present invention are useful for extended treatment regimes. In addition, the properties of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the compounds of the invention are well balanced, thereby enhancing their utility for both in vitro and especially in vivo uses. Specifically, compounds of the invention have an appropriate degree of solubility in aqueous media that permits absorption and bioavailability in the body, while also having a degree of solubility in lipids that permits the compounds to traverse the cell membrane to a putative site of action, such as a particular muscle mass.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the ActRIIB5 proteins and polypeptides of the present invention are useful for detecting and quantitating myostatin, activin A, or GDF-11 in any number of assays. In general, the ActRIIB5 polypeptides of the present invention are useful as capture agents to bind and immobilize myostatin, activin A, or QDF-11 in a variety of assays, similar to those described, for example, in \nAsai, ed., Methods in Cell Biology, 37, Antibodies in Cell Biology, Academic Press, Inc., New York (1993\n). The polypeptides may be labeled in some manner or may react with a third molecule such as an antibody which is labeled to enable myostatin to be detected and quantitated. For example, a polypeptide or a third molecule can be modified with a detectable moiety, such as biotin, which can then be bound by a fourth molecule, such as enzyme-labeled streptavidin, or other proteins. (\nAkerstrom, J Immunol 135:2589 (1985\n);\n Chaubert, Mod Pathol 10:585 (1997\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention having been described, the following examples are offered by way of illustration, and not limitation.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample I: isolation of cDNA and expression in cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cDNA of the novel human activin type IIB receptor was isolated from a cDNA library of human testis origin (Clontech, Inc.) according to the following protocol. Primers for the N-terminal and the C-terminal of the human activin IIB receptor (SEQ ID NO: 4) were generated and PCR was performed using these primers against templates from human cDNA libraries. PCT was performed using the GC-RICH PCR System (Roche, cat #2140306). Both N and C terminal PCR products were digested with PvuII/EcoRI and subcloned into pcDNA3.1-HisA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Ca.) to make a full length clone. After sequencing a number of PCR products, a cDNA clone from the human testes cDNA library was identified as a novel N-terminal splice variant receptor. The polynucleotide sequence of this receptor, designated human activin type IIB5 receptor (ActRIIB5). The cDNA clone of this receptor was missing 152 nucleotide bases that correspond to the entire Exon-4 in the wild-type human activin type IIB receptor gene. The truncation of exon-4 in the splice variant resulted in the deletion of the amino acid sequence that spans the transmembrane region as well as in a frame shift leading to an early translational termination. The amino acid sequence of the splice variant receptor contains most of the extracellular domain, encoded by \n \n \nexons\n \n \n 1, 2 and 3 of the wild-type human activin type IIB receptor, and an additional tail region of 36 amino acids resulting from the frame shift. The amino acid sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2. The C terminal sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3. Due to the lack of transmembrane region, the ActRIIB5 encodes a soluble form of activin type IIB receptor. Transfection of the ActRBII5 cDNA in cells led to the expression of secreted, instead of membrane-bound, form of the receptor protein.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Expression of ActRIIB5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \ncDNA encoding ActRIIB5 was cloned into a mammalian pDC323 or pDC324 vectors (\nBianchi et al, Biotech and Bioengineering, Vol 84(4):439-444 (2003\n)) and expressed in a 293T cell line. To generate the Fc fusions, polynucleotides encoding the ActRIIB5 (SEQ ID NO:1) were cloned adjacent to polynucleotides encoding the (Gly)\n8\n linker sequence adjacent to polynucleotides encoding the human IgG1 Fc into a pDSRa vector (described in \n \nWO/9014363\n \n, herein incorporated by reference). Polynucleotides encoding ActRIIB-ECD (amino acids 1-124 of SEQ ID NO: 5) were cloned adjacent to polynucleotides encoding the human IgG1 Fc into a pDSRa vector (no linker). These constructs were transfected into a , stable CHO cell line. The soluble receptor-Fc fusions expressed were used for the side-by-side in vitro testing described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the in vivo animal experiments described in Example 4. below, the PCR products generated as described above were digested with NheI/SalI and subcloned into an AA V-Fc vector at the same sites. The AAV-Fc vector allows for transfer of the ActRIIB5 gene into an animal for expression in vivo.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 3: In vitro Activities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHuActRIIB5/Fc and HuActRIIB-ECD/Fc were generated as described above. The ability the ActRIIB5 receptor to inhibit the binding of each of the three ligands myostatin, activin A, and GDF-11 to the activin IIB receptor was tested using a cell based activity assay as described below.\n\n\n \n\n\nC2C12 Cell Based Activity Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA myostatin/activin/GDF-11-responsive reporter cell line was generated by transfection of C2C12 myoblast cells (ATCC No: CRL-1772) with a pMARE-luc construct. The pMARE-luc construct was made by cloning twelve repeats of the CAGA sequence, representing the myostatin/activin response elements (\nDennler et al. EMBO 17: 3091-3100 (1998\n)) into a pLuc-MCS reporter vector (Stratagene cat # 219087) upstream of the TATA box. The myoblast C2C12 cells naturally express myostatin/activin/GDF-11 receptor activin receptor IIB on its cell surface. When myostatin/activinA/GDF-11 binds the cell receptors, the Smad pathway is activated, and phosphorylated Smad binds to the response element (\nMacias-Silva et al. Cell 87:1215 (1996\n)), resulting in the expression of the luciferase gene. Luciferase activity is then measured using a commercial luciferase reporter assay kit (cat # E4550, Promega, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's protocol. A stable line of C2C12 cells that had been transfected with pMARE-luc (C2C12/pMARE clone #44) was used to measure activity according to the following procedure. Reporter cells were plated into 96 well cultures. Screening using dilutions of each type of soluble receptor was performed with the concentration fixed at 4 nM myostatin, 20 nM activin, and 4 nM GDF-11. Myostatin, activin and GDF-11 were each pre-incubated with the soluble receptors at several concentrations. Myostatin/activin/GDF-11 activity was measured by determining the luciferase activity in the treated cultures. The IC\n50\n values were for the determined for each soluble receptor as set out in Table 1 below.\n\n \nTABLE 1\n \n \nSoluble receptor protein\n \nactivin A neutralizing activity IC50 (nM) vs. 20 nM activin\n \n \n \nhuActRIIB5/Fc\n \n156.2\n \n \n \nhuActRIIB-ECD/Fc\n \n339.6\n \n \n \nsoluble receptor protein\n \nmyostatin neutralizing activity IC50 (nM) vs. 4 nM myostatin\n \n \n \nhuActRIIB5/Fc\n \n29.72\n \n \n \nhuActRIIB-ECD/Fc\n \n51.06\n \n \n \nsoluble receptor protein\n \nGDF-11 neutralizing activity IC50(nM) vs. 4 nM GDF-11\n \n \n \nhuActRIIB5/Fc\n \n90.6\n \n \n \nhuActRIIB-ECD/Fc\n \n89.88\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe table above shows that the soluble receptors can block myostatin signaling through its receptor but also activin A and GDF-11 signaling.\n\n\n \n\n\nBIAcore\n\n\n\n\n®\n\n\n\n\nassay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBlocking assays were carried out using immobilized human ActRIIB-ECD/Fc (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Mn.) on a CM5 chip (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) in the presence and absence of each of the two soluble receptors ActRIIB-ECD/Fc and ActRIIB5/Fc using the BIAcore\n®\n assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n100% myostatin binding signal was determined in the absence of receptor in solution. Various concentrations of the soluble receptors were diluted in sample buffer and incubated with 4 nM myostatin before being injected over the receptor surface. Since only free myostatin molecules were able to bind to the chip, a decreased binding response with increasing concentration of the receptors indicated binding of the receptors to myostatin in solution. Plotting the binding signal vs. concentration of soluble receptor, ActRIIB-ECD/Fc and ActRIIB5/Fc were calculated to have an EC\n50\n of approximately 18 nM and 7 nM respectively. The comparison between the two receptors is shown in \nFigure 1\n.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 4: Activin A over-expression in C57Bl/6 mice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo explore the postnatal role of activin in postnatal animals, activin A was overexpressed in mice using AAV mediated gene transfer. Aged-matched young adult (5-week-old) female C57B1/6 mice ( Charles River laboratories, Wilmington, Mass) were separated into two weight-balanced groups (n=6/group), which were subsequently injected via portal vein with either AAV-activin A or AAV-empty vector (control) at 1X10\n13\n pfu/mouse. The effects on body weight and body composition were analyzed. AAV-activin A transduced group showed a drastic reduction in body weight compared to the control mice transduced with AAV-empty vector. Within 2 weeks post AAV injection, the activin A-transduced group became so severely cachexic that their average body weight was only about ½ of that of empty vector-transduced control group. Necropsy revealed that AAV-activin A administration resulted a dramatic depletion by approximately 60% of lean body mass, skeletal muscle mass and fat mass. In addition, the activin-transduced mice also showed severe wasting of organs as indicated by significantly reduced organ weights such as liver and heart.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn additional experiment using a reduced amount (1X10\n12\n pfu/mouse) of AAV-Activin A virus was performed. The results showed a reduction in body weight and lean body mass resulting from activin-transduction but the effects were less dramatic as compared to the initial experiment using AAV-activin A at a higher dose (1X10\n13\n pfu/mouse). This demonstrates that the postnatal cachectic effect of activin A is dose-dependent.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 5: Anabolic Effect of AA V-ActRIIB5 in C57Bl/6 mice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAge-matched (5-week-old) C57Bl/6 male mice were divided into 5 groups (n=10 per group). AAV viral particles were packaged and titered prior to injection as follows: AAV-empty, AAV-activin A, AAV-ActRIIB5/Fc, AAV-ActRIIB-ECD/Fc, and AAV-ProMyo/Fc, wherein AAV-ProMyo stands for propeptide of myostatin. Each of the above AAV viruses were injected at 8x10\n12\n pfu / mouse except for AAV-activin A, of which an reduced amount of viral particles at 1x10\n12\n pfu /mouse was injected (n=10/group). The viral particles were injected via the portal vein. Body weights were determined every other day. The results are shown in \nFigure 2\n. AAV-ActRIIB5/Fc group and the AAV-ActRIIB-ECD/Fc group developed increased body weights compared to the AAV-Vector control group, as well as increased body weight compared to the AAV-ProMyo/Fc group. Comparing the two soluble receptor groups, the AAV-ActRIIB5/Fc group showed the greatest amount of increase in body weight gain. In contrast, the AAV-Vector control group showed a dramatic decrease in body weights in comparison to the AAV-Vector control group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt seven weeks post viral injection, body weight changes of individual groups were plotted as percentage of that of the control group (AAV-empty vector group). The AAV-ActRIIB5/Fc group showed the highest average body weight increase over control, approximately 25%, compared with 21% body weight increase for the ActRIIB-ECD/Fc group. The AAV-ActRIIB5/Fc group and the AAV-ActRIIB-ECD/Fc group showed body weight increases greater than that elicited by the ProMyo/Fc group of approximately 16%. In contrast, AAV-activin group had a significant drop in body weight by 19%. A comparison of these changes is shown in \nFigure 3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne-month post viral injection, lean body mass in each group of ten mice was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) by measuring body composition of live mice. At the same time, the body fat content of the mice in each group was determined. The measurements were taken on live mice using the EchoMRI 2003 (Echo Medical Systems, Houston, Tx). EchoMRI 2004 is a whole body composition analyzer that measures the masses of fat and lean tissues in live animals using NMR technology. The average percentage of lean mass and fat as percentage of body weight for each group of 10 mice is presented in Table 2 below.\n\n \nTABLE 2\n \n \n \n \n \nFat (% body weight)\n \nlean mass (% body weight)\n \n \n \n \nAAV-promyostatin/Fc\n \n9.11\n \n90.33\n \n \n \nAAV-Activin A\n \n10.21\n \n87.92\n \n \n \nAAV-empty\n \n11.76\n \n86.74\n \n \n \nAAV-ActRIIB5/Fc\n \n7.82\n \n91.05\n \n \n \nAAV-ActRIIB-ECD/Fc\n \n8.51\n \n90.18\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs can be seen from Table 2 above, the AAV-ActRIIB5/Fc group of mice showed the smallest percentage of body fat, and the largest percentage of lean mass for all of the groups after one month. This data shows that ActRIIB5/Fc is effective in enhancing body weight, lean body mass and decreasing fat mass in the animals tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a related experiment, the five groups of ten mice per group were tested for gripping strength using a Columbia Instruments meter, model 1027 dsm (Columbus, Ohio). The results were averaged for each group. The AAV-promyostatin/Fc group averaged a gripping strength compared with the AAV-empty control mice was about 21% for the promyostatin/Fc group, about 31 % for the ActRIIB-ECD/Fc group and about 33% for the ActRIIB5/Fc group of mice. The increase in gripping strength measured was about 46% for the promyostatin/Fc group, about 56% for the ActRIIIB-ECD/Fc group, and about 60% for the ActRIIB5/Fc group.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample VI: Changes in body weight and composition in Ay Obese mice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo groups of Ay Obese mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine) of 11 animals each (8 animals per group at the termination of the experiment) were injected with an AAV-empty vector and an AA V-ActRIIB5/Fc vector respectively. The viruses were injected at 8x10\n12\n pfu / mouse into the portal vein of each mouse. The mice were then monitored for changes in body weight, food intake, lean muscle mass and fat mass over a three month period post injection. Food intake was determined by weighing the remaining uneaten food in the mouse cage on a daily basis and calculating the weekly intake. The lean muscle mass and fat mass were determined by NMR as described above. The results of the experiments are shown in \nFigures 4\n and \n5\n. \nFigure 4A\n shows a decrease in body weight and \nFigure 4B\n shows a decrease in weekly food intake in the AAV-ActRIIB5/Fc mice compared with the control mice. \nFigure 5A\n shows increase in lean mass, as determined by NMR for the AAV-ActRIIB5/Fc, while \nFigure 5B\n shows a large decrease of fat mass for the AAV-ActRIIB5/Fc compared to the control mice, by approximately 50%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the termination of the experiment, the mice were sacrificed and examined for internal changes. The livers of the AAV-ActRIIB5/Fc treated mice were compared with those treated with AAV-empty control. Visual inspection of the livers of the AAV-empty treated mice and the AAV-ActRIIB5/Fc treated mice showed that the livers of the control AAV-empty mice contained fat deposits within the livers, whereas the AAV-ActRIIB5/Fc treated mice were free of fat deposits. Therefore, the expression of the ActRIIB5/Fc in the Ay mice corrected the fatty livers which characterize the Ay obese mice, as well as caused a decrease in overall body weight, a decrease in amount of food consumed, an increase in lean muscle mass and large decrease in fat mass.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein, which are intended as single illustrations of individual aspects of the invention, and functionally equivalent methods and components are within the scope of the invention.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates generally to novel compounds that are selective inhibitors of PI3Kδ, and are useful for treating and/or preventing conditions associated with aberrant proliferation of hematopoietic cells and various conditions characterized by inflammation. More particularly, the invention relates to compositions and methods for treating and/or preventing certain cancers, especially hematologic cancers such as leukemia, as well as various inflammatory and immune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis and asthma.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCell signaling via 3'-phosphorylated phosphoinositides has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, \ne.g\n., malignant transformation, growth factor signaling, inflammation, and immunity (see \nRameh, et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1999) 274:8347-8350\n for a review). The enzymes responsible for generating these phosphorylated signaling products, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase; PI3K), were originally identified as an activity associated with viral oncoproteins and growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its phosphorylated derivatives at the 3'-hydroxyl of the inositol ring (\nPanayotou, et al., Trends Cell Biol. (1992) 2:358-360\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPresently, three classes of PI 3-kinase (PI3K) enzymes are distinguished, based on their substrate specificities. Class I PI3K's can phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate (PIP2) to produce phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PIP), phosphatidylinositol-3,4-diphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate, respectively. Class II PI3K's phosphorylate PI and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate, whereas Class III PI3K's can only phosphorylate PI.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe initial purification and molecular cloning of PI 3-kinase revealed that it was a heterodimer consisting of p85 and p110 subunits (\nOtsu, et al., Cell (1991) 65:91-104\n; \nHiles, et al., Cell (1992) 70:419-429\n). Since then, four distinct Class I PI3K's have been identified, designated PI3Kα, β, γ, and δ, each consisting of a distinct 110 kDa catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit. More specifically, three of the catalytic subunits, \ni.e\n., p110α, p110β, and p110δ, each interact with the same regulatory subunit, p85; whereas p110γ interacts with a distinct regulatory subunit, p101. As described below, the patterns of expression of each of these PI3K's in human cells and tissues are also distinct.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdentification of the p110δ isoform of PI 3-kinase is described in \nChantry, et al., J Biol Chem (1997) 272:19236-19241\n. It was observed that the human p110δ isoform is expressed in a tissue-restricted fashion. It is expressed at high levels in lymphocytes and lymphoid tissues, suggesting that the protein might play a role in PI 3-kinase-mediated signaling in the immune system. Details concerning the p110δ isoform can be found in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,858,753\n \n; \n \n5,822,910\n \n; and \n \n5,985,589\n \n. See also, \nVanhaesebroeck, et al., Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1997) 94:4330-4335\n, and published \n \nPCT application WO 97/46688\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe delta (δ) isoform of PI3K is primarily expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin; consequently, selective inhibitors of this isoform are expected to primarily affect hematopoietic cells. Such cells are central to the various functions of the blood, and consequently they are critically involved in disorders characterized by inflammation and immune responses as well as disorders of the blood and cardiovascular system. Selective inhibitors are therefore expected to be useful for treatment of such disorders with minimal effect on other systems and processes mediated by other isoforms of PI3K. Indeed, selective inhibitors of PI3Kδ have been demonstrated in animal models to reduce allergic inflammation of airways and hyperresponsiveness in an animal model for asthma. \nLee, K. S., et al., FASEB Journal (2006) 20:455-465\n. Selective PI3Kδ inhibitors have also been shown to inhibit proliferation of aberrant leukocytes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), without affecting proliferation of normal hematopoietic cells. \nSujobert, P., et al., Blood (2005) 106:1063-1066\n. The selectivity for the delta isoform over other isoforms, especially the alpha, beta and gamma isoforms, is thus an important aspect of providing a compound that is useful to treat disorders associated with excessive accumulation, activity or production of hematopoietic cells, without preventing the function and/or proliferation of normal hematopoietic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelective inhibitors of PI3Kδ are disclosed, for example, in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 6,518,277\n \n; \n \n6,667,300\n \n; \n \n6,949,535\n \n; and \n \n6,800,620\n \n, and in published U.S. Patent Application \n \nUS 2006/0106038\n \n and \n \nPCT application WO 2005/113554\n \n. However, a need remains for additional therapeutic agents useful to treat proliferative disorders, such as cancer, and excessive or destructive immune reactions, such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and lupus. The present invention provides novel compounds that are potent inhibitors of PI3Kδ, and are highly selective for the delta isoform and much less active against other isoforms of PI3K. These compounds are useful for the treatment of disorders associated with excessive activity, accumulation or production of hematopoietic cells, especially lymphocytes and leukocytes, including lymphomas, leukemias, and excessive immune response disorders.\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides novel compounds that selectively or specifically inhibit PI3Kδ activity, and are thus useful both therapeutically and prophylactically, for the treatment of disorders wherein a subject experiences excessive activity, accumulation, or production of cells that express PI3Kδ. The invention includes compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of administering the compounds and compositions for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, inflammation, autoimmune disorders, allergic reactions, and cardiovascular disease.

In one aspect, the method involves administering an amount of a PI3Kδ selective inhibitor of formula (1) that is effective to inhibit PI3Kδ activity of hematopoietic cells. In another aspect, the PI3Kδ selective inhibitor is administered in an amount effective to inhibit Akt phosphorylation in hematopoietic cells. In an additional aspect, the PI3Kδ selective inhibitor is administered in an amount effective to inhibit FOXO3a phosphorylation in hematopoietic cells. In a further aspect, the PI3Kδ selective inhibitor is administered in an amount effective to inhibit GAB 1 phosphorylation in hematopoietic cells. In a further aspect, the PI3Kδ selective inhibitor is administered in an amount effective to inhibit GAB2 phosphorylation in hematopoietic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the methods are carried out \nex vivo,\n by contacting a PI3Kδ with a compound of formula (1). In another aspect, the methods are carried out \nin vivo,\n by administration of a compound of formula (1) or a composition containing a compound of formula (1) to a subject diagnosed as having a condition associated with undesired proliferation or activity or accumulation of a hematopoietic cell type that expresses PI3Kδ. The methods may generally be used to treat any indication involving aberrant proliferation of lymphoid and/or myeloid progenitor cells. In one aspect, the indication can be acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute myeloid leukemia; chronic lymphocytic leukemia; chronic myelogenous leukemia; hairy cell leukemia; polycythemia vera; chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis; essential thrombocythemia; refractory anemia; refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts; refractory anemia with excess blasts; refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation; Hodgkin's lymphoma; B-cell lymphoma; Burkitt's lymphoma; diffuse cell lymphoma; follicular lymphoma; immunoblastic large cell lymphoma; lymphoblastic lymphoma; mantle cell lymphoma; mycosis fungoides; post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder; small non-cleaved cell lymphoma; T-cell lymphoma; or, plasma cell neoplasms. The methods are particularly effective when the PI3K pathway is constitutively activated in the hematopoietic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods may further include administering a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor. In one aspect of this embodiment, the mTOR inhibitor is selected from rapamycin, FK506, cyclosporine A (CsA), and everolimus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention provides methods for treating and/or preventing leukemia by selectively inhibiting phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) activity in leukemic cells. In one aspect, the methods include administering an amount of a PI3Kδ selective inhibitor effective to inhibit PI3Kδ activity of leukemic cells. In another aspect, a PI3Kδ selective inhibitor is administered in an amount effective to inhibit Akt phosphorylation in leukemic cells. In a further aspect, a P13KS selective inhibitor is administered in an amount effective to inhibit FOXO3a phosphorylation in leukemic cells. In a further aspect, a PI3Kδ selective inhibitor is administered in an amount effective to inhibit GAB1 phosphorylation in leukemic cells. In a further aspect, a PI3Kδ selective inhibitor is administered in an amount effective to inhibit GAB2 phosphorylation in leukemic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPI 3-kinase also appears to be involved in a number of aspects of leukocyte activation. A p85-associated PI 3-kinase activity has been shown to physically associate with the cytoplasmic domain of CD28, which is an important costimulatory molecule for the activation of T-cells in response to antigen (\nPages, et al., Nature (1994) 369:327-329\n; \nRudd, Immunity (1996) 4:527-534\n). Activation of T cells through CD28 lowers the threshold for activation by antigen and increases the magnitude and duration of the proliferative response. These effects are linked to increases in the transcription of a number of genes including interleukin-2 (IL2), an important T cell growth factor (\nFraser, et. al., Science (1991) 251:313-316\n). Mutation of CD28 such that it can no longer interact with PI 3-kinase leads to a failure to initiate IL2 production, suggesting a critical role for PI 3-kinase in T cell activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are also useful for disrupting leukocyte function. Thus the invention also provides a method for disrupting leukocyte function by contacting leukocytes with a compound that selectively inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) activity in the leukocytes. According to the method, the leukocytes can be neutrophils, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, or basophils.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in cases in which the leukocytes are neutrophils, the method can include disrupting at least one neutrophil function such as stimulated superoxide release, stimulated exocytosis, or chemotactic migration. Preferably, the method does not substantially disrupt bacterial phagocytosis or bacterial killing by the neutrophils. In cases wherein the leukocytes are B lymphocytes, the method can include disrupting proliferation of the B lymphocytes or antibody production by the B lymphocytes. In cases wherein the leukocytes are T lymphocytes, the method can involve disrupting proliferation of the T lymphocytes. In cases wherein the leukocytes are basophils, the method can include disrupting histamine release by the basophils.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPI3Kδ is also involved in the accumulation of neutrophils in inflamed tissues, and a selective inhibitor of PI3Kδ blocks that effect in an animal model using lipopolysaccharide to induce inflammation in the trachea. \nPuri, K. L., Curr. Enz. Inhib. (2006) 2:147-161\n. Furthermore, a selective PI3Kδ inhibitor also inhibited allergic responses in an animal model. \nId\n. In addition, the selective inhibitor demonstrated anti-hypertensive activity in an animal model. \nId\n. Thus selective inhibitors of PI3Kδ are known to be useful to treat a variety of medical conditions, and the selective PI3Kδ inhibitors of the invention are useful to treat inflammation by reducing accumulation of neutrophils in affected tissues, and to reduce the severity of allergic reactions, as well as to treat hypertension.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"alkyl\" is defined as straight chained and/or branched hydrocarbon groups containing the indicated number of carbon atoms and an open valence by which the alkyl group is attached to a base molecule; typical examples include methyl, ethyl, and straight chain and branched propyl and butyl groups. The hydrocarbon group can contain up to 16 carbon atoms, unless otherwise specified, and often contain one to eight carbon atoms. The term \"alkyl\" includes cycloalkyl and \"bridged alkyl,\" \ni.e.,\n a C6-C16 bicyclic or polycyclic hydrocarbon group, for example, norbornyl, adamantyl, bicyclo[2.2.2]octyl, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptyl, bicyclo[3.2.1]octyl, or decahydronaphthyl. The term \"cycloalkyl\" is defined as a cyclic C3-C8 hydrocarbon group, \ne.g\n., cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclohexyl, and cyclopentyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"alkenyl\" is defined identically as \"alkyl,\" except the alkenyl group contains at least one carbon-carbon double bond, and as a result, the minimum size for an alkenyl group is C2. \"Alkynyl\" is defined similarly, except that an alkynyl group contains at least one carbon-carbon triple bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Cycloalkenyl\" is defined similarly to cycloalkyl, except at least one carbon-carbon double bond is present in the ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"alkylene\" is defined as an alkyl group having a second open valence to which another group is attached, \ni.e.,\n an alkylene must connect two other substructures. For example, the term \"aryl-C1-C3-alkylene\" refers to an alkylene group containing one to three carbon atoms, and substituted at one valence with an aryl group, which leaves one remaining valence of the alkylene portion of the group as the point at which it is connected to a base molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"heteroalkyl\", \"heteroalkenyl\", \"heteroalkynyl\", and \"heteroalkylene\" as used herein are defined similarly to the terms alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and alkylene, except that the 'hetero' forms include at least one heteroatom selected from N, O and S as a replacement for one of the carbons of the corresponding alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or alkylene moiety. In these heteroforms, S can be further oxidized to S=O or -SO\n2\n-, \ni.e\n., it can have one or more =O substituents. These groups include at least one carbon atom, and are typically linked to a base molecule through carbon rather than by the heteroatom. Examples of heteroalkyl include methoxymethyl and dimethylaminoethyl, for example, and -CH\n2\n-SO\n2\n-CH\n2\n- is an example of a heteroalkylene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"halo\" or \"halogen\" is defined herein to include fluorine, bromine, chlorine, and iodine. Frequently, fluoro or chloro is preferred in the compounds of formula (1) and (2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"aryl,\" alone or in combination, is defined herein as a monocyclic or polycyclic aromatic group, \ne.g.,\n phenyl or naphthyl. Unless otherwise indicated, an \"aryl\" group can be unsubstituted or substituted, for example, with one or more, and in particular one to three substituents. Preferred substituents for the aryl groups of the invention include halo, alkyl, phenyl, hydroxyalkyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkyl, haloalkyl, nitro, and amino. Exemplary aryl groups include phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, chlorophenyl, fluorophenyl, aminophenyl, methylphenyl, methoxyphenyl, trifluoromethylphenyl, nitrophenyl, carboxyphenyl, and the like. Fluoro, chloro, CF\n3\n, CN, methyl, methoxy, dimethylamino, amino, and amine-substituted alkyl and heteroalkyl groups are typical examples suitable as substituents for an aryl ring, whether it is a single ring or is fused to another aryl, nonaryl, or heteroaryl ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"heteroaryl\" is defined herein as a monocyclic or bicyclic ring system containing one or two aromatic rings and containing at least one nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atom as a ring member of an aromatic ring, and which can be unsubstituted or substituted, for example, with one or more, and in particular one to three, substituents, like halo, alkyl, hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkyl, haloalkyl, nitro, and amino. F, Cl, NH\n2\n, MeNH (methylamine), OMe, Me, and CF\n3\n as well as amine-substituted alkyl or heteroalkyl groups are often preferred substituents for the heteroaryl groups of the invention. Examples of heteroaryl groups include thienyl, furyl, pyridyl, oxazolyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, indolyl, triazolyl, isothiazolyl, isoxazolyl, imidazolyl, benzothiazolyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, thiazolyl, and thiadiazolyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Pharmaceutically acceptable salts\" refer to any salt that is physiologically acceptable insofar as it is compatible with other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Some specific preferred examples are: acetate, trifluoroacetate, hydrochloride, methanesulfonate, succinate, malonate, maleate, hydrobromide, sulfate, citrate, tartrate, glycolate, and oxalate salts, which may be formed when the compound includes a basic (protonatable) feature. Similarly, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts include base addition products when the compound of the invention includes an acidic (de-protonatable) feature. Non-limiting examples of counterions for the deprotonated compounds of the invention include sodium, magnesium, calcium, ammonium, potassium, lithium, zinc, and similar cations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Inflammatory disorder\" as used herein can refer to any disease, disorder, or syndrome in which an excessive or unregulated inflammatory response leads to excessive inflammatory symptoms, host tissue damage, or loss of tissue function. \"Inflammatory disorder\" also refers to a pathological state mediated by influx of leukocytes and/or neutrophil chemotaxis. These disorders include, but are not limited to, conditions wherein excessive immune activity occurs, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), asthma, and allergies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Inflammation\" as used herein refers to a localized, protective response elicited by injury or destruction of tissues, which serves to destroy, dilute, or wall off (sequester) both the injurious agent and the injured tissue. Inflammation is notably associated with influx of leukocytes and/or neutrophil chemotaxis. Inflammation can result from infection with pathogenic organisms and viruses and from noninfectious means such as trauma or reperfusion following myocardial infarction or stroke, immune response to foreign antigen, and autoimmune responses. Accordingly, inflammatory disorders amenable to the invention encompass disorders associated with reactions of the specific defense system as well as with reactions of the nonspecific defense system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"specific defense system\" refers to the component of the immune system that reacts to the presence of specific antigens. Examples of inflammation resulting from a response of the specific defense system include the classical response to foreign antigens, autoimmune diseases, and delayed type hypersensitivity response mediated by T-cells. Chronic inflammatory diseases, the rejection of solid transplanted tissue and organs, \ne.g\n., kidney and bone marrow transplants, and graft versus host disease (GVHD), are further examples of inflammatory reactions of the specific defense system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"nonspecific defense system\" as used herein refers to inflammatory disorders that are mediated by leukocytes that are incapable of immunological memory (\ne.g\n., granulocytes, and macrophages). Examples of inflammation that result, at least in part, from a reaction of the nonspecific defense system include inflammation associated with conditions such as adult (acute) respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ injury syndromes; reperfusion injury; acute glomerulonephritis; reactive arthritis; dermatoses with acute inflammatory components; acute purulent meningitis or other central nervous system inflammatory disorders such as stroke; thermal injury; inflammatory bowel disease; granulocyte transfusion associated syndromes; and cytokine-induced toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Selectively inhibits\" as used herein refers to a compound that has a greater inhibitory activity against one isoform of PI3K, usually the delta isoform, than it has against at least one of the other isoforms. In the methods of the invention wherein a selective PI3Kδ inhibitor is employed, it is preferred that the compound be at least about 10-fold selective for inhibition of PI3Kδ relative to at least one of the other Type I PI3K isoforms (alpha, beta and gamma) in a cell-based assay. More preferably, the compound is at least about 20-fold selective for inhibition of PI3Kδ relative to at least one of the other Type I PI3K isoforms in a cell-based assay. Still more preferably, the compound is at least about 50-fold more active for inhibition of PI3Kδ relative to other Type I PI3K isoforms in a biochemical assay. A PI3Kδ selective inhibitor compound is therefore more selective for PI3Kδ than conventional PI3K inhibitors such as wortmannin and LY294002, which are \"nonselective PI3K inhibitors.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"aberrant proliferation\" means cell proliferation that deviates from the normal, proper, or expected course. For example, aberrant cell proliferation may include inappropriate proliferation of cells whose DNA or other cellular components have become damaged or defective. Aberrant cell proliferation may include cell proliferation whose characteristics are associated with an indication caused by, mediated by, or resulting in inappropriately high levels of cell division, inappropriately low levels of apoptosis, or both. Such indications may be characterized, for example, by single or multiple local abnormal proliferations of cells, groups of cells, or tissue(s), whether cancerous or non-cancerous, benign or malignant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"hematopoietic cells\" generally refers to blood cells including but not limited to lymphoid progenitor cells, myeloid progenitor cells, natural killer cells, T cells, B cells, plasma cells, erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes such as neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"amount effective\" or \"effective amount\" means a dosage sufficient to produce a desired or stated effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Autoimmune disease\" as used herein refers to any of a group of disorders in which tissue injury is associated with humoral or cell-mediated responses to the body's own constituents.

Exemplary compounds include (3a) and (3b) for which comparative activity data is provided in Table I (relative to reference compounds (4a) and (4b)):\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe S-enantiomers of these compounds are particularly preferred embodiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention, in a compound of formula (1) or (2), Het is a purine that is linked to L at either position 9 (N-9 of the purine) or position 6 (C-6 of the purine).

Among the mammalian animals that can be treated are, for example, companion animals (pets), including dogs and cats; farm animals, including cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, and goats; laboratory animals, including rats, mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates, and zoo specimens. Non-mammalian animals include, for example, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs previously described, the term \"PI3Kδ selective inhibitor\" generally refers to a compound that inhibits the activity of the PI3Kδ isozyme more effectively than other isozymes of the PI3K family. The relative efficacies of compounds as inhibitors of an enzyme activity (or other biological activity) can be established by determining the concentrations at which each compound inhibits the activity to a predefined extent and then comparing the results. Typically, the preferred determination is the concentration that inhibits 50% of the activity in a biochemical assay, i.e., the 50% inhibitory concentration or \"TC\n50\n\"- IC\n50\n determinations can be accomplished using conventional techniques known in the art. In general, an IC\n50\n can be determined by measuring the activity of a given enzyme in the presence of a range of concentrations of the inhibitor under study. The experimentally obtained values of enzyme activity then are plotted against the inhibitor concentrations used. The concentration of the inhibitor that shows 50% enzyme activity (as compared to the activity in the absence of any inhibitor) is taken as the IC\n50\n value. Analogously, other inhibitory concentrations can be defined through appropriate determinations of activity. For example, in some settings it can be desirable to establish a 90% inhibitory concentration, \ni.e\n., IC\n90\n, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, a PI3Kδ selective inhibitor alternatively can be understood to refer to a compound that exhibits a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC\n50\n) with respect to PI3Kδ that is at least 10-fold, in another aspect at least 20-fold, and in another aspect at least 30-fold, lower than the IC\n50\n value with respect to any or all of the other Class I PI3K family members. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the term PI3Kδ selective inhibitor can be understood to refer to a compound that exhibits an IC\n50\n with respect to PI3Kδ that is at least 50-fold, in another aspect at least 100-fold, in an additional aspect at least 200-fold, and in yet another aspect at least 500-fold, lower than the IC\n50\n with respect to any or all of the other PI3K Class I family members. A PI3Kδ selective inhibitor is typically administered in an amount such that it selectively inhibits PI3Kδ activity, as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods of the invention may be applied to cell populations \nin vivo\n or \nex vivo\n. \"\nIn vivo\n\" means within a living individual, as within an animal or human. In this context, the methods of the invention may be used therapeutically in an individual, as described \ninfra.\n The methods may also be used prophylactically including but not limited to when certain risk factors associated with a given indication treatable by the methods of the invention are present, particularly when two or more such risk factors are present. Many such risk factors are related to an individual's risk of relapse. Individuals having a high risk of relapse include but are not limited to individuals having chromosomal abnormalities involving chromosomes 3, 5, and/or 7. Other risk factors include but are not limited to the following: having a close relative who has been diagnosed with an indication involving aberrant proliferation of hematopoietic cells; having Down's syndrome or other disease caused by abnormal chromosomes; repeated or substantial exposure to benzene and/or other organic solvents; exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation; having received treatments comprising certain chemotherapeutic agents; exposure to diagnostic X-rays during pregnancy; infection with human T-cell leukemia virus; and, cigarette smoking and/or substantial exposure to smoke. Additional risk factors that may indicate that prophylactic treatment is warranted are known in the art and/or may be readily determined by the attending physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"\nEx vivo\n\" means outside of a living individual. Examples of \nex vivo\n cell populations include \nin vitro\n cell cultures and biological samples including but not limited to fluid or tissue samples obtained from individuals. Such samples may be obtained by methods well known in the art. Exemplary biological fluid samples include blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, saliva. Exemplary tissue samples include tumors and biopsies thereof. In this context, the invention may be used for a variety of purposes, including therapeutic and experimental purposes. For example, the invention may be used \nex vivo\n to determine the optimal schedule and/or dosing of administration of a PI3Kδ selective inhibitor for a given indication, cell type, individual, and other parameters. Information gleaned from such use may be used for experimental purposes or in the clinic to set protocols for \nin vivo\n treatment. Other \nex vivo\n uses for which the invention may be suited are described below or will become apparent to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPI3Kδ is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells; consequently, the direct effects of selective inhibitors of PI3Kδ are most apparent in hematopoietic cells. Hematopoietic cells typically differentiate into either lymphoid progenitor cells or myeloid progenitor cells, both of which ultimately differentiate into various mature cell types including but not limited to leukocytes. Aberrant proliferation of hematopoietic cells of one type often interferes with the production or survival of other hematopoietic cell types, which can result in compromised immunity, anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia. The methods of the invention treat and/or prevent aberrant proliferation of hematopoietic cells by inhibiting aberrant proliferation of hematopoietic cells. As a result, they may also ameliorate the symptoms and secondary conditions that result from a primary effect such as excessive system or localized levels of leukocytes or lymphocytes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious disease states, disorders, and conditions (hereafter, indications) involving aberrant proliferation of hematopoietic cells (including excessive production of lymphoid progenitor cell-derived cells and/or myeloid progenitor cell-derived cells) include but are not limited to leukemias, lymphomas, myeloproliferative disorders, myelodysplastic syndromes, and plasma cell neoplasms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides methods for treating and/or preventing aberrant proliferation of hematopoietic cells comprising selectively inhibiting phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) activity in hematopoietic cells, using a compound of formula (1) or formula (2). Thus, in one aspect, the methods comprise administering an amount of a PI3Kδ selective inhibitor effective to inhibit PI3Kδ activity in hematopoietic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods of the invention may generally be used to treat and/or prevent indications involving aberrant proliferation of hematopoietic cells. Accordingly, the methods may be used to treat and/or prevent indications involving aberrant proliferation of lymphoid and/or myeloid progenitor cells including but not limited to leukemias such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia; chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia; myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera, chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, and essential thrombocythemia; myelodysplastic syndromes such as refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts, and refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation; lymphomas such as Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas such as B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, diffuse cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, immunoblastic large cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, mycosis fungoides, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, small non-cleaved cell lymphoma, and T-cell lymphoma; and, plasma cell neoplasms such as myelomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides methods for treating and/or preventing leukemia comprising selectively inhibiting phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) activity in leukemic cells. In one aspect of this embodiment, the methods comprise administering an amount of a PI3Kδ selective inhibitor effective to inhibit PI3Kδ activity of hematopoietic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"leukemia\" generally refers to cancers that are characterized by an uncontrolled increase in the number of at least one leukocyte and/or leukocyte precursor in the blood and/or bone marrow. Leukemias including but not limited to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); acute myeloid leukemia (AML); chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML); and, hairy cell leukemia are contemplated. \"Leukemic cells\" typically comprise cells of the aforementioned leukemias.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PI3K pathway is constitutively activated in the aberrantly proliferating hematopoietic cells. In one aspect of this embodiment, a higher level of phosphorylated Akt protein is present in untreated aberrantly proliferating hematopoietic cells relative to normal hematopoietic cells (\ni.e\n., non-aberrantly proliferating hematopoietic cells). In an additional aspect, a higher level of phosphorylated FOXO3a protein is present in untreated hematopoietic cells, and/or a higher level of phosphorylated GAB 1 protein or phosphorylated GAB 2 protein is present in untreated hematopoietic cells, in each instance relative to normal hematopoietic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one aspect, the PI3Kδ selective inhibitor is administered in an amount effective to inhibit Akt phosphorylation in aberrantly proliferating hematopoietic cells. In another aspect, the PI3Kδ selective inhibitor is administered in an amount effective to inhibit FOXO3a phosphorylation in aberrantly proliferating hematopoietic cells. In a further aspect, the PI3Kδ selective inhibitor is administered in an amount effective to inhibit GAB1 phosphorylation and/or GAB2 phosphorylation in aberrantly proliferating hematopoietic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimal models of some of the foregoing indications involving aberrant proliferation of hematopoietic cells treatable by selective inhibitors of PI3Kδ, such as the compounds of the invention, include, for example: non-obese diabetic-severe combined immune deficient (NOD/scid) mice injected with human ALL cells (ALL model); athymic (rnu/rnu) nude rats injected with human ALL cells (\ne.g\n., HPB-ALL cells) (ALL model); NOD/scid mice injected with human CML cells (CML model); inbred Sprague-Dawley/Charles University Biology (SD/Cub) rats (spontaneous T-cell lymphoma/leukemia model); Emu-immediate-early response gene X-1 (IEX-1) mice (T-cell lymphoma model); rabbits injected with cynomogulus-Epstein Barr virus (T-cell lymphoma model); rabbits injected with Herpes virus papio (T-cell lymphoma model); transgenic mice expressing p210bcr/ab1 (founder mice, ALL model; progeny mice, CML model); NOD/scid/gammac null (NOG) mice injected with U266 cells (multiple myeloma model); and, C57B1/KaLwRij mice injected with ST33 cells (multiple myeloma model).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAberrant cell proliferation is cell proliferation that deviates from the normal, proper, or expected course. Aberrant cell proliferation is the hallmark of cancer. Cancers can generally be divided into solid tumors affecting organs and/or connective tissues (including but not limited to bone and cartilage) and hematological malignancies that arise from hematopoietic cells. Hematopoietic cells typically differentiate into either lymphoid progenitor cells or myeloid progenitor cells, both of which ultimately differentiate into various mature cell types including but not limited to leukocytes. Lymphoid progenitor cell-derived cells include but are not limited to natural killer cells, T cells, B cells, and plasma cells. Myeloid progenitor cell-derived cells include but are not limited to erythrocytes (red blood cells), megakaryocytes (platelet producing cells), monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes such as neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. Because the aforementioned leukocytes are integral components of the body's immune system, aberrant proliferation of hematopoietic cells can impair an individual's ability to fight infection. Additionally, aberrant proliferation of hematopoietic cells of one type often interferes with the production or survival of other hematopoietic cell types, which can result in anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Thus the inhibition of aberrant proliferation of hematopoietic cells is advantageous for the treatment of other conditions that may be associated with a hematopoietic cell cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLeukemias are cancers that are characterized by an uncontrolled increase in the number of at least one type of leukocyte and/or leukocyte precursor in the blood and/or bone marrow. Leukemias are generally classified as either acute or chronic, which correlates with both the tempo of the clinical course and the degree of leukocyte differentiation. In acute leukemias, the involved cell line (usually referred to as blast cells) shows little or no differentiation. In chronic leukemias, on the other hand, the involved cell line is typically more well-differentiated but immunologically incompetent. Leukemias are also further classified according to cell lineage as either myelogenous (when myeloid progenitor cell-derived cells are involved) or lymphocytic (when lymphoid progenitor cell-derived cells are involved). Additionally, secondary leukemias can develop in patients treated with cytotoxic agents such as radiation, alkylating agents, and epipodophyllotoxins. Inhibitors of PI3Kδ reduce the rate of production of these hematopoietic cells, thus at least slowing the progression of leukemia in its various forms. Selective inhibitors such as the compound of formula (1) achieve this effect with minimal disruption to the functioning of other types of cells, which typically utilize other isoforms of PI3K.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLymphomas are cancers that originate in lymphocytes of lymphoid tissues including but not limited to the lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen, and other organs of the immune system, and are characterized by uncontrolled increase in lymphocyte production. There are two basic categories of lymphomas, Hodgkin's lymphoma, which is marked by the presence of a hallmark cell type called the Reed-Sternberg cell, and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, which includes a large, diverse group of lymphocytic cancers. The non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are generally classified according to lymphocyte cell lineage (including but not limited to B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells), and can be further divided into cancers that have an indolent (slowly progressing or low grade) course and those that have an aggressive (rapidly progressing or intermediate or high grade) course. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas include but are not limited to B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, diffuse cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, immunoblastic large cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, mycosis fungoides, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, small non-cleaved cell lymphoma, and T-cell lymphoma. Again, selective inhibitors of PI3Kδ reduce the growth rate of lymphomas by their selective activity against hematopoietic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMyeloproliferative disorders also involve excessive production of certain types of blood cells in the bone marrow. Myeloproliferative disorders include but are not limited to polycythemia vera, chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, and essential thrombocythemia. In polycythemia vera, red blood cells are overproduced in the bone marrow and build up in the blood stream. In chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, aberrant proliferation of myeloid progenitor-derived cells leads to fibrosis in the bone marrow and eventually bone marrow failure (\ni.e\n., an underproduction of myeloid progenitor-derived cells). In essential thrombocythemia, the number of platelets are overproduced, but other cells in the blood are normal. Selective inhibitors of PI3Kδ reduce the overproduction of these hematopoietic cells and thus ameliorate these conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMyelodysplastic syndromes, sometimes referred to as pre-leukemias or \"smoldering\" leukemias, are additional indications in which the bone marrow does not function normally, a so called \"ineffective hematopoiesis\". Immature blast cells do not mature properly and become overproduced, leading to a lack of effective mature blood cells. A myelodysplastic syndrome may develop following treatment with drugs or radiation therapy for other diseases, or it may develop without any known cause. Myelodysplastic syndromes are classified based on the appearance of bone marrow and blood cells as imaged by microscope. Myelodysplastic syndromes include but are not limited to refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts, and refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma cell neoplasms including but not limited to myelomas are malignancies of bone marrow plasma cells that resemble leukemia. The malignant plasma cells, otherwise known as myeloma cells, accumulate in the bone marrow and, unlike typical leukemias, rarely enter the blood stream. This progressive accumulation of myeloma cells within the marrow disrupts normal bone marrow function (most commonly reflected by anemia), reduces white cell and platelet counts, causes damage to surrounding bone, and suppresses normal immune function (reflected by reduced levels of effective immunoglobulins and increased susceptibility to infection). Myeloma cells usually grow in the form of localized tumors (plasmacytomas). Such plasmacytomas can be single or multiple and confined within bone marrow and bone (medullary) or developed outside of bone in soft tissue (extramedullary plasmacytomas). When there are multiple plasmacytomas inside or outside bone, the indication is also called multiple myeloma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch indications are typically treated with one or more therapies including but not limited to surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and bone marrow and/or stem cell transplantation. Combinations of these treatments are often utilized, and the compounds of the invention may be used in combination with surgical, radiation, immunotherapy, and bone marrow and/or stem cell transplantation methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurgery involves the bulk removal of diseased tissue. While surgery can be effectively used to remove certain tumors, for example, breast, colon, and skin, it cannot be used to treat tumors located in areas that are inaccessible to surgeons. Additionally, surgery cannot typically be successfully used to treat non-localized cancerous indications including but not limited to leukemias and myelomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadiation therapy involves using high-energy radiation from x-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, and other sources (\"radiation\") to kill rapidly dividing cells such as cancerous cells and to shrink tumors. Radiation therapy is well known in the art (\nHellman, Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology, 248-275, 4th ed., vol. 1 (1993\n)). Radiation therapy may be administered from outside the body (\"externalbeam radiation therapy\"). Alternatively, radiation therapy can be administered by placing radioactive materials capable of producing radiation in or near the tumor or in an area near the cancerous cells. Systemic radiation therapy employs radioactive substances including but not limited to radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies that can circulate throughout the body or localize to specific regions or organs of the body. Brachytherapy involves placing a radioactive \"seed\" in proximity to a tumor. Radiation therapy is non-specific and often causes damage to any exposed tissues. Additionally, radiation therapy frequently causes individuals to experience side effects (such as nausea, fatigue, low leukocyte counts, etc.) that can significantly affect their quality of life and influence their continued compliance with radiation treatment protocols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemotherapy involves administering chemotherapeutic agents that often act by disrupting cell replication or cell metabolism (e.g., by disrupting DNA metabolism, DNA synthesis, DNA transcription, or microtubule spindle function, or by perturbing chromosomal structural integrity by way of introducing DNA lesions). Chemotherapeutics are frequently non-specific in that they affect normal healthy cells as well as tumor cells. The maintenance of DNA integrity is essential to cell viability in normal cells. Chemotherapeutic agents must be potent enough to kill cancerous cells without causing too much damage to normal cells. Therefore, anticancer drugs typically have very low therapeutic indices, i.e., the window between the effective dose and the excessively toxic dose can be extremely narrow because the drugs cause a high percentage of damage to normal cells as well as tumor cells. Additionally, chemotherapy-induced side effects significantly affect the quality of life of an individual in need of treatment, and therefore frequently influence the individual's continued compliance with chemotherapy treatment protocols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the compounds and methods of the invention may be used to reduce the amount of radiation, immunotherapy or chemotherapy required to control these conditions, and to overcome some of the limitations of these conventional therapies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn many indications involving aberrant proliferation of Hematopoietic cells, there are two main treatment phases: remission induction and post-remission treatment. Post-remission treatment may be referred to as consolidation therapy. Less frequently, a third phase of treatment involving long-term, low-dose chemotherapy (maintenance therapy). Although maintenance therapy may reduce the likelihood of relapses, the general consensus is that this benefit is outweighed by the increased risk of treatment-related mortality when extended maintenance treatment is given.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRemission induction is achieved in most patients using two or more drugs in combination to clear all detectable cancerous cells from the blood and/or bone marrow. Remission induction is essentially standard for all patients except those with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of the cancer acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Remission induction normally involves administration of the drug cytarabine, optionally in combination with an anthracycline (including but not limited to daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, or idarubicin). Sometimes a third drug, such as etoposide or thioguanine, is also administered. The intensity of treatment typically causes severe bone marrow suppression. Myeloid colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF and GM-CSF) can be administered to induce myeloid progenitor cell production and shorten the period of granulocytopenia following induction therapy. For acute promyelocytic leukemia, (M3 stage) tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid, ATRA) can be used to induce terminal differentiation of the leukemic cells (i.e., to induce the proliferating, immature cells to differentiate into non-proliferating, specialized, mature cells).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disappearance of detectable cancerous cells from the blood and bone marrow does not necessarily mean that all malignant cells in the body have been killed. Thus, additional treatment with the same, or similar drugs as used in remission induction at the same, or lower doses are often administered soon after completion of the remission induction phase. In some treatment protocols, consolidation therapy is intensified by using cytarabine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the method of the invention can be employed to treat subjects therapeutically or prophylactically who have or can be subject to an inflammatory disorder. One aspect of the present invention derives from the involvement of PI3Kδ in mediating aspects of the inflammatory process. Without intending to be bound by any theory, it is theorized that, because inflammation involves processes that are typically mediated by leukocyte (\ne.g\n., neutrophil, lymphocyte, etc.) activation and chemotactic transmigration, and because PI3Kδ can mediate such phenomena, antagonists of PI3Kδ can be used to suppress injury associated with inflammation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic methods of the present invention include methods for the treatment of disorders associated with inflammatory cell activation. \"Inflammatory cell activation\" refers to the induction by a stimulus (including, but not limited to, cytokines, antigens or auto-antibodies) of a proliferative cellular response, the production of soluble mediators (including but not limited to cytokines, oxygen radicals, enzymes, prostanoids, or vasoactive amines), or cell surface expression of new or increased numbers of mediators (including, but not limited to, major histocompatibility antigens or cell adhesion molecules) in inflammatory cells (including but not limited to monocytes, macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, granulocytes (\ni.e\n., polymorphonuclear leukocytes such as neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils), mast cells, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, and endothelial cells). It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the activation of one or a combination of these phenotypes in these cells can contribute to the initiation, perpetuation, or exacerbation of an inflammatory disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention have been found to inhibit superoxide release by neutrophils. Superoxide is released by neutrophils in response to any of a variety of stimuli, including signals of infection, as a mechanism of cell killing. For example, superoxide release is known to be induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), which is released by macrophages, mast cells, and lymphocytes upon contact with bacterial cell wall components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TNFα is an extraordinarily potent and promiscuous activator of inflammatory processes, being involved in activation of neutrophils and various other cell types, induction of leukocyte/endothelial cell adhesion, pyrexia, enhanced MHC Class I production, and stimulation of angiogenesis. Alternatively, superoxide release can be stimulated by formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) or other peptides blocked at the N-terminus by formylated methionine. Such peptides are not normally found in eukaryotes, but are fundamentally characteristic of bacteria, and signal the presence of bacteria to the immune system. Leukocytes expressing the fMLP receptor, \ne.g\n., neutrophils and macrophages, are stimulated to migrate up gradients of these peptides (\ni.e\n., chemotaxis) toward loci of infection, As demonstrated herein, the compounds of the invention inhibit stimulated superoxide release by neutrophils in response to either TNFα or fMLP. Other functions of neutrophils, including stimulated exocytosis and directed chemotactic migration, also have been shown to be inhibited by the PI3Kδ inhibitors of the invention. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention can be expected to be useful in treating disorders, such as inflammatory disorders, that are mediated by any or all of these neutrophil functions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention enables methods of treating such diseases as arthritic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, monoarticular arthritis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis, spondylitis; Behçet disease; sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, gram positive sepsis, and toxic shock syndrome; multiple organ injury syndrome secondary to septicemia, trauma, or hemorrhage; ophthalmic disorders such as allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, uveitis, and thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy; eosinophilic granuloma; pulmonary or respiratory disorders such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, allergic rhinitis, ARDS, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), silicosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, pleurisy, alveolitis, vasculitis, emphysema, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary oxygen toxicity; reperfusion injury of the myocardium, brain, or extremities; fibrosis such as cystic fibrosis; keloid formation or scar tissue formation; atherosclerosis; autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), autoimmune thyroiditis, some forms of diabetes, and Raynaud's syndrome; and transplant rejection disorders such as GVHD and allograft rejection; chronic glomerulonephritis; inflammatory bowel diseases such as chronic inflammatory bowel disease (CIBD), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis; inflammatory dermatoses such as contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, or urticaria; fever and myalgias due to infection; central or peripheral nervous system inflammatory disorders such as meningitis, encephalitis, and brain or spinal cord injury due to minor trauma; Sjogren's syndrome; diseases involving leukocyte diapedesis; alcoholic hepatitis; bacterial pneumonia; antigen-antibody complex mediated diseases; hypovolemic shock; Type I diabetes mellitus; acute and delayed hypersensitivity; disease states due to leukocyte dyscrasia and metastasis; thermal injury; granulocyte transfusion-associated syndromes; and cytokine-induced toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method can have utility in treating subjects who are or can be subject to reperfusion injury, \ni.e\n., injury resulting from situations in which a tissue or organ experiences a period of ischemia followed by reperfusion. The term \"ischemia\" refers to localized tissue anemia due to obstruction of the inflow of arterial blood. Transient ischemia followed by reperfusion characteristically results in neutrophil activation and transmigration through the endothelium of the blood vessels in the affected area, Accumulation of activated neutrophils in turn results in generation of reactive oxygen metabolites, which damage components of the involved tissue or organ. This phenomenon of \"reperfusion injury\" is commonly associated with conditions such as vascular stroke (including global and focal ischemia), hemorrhagic shock, myocardial ischemia or infarction, organ transplantation, and cerebral vasospasm. To illustrate, reperfusion injury occurs at the termination of cardiac bypass procedures or during cardiac arrest when the heart, once prevented from receiving blood, begins to reperfuse. It is expected that inhibition of PI3K8 activity will result in reduced amounts of reperfusion injury in such situations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith respect to the nervous system, global ischemia occurs when blood flow to the entire brain ceases for a period. Global ischemia can result from cardiac arrest. Focal ischemia occurs when a portion of the brain is deprived of its normal blood supply. Focal ischemia can result from thromboembolytic occlusion of a cerebral vessel, traumatic head injury, edema, or brain tumor. Even if transient, both global and focal ischemia can cause widespread neuronal damage. Although nerve tissue damage occurs over hours or even days following the onset of ischemia, some permanent nerve tissue damage can develop in the initial minutes following the cessation of blood flow to the brain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIschemia also can occur in the heart in myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular disorders in which the coronary arteries have been obstructed as a result of atherosclerosis, thrombus, or spasm. Accordingly, the invention is also useful for treating cardiac tissue damage, particularly damage resulting from cardiac ischemia or damage caused by reperfusion injury in mammals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, selective inhibitors of PI3Kδ activity, such as the compounds of the invention, can be employed in methods of treating diseases of bone, especially diseases in which osteoclast function is abnormal or undesirable. Selective inhibitors of PI3Kδ have been shown to inhibit osteoclast function \nin vitro.\n See, \ne.g.\n, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,800,620\n \n. Accordingly, the PI3Kδ selective inhibitors of the invention can be of value in treating osteoporosis, Paget's disease, and related bone resorption disorders where a reduction in osteoclast function is desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the invention includes methods of using selective PI3Kδ inhibitory compounds to inhibit the growth or proliferation of cancer cells of hematopoietic origin, particularly cancer cells of lymphoid origin, and more particularly cancer cells related to or derived from B lymphocytes or B lymphocyte progenitors. Cancers amenable to treatment using the method of the invention include, without limitation, lymphomas, \ne.g\n., malignant neoplasms of lymphoid and reticuloendothelial tissues, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, lymphocytic lymphomas and the like; multiple myelomas; as well as leukemias such as lymphocytic leukemias, chronic myeloid (myelogenous) leukemias, and the like. In a preferred embodiment, PI3Kδ inhibitory compounds can be used to inhibit or control the growth or proliferation of chronic myeloid (myelogenous) leukemia cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention includes a method for suppressing a function of basophils and/or mast cells, and thereby enabling treatment of diseases or disorders characterized by excessive or undesirable basophil and/or mast cell activity. According to the method, a compound of the invention can be used to selectively inhibit the expression or activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) in the basophils and/or mast cells. Preferably, the method employs a PI3Kδ inhibitor of formula (1) or (2) in an amount sufficient to inhibit stimulated histamine release by the basophils and/or mast cells. Accordingly, the use of such PI3Kδ selective inhibitors can be of value in treating diseases characterized by histamine release, \ni.e\n., allergic disorders, including disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, ARDS, emphysema, and related disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods in accordance with the invention may include administering a PI3Kδ selective inhibitor with one or more other agents that either enhance the activity of the inhibitor or compliment its activity or use in treatment. Such additional factors and/or agents may produce an augmented or even synergistic effect when administered with a PI3Kδ selective inhibitor, or minimize side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the methods of the invention further comprise administering a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor. In one aspect of this embodiment, the mTOR inhibitor is rapamycin.

Some commercially available diluents are Fast-Flo\n®\n, Emdex\n®\n, STA-Rx 1500\n®\n, Emcompress\n®\n and Avicel\n®\n, Such compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate \nof in vivo\n release, and rate \nof in vivo\n clearance of the PI3Kδ inhibitor compounds (see, \ne.g\n., \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. pp. 1435-1712 (1990\n), which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable fillers can include, for example, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, dextrose, mannitol, and/or sucrose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInorganic salts including calcium triphosphate, magnesium carbonate, and sodium chloride may also be used as fillers in the pharmaceutical compositions. Amino acids may be used such as use in a buffer formulation of the pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisintegrants may be included in solid dosage formulations of the inhibitors. Materials used as disintegrants include but are not limited to starch including the commercial disintegrant based on starch, Explotab\n®\n. Sodium starch glycolate, Amberlite\n®\n, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ultramylopectin, sodium alginate, gelatin, orange peel, acid carboxymethylcellulose, natural sponge and bentonite may all be used as disintegrants in the pharmaceutical compositions. Other disintegrants include insoluble cationic exchange resins. Powdered gums including powdered gums such as agar, karaya or tragacanth may be used as disintegrants and as binders. Alginic acid and its sodium salt are also useful as disintegrants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinders may be used to hold the therapeutic agent together to form a hard tablet and include materials from natural products such as acacia, tragacanth, starch and gelatin. Others include methyl cellulose (MC), ethyl cellulose (EC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) can both be used in alcoholic solutions to facilitate granulation of the therapeutic ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antifrictional agent may be included in the formulation of the therapeutic ingredient to prevent sticking during the formulation process. Lubricants may be used as a layer between the therapeutic ingredient and the die wall, and these can include but are not limited to; stearic acid including its magnesium and calcium salts, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), liquid paraffin, vegetable oils and waxes. Soluble lubricants may also be used such as sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate, polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, Carbowax\n®\n 4000 and 6000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlidants that might improve the flow properties of the therapeutic ingredient during formulation and to aid rearrangement during compression might be added. Suitable glidants include starch, talc, pyrogenic silica and hydrated silicoaluminate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo aid dissolution of the therapeutic into the aqueous environment, a surfactant might be added as a wetting agent. Natural or synthetic surfactants may be used. Surfactants may include anionic detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, and dioctyl sodium sulfonate. Cationic detergents such as benzalkonium chloride and benzethonium chloride may be used. Nonionic detergents that can be used in the pharmaceutical formulations include lauromacrogol 400, polyoxyl 40 stearate, polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 10, 50 and 60, glycerol monostearate, polysorbate 40, 60, 65 and 80, sucrose fatty acid ester, methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose. These surfactants can be present in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention either alone or as a mixture in different ratios.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControlled release formulation may be desirable. The inhibitors of the invention can be incorporated into an inert matrix which permits release by either diffusion or leaching mechanisms, \ne.g\n., gums. Slowly degenerating matrices may also be incorporated into the pharmaceutical formulations, \ne.g\n., alginates, polysaccharides. Another form of controlled release is a method based on the Uros\n®\n therapeutic system (Alza Corp.), \ni.e\n., the drug is enclosed in a semipermeable membrane which allows water to enter and push the inhibitor compound out through a single small opening due to osmotic effects. Some enteric coatings also have a delayed release effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nColorants and flavoring agents may also be included in the pharmaceutical compositions. For example, the inhibitors of the invention may be formulated (such as by liposome or microsphere encapsulation) and then further contained within an edible product, such as a beverage containing colorants and flavoring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic agent can also be given in a film coated tablet. Nonenteric materials for use in coating the pharmaceutical compositions include methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, methylhydroxy-ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl-methyl cellulose, sodium carboxy-methyl cellulose, povidone and polyethylene glycols. Enteric materials for use in coating the pharmaceutical compositions include esters of phthalic acid. A mix of materials might be used to provide the optimum film coating. Film coating manufacturing may be carried out in a pan coater, in a fluidized bed, or by compression coating.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions can be administered in solid, semi-solid, liquid or gaseous form, or may be in dried powder, such as lyophilized form. The pharmaceutical compositions can be packaged in forms convenient for delivery, including, for example, capsules, sachets, cachets, gelatins, papers, tablets, capsules, suppositories, pellets, pills, troches, lozenges or other forms known in the art. The type of packaging will generally depend on the desired route of administration. Implantable sustained release formulations are also contemplated, as are transdermal formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the methods according to the invention, the inhibitor compounds may be administered by various routes. For example, pharmaceutical compositions may be for injection, or for oral, nasal, transdermal or other forms of administration, including, \ne.g.\n, by intravenous, intradermal, intramuscular, intramammary, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraocular, retrobulbar, intrapulmonary (\ne.g\n., aerosolized drugs) or subcutaneous injection (including depot administration for long term release, \ne.g\n., embedded under the splenic capsule, brain, or in the cornea); by sublingual, anal, vaginal, or by surgical implantation, \ne.g\n., embedded under the splenic capsule, brain, or in the cornea. The treatment may consist of a single dose or a plurality of doses over a period of time. In general, the methods of the invention involve administering effective amounts of an inhibitor of the invention together with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, preservatives, solubilizers, emulsifiers, adjuvants and/or carriers, as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides methods for oral administration of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention. Oral solid dosage forms are described generally in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,\n \nsupra\n at chapter 89. Solid dosage forms include tablets, capsules, pills, troches or lozenges, and cachets or pellets. Also, liposomal or proteinoid encapsulation may be used to formulate the compositions (as, for example, proteinoid microspheres reported in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,925,673\n \n). Liposomal encapsulation may include liposomes that are derivatized with various polymers (\ne.g\n., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,013,556\n \n). In general, the formulation will include a compound of the invention and inert ingredients which protect against degradation in the stomach and which permit release of the biologically active material in the intestine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibitors can be included in the formulation as fine multiparticulates in the form of granules or pellets of particle size about 1 mm. The formulation of the material for capsule administration could also be as a powder, lightly compressed plugs or even as tablets. The capsules could be prepared by compression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso contemplated herein is pulmonary delivery of the PI3Kδ inhibitors in accordance with the invention. According to this aspect of the invention, the inhibitor is delivered to the lungs of a mammal by inhalation of a suitable composition, and the PI3Kδ inhibitor traverses across the lung epithelial lining to the blood stream.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nContemplated for use in the practice of this invention are a wide range of mechanical devices designed for pulmonary delivery of therapeutic products, including but not limited to nebulizers, metered dose inhalers, and powder inhalers, all of which are familiar to those skilled in the art. Some specific examples of commercially available devices suitable for the practice of this invention are the UltraVent™ nebulizer, manufactured by Mallinckrodt, Inc., St. Louis, Mo,; the Acorn II\n®\n nebulizer, manufactured by Marquest Medical Products, Englewood, Colorado; the Ventolin\n®\n metered dose inhaler, manufactured by Glaxo Inc., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; and the Spinhaler\n®\n powder inhaler, manufactured by Fisons Corp., Bedford, Mass.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll such devices require the use of formulation suitable for the dispensing of the inventive compound. Typically, each formulation is specific to the type of device employed and may involve the use of an appropriate propellant material, in addition to diluents, adjuvants and/or carriers useful in therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen used in pulmonary administration methods, the inhibitors of the invention are most advantageously prepared in particulate form with an average particle size of less than 10 µm (or microns), for example, 0.5 to 5 µm, for most effective delivery to the distal lung.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations suitable for use with a nebulizer, either jet or ultrasonic, will typically comprise the inventive compound dissolved in water at a concentration range of about 0.1 to 100 mg of inhibitor per mL of solution, 1 to 50 mg of inhibitor per mL of solution, or 5 to 25 mg of inhibitor per mL of solution. The formulation may also include a buffer. The nebulizer formulation may also contain a surfactant, to reduce or prevent surface induced aggregation of the inhibitor caused by atomization of the solution in forming the aerosol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for use with a metered-dose inhaler device will generally comprise a finely divided powder containing the inventive inhibitors suspended in a propellant with the aid of a surfactant. The propellant may be any conventional material employed for this purpose, such as a chlorofluorocarbon, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon, a hydrofluorocarbon, or a hydrocarbon, including trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethanol, and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, or combinations thereof. Suitable surfactants include sorbitan trioleate and soya lecithin. Oleic acid may also be useful as a surfactant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for dispensing from a powder inhaler device will comprise a finely divided dry powder containing the inventive compound and may also include a bulking agent or diluent such as lactose, sorbitol, sucrose, mannitol, trehalose, or xylitol in amounts which facilitate dispersal of the powder from the device, \ne.g.\n, 50 to 90% by weight of the formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNasal delivery of the inventive compound is also contemplated. Nasal delivery allows the passage of the inhibitor to the blood stream directly after administering the therapeutic product to the nose, without the necessity for deposition of the product in the lung. Formulations for nasal delivery may include dextran or cyclodextran. Delivery via transport across other mucous membranes is also contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the PI3Kδ selective compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, \ne.g.\n, for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). Additionally, this information can be determined in cell cultures or experimental animals additionally treated with other therapies including but not limited to radiation, chemotherapeutic agents, photodynamic therapies, radiofrequency ablation, anti-angiogenic agents, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn practice of the methods of the invention, the pharmaceutical compositions are generally provided in doses ranging from 1 pg compound/kg body weight to 1000 mg/kg, 0.01 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg, given in daily doses or in equivalent doses at longer or shorter intervals, \ne.g\n., every other day, twice weekly, weekly, or twice or three times daily. The inhibitor compositions may be administered by an initial bolus followed by a continuous infusion to maintain therapeutic circulating levels of drug product. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily optimize effective dosages and administration regimens as determined by good medical practice and the clinical condition of the individual to be treated. The frequency of dosing will depend on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the agents and the route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe optimal pharmaceutical formulation will be determined by one skilled in the art depending upon the route of administration and desired dosage (see, for example, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, latest ed\n., the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference). Such formulations may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in \nvivo\n clearance of the administered agents. Depending on the route of administration, a suitable dose may be calculated according to body weight, body surface area or organ size. Further refinement of the calculations necessary to determine the appropriate dosage for treatment involving each of the above mentioned formulations is routinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation, especially in light of the dosage information and assays disclosed herein, as well as the pharmacokinetic data observed in human clinical trials. Appropriate dosages may be ascertained by using established assays for determining blood level dosages in conjunction with an appropriate physician considering various factors which modify the action of drugs, \ne.g\n., the drug's specific activity, the severity of the indication, and the responsiveness of the individual, the age, condition, body weight, sex and diet of the individual, the time of administration and other clinical factors. As studies are conducted, further information will emerge regarding the appropriate dosage levels and duration of treatment for various indications involving aberrant proliferation of Hematopoietic cells.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples are provided merely to illustrate the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope thereof.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation of IC491691: 6-Bromo-3-phenyl-2-(9\nH-p\nurin-6-ylsulfanylmethyl)-3\nH\n thieno[2,3-\nd\n]pyrimidin-4-one\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nD2: 2-acetylamino-thiophene-3-carboxylic acid phenylamide.
