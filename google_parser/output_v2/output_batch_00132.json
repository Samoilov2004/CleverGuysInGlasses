The alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds are provided in both racemic and enantiomerically enriched forms and may comprise either or both of fluorine-18 and fluorine 19. The alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds are believed to possess high affinity for VMAT-2, a biomarker implicated in human diabetes. The alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds comprising a fluorine-18 group are useful as PET imaging agents targeting the VMAT-2 biomarker.

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application is a Continuation-in-Part of U.S. patent applications, Ser. Nos. 11/947,215, and 11/947,275 filed on Nov. 29, 2007.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nThis invention relates to alpha-fluoroalkyl compounds related to tetrabenazine and dihydrotetrabenazine and intermediates useful in the preparation of such alpha-fluoroalkyl compounds.\n\n\nSince first reported on in 1957 (Pletscher, A. (1957) Release of 5-hydroxytryptamine by benzoquinolizine derivatives with sedative action, \nScience \n126, 507), tetrabenazine and structurally related compounds have been widely investigated, and a number of TBZ compounds and derivatives of tetrabenazine have shown promise in the treatment of a variety of conditions affecting human health. For example, dihydrotetrabenazine has been identified as an agent for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychoses (See for example WO 2007017654 A1), and tetrabenazine has shown promise as an agent in the treatment of Huntington's disease (Neurology (2006), 66(3), 366-372). Although most preparations used in biological studies of tetrabenazine and its derivatives have been carried out on racemates, in at least one instance the biological activity exhibited by enantiomers tested separately was highly differentiated (See Koeppe, R. A. et al. (1999) Assessment of extrastriatal vesicular monoamine transporter binding site density using stereoisomers of [11C] dihydrotetrabenazine, \nJ Cereb Blood Flow Metab \n19, 1376-1384).\n\n\nMore recently, derivatives of 9-desmethyl(±)-dihydrotetrabenazine incorporating a fluorine-18 atom have been shown to be useful as PET imaging agents, \nNuclear Medicine and Biology \n33 (2006) 685-694. See also \nNuclear Medicine and Biology \n34 (2007) 239-246; and \nNuclear Medicine and Biology \n34 (2007) 233-237.\n\n\nThe present invention provides both a new class of fluorinated dihydrotetrabenazine derivatives and fluorinated dihydrotetrabenazine analogs, and discloses efficient synthetic methodology which may be used to prepare such compounds in enantiomerically enriched or racemic forms. The alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds provided by the present invention are useful as PET imaging agents, probes for the development of PET imaging agents, and therapeutic agents. In addition, the present invention provides novel synthetic intermediate compositions which may be used to prepare either or both enantiomers of the subject dihydrotetrabenazine derivatives and dihydrotetrabenazine analogs.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the present invention provides an alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compound having structure I\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1 \nis a C\n1\n-C\n10 \nfluorinated aliphatic radical; R\n2 \nis hydrogen or a C\n1\n-C\n10 \naliphatic radical; R\n3 \nis hydrogen or a C\n1\n-C\n10 \naliphatic radical; and R\n4 \nis a C\n1\n-C\n10 \naliphatic radical, a C\n3\n-C\n10 \ncycloaliphatic radical, or a C\n3\n-C\n10 \naromatic radical.\n\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a PET imaging agent comprising an alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compound having structure I\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1 \nis a C\n1\n-C\n10 \nfluorinated aliphatic radical; R\n2 \nis hydrogen or a C\n1\n-C\n10 \naliphatic radical; R\n3 \nis hydrogen or a C\n1\n-C\n10 \naliphatic radical; and R\n4 \nis a C\n1\n-C\n10 \naliphatic radical, a C\n3\n-C\n10 \ncycloaliphatic radical, or a C\n3\n-C\n10 \naromatic radical.\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\nIn the following specification and the claims, which follow, reference will be made to a number of terms, which shall be defined to have the following meanings.\n\n\nThe singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.\n\n\n“Optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event occurs and instances where it does not.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “solvent” can refer to a single solvent or a mixture of solvents.\n\n\nApproximating language, as used herein throughout the specification and claims, may be applied to modify any quantitative representation that could permissibly vary without resulting in a change in the basic function to which it is related. Accordingly, a value modified by a term or terms, such as “about”, is not to be limited to the precise value specified. In some instances, the approximating language may correspond to the precision of an instrument for measuring the value.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “aromatic radical” refers to an array of atoms having a valence of at least one comprising at least one aromatic group. The array of atoms having a valence of at least one comprising at least one aromatic group may include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, selenium, silicon and oxygen, or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. As used herein, the term “aromatic radical” includes but is not limited to phenyl, pyridyl, furanyl, thienyl, naphthyl, phenylene, and biphenyl radicals. As noted, the aromatic radical contains at least one aromatic group. The aromatic group is invariably a cyclic structure having 4n+2 “delocalized” electrons where “n” is an integer equal to 1 or greater, as illustrated by phenyl groups (n=1), thienyl groups (n=1), furanyl groups (n=1), naphthyl groups (n=2), azulenyl groups (n=2), anthraceneyl groups (n=3) and the like. The aromatic radical may also include nonaromatic components. For example, a benzyl group is an aromatic radical which comprises a phenyl ring (the aromatic group) and a methylene group (the nonaromatic component). Similarly a tetrahydronaphthyl radical is an aromatic radical comprising an aromatic group (C\n6\nH\n3\n) fused to a nonaromatic component —(CH\n2\n)\n4\n—. For convenience, the term “aromatic radical” is defined herein to encompass a wide range of functional groups such as alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, alkynyl groups, haloalkyl groups, haloaromatic groups, conjugated dienyl groups, alcohol groups, ether groups, aldehyde groups, ketone groups, carboxylic acid groups, acyl groups (for example carboxylic acid derivatives such as esters and amides), amine groups, nitro groups, and the like. For example, the 4-methylphenyl radical is a C\n7 \naromatic radical comprising a methyl group, the methyl group being a functional group which is an alkyl group. Similarly, the 2-nitrophenyl group is a C\n6 \naromatic radical comprising a nitro group, the nitro group being a functional group. Aromatic radicals include halogenated aromatic radicals such as 4-trifluoromethylphenyl, hexafluoroisopropylidenebis(4-phen-1-yloxy) (i.e., —OPhC(CF\n3\n)\n2\nPhO—), 4-chloromethylphen-1-yl, 3-trifluorovinyl-2-thienyl, 3-trichloromethylphen-1-yl (i.e., 3-CCl\n3\nPh-), 4-(3-bromoprop-1-yl)phen-1-yl (i.e., 4-BrCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nPh-), and the like. Further examples of aromatic radicals include 4-allyloxyphen-1-oxy, 4-aminophen-1-yl (i.e., 4-H\n2\nNPh-), 3-aminocarbonylphen-1-yl (i.e., NH\n2\nCOPh-), 4-benzoylphen-1-yl, dicyanomethylidenebis(4-phen-1-yloxy) (i.e., —OPhC(CN)\n2\nPhO—), 3-methylphen-1-yl, methylenebis(4-phen-1-yloxy) (i.e., —OPhCH\n2\nPhO—), 2-ethylphen-1-yl, phenylethenyl, 3-formyl-2-thienyl, 2-hexyl-5-furanyl, hexamethylene-1,6-bis(4-phen-1-yloxy) (i.e., —OPh(CH\n2\n)\n6\nPhO—), 4-hydroxymethylphen-1-yl (i.e., 4-HOCH\n2\nPh-), 4-mercaptomethylphen-1-yl (i.e., 4-HSCH\n2\nPh-), 4-methylthiophen-1-yl (i.e., 4-CH\n3\nSPh-), 3-methoxyphen-1-yl, 2-methoxycarbonylphen-1-yloxy (e.g., methyl salicyl), 2-nitromethylphen-1-yl (i.e., 2-NO\n2\nCH\n2\nPh), 3-trimethylsilylphen-1-yl, 4-t-butyldimethylsilylphenl-1-yl, 4-vinylphen-1-yl, vinylidenebis(phenyl), and the like. The term “a C\n3\n-C\n10 \naromatic radical” includes aromatic radicals containing at least three but no more than 10 carbon atoms. The aromatic radical 1-imidazolyl (C\n3\nH\n2\nN\n2\n—) represents a C\n3 \naromatic radical. The benzyl radical (C\n7\nH\n7\n—) represents a C\n7 \naromatic radical.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “cycloaliphatic radical” refers to a radical having a valence of at least one, and comprising an array of atoms which is cyclic but which is not aromatic. As defined herein a “cycloaliphatic radical” does not contain an aromatic group. A “cycloaliphatic radical” may comprise one or more noncyclic components. For example, a cyclohexylmethyl group (C\n6\nH\n11\nCH\n2\n—) is a cycloaliphatic radical which comprises a cyclohexyl ring (the array of atoms which is cyclic but which is not aromatic) and a methylene group (the noncyclic component). The cycloaliphatic radical may include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, selenium, silicon and oxygen, or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. For convenience, the term “cycloaliphatic radical” is defined herein to encompass a wide range of functional groups such as alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, alkynyl groups, haloalkyl groups, conjugated dienyl groups, alcohol groups, ether groups, aldehyde groups, ketone groups, carboxylic acid groups, acyl groups (for example carboxylic acid derivatives such as esters and amides), amine groups, nitro groups, and the like. For example, the 4-methylcyclopent-1-yl radical is a C\n6 \ncycloaliphatic radical comprising a methyl group, the methyl group being a functional group which is an alkyl group. Similarly, the 2-nitrocyclobut-1-yl radical is a C\n4 \ncycloaliphatic radical comprising a nitro group, the nitro group being a functional group. A cycloaliphatic radical may comprise one or more halogen atoms which may be the same or different. Halogen atoms include, for example; fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.

Further examples of cycloaliphatic radicals include 4-allyloxycyclohex-1-yl, 4-aminocyclohex-1-yl (i.e., H\n2\nNC\n6\nH\n10\n—), 4-aminocarbonylcyclopent-1-yl (i.e., NH\n2\nCOC\n5\nH\n8\n—), 4-acetyloxycyclohex-1-yl, 2,2-dicyanoisopropylidenebis(cyclohex-4-yloxy) (i.e., —OC\n6\nH\n10\nC(CN)\n2\nC\n6\nH\n10\nO—), 3-methylcyclohex-1-yl, methylenebis(cyclohex-4-yloxy) (i.e., —OC\n6\nH\n10\nCH\n2\nC\n6\nH\n10\nO—), 1-ethylcyclobut-1-yl, cyclopropylethenyl, 3-formyl-2-terahydrofuranyl, 2-hexyl-5-tetrahydrofuranyl, hexamethylene-1,6-bis(cyclohex-4-yloxy) (i.e., —OC\n6\nH\n10\n(CH\n2\n)\n6\nC\n6\nH\n10\nO—), 4-hydroxymethylcyclohex-1-yl (i.e., 4-HOCH\n2\nC\n6\nH\n10\n—), 4-mercaptomethylcyclohex-1-yl (i.e., 4-HSCH\n2\nC\n6\nH\n10\n—), 4-methylthiocyclohex-1-yl (i.e., 4-CH\n3\nSC\n6\nH\n10\n—), 4-methoxycyclohex-1-yl, 2-methoxycarbonylcyclohex-1-yloxy (2-CH\n3\nOCOC\n6\nH\n10\nO—), 4-nitromethylcyclohex-1-yl (i.e., NO\n2\nCH\n2\nC\n6\nH\n10\n—), 3-trimethylsilylcyclohex-1-yl, 2-t-butyldimethylsilylcyclopent-1-yl, 4-trimethoxysilylethylcyclohex-1-yl (e.g., (CH\n3\nO)\n3\nSiCH\n2\nCH\n2\nC\n6\nH\n10\n—), 4-vinylcyclohexen-1-yl, vinylidenebis(cyclohexyl), and the like.

The cycloaliphatic radical 2-tetrahydrofuranyl (C\n4\nH\n7\nO—) represents a C\n4 \ncycloaliphatic radical. The cyclohexylmethyl radical (C\n6\nH\n11\nCH\n2\n—) represents a C\n7 \ncycloaliphatic radical.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “aliphatic radical” refers to an organic radical having a valence of at least one consisting of a linear or branched array of atoms which is not cyclic. Aliphatic radicals are defined to comprise at least one carbon atom. The array of atoms comprising the aliphatic radical may include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, silicon, selenium and oxygen or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. For convenience, the term “aliphatic radical” is defined herein to encompass, as part of the “linear or branched array of atoms which is not cyclic” a wide range of functional groups such as alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, alkynyl groups, haloalkyl groups, conjugated dienyl groups, alcohol groups, ether groups, aldehyde groups, ketone groups, carboxylic acid groups, acyl groups (for example carboxylic acid derivatives such as esters and amides), amine groups, nitro groups, and the like. For example, the 4-methylpent-1-yl radical is a C\n6 \naliphatic radical comprising a methyl group, the methyl group being a functional group which is an alkyl group. Similarly, the 4-nitrobut-1-yl group is a C\n4 \naliphatic radical comprising a nitro group, the nitro group being a functional group. An aliphatic radical may be a haloalkyl group which comprises one or more halogen atoms which may be the same or different. Halogen atoms include, for example; fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Aliphatic radicals comprising one or more halogen atoms include the alkyl halides trifluoromethyl, bromodifluoromethyl, chlorodifluoromethyl, hexafluoroisopropylidene, chloromethyl, difluorovinylidene, trichloromethyl, bromodichloromethyl, bromoethyl, 2-bromotrimethylene (e.g., —CH\n2\nCHBrCH\n2\n—), and the like. Further examples of aliphatic radicals include allyl, aminocarbonyl (i.e., —CONH\n2\n), carbonyl, 2,2-dicyanoisopropylidene (i.e., —CH\n2\nC(CN)\n2\nCH\n2\n—), methyl (i.e., —CH\n3\n), methylene (i.e., —CH\n2\n—), ethyl, ethylene, formyl (i.e., —CHO), hexyl, hexamethylene, hydroxymethyl (i.e., —CH\n2\nOH), mercaptomethyl (i.e., —CH\n2\nSH), methylthio (i.e., —SCH\n3\n), methylthiomethyl (i.e., —CH\n2\nSCH\n3\n), methoxy, methoxycarbonyl (i.e., CH\n3\nOCO—), nitromethyl (i.e., —CH\n2\nNO\n2\n), thiocarbonyl, trimethylsilyl (i.e., (CH\n3\n)\n3\nSi—), t-butyldimethylsilyl, 3-trimethyoxysilylpropyl (i.e., (CH\n3\nO)\n3\nSiCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n—), vinyl, vinylidene, and the like. By way of further example, a C\n1\n-C\n10 \naliphatic radical contains at least one but no more than 10 carbon atoms. A methyl group (i.e., CH\n3\n—) is an example of a C\n1 \naliphatic radical. A decyl group (i.e., CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\n9\n—) is an example of a C\n10 \naliphatic radical.\n\n\nAs noted, in one embodiment the present invention provides an alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compound having structure I\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1 \nis a C\n1\n-C\n10 \nfluorinated aliphatic radical; R\n2 \nis hydrogen or a C\n1\n-C\n10 \naliphatic radical; R\n3 \nis hydrogen or a C\n1\n-C\n10 \naliphatic radical; and R\n4 \nis a C\n1\n-C\n10 \naliphatic radical, a C\n3\n-C\n10 \ncycloaliphatic radical, or a C\n3\n-C\n10 \naromatic radical.\n\n\n\nThe alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds I provided by the present invention are believed to possess a high affinity for Type 2 Vesicular Monoamine Transporters (VMAT-2), a group of biomarkers which are believed to correlate with diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and other neurological disorders in human patients. The inventors' recent discovery that substitution by fluorine is tolerated with respect to VMAT-2 binding in closely related novel alpha-fluoroalkyl tetrabenazine and dihydrotetrabenazine compounds supports the proposition that the compounds of present invention may be used as positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents in studies targeting the VMAT-2 biomarker.\n\n\nThus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides radiolabeled alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds falling within the scope of generic structure I comprising a fluorine-18 atom. Fluorine-18 labeled alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds I are suitable for use as imaging agents for positron emission tomography (PET) screening of human patients for pathological conditions related to diabetes. Positron emission tomography has become a medical imaging technique of critical importance to human health.\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, the present invention provides alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds falling within the scope of either generic structure I and comprising a fluorine-19 atom, a stable isotope of fluorine. The alpha-fluoroalkyl compounds comprising a fluorine-19 atom are useful in binding studies which allow the identification of those alpha-fluoroalkyl compounds possessing optimal affinity for a target biomarker, for example VMAT-2. A substantial binding affinity of a given fluorine-19 containing alpha-fluoroalkyl tetrabenzine or dihydrotetrabenazine compound for a target biomarker such as VMAT-2 is a reliable predictor of utility in PET imaging of the corresponding fluorine-18 containing alpha-fluoroalkyl compound.

The term “protected carbonyl group” refers to a carbonyl group equivalent, usually a carbonyl group which has been transformed into a functional group such as a ketal, thioketal, or dithioketal group; and the term “protected hydroxy methine group” refers to a hydroxy methine group equivalent, usually a hydroxy methine group which has been transformed into a functional group such as a tetrahydropyranyl (THP) ether group, a methoxymethyl ether group (MOM group), a methoxyethoxyether group (MEM group), a methylthiomethyl ether group, a benzyl ether group, a p-methoxybenzyl ether group, a pivaloyl ester group (OPiv), or an actetyl ester group (OAc). Protection agents which may be used to transform a carbonyl group or a hydroxy methine group into a protected carbonyl group or a protected hydroxy methine group are well known in the art, for example protection agents detailed in Protecting Groups In Organic Synthesis by James R. Hanson (Blackwell Science, 1999) and Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (Wiley-Interscience, 2006).\n\n\nAs noted, in one embodiment, the alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds provided by the present invention may be prepared from a fluorophilic compound having structure IV, wherein R\n1 \nis a C\n1\n-C\n20 \naliphatic radical, a C\n2\n-C\n20 \ncycloaliphatic radical, or a C\n2\n-C\n20 \naromatic radical comprising at least one functional group susceptible to reaction with nucleophilic fluoride ion. In one embodiment, the functional group susceptible to reaction with nucleophilic fluoride ion is an aromatic sulfonate ester (e.g. tosylate, benzenesulfonate, naphthalenesulfonate). In an alternate embodiment, the functional group susceptible to reaction with nucleophilic fluoride ion is an aliphatic sulfonate ester (e.g. methane sulfonate, trifluoromethane sulfonate). In one embodiment, the functional group susceptible to reaction with nucleophilic fluoride ion is selected from the group consisting of tosylate, mesylate, and trifluoromethane sulfonate groups.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds provided by the present invention may be prepared from a fluorophilic compound having structure IV wherein the group R\n1 \ncomprises at least one tosylate group susceptible to reaction with nucleophilic fluoride ion. See for example the Entries 7a, 7j and 7k of Table 7. As defined herein, the tosylate group is an aromatic radical and the group R\n1 \ncomprising the tosylate group is also an aromatic radical. In the compound shown in Entry 7a for example, the group R\n1 \ncomprising the tosylate group is a C\n9 \naromatic radical which upon displacement with fluoride ion becomes a C\n2 \nfluorinated aliphatic radical.\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds provided by the present invention may be prepared from a fluorophilic compound having structure IV wherein the group R\n1 \ncomprises at least one mesylate group (methane sulfonate group) susceptible to reaction with nucleophilic fluoride ion. As defined herein, the mesylate group is an aliphatic radical and the group R\n1 \ncomprising the mesylate group may be an aliphatic, a cycloaliphatic or an aromatic radical depending on the overall structure of the group R\n1\n. For example, in a fluorophilic compound having structure IV in which R\n1 \ncomprises both a mesylate group and an epoxy group, the group R\n1 \nmay be a cycloaliphatic radical. Alternatively, in a fluorophilic compound having structure IV in which R\n1 \ncomprises both a mesylate group and a tosylate group, the group R\n1 \nis an aromatic radical. It is helpful to bear in mind that the definitions of aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic radicals provided in this disclosure establish a hierarchy in which aliphatic radicals (non-cyclic arrays of atom(s)) must be free of cycloaliphatic groups (a cyclic array of atoms which is not aromatic) and aromatic groups (a cyclic array of atoms which is aromatic), cycloaliphatic radicals must be free of aromatic groups, and aromatic radicals must simply comprise an aromatic group.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds provided by the present invention may be prepared from a fluorophilic compound having structure IV wherein the group R\n1 \ncomprises at least one trifluoromethane sulfonate (triflate) group susceptible to reaction with nucleophilic fluoride ion. See for example Entry 7b of Table 7.\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, the alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds provided by the present invention may be prepared from a fluorophilic compound having structure IV wherein the group R\n1 \ncomprises at least one p-nitrobenzoate group susceptible to reaction with nucleophilic fluoride ion. See for example Entry 7c of Table 7.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds provided by the present invention may be prepared from a fluorophilic compound having structure IV wherein the group R\n1 \ncomprises at least one epoxy group susceptible to reaction with nucleophilic fluoride ion. See for example Entry 7i of Table 7.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds provided by the present invention may be prepared from a fluorophilic compound having structure IV wherein the group R\n1 \ncomprises at least one cyclic sulfate group susceptible to reaction with nucleophilic fluoride ion. See for example Entry 71 of Table 7.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds provided by the present invention may be prepared from a fluorophilic compound having structure IV, wherein R\n1 \nis a C\n2\n-C\n20 \naliphatic radical comprising at least one functional group susceptible to reaction with an electrophilic fluorinating agent, for example fluorine gas, perchloryl fluoride, mercuric fluoride, and phenyl selenenyl fluoride.\n\n\nThus in one embodiment, the functional group susceptible to reaction with an electrophilic fluorinating agent is selected from the group consisting of carbon-carbon double bonds and carbon-carbon triple bonds. Entries 7e, 7f, 7g, 7h and 7k of Table 7 illustrate compounds falling within the scope of generic structure IV which are susceptible to reaction with an electrophilic fluorinating agent. Attention is called to Entry 7k wherein the group R\n1 \ncomprises functional groups susceptible to reaction with an electrophilic fluorinating agent (double bond) and to reaction with nucleophilic fluoride ion (tosylate group). Entry 7k of Table 7 also features a thioketal carbonyl protecting group. As used herein a thioketal protecting group comprises both an oxygen and a sulfur atom bonded to the “carbonyl carbon” and is distinguished from a dithioketal which comprises two sulfur atoms attached to the “carbonyl carbon”.\n\n\nFluorophilic tetrabenazine- and dihydrotetrabenazine compounds IV may be prepared in enantiomerically enriched or racemic forms. For example, a fluorophilic dihydrotetrabenazine compound IV may be enriched in the R,R,R-enantiomer shown in Entry 7h (a fluorophilic dihydrotetrabenazine compound) of Table 7. Alternatively, a fluorophilic tetrabenazine- or dihydrotetrabenazine compound IV may be enriched in an enantiomer having absolute stereochemistry opposite that of Entry 7d of Table 7, for example the S,S,S-enantiomer of Entry 7f.\n\n\nThus, in one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention may be prepared from an enantiomerically enriched fluorophilic compound comprising a principal component enantiomer having structure V\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein Q is a carbonyl group, a protected carbonyl group, a hydroxy methine group, or a protected hydroxy methine group; R\n1 \nis a C\n1\n-C\n20 \naliphatic, C\n2\n-C\n20 \ncycloaliphatic, or C\n2\n-C\n20 \naromatic radical comprising at least one functional group susceptible to reaction with nucleophilic fluoride ion or an electrophilic fluorinating agent; R\n2 \nis hydrogen or a C\n1\n-C\n10 \naliphatic radical; and R\n3 \nis hydrogen or a C\n1\n-C\n10 \naliphatic radical. Principal component enantiomers V are illustrated by Entries 7b, 7d, 7h, and 7k of Table 7. Where Q is a carbonyl group, a protected carbonyl group, or a hydroxy methine group, access to the alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds of the present invention may involve additional chemical transformation (e.g. acetylation) following reaction of compound V with nucleophilic fluoride ion or an electrophilic fluorinating agent.\n\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, the compounds of the present invention may be prepared from an enantiomerically enriched fluorophilic compound comprising a principal component enantiomer having structure VI\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein Q is a carbonyl group, a protected carbonyl group, a hydroxy methine group, or a protected hydroxy methine group; R\n1 \nis a C\n1\n-C\n20 \naliphatic, C\n2\n-C\n20 \ncycloaliphatic, or C\n2\n-C\n20 \naromatic radical comprising at least one functional group susceptible to reaction with nucleophilic fluoride ion or an electrophilic fluorinating agent; R\n2 \nis hydrogen or a C\n1\n-C\n10 \naliphatic radical; and R\n3 \nis hydrogen or a C\n1\n-C\n10 \naliphatic radical. Principal component enantiomers VI are illustrated by Entries 7e and 7f of Table 7. Where Q is a carbonyl group, a protected carbonyl group, or a hydroxy methine group, access to the alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds of the present invention may involve additional chemical transformation (e.g. acetylation) following reaction of compound VI with nucleophilic fluoride ion or an electrophilic fluorinating agent.\n\n\n\nCo-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

In general, the class of aldehyde compounds represented by structure VII may be prepared by art recognized methods, for example using the methodology depicted in Scheme 1. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that as depicted in Scheme 1 the protecting group P\n1 \nrepresents a “Boc” protecting group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, aldehyde compounds VII may be prepared from intermediates prepared using methodology described by Sasamoto et al. (Journal of the American Chemical Society 128, 14010-14011, 2006). Sasamoto et al. disclose the preparation of enantiomerically enriched tetrahydroquinoline malonate compounds which may be converted as shown in the present disclosure to aldehyde compound VII by selective hydrolysis of one of the ester moieties of the tetrahydroquinoline malonate and decarboxylation followed by reduction of the resultant tetrahydroisoquinoline monoester to aldehyde compound VII as depicted in Scheme 1.\n\n\nOne of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the 2 mole percent DM-SEGPHOS shown in Scheme 1 represents a chiral catalyst responsible for the enantiomeric enrichment of the product aldehyde VII, and further that the use of DM-SEGPHOS of opposite chirality as the chiral catalyst will afford a product aldehyde VII enantiomerically enriched in the “S” enantiomer (aldehyde compound VII having the S configuration at ring position-12 (See for example Entry 8b of Table 8). Suitable chiral catalysts include those disclosed by Sasamoto et al. (Journal of the American Chemical Society 128, 14010-14011, 2006), for example (S)-Binap, (R)-Binap, (S)-DM-Binap, (R)-DM-Binap, (S)-DM-SEGPHOS, and (R)-DM-SEGPHOS. Typically use of a catalyst consisting of a ligand possessing a single, for example “S”, configuration produces stereochemically enriched malonate adducts of the opposite “R” configuration and vice versa.\n\n\nIn addition to the use of a chiral catalyst to generate aldehyde compounds VII enriched in a single configuration at ring position-12, there are available a wide variety of methods for the separation of racemic aldehyde VII into its constituent enantiomers. For example, racemic aldehyde compound VII may be separated into its constituent enantiomers by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) on a chiral hplc column.\n\n\nOther methods for producing enantiomerically enriched compositions provided by the present invention include conversion of a racemic alpha-fluoroalkyl compound having structure I compound into an adduct comprising a mixture of diastereomers which are then separated by fractional crystallization. For example, a racemic alpha-fluoroalkyl compound having structure I may be reacted with (−)-tartaric acid to form an adduct (ammonium tartarate salt) of the racemic alpha-fluoroalkyl compound, said adduct comprising a mixture of diastereomeric ammonium tartarate salts which are then separated by fractional crystallization.\n\n\nMETHODS AND EXAMPLES\n\n\nThe following Examples and Methods are intended only to illustrate methods and embodiments in accordance with the invention, and as such should not be construed as imposing limitations upon the claims.\n\n\nMethod 1 Preparation of Protected Diester 2\n\n\nThe dihydroisoquinoline 1 (1.0 eq.) and Boc anhydride (1.5 eq.) were dissolved in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nat room temperature to provide a 1.5 M solution with respect to the dihydroisoquinoline. The mixture was allowed to stir for 30 min. Following the allotted time, the reaction mixture was cooled to 0° C. and then diisopropylmalonate (1.5 eq.) followed by a pre-chilled solution of the Pd catalyst (0.008 eq.) in dichloromethane were added successively to the reaction mixture to provide a final reaction concentration of 0.84 M with respect to the starting dihydroisoquinoline. The reaction mixture was allowed to continue stirring at ˜2.5° C. for 15 h. Following this time EtOAc and brine were added to the reaction mixture.

In addition, the VMAT-2 binding affinity of a fluoroalkyl tetrabinazine carbinol compound 38 bearing an acetoxy group at ring position-2 was also measured. VMAT-2 binding affinity measurements were carried out by Novascreen Biosciences Corporation (Hanover, Md., USA) using protocol Cat. No. 100-0751. Novascreen, Inc. is a commercial provider of biological assays for the pharmaceutical industry. Binding affinity data are presented in Table 9 and illustrate very high binding affinity for the alpha-fluoroalkyl compounds 31, 2-epi-32, and 32 relative to a (+)-DTBZ control (Compound 18) and somewhat lower yet still robust binding activity for fluoroalkyl tetrabinazine carbinol compounds 38 and 39. The data obtained for alpha-fluoroalkyl compounds 31, 32 and 2-epi-32 reveal an unexpected tolerance of fluoroalkyl substitution at ring position-3, a structural change relative to TBZ and DTBZ which combines a change in the size and lipophilicity of the group at ring position-3 with the uncertainty which arises whenever a hydrogen in a biologically active molecule is replaced by fluorine. In addition, the binding constants Ki expressed in nano-molar (nM) concentration units indicate a very high affinity of the alpha-fluoroalkyl compounds of the present invention for the VMAT-2 biomarker. The data obtained for fluoroalkyl tetrabenazine carbinol compounds 38 and 39 illustrate a similar structure-activity principle, namely an unexpected tolerance of fluoroalkyl substitution at ring position-2, as well as the unexpected tolerance for substitution at the hydroxy group at ring position-2. The ensemble of the VMAT-2 binding data gathered for compounds 31, 32 and 2-epi-32 with the VMAT-2 binding data gathered for compounds 38 and 39 supports the proposition that alpha-fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine compounds having structure I and provided by the present invention will also bind to VMAT-2 and serve as useful positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents in studies targeting the VMAT-2 biomarker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVMAT-2 Binding Affinity of Alpha-Fluoroalkyl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds 31, 32 and 2-epi-32, (+) DTBZ 18,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand Fluoroalkyl Tetrabenazine Carbinol Compounds 38 and 39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntry\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nStructure\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9a\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n9b\n\n\n2-epi-32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n9c\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n9d\n\n\n(+)-DTBZ (18)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n9e\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n9f\n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nPreparation of (2R,3R,11bR)-3-(4-fluoro-2,2-dimethylbutyl)-9,10-dimethoxy-2,3,4,6,7,11b-hexahydro-1H-pyrido[2,1-a]isoquinolin-2-yl acetate 40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a solution of 10 mg (27 μmol) of alpha-fluoroalkyl dyhydrotetrabenazine compound 32 in 250 μL of anhydrous dichloromethane at 0° C. is added 4.4 μL (2 equiv., 54 μmol) of anhydrous pyridine followed by 3.1 μL (1.2 equiv., 32.4 μmol) of acetic anhydride.

These and other materials are disclosed herein, and it is understood that when combinations, subsets, interactions, groups, etc. of these materials are disclosed that while specific reference of each various individual and collective combinations and permutation of these compounds may not be explicitly disclosed, each is specifically contemplated and described herein. For example, if a peptide is disclosed and discussed and a number of modifications that can be made to a number of molecules including the peptide are discussed, each and every combination and permutation of peptide and the modifications that are possible are specifically contemplated unless specifically indicated to the contrary. Thus, if a class of molecules A, B, and C are disclosed as well as a class of molecules D, E, and F and an example of a combination molecule, A-D is disclosed, then even if each is not individually recited, each is individually and collectively contemplated. Thus, is this example, each of the combinations A-E, A-F, B-D, B-E, B-F, C-D, C-E, and C-F are specifically contemplated and should be considered disclosed from disclosure of A, B, and C; D, E, and F; and the example combination A-D. Likewise, any subset or combination of these is also specifically contemplated and disclosed. Thus, for example, the sub-group of A-E, B-F, and C-E are specifically contemplated and should be considered disclosed from disclosure of A, B, and C; D, E, and F; and the example combination A-D. This concept applies to all aspects of this application including, but not limited to, steps in methods of making and using the disclosed compositions. Thus, if there are a variety of additional steps that can be performed it is understood that each of these additional steps can be performed with any specific embodiment or combination of embodiments of the disclosed methods, and that each such combination is specifically contemplated and should be considered disclosed.\n\n\nThose skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments of the method and compositions described herein. Such equivalents are intended to be encompassed by the following claims.\n\n\nIt is understood that the disclosed method and compositions are not limited to the particular methodology, protocols, and reagents described as these may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention which will be limited only by the appended claims.\n\n\nA. Compositions\n\n\n1. Proprotein Convertase Inhibitors\n\n\nProvided herein are compounds and compositions that can inhibit protein processing by one or more proprotein convertases (PCs). For example, the disclosed compounds and compositions can inhibit processing of toxins by one or more host proprotein convertases, thus interfering with infection and/or pathology of the pathogen. The disclosed compounds and compositions that inhibit proprotein convertases can be referred to as proprotein convertases.\n\n\nA proprotein convertase inhibitor, as used herein, is any compound or composition that can inhibit the ability of one or more proprotein convertases to cleave one or more of their substrates. For example, a proprotein convertase inhibitor can in some aspects inhibit the ability of furin to cleave a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:24. Proprotein convertase inhibitors can also be referred to as inhibitors of any or all of the respective proprotein convertase against which the inhibitor is effective. Thus, for example, a proprotein convertase inhibitor that can inhibit furin can be referred to as a furin inhibitor. This is the case regardless of whether the inhibitor inhibits only furinor can also inhibit other proprotein convertases.\n\n\nUseful proprotein convertases include peptides. Thus, in some aspects, disclosed are isolated peptides that can inhibit proprotein convertase activity. In some aspects, the disclosed isolated peptide is modeled from the cleavage motif of avian influenza H5 hemagglutinin. Thus, for example, the isolated peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence R-X-R/K-R (SEQ ID NO:24). For example, the isolated peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence X\n1\nRX\n2\nRRRKKRX\n3\n, wherein X\n1 \nis TP (threonine-proline) or TPQ (threonine-proline-glutamine), wherein X\n2 \nis A (alanine) or G (glycine), and X\n3 \nis any or no amino acid (SEQ ID NOs:346, 371, 372 and 373). In preferred aspects, the isolated peptide can be administered to a subject and is therefore non-toxic.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “peptide” is meant to include both short and long amino acid polymers. Thus, the terms “peptide” and “polypeptide” are used interchangeably herein. Thus, the disclosed peptide can be at least about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, or more amino acids in length. Thus, the disclosed peptide can be less than about 100, 95, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, or 15 amino acids in length.\n\n\nOne advantage of the disclosed peptides is the ability to bind proprotein convertases such as furin. In preferred aspects, the disclosed peptides can sequester proprotein convertases such as furin and thereby inhibit processing of toxins by said proprotein convertases. Thus, the disclosed peptide can bind a proprotein convertase such as furin. In some aspects, the disclosed peptide is not cleaved by a proprotein convertase such as furin.\n\n\nNumerous examples of the disclosed peptides are described and provided herein. Thus, for example, provided is a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:5. Also provided is a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:28. Also provided is a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:51. Also provided is a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:94.

Also provided is a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:369. Also provided is a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:370.\n\n\nAlso provided is an isolated peptide comprising 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more of the amino acid sequences disclosed herein. Thus, for example, provided is an isolated peptide comprising 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:28, SEQ ID NO:51, SEQ ID NO:94, SEQ ID NO:142, SEQ ID NO:143, SEQ ID NO:147, SEQ ID NO:148, SEQ ID NO:149, SEQ ID NO:151, SEQ ID NO:153, SEQ ID NO:156, SEQ ID NO:164, SEQ ID NO:204, SEQ ID NO:206, SEQ ID NO:208, SEQ ID NO:209, SEQ ID NO:212, SEQ ID NO:214, SEQ ID NO:215, SEQ ID NO:216, SEQ ID NO:217, SEQ ID NO:222, SEQ ID NO:223, SEQ ID NO:365, SEQ ID NO:366, SEQ ID NO:367, SEQ ID NO:368, SEQ ID NO:369, or SEQ ID NO:370\n\n\nThe sequences can be contiguous or separated by linker sequences. The peptide can be linear or branched.\n\n\nAlso contemplated is the use of amino acid analogues in and/or as part of the disclosed peptides. For example, molecules can be produced that resemble peptides, but which are not connected via a natural peptide linkage. For example, linkages for amino acids or amino acid analogs can include CH\n2\nNH—, —CH\n2\nS—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH═CH—(cis and trans), —COCH\n2\n—, —CH(OH)CH\n2\n—, and —CHH\n2\nSO-(These and others can be found in Spatola, A.

A particularly preferred non-peptide linkage is —CH\n2\nNH—. It is understood that peptide analogs can have more than one atom between the bond atoms, such as b-alanine, g-aminobutyric acid, and the like.\n\n\nAmino acid analogs and peptide analogs often have enhanced or desirable properties, such as more economical production, greater chemical stability, enhanced pharmacological properties (half-life, absorption, potency, efficacy, etc.), altered specificity (e.g., a broad-spectrum of biological activities), reduced antigenicity, and others.\n\n\nD-amino acids can be used to generate more stable peptides, because D amino acids are not recognized by peptidases and such. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) can be used to generate more stable peptides. Cysteine residues can be used to cyclize or attach two or more peptides together. This can be beneficial to constrain peptides into particular conformations. (Rizo and Gierasch Ann. Rev. Biochem. 61:387 (1992), incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nIt has been discovered that the disclosed peptides can inhibit a plurality of proprotein convertases. For example, the disclosed peptides can inhibit two, three, four, five, six or more PCs. The disclosed peptides can inhibit at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, or at least six PCs. As used herein, inhibit in the context of PCs refers to a reduction of cleavage by the PC of a detectable amount in the presence of an inhibitor as compared to a control level of cleavage in the absence of the inhibitor. For example, the activity of a PC can be inhibited by, for example, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more. The activity of a PC can be inhibited by, for example, at least 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%. The activity of a PC can be inhibited by, for example, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%. The activity of a PC when inhibited can be, for example, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% of the control level of activity for the PC. The activity of a PC when inhibited can be, for example, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% or less of the control level of activity for the PC. The activity of a PC when inhibited can be, for example, less than 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% of the control level of activity for the PC. Where a plurality of PCs are inhibited by the disclosed peptides, the different PCs can be inhibited by the same or different amounts. Particularly useful peptides have at least a threshold level of inhibition, inhibit at least a threshold number of PCs, or a combination.\n\n\nThe disclosed peptides can also comprise additional parts, components, moieties or features other than amino acids and amino acid analogues. Any of the peptides disclosed herein can be included or excluded for use as a furin or proprotein convertase inhibitors, either individually or as groups or sets. Thus, for example, the furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (DEC-RVKR-CMK) can be included or excluded.\n\n\nThe proprotein convertase inhibitor also can be a small molecule. For example, small molecule proprotein convertase inhibitors based on 2,5-dideoxystreptamine are disclosed in Jiao, G., et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2006 Dec. 26; 103(52):19707-12).\n\n\nThe proprotein convertase inhibitor also can be an antibody. The term “antibodies” is used herein in a broad sense and includes both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. In addition to intact immunoglobulin molecules, also included in the term “antibodies” are fragments or polymers of those immunoglobulin molecules, and human or humanized versions of immunoglobulin molecules or fragments thereof. The antibodies can be tested for their desired activity using the in vitro assays described herein, or by analogous methods, after which their in vivo therapeutic and/or prophylactic activities are tested according to known clinical testing methods.\n\n\nThe term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies within the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in a small subset of the antibody molecules. The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, as long as they exhibit the desired antagonistic activity (See, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 and Morrison et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n81:6851-6855 (1984)).\n\n\nThe disclosed monoclonal antibodies can be made using any procedure which produces mono clonal antibodies. For example, disclosed monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using hybridoma methods, such as those described by Kohler and Milstein, \nNature, \n256:495 (1975). In a hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal is typically immunized with an immunizing agent to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes can be immunized in vitro, e.g., using the HIV Env-CD4-co-receptor complexes described herein.\n\n\nThe monoclonal antibodies can also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 (Cabilly et al.). DNA encoding the disclosed monoclonal antibodies can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). Libraries of antibodies or active antibody fragments can also be generated and screened using phage display techniques, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,804,440 to Burton et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6,096,441 to Barbas et al.\n\n\nIn vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of antibodies to produce fragments thereof, particularly, Fab fragments, can be accomplished using routine techniques known in the art. For instance, digestion can be performed using papain. Examples of papain digestion are described in WO 94/29348 published Dec. 22, 1994 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,342,566. Papain digestion of antibodies typically produces two identical antigen binding fragments, called Fab fragments, each with a single antigen binding site, and a residual Fc fragment. Pepsin treatment yields a fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.\n\n\nThe fragments, whether attached to other sequences or not, can also include insertions, deletions, substitutions, or other selected modifications of particular regions or specific amino acids residues, provided the activity of the antibody or antibody fragment is not significantly altered or impaired compared to the non-modified antibody or antibody fragment. These modifications can provide for some additional property, such as to remove/add amino acids capable of disulfide bonding, to increase its bio-longevity, to alter its secretory characteristics, etc. In any case, the antibody or antibody fragment must possess a bioactive property, such as specific binding to its cognate antigen. Functional or active regions of the antibody or antibody fragment can be identified by mutagenesis of a specific region of the protein, followed by expression and testing of the expressed polypeptide. Such methods are readily apparent to a skilled practitioner in the art and can include site-specific mutagenesis of the nucleic acid encoding the antibody or antibody fragment. (Zoller, M. J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 3:348-354, 1992).\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “antibody” or “antibodies” can also refer to a human antibody and/or a humanized antibody. Many non-human antibodies (e.g., those derived from mice, rats, or rabbits) are naturally antigenic in humans, and thus can give rise to undesirable immune responses when administered to humans. Therefore, the use of human or humanized antibodies in the methods serves to lessen the chance that an antibody administered to a human will evoke an undesirable immune response.\n\n\n2. Pathogens\n\n\nDisclosed herein is a broad-spectrum therapy against natural and pathogens, such as those involving toxins that require processing by host proprotein convertases (PCs) to enter host cells and to cause disease. Examples of such pathogens are disclosed herein. However, it is understood that other pathogens known or discovered to require processing by proprotein convertases can also be affected by the disclosed compositions and methods.\n\n\nFor example the pathogen can be a bacterial pathogen such as Anthrax, \nPseudomonas, Botulism, Diptheria, Aeromonas\n, or \nShigella\n. Alternatively, the pathogen can be a viral pathogen such as Influenzavirus A, parainfluenza, Sindbis virus, Newcastle disease virus, flavivirus, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus, HIV, Measles virus, infectious bronchitis virus, Coronavirus, Marburg virus, Ebola virus, or Epstein-Barr virus.\n\n\ni. Anthrax\n\n\nAnthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by \nBacillus anthracis\n. There are three types of this disease: cutaneous anthrax, inhalation anthrax, and gastrointestinal anthrax. About 95% of the human anthrax cases in the United States have been in the former category. Cutaneous anthrax develops when a bacterial organism from infected animal tissues becomes deposited under the skin. When a patient does not receive an effective antibiotic, the mortality rate for cutaneous anthrax is 10-20%. With treatment, the mortality rate falls to less than 1%. Inhalation anthrax develops when the bacterial organism is inhaled into the lungs. A progressive infection follows. Since inhalation anthrax is usually not diagnosed in time for treatment, the mortality rate in the United States is 90-100%. A biological attack with anthrax spores delivered by aerosol would cause inhalation anthrax, an extraordinarily rare form of the naturally occurring disease.\n\n\nThe pathogenesis of anthrax is primarily the result of a tripartite toxin. This toxin is composed of three proteins: the protective antigen (PA), the edema factor (EF) and the lethal factor (LF). The three proteins of the anthrax toxin depend on each other for their toxic effect. Each protein is nontoxic on its own, but when combined, these proteins produce the lethal symptoms of anthrax.\n\n\nPA is necessary because both LF and EF function inside cells, but they are too large (90.2 kDa and 88.9 kDa, respectively) to enter via existing channels. Through a series of steps, PA helps to shuttle EF and LF into the cell (\nFIG. 2\n). This process starts when the 83 kDa PA (PA83) monomers bind to the largely ubiquitous human tumor endothelium marker-8 (TEM8) or capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2) receptors. Once bound, a 20 kDa N-terminal fragment (PA20) is cleaved off of PA83 by membrane endoproteases from the furin family, exposing binding sites for LF, EF, and other molecules of cleaved PA. Because of this cleavage the remaining 63 kDa portion (PA63) rapidly oligomerizes to form a heptamer pre-pore, which then associates with up to three molecules of EF and/or LF. The cell then endocytoses the complex and carries it to an acidic compartment, where the low pH causes a conformational change in the PA63 pre-pore that forms a cation-specific channel and allows the EF and LF to enter into the cytosol.\n\n\nOnce in the cytosol, the EF and LF then carry out their respective damage-inducing processes. EF acts as a Ca\n2+\n and calmodulin dependent adenylate cyclase that greatly increases the level of cAMP in the cell. This increase in cAMP upsets water homeostasis, severely throws the intracellular signaling pathways off balance, and impairs macrophage function, allowing the bacteria to further evade the immune system. LF also helps the bacteria evade the immune system through killing macrophages. Once in these cells, LF acts as a Zn\n2+\n-dependent endoprotease that snips off the N-terminus of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKK). This inhibits these kinases by not allowing them to efficiently bind to their substrates, which leads to altered signaling pathways and ultimately to apoptosis. Thus, the synergistic effect of these three proteins leads to cellular death through a cascade of events that allow the proteins to enter the cell and disrupt cellular function.\n\n\nii. \nPseudomonas \n \n\n\n \nPseudomonas aeruginosa \nis a Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium with unipolar motility. An opportunistic pathogen of immunocompromised individuals, \nP. aeruginosa \ntypically infects the pulmonary tract, urinary tract, burns, wounds, and also causes other blood infections. \nPseudomonas \ncan cause community acquired pneumonias albeit it is uncommon, as well as ventilator-associated pneumonias, being one of the most common agents isolated in several studies. Pyocyanin is a virulence factor of the bacteria and has been known to cause death in \nC. elegans \nby oxidative stress. However, research indicates that salicylic acid can inhibit pyocyanin production. One in ten hospital-acquired infections are from \nPseudomonas\n. Cystic fibrosis patients are also predisposed to \nP. aeruginosa \ninfection of the lungs. \nP. aeruginosa \nis also the typical cause of “hot-tub rash” (dermatitis), caused by lack of proper, periodic attention to water quality. The most common cause of burn infections is \nP. aeruginosa. \n \n\n\n \nPseudomonas aeruginosa \nproduces two extracellular protein toxins, Exoenzyme S and Exotoxin A. Exoenzyme S is probably an exotoxin. It has the characteristic subunit structure of the A-component of a bacterial toxin, and it has ADP-ribosylating activity (for a variety of eukaryotic proteins) characteristic of exotoxins. Exoenzyme S is produced by bacteria growing in burned tissue and can be detected in the blood before the bacteria are. It has been suggested that exoenzyme S may act to impair the function of phagocytic cells in the bloodstream and internal organs to prepare for invasion by \nP. aeruginosa. \n \n\n\nExotoxin A has exactly the same mechanism of action as the diphtheria toxin, it causes the ADP ribosylation of \neukaryotic elongation factor\n 2. It is partially-identical to diphtheria toxin, but it is antigenically-distinct. It utilizes a different receptor on host cells, but otherwise it enters cells in the same manner as the diphtheria toxin and it has the exact enzymatic mechanism. Doxtoxin A requires proteolytic cleavage to generate a 37-kDa C-terminal fragment that translocates to the cytosol and ADP-\nribosylates elongation factor\n 2. Cleavage within cells is mediated by furin, occurs between arginine 279 and glycine 280, and requires an arginine at both P1 and P4 residues.\n\n\niii. Gas Gangrene\n\n\n \nClostridium perfringens \nalpha toxin is a toxin produced by the bacterium \nClostridium perfringens \nand is responsible for gas gangrene and myonecrosis in infected tissues. The toxin also possesses hemolytic activity. This toxin has been shown to be the key virulence in infection with \nC. perfringens\n; the bacterium is unable to cause disease without this toxin. Further, vaccination against the alpha toxin toxoid protects mice against \nC. perfringens \ngas gangrene.\n\n\n \nClostridium septicum \nalpha-toxin is secreted as an inactive 46,450-Da protoxin. The protoxin is activated by proteolytic cleavage near the C terminus by furin, which eventually causes the release of a 45-amino-acid fragment. Proteoytic activation and loss of the propeptide allow alpha-toxin to oligomerize and form pores on the plasma membrane, which results in colloidal-osmotic lysis.\n\n\niv. Diphtheria\n\n\n \nCorynebacterium diphtheriae \nis a pathogenic bacterium that causes diphtheria. \nC. diphtheriae \nis a facultatively anaerobic Gram positive organism, characterized by non-encapsulated, non-sporulated, immobile, straight or curved rods with a length of 1 to 8 μm and width of 0.3 to 0.8 μm, which form ramified aggregations in culture (looking like “Chinese characters”). Three subspecies \nare \nrecognized: \nC. diphtheriae mitis, C. diphtheriae intermedius\n, and \nC. diphtheriae gravis\n. The three subspecies differ slightly in their ability to metabolize certain nutrients, but all may be toxigenic (and therefore cause diphtheria) or non-toxigenic.\n\n\nMany strains of \nC. diphtheriae \nproduce diphtheria toxin, a proteic exotoxin, with a molecular weight of 62 kilodaltons which ADP-ribosylates host EF-2, which is responsible for the signs of diphtheria. The inactivation of this toxin with an antitoxic serum (antitoxin) is the basis of the antidiphtheric vaccination. However, not all strains are toxigenic; toxin production is associated with infection of the bacterium by a bacteriophage.\n\n\nProteolytic cleavage (nicking) of diphtheria toxin (DT) in the 14-amino acid loop subtended by the disulfide bond between Cys186 and Cys201 is required for the cytotoxic action of DT. The loop includes the consensus motif for cleavage by a membrane-anchored furin. In agreement, furin cleaves intact DT between Arg103 and Ser194 in vitro. LoVo cells, a human colon carcinoma cell line, do not produce functional furin. Accordingly, intact DT is not cleaved by LoVo cells. The cells are resistant to intact DT, although they are sensitive to DT nicked by furin before it is added to the medium. When intact DT is added to LoVo/Furl cells, a stable transfectant of LoVo cells expressing mouse furin, nicked DT associated with the cells is observed. LoVo/Furl cells are sensitive to both intact and nicked DT. These results indicate that furin is involved in the toxicity of intact DT. Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of intracellular vesicle acidification, did not inhibit cleavage of intact DT by LoVo/Furl or Vero cells, indicating that cleavage can proceed in a neutral environment. Inhibitors of endocytosis decreased DT cleavage but did not eliminate it. Thus, intact DT is cleaved by cell-associated furin on the cell surface as well as in endocytotic vesicles.\n\n\nv. \nAeromonas \n \n\n\nThe \nAeromonadales \nare an order of Proteobacteria, with six genera in two families. \nAeromonas \nis a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rod that morphologically resembles members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Fourteen species of \nAeromonas \nhave been described, most of which have been associated with human diseases. The most important pathoges are \nA. hydrophila, A. caviae\n, and \nA. veronii biovar sobria\n. The organisms are ubiquitous in fresh and brachish water.\n\n\nTwo major diseases associated with \nAeromonas \nare gastroenteritis and wound infections, with or without bacteremia. Gastroentritis typically occurs after the ingestion of contaminated water or food, whereas wound infections result from exposure to contaminated water.\n\n\nBecause of \nAeromonas hydrophila\n's structure, it is very toxic to many organisms. When it enters the body of its victim, it travels through the bloodstream to the first available organ. It produces Aerolysin Cytotoxic Enterotoxin (ACT), a toxin that can cause tissue damage. It is known as a pathogenic bacterium. \nAeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas caviae\n, and \nAeromonas \nsobria are all considered to be “opportunistic pathogens,” meaning they only infect hosts with weakened immune responses. Though \nAeromonas hydrophila \nis considered a pathogenic bacterium, scientists have not been able to prove that it is the actual cause of some of the diseases it is associated with. It is believed that this bacterium aids in the infection of diseases, but do not cause the diseases themselves.\n\n\n \nAeromonas hydrophila \nexcretes extracellular proteins which are toxic to other cells. These are aerolysin, glycerophospholipid:cholesterol acyltransferase (GCAT), and serine protease. Another major chemical that contributes to pathogenicity is hemolysin. Aerolysin is secreted as an inactive dimeric precursor. Proteolytic cleavage within a mobile loop near the C terminus of the protoxin is required for oligomerization and channel formation. This loop contains a sequence that is recognized by mammalian proprotein convertases such as furin, PACE4, and PC5/6A.\n\n\nvi. \nShigella \n \n\n\n \nShigella \nare Gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore forming rod-shaped bacteria closely related to \nEscherichia coli \nand \nSalmonella. Shigella \nspecies are classified by four serogroups: Serogroup A: \nS. dysenteriae \n(12 serotypes), Serogroup B: \nS. flexneri \n(6 serotypes), Serogroup C: \nS. boydii \n(23 serotypes), and Serogroup D: \nS. sonnei \n(1 serotype).\n\n\nShiga toxins are a family of related toxins with two major groups, Stx1 and Stx2, whose genes are considered to be part of the genome of lambdoid prophages. The most common sources for Shiga toxin are the bacteria \nS. dysenteriae \nand the Shigatoxigenic group of \nEscherichia coli \n(STEC). Shiga toxins act to inhibit protein synthesis within target cells by a mechanism similar to that of ricin toxin produced by \nRicinus communis\n. After entering a cell, the protein functions as an N-glycosidase, cleaving several nucleobases from the RNA that comprises the ribosome, thereby halting protein synthesis. The toxin has two subunits—designated A and B—and is one of the AB5 toxins. The B subunit is a pentamer that binds to specific glycolipids on the host cell, specifically globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). Following this, the A subunit is internalised and cleaved into two parts. The A1 component then binds to the ribosome, disrupting protein synthesis.\n\n\nShiga toxin is composed of an enzymatically active A-subunit in non-covalent association with a pentamer of B-subunits responsible for binding to cell surface receptors. The A-subunit is a specific N-glycosidase that cleaves off a single adenine residue from 28 S rRNA of the 60 S ribosomal subunit, resulting in inhibition of the protein synthesis. After binding to cell surface receptors, the toxin is endocytosed from clathrin-coated pits. Shiga toxin A-chain (ST-A) contains 2 cysteines that are linked by a disulfide bond. The loop between the 2 cysteines can be cleaved by Furin, separating the A-chain into A\n1 \n(˜27.5 kDa) and A\n2 \n(˜4.5 kDa) fragments, thus activating the toxin.\n\n\nvii. Influenza A\n\n\nInfluenza, commonly known as flu, is an infectious disease of birds and mammals caused by an RNA virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae (the influenza viruses). In humans, common symptoms of influenza infection are fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, and weakness and fatigue. In more serious cases, influenza causes pneumonia, which can be fatal, particularly in young children and the elderly. Sometimes confused with the common cold, influenza is a much more severe disease and is caused by a different type of virus.\n\n\nTypically, influenza is transmitted from infected mammals through the air by coughs or sneezes, creating aerosols containing the virus, and from infected birds through their droppings. Influenza can also be transmitted by saliva, nasal secretions, feces and blood. Infections occur through contact with these bodily fluids or with contaminated surfaces. Flu viruses can remain infectious for about one week at human body temperature, over 30 days at 0° C. (32° F.), and indefinitely at very low temperatures (such as lakes in northeast Siberia).\n\n\nThe influenza virus is an RNA virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae. There are three types of influenza virus: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, or Influenzavirus C. Influenza A and C infect multiple species, while influenza B almost exclusively infects humans. The type A viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the three influenza types and cause the most severe disease. The Influenza A virus can be subdivided into different serotypes based on the antibody response to these viruses. The serotypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths, are HIN1 (Spanish Flu), H2N2 (Asian Flu), H3N2 (Hong Kong Flu), H5N1 (Avian Flu), H7N7, H1N2, H9N2, H7N2, H7N3, and H10N7.\n\n\nThe influenza A genome is not a single piece of nucleic acid; instead, it contains eight pieces of segmented negative-sense RNA (13.5 kilobases total), which encode 11 proteins (HA, NA, NP, M1, M2, NS1, NEP, PA, PB1, PB1-F2, PB2). The best-characterised of these viral proteins are hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), two large glycoproteins found on the outside of the viral particles. Neuraminidase is an enzyme involved in the release of progeny virus from infected cells, by cleaving sugars that bind the mature viral particles. By contrast, hemagglutinin is a lectin that mediates binding of the virus to target cells and entry of the viral genome into the target cell. The responses of antibodies to these proteins are used to classify the different serotypes of influenza A viruses, hence the H and N in H5N1. There are at least 16 different HA antigens. These subtypes are labeled H1 through H16.\n\n\nAlthough the virulence of avian influenza viruses is polygenic, the susceptibility of the hemagglutinin (HA) to host proteases is the major determinant for this property. That is, influenza virus HA must be cleaved into HA1 and HA2 subunits for the virus to be infectious, as this event generates the amino terminus of HA2, which mediates the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. Lethal and nonlethal avian viruses differ in this mode of activation: the HA of the former is cleaved by the ubiquitous proteases furin and PC6, whereas the HA of the latter is not susceptible to these proteases but rather is cleaved by proteases localized in the respiratory or intestinal organs or both.\n\n\nviii. Flavivirus\n\n\nFlaviviruses are small enveloped viruses with a positive-stranded RNA genome. Several of the members of the genus \nFlavivirus\n, in the family Flaviviridae, are important human pathogens, including Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and the four serotypes of Dengue virus. All of the flaviviruses share very similar structural and functional properties. Their genomic RNA serves as the only viral messenger and encodes all viral proteins in a single long open reading frame. The translation product, a polyprotein, is cleaved by viral and cellular proteases to yield the three structural proteins, C (capsid protein), prM/M (membrane protein and its precursor protein), and E (envelope protein), as well as seven nonstructural proteins. Flavivirus virions consist of a nucleocapsid, which is formed by multiple copies of the basic and mostly alpha-helical protein C encapsulating the genomic RNA, and a surrounding host cell-derived lipid membrane, in which the two surface proteins, prM/M and E, are carboxy-terminally anchored.\n\n\nShortly before or concomitant with the final release of the virion from the cell, the immature virion is converted to its mature form by the proteolytic cleavage of protein prM by the cellular proprotein convertase furin. This cleavage event induces a major structural reorganization of the viral particle. The immature particle with its 60 heterodimeric spikes is transformed into the smooth mature virion, which has 90 homodimers of protein E in an icosahedrally symmetric herringbone pattern. The amino-terminal part of protein prM (often referred to as the “pr” part) is lost when prM is cleaved, leaving only the small 8-kDa carboxy-terminal part, protein M, in the viral particle. The “pr” part of protein prM carries major determinants that are important for its role in protecting protein E during exocytosis.\n\n\nix. HIV\n\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This is a condition in humans in which the immune system begins to fail, leading to life-threatening opportunistic infections. Previous names for the virus include human T-lymphotropic virus-III (HTLV-III), lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV), and AIDS-associated retrovirus (ARV)\n\n\nHIV is different in structure from other retroviruses. It is about 120 nm in diameter (120 billionths of a meter; around 60 times smaller than a red blood cell) and roughly spherical. It is composed of two copies of positive single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7 and enzymes needed for the development of the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle. This is, in turn, surrounded by the viral envelope which is composed of two layers of fatty molecules called phospholipids taken from the membrane of a human cell when a newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. Embedded in the viral envelope are proteins from the host cell and about 70 copies of a complex HIV protein that protrudes through the surface of the virus particle. This protein, known as Env, consists of a cap made of three molecules called glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules that anchor the structure into the viral envelope. This glycoprotein complex enables the virus to attach to and fuse with target cells to initiate the infectious cycle.\n\n\nOf the nine genes that are encoded within the RNA genome, three of these genes, gag, pol, and env, contain information needed to make the structural proteins for new virus particles. env, for example, codes for a protein called gp160 that is broken down by the proprotein convertase furin to form gp120 and gp41. HIV-1 infectivity is strictly dependent on the processing of gp160 to gp120/gp41. The gp120 component promotes the binding of the gp120/gp41 complex to CD4 molecules on target cells, whereas the NH2-\nterminal\n 28 residues of the associated gp41 confer the fusogenic properties of the protein. The processing, and hence the bioactivities of both proproteins, show an absolute dependence on the integrity of the consensus furin site.\n\n\nx. Filoviruses\n\n\nFiloviruses are viruses belonging to the family Filoviridae, which is in the order Mononegavirales. These viruses are single stranded negative sense RNA viruses that target primates. There are two general viruses, the Ebola virus (Ebolavirus, with four species) and the Marburg virus (Marburgvirus).\n\n\nThese viruses cause horrific viral hemorrhagic fevers, characterized by bleeding and coagulation abnormalities including diffuse bleeding. Ebola destroys the immune system in an explosive manner. Marburg virus typically has a mortality rate of at least 25%, while Ebola virus, depending on the species, has a mortality rate of anywhere from 50% to 90%. The virus is spread through bodily fluids. They are classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as \nBiosafety Level\n 4. This means that they are among the most lethal and destructive viruses known to man.\n\n\nEbola virus, a filamentous, enveloped, negative-strand RNA virus in the family Filoviridae, causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. The fourth gene from the 3′ end of its nonsegmented genome encodes two glycoproteins: the nonstructural secretory glycoprotein (SGP), which is secreted from infected cells and is the primary product of the gene, and the envelope glycoprotein (GP), which is responsible for cell binding and penetration of the virus. The latter is expressed by transcriptional editing, resulting in the addition of an extra adenosine within a stretch of seven adenosines in the coding region of GP. These glycoproteins have different proclivities for cell surface molecules. While SGP is reported to bind to neutrophils via the Fcγ receptor and to inhibit early neutrophil activation, GP is thought to contribute to the tissue tropism of Ebola virus, since a murine retroviral vector pseudotyped with Ebola virus GP more efficiently infected endothelial cells, the major targets of filoviruses, than other cell types tested.\n\n\nThe Ebola virus GP undergoes posttranslational proteolytic cleavage by furin into GP1 and GP2, which are covalently linked by disulfide bonds. SGP and GP1 are phagocytosed by macrophages and other APC's when in secreted form. Those peptides are then presented on MHC class II, which elicits a lytic response by CD4 T cells, a result also observed with GP's of HIV, VSV and influenza virus. Endothelial cells may also be subject to lysis by CD4 T cells when expressing SGP or GP1 in MHC II in addition to destruction by viral replication.\n\n\nxi. Parainfluenza\n\n\nHuman parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are a group of four distinct serotypes of single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the paramyxovirus family. They are the second most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in younger children. Repeated infection throughout the life of the host is not uncommon. Symptoms of later breakouts include upper respiratory tract illness as in a cold and sore throat. The incubation period of all four serotypes is 1 to 7 days. Parainfluenza viruses can be detected via cell culture, immunofluorescent microscopy, and PCR.\n\n\nThe four serotypes include: HPIV-1 (most common cause of croup; also other upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses typical), HPIV-2 (causes croup and other upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses), HPIV-3 (associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia), and HPIV-4 (includes subtypes 4a and 4b).\n\n\nParamyxovirus proteins include: nucleocapsid, phosphoprotein, matrix, fusion, attachment proteins, large proteins, and accessory proteins. Nucleocapsid (N) protein associates with genomic RNA (one molecule per hexamer) and protects the RNA from nuclease digestion. The phosphoprotein (P) binds to the N and L proteins and forms part of the RNA polymerase complex. The matrix (M) protein assembles between the envelope and the nucleocapsid core, it organises and maintains virion structure. The fusion (F) protein projects from the envelope surface as a trimer, and mediates cell entry by inducing fusion between the viral envelope and the cell membrane by class I fusion. One of the defining characteristics of members of the paramyxoviridae family is the requirement for a neutral pH for fusogenic activity. The cell attachment proteins span the viral envelope and project from the surface as spikes. They bind to sialic acid on the cell surface and facilitate cell entry. Note that the receptor for measles virus is unknown. Proteins are designated “H” for morbilliviruses and henipaviruses as they possess haemagglutination activity, observed as an ability to cause red blood cells to clump. “HN” attachment proteins occur in respiroviruses and rubulaviruses. These possess both haemagglutination and neuraminidase activity which cleaves sialic acid on the cell surface, preventing viral particles from reattaching to previously infected cells. Attachment proteins with neither haemagglutination nor neuraminidase activity are designated “G” (glycoprotein). These occur in members of pneumovirinae. The large (L) protein is the catalytic subunit of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP). A mechanism known as RNA editing (see Mononegavirales) allows multiple proteins to be produced from the P gene. These are not essential for replication but can aid in survival in vitro or can be involved in regulating the switch from mRNA synthesis to antigenome synthesis.\n\n\nThe fusion (F) protein precursor of virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) has a multibasic amino acid sequence at the cleavage site, and intracellular cleavage activation occurs in a variety of cells.\n\n\nThe fusion (F) protein of HPIV3 contains the tribasic cleavage site R-T-K-R (SEQ ID NO: 364). The endogenous endoprotease present in CV-1 cells cleaves F variants containing the furin recognition motif R-X-K/R-R (SEQ ID NO:24) but not mutant variants containing the dibasic site K-R or a single R at the cleavage site. Peptidylchloromethylketone inhibitors mimicking basic cleavage sites prevent cleavage of the precursor F0 by the endogenous protease only when the furin-specific motif is present in the peptidyl portion. Thus, furin is a cellular protease responsible for the activation of the F protein of HPIV3.\n\n\nxii. Herpes Virus\n\n\nThe Herpesviridae are a large family of DNA viruses that cause diseases in humans and animals. The family name is derived from the Greek herpein (“to creep”), referring to the latent, re-occurring infections typical of this group of viruses. Herpesviridae can cause latent or lytic infections.\n\n\nThere are eight distinct viruses in this family known to cause disease in humans.\n\n\nHHV-1 (Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1)), HHV-2 (Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2)), HHV-3 (Varicella zoster virus (VZV)), HHV-4 (Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), lymphocryptovirus), HHV-5 (Cytomegalovirus (CMV)), HHV-6, -7 (Roseolovirus), and HHV-8 (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ((KSHV)).\n\n\nThe human herpesviruses all share some common properties. One shared property is virus structure—all herpesviruses are composed of relatively large double-stranded, linear DNA genomes encoding 100-200 genes encased within an icosahedral protein cage called the capsid which is itself wrapped in a lipid bilayer membrane called the envelope.\n\n\nHCMV infection requires that a viral envelope glycoprotein(s) and the respective cellular receptor(s) engage in a synchronized series of interactions, ultimately resulting in fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane. Initial attachment of HCMV to permissive host cells is dependent upon the presence of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). The HCMV glycoprotein complex II (gC-II) was described to be the major HCMV envelope protein complex retained on the heparin matrix, while a lesser proportion of glycoprotein B (gB) (also known as gpUL55) was bound.\n\n\nHCMV gB is a 906-amino-acid protein encoded by the UL55 open reading frame. The gB precursor is synthesized as a 105-kDa protein, which matures into a 130- to 160-kDa glycoprotein by acquiring N-linked glycosylation modifications in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi network. The cellular protease furin cleaves the mature gB into two components, a 93- to 116-kDa amino-terminal fragment and a 55-kDa carboxy-terminal fragment. After stable attachment to the cell surface, a direct pH-independent fusion event occurs between the viral envelope and the plasma membrane. Two HCMV envelope glycoprotein complexes, gB and gH-gL (also known as gpUL75-gpUL115), are crucial components in mediating fusion events required for subsequent virus entry. EBV gB contains a consensus furin cleavage site. The enveloped mature EBV contains both full-length and furin-cleaved gB, similar to herpesviruses.\n\n\n3. Proprotein Convertases\n\n\nProprotein convertases (PCs) are enzymes which convert prohormones into hormones. In some aspects, the proprotein covertase of the disclosed method is a subtilisin-like proprotein convertase. Thus, for example, the proprotein convertase can be Furin (SPC1, PACE, PCSK3), PC2 (SPC2, PCSK2), PC1/3 (SPC3, PC1, PC3, PCSK1), PACE4 (SPC4, PCSK6), PC4, (SPC5, PCSK4), PC5/6 (SPC6, PC5, PC6, PCSK5), or PC7 (SPC7, PC8, LPC, PCSK7).\n\n\nFurin is a protease of animal cells that is similar in structure to the bacterial protease subtilisin. Furin is enriched in the Golgi apparatus, where it functions to cleave other proteins into their mature/active forms. Furin cleaves proteins just downstream of a basic amino acid target sequence (canonically, Arg-X-(Arg/Lys)-Arg; SEQ ID NO:24). In addition to processing cellular precursor proteins, furin is also utilized by a number of pathogens. For example, the envelope proteins of viruses such as HIV, influenza and dengue fever viruses must be cleaved by furin or furin-like proteases to become fully functional. Anthrax toxin, pseudomonas exotoxin and papillomaviruses must be processed by furin during their initial entry into host cells.\n\n\nIn some aspects, the toxin of the disclosed method can be any toxin that is cleaved by a proprotein convertase. In further aspects, the toxin of the disclosed method can be any toxin that is cleaved by a subtilisin-like endoprotease. In further aspects, the toxin of the disclosed method can be any toxin that is cleaved by furin. Thus, the toxin of the disclosed method can be Influenza A H5N1 hemagglutin type H5 protein, Newcastle disease virus F fusion protein, parainfluenza HPIV3 F protein, Sindbis virus structural polyprotein p130, cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B (gpUL55), HIV-1 glycoprotein-160, Measles virus fusion protein, infectious bronchitis spike protein, Marburg virus spike glycoprotein, Ebola envelope glycoprotein, Epstein-Barr virus glycoprotein gp100, \nPseudomonas aeruginosa \nexotoxin A, Anthrax protective antigen, Botulinum toxin, Clostridium alpha-toxin, Diphtheria toxin, \nAeromonas aerolysin\n, and \nShigella shiga \ntoxin, Borna disease p57/gp94, flaviviral prM protein, Mumps virus F glycoprotein, Varicella zoster gpII, Bovine leukemia gp72, Rous sarcoma env protein, and respiratory syncytial F protein.\n\n\nIn some aspects, the pathogen can be any pathogen that produces a toxin cleaved by a proprotein convertase. In some aspects, the pathogen can be any pathogen that produces a toxin cleaved by a subtilisin-like endoprotease. Thus, the pathogen can be any pathogen that produces a toxin cleaved by furin (SPC1, PACE, PCSK3). The pathogen can be any pathogen that produces a toxin cleaved by PC2 (SPC2, PCSK2). The pathogen can be any pathogen that produces a toxin cleaved by PC1/3 (SPC3, PC1, PC3, PCSK1). The pathogen can be any pathogen that produces a toxin cleaved by PACE4 (SPC4, PCSK6).

The provided polypeptide can further comprise BGSC (Bis-Guanidinium-Spermidine-Cholesterol) or BGTC (Bis-Guanidinium-Tren-Cholesterol) (Vigneron, J. P. et al. 1998. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 93, 9682-9686). The preceding references are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for the teachings of cellular internalization vectors and sequences. Any other internalization sequences now known or later identified can be combined with a polypeptide disclosed herein.\n\n\n8. Carriers\n\n\nThe disclosed proprotein convertase inhibitors can be combined, conjugated or coupled with or to carriers and other compositions to aid administration, delivery or other aspects of the inhibitors and their use. For convenience, such composition will be referred to herein as carriers. Carriers can, for example, be a small molecule, pharmaceutical drug, fatty acid, detectable marker, conjugating tag, nanoparticle, or enzyme.\n\n\nThe carrier can be any substance that can be used with the disclosed inhibitors, and is not restricted by size or substance. Examples include, but are not limited to, nanoparticles (such as silica nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles or albumin nanoparticles), liposomes, small organic molecules, microparticles, or microbubbles, such as fluorocarbon microbubbles. The term carrier is used to identify a component of the disclosed conjugate but is not intended to be limiting. In particular, the disclosed carriers are not limited to substances, compounds, compositions, particles or other materials composed of a single molecule. Rather, the disclosed carriers are any substance(s), compound(s), composition(s), particle(s) and/or other material(s) that can be conjugated with one or more PC inhibitors. A variety of examples of suitable carriers are described and disclosed herein.\n\n\nThe disclosed compositions can be used therapeutically in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. By “pharmaceutically acceptable” is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the material can be administered to a subject, along with the composition, without causing any undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the pharmaceutical composition in which it is contained. The carrier would naturally be selected to minimize any degradation of the active ingredient and to minimize any adverse side effects in the subject, as would be well known to one of skill in the art.\n\n\nSuitable carriers and their formulations are described in \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy \n(19th ed.) ed. A. R. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. 1995. Typically, an appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt is used in the formulation to render the formulation isotonic. Examples of the pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier include, but are not limited to, saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. The pH of the solution is preferably from about 5 to about 8, and more preferably from about 7 to about 7.5. Further carriers include sustained release preparations such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, liposomes or microparticles. It will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art that certain carriers may be more preferable depending upon, for instance, the route of administration and concentration of composition being administered.\n\n\nPharmaceutical carriers are known to those skilled in the art. These most typically would be standard carriers for administration of drugs to humans, including solutions such as sterile water, saline, and buffered solutions at physiological pH. The compositions can be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Other compounds can be administered according to standard procedures used by those skilled in the art.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions can include carriers, thickeners, diluents, buffers, preservatives, surface active agents and the like in addition to the molecule of choice. Pharmaceutical compositions can also include one or more active ingredients such as antimicrobial agents, antiinflammatory agents, anesthetics, and the like.\n\n\nPreparations for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's, or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers (such as those based on Ringer's dextrose), and the like. Preservatives and other additives can also be present such as, for example, antimicrobials, anti-oxidants, chelating agents, and inert gases and the like.\n\n\nFormulations for topical administration can include ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable.\n\n\nCompositions for oral administration include powders or granules, suspensions or solutions in water or non-aqueous media, capsules, sachets, or tablets. Thickeners, flavorings, diluents, emulsifiers, dispersing aids or binders may be desirable. Some of the compositions can be administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid- or base-addition salt, formed by reaction with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, perchloric acid, nitric acid, thiocyanic acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid, and organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, and fumaric acid, or by reaction with an inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and organic bases such as mono-, di-, trialkyl and aryl amines and substituted ethanolamines.\n\n\nThe materials may be in solution, suspension (for example, incorporated into microparticles, liposomes, or cells). These may be targeted to a particular cell type via antibodies, receptors, or receptor ligands. The following references are examples of the use of this technology to target specific proteins to tumor tissue (Senter, et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 2:447-451, (1991); Bagshawe, K. D., Br. J. Cancer, 60:275-281, (1989); Bagshawe, et al., Br. J. Cancer, 58:700-703, (1988); Senter, et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 4:3-9, (1993); Battelli, et al., Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 35:421-425, (1992); Pietersz and McKenzie, Immunolog. Reviews, 129:57-80, (1992); and Roffler, et al., Biochem. Pharmacol, 42:2062-2065, (1991)). Vehicles such as “stealth” and other antibody conjugated liposomes (including lipid mediated drug targeting to colonic carcinoma), receptor mediated targeting of DNA through cell specific ligands, lymphocyte directed tumor targeting, and highly specific therapeutic retroviral targeting of murine glioma cells in vivo. The following references are examples of the use of this technology to target specific proteins to tumor tissue (Hughes et al., Cancer Research, 49:6214-6220, (1989); and Litzinger and Huang, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1104:179-187, (1992)). In general, receptors are involved in pathways of endocytosis, either constitutive or ligand induced. These receptors cluster in clathrin-coated pits, enter the cell via clathrin-coated vesicles, pass through an acidified endosome in which the receptors are sorted, and then either recycle to the cell surface, become stored intracellularly, or are degraded in lysosomes. The internalization pathways serve a variety of functions, such as nutrient uptake, removal of activated proteins, clearance of macromolecules, opportunistic entry of viruses and toxins, dissociation and degradation of ligand, and receptor-level regulation. Many receptors follow more than one intracellular pathway, depending on the cell type, receptor concentration, type of ligand, ligand valency, and ligand concentration. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of receptor-mediated endocytosis has been reviewed (Brown and Greene, DNA and Cell Biology 10:6, 399-409 (1991)). The carrier molecule can be covalently linked to the disclosed inhibitors. The carrier molecule can be linked to the amino terminal end of the disclosed peptides. The carrier molecule can be linked to the carboxy terminal end of the disclosed peptides. The carrier molecule can be linked to an amino acid within the disclosed peptides. The herein provided compositions can further comprise a linker connecting the carrier molecule and disclosed inhibitors. The disclosed inhibitors can also be conjugated to a coating molecule such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) (see Tkachenko et al., (2003) J Am Chem Soc, 125, 4700-4701) that can be used to coat microparticles, nanoparticles of nanoshells with the inhibitors.\n\n\nProtein crosslinkers that can be used to crosslink the carrier molecule to the inhibitors, such as the disclosed peptides, are known in the art and are defined based on utility and structure and include DSS (Disuccinimidylsuberate), DSP (Dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate)), DTSSP (3,3′-Dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidylpropionate)), SULFO BSOCOES (Bis[2-(sulfosuccinimdooxycarbonyloxy) ethyl]sulfone), BSOCOES (Bis[2-(succinimdooxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone), SULFO DST (Disulfosuccinimdyltartrate), DST (Disuccinimdyltartrate), SULFO EGS (Ethylene glycolbis(succinimidylsuccinate)), EGS (Ethylene glycolbis(sulfosuccinimidylsuccinate)), DPDPB (1,2-Di[3′-(2′-pyridyldithio) propionamido]butane), BSSS (Bis(sulfosuccinimdyl) suberate), SMPB (Succinimidyl-4-(p-maleimidophenyl) butyrate), SULFO SMPB (Sulfosuccinimdyl-4-(p-maleimidophenyl) butyrate), MBS (3-Maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester), SULFO MBS (3-Maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester), SIAB (N-Succinimidyl(4-iodoacetyl) aminobenzoate), SULFO SLAB (N-Sulfosuccinimidyl(4-iodoacetyl)aminobenzoate), SMCC (Succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate), SULFO SMCC (Sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate), NHS LC SPDP (Succinimidyl-6-[3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionamido) hexanoate), SULFO NHS LC SPDP (Sulfosuccinimidyl-6-[3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionamido) hexanoate), SPDP(N-Succinimdyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate), NHS BROMOACETATE (N-Hydroxysuccinimidylbromoacetate), NHS IODOACETATE (N-Hydroxysuccinimidyliodoacetate), MPBH (4-(N-Maleimidophenyl) butyric acid hydrazide hydrochloride), MCCH (4-(N-Maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid hydrazide hydrochloride), MBH (m-Maleimidobenzoic acid hydrazidehydrochloride), SULFO EMCS(N-(epsilon-Maleimidocaproyloxy) sulfosuccinimide), EMCS(N-(epsilon-Maleimidocaproyloxy) succinimide), PMPI (N-(p-Maleimidophenyl) isocyanate), KMUH (N-(kappa-Maleimidoundecanoic acid) hydrazide), LC SMCC (Succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxy(6-amidocaproate)), SULFO GMBS (N-(gamma-Maleimidobutryloxy) sulfosuccinimide ester), SMPH (Succinimidyl-6-(beta-maleimidopropionamidohexanoate)), SULFO KMUS (N-(kappa-Maleimidoundecanoyloxy)sulfosuccinimide ester), GMBS (N-(gamma-Maleimidobutyrloxy) succinimide), DMP (Dimethylpimelimidate hydrochloride), DMS (Dimethylsuberimidate hydrochloride), MHBH(Wood's Reagent) (Methyl-p-hydroxybenzimidate hydrochloride, 98%), DMA (Dimethyladipimidate hydrochloride).\n\n\nGiven that cell surface-associated PCs in bronchial epithelial cells are the first to encounter inhaled pathogens, it was realized that for of the disclosed inhibitor compositions suitable for inhalation was desirable. Attaching PC inhibitors to nanoparticles are one useful form of such compositions.\n\n\ni. Nanoparticles, Microparticles, and Microbubbles\n\n\nThe term “nanoparticle” refers to a nanoscale particle with a size that is measured in nanometers, for example, a nanoscopic particle that has at least one dimension of less than about 100 nm. Examples of nanoparticles include paramagnetic nanoparticles, superparamagnetic nanoparticles, metal nanoparticles, fullerene-like materials, inorganic nanotubes, dendrimers (such as with covalently attached metal chelates), nanofibers, nanohoms, nano-onions, nanorods, nanoropes and quantum dots. A nanoparticle can produce a detectable signal, for example, through absorption and/or emission of photons (including radio frequency and visible photons) and plasmon resonance.\n\n\nMicrospheres (or microbubbles) can also be used with the methods disclosed herein. Microspheres containing chromophores have been utilized in an extensive variety of applications, including photonic crystals, biological labeling, and flow visualization in microfluidic channels. See, for example, Y. Lin, et al., Appl. Phys Lett. 2002, 81, 3134; D. Wang, et al., Chem. Mater. 2003, 15, 2724; X. Gao, et al., J. Biomed. Opt. 2002, 7, 532; M. Han, et al., Nature Biotechnology. 2001, 19, 631; V. M. Pai, et al., Mag. & Magnetic Mater. 1999, 194, 262, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Both the photostability of the chromophores and the monodispersity of the microspheres can be important.\n\n\nNanoparticles, such as, for example, silica nanoparticles, metal nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles, or semiconductor nanocrystals can be incorporated into microspheres. The optical, magnetic, and electronic properties of the nanoparticles can allow them to be observed while associated with the microspheres and can allow the microspheres to be identified and spatially monitored. For example, the high photostability, good fluorescence efficiency and wide emission tunability of colloidally synthesized semiconductor nanocrystals can make them an excellent choice of chromophore. Unlike organic dyes, nanocrystals that emit different colors (i.e. different wavelengths) can be excited simultaneously with a single light source. Colloidally synthesized semiconductor nanocrystals (such as, for example, core-shell CdSe/ZnS and CdS/ZnS nanocrystals) can be incorporated into microspheres. The microspheres can be monodisperse silica microspheres.\n\n\nThe nanoparticle can be a metal nanoparticle, a metal oxide nanoparticle, or a semiconductor nanocrystal. The metal of the metal nanoparticle or the metal oxide nanoparticle can include titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, technetium, rhenium, iron, ruthenium, osmium, cobalt, rhodium, iridium, nickel, palladium, platinum, copper, silver, gold, zinc, cadmium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, a lanthanide series or actinide series element (e.g., cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, thorium, protactinium, and uranium), boron, aluminum, gallium, indium, thallium, silicon, germanium, tin, lead, antimony, bismuth, polonium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium. In certain embodiments, the metal can be iron, ruthenium, cobalt, rhodium, nickel, palladium, platinum, silver, gold, cerium or samarium. The metal oxide can be an oxide of any of these materials or combination of materials. For example, the metal can be gold, or the metal oxide can be an iron oxide, a cobalt oxide, a zinc oxide, a cerium oxide, or a titanium oxide. Preparation of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,897,945 and 6,759,199, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nFor example, PC inhibitors such as the disclosed peptides can be immobilized on silica nanoparticles (SNPs). SNPs have been widely used for biosensing and catalytic applications owing to their favorable surface area-to-volume ratio, straightforward manufacture and the possibility of attaching fluorescent labels, magnetic nanoparticles (Yang, H. H. et al. 2005) and semiconducting nanocrystals (Lin, Y. W., et al. 2006). When peptides with a GGG linker (\nFIG. 1A\n) were immobilized on 15-nm diameter 4-formylbenzoyl chloride-activated SNPs with a density of ˜100 peptide molecules/SNP, it was found that the inhibitory efficacy (on a molar basis) of the immobilized peptides against furin was similar to that of the soluble peptides (\nFIGS. 2B\n and C). Furthermore, SNPs showed no cell toxicity, even at high concentrations [e.g., 50 nM SNPs (3×10\n17 \nSNP particles)/100,000 cells].\n\n\nThe nanoparticle can also be, for example, a heat generating nanoshell. As used herein, “nanoshell” is a nanoparticle having a discrete dielectric or semi-conducting core section surrounded by one or more conducting shell layers. U.S. Pat. No. 6,530,944 is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for its teaching of the methods of making and using metal nanoshells. Targeting molecules can be attached to the disclosed compositions and/or carriers. For example, the targeting molecules can be antibodies or fragments thereof, ligands for specific receptors, or other proteins specifically binding to the surface of the cells to be targeted.\n\n\nii. Liposomes\n\n\n“Liposome” as the term is used herein refers to a structure comprising an outer lipid bi- or multi-layer membrane surrounding an internal aqueous space. Liposomes can be used to package any biologically active agent for delivery to cells.\n\n\nMaterials and procedures for forming liposomes are well-known to those skilled in the art. Upon dispersion in an appropriate medium, a wide variety of phospholipids swell, hydrate and form multilamellar concentric bilayer vesicles with layers of aqueous media separating the lipid bilayers. These systems are referred to as multilamellar liposomes or multilamellar lipid vesicles (“MLVs”) and have diameters within the range of 10 nm to 100 μm. These MLVs were first described by Bangham, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 13:238-252 (1965). In general, lipids or lipophilic substances are dissolved in an organic solvent. When the solvent is removed, such as under vacuum by rotary evaporation, the lipid residue forms a film on the wall of the container. An aqueous solution that typically contains electrolytes or hydrophilic biologically active materials is then added to the film. Large MLVs are produced upon agitation. When smaller MLVs are desired, the larger vesicles are subjected to sonication, sequential filtration through filters with decreasing pore size or reduced by other forms of mechanical shearing. There are also techniques by which MLVs can be reduced both in size and in number of lamellae, for example, by pressurized extrusion (Barenholz, et al., FEBS Lett. 99:210-214 (1979)).\n\n\nLiposomes can also take the form of unilamnellar vesicles, which are prepared by more extensive sonication of MLVs, and consist of a single spherical lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous solution. Unilamellar vesicles (“ULVs”) can be small, having diameters within the range of 20 to 200 nm, while larger ULVs can have diameters within the range of 200 nm to 2 μm. There are several well-known techniques for making unilamellar vesicles. In Papahadjopoulos, et al., Biochim et Biophys Acta 135:624-238 (1968), sonication of an aqueous dispersion of phospholipids produces small ULVs having a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous solution. Schneider, U.S. Pat. No. 4,089,801 describes the formation of liposome precursors by ultrasonication, followed by the addition of an aqueous medium containing amphiphilic compounds and centrifugation to form a biomolecular lipid layer system.\n\n\nSmall ULVs can also be prepared by the ethanol injection technique described by Batzri, et al., Biochim et Biophys Acta 298:1015-1019 (1973) and the ether injection technique of Deamer, et al., Biochim et Biophys Acta 443:629-634 (1976). These methods involve the rapid injection of an organic solution of lipids into a buffer solution, which results in the rapid formation of unilamellar liposomes. Another technique for making ULVs is taught by Weder, et al. in “Liposome Technology”, ed. G. Gregoriadis, CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, Fla., Vol. 1, \nChapter\n 7, pg. 79-107 (1984). This detergent removal method involves solubilizing the lipids and additives with detergents by agitation or sonication to produce the desired vesicles.\n\n\nPapahadjopoulos, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,235,871, describes the preparation of large ULVs by a reverse phase evaporation technique that involves the formation of a water-in-oil emulsion of lipids in an organic solvent and the drug to be encapsulated in an aqueous buffer solution. The organic solvent is removed under pressure to yield a mixture which, upon agitation or dispersion in an aqueous media, is converted to large ULVs. Suzuki et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,016,100, describes another method of encapsulating agents in unilamellar vesicles by freezing/thawing an aqueous phospholipid dispersion of the agent and lipids.\n\n\nIn addition to the MLVs and ULVs, liposomes can also be multivesicular. Described in Kim, et al., Biochim et Biophys Acta 728:339-348 (1983), these multivesicular liposomes are spherical and contain internal granular structures. The outer membrane is a lipid bilayer and the internal region contains small compartments separated by bilayer septum. Still yet another type of liposomes are oligolamellar vesicles (“OLVs”), which have a large center compartment surrounded by several peripheral lipid layers. These vesicles, having a diameter of 2-15 μm, are described in Callo, et al., Cryobiology 22(3):251-267 (1985).\n\n\nMezei, et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,054 and 4,761,288 also describe methods of preparing lipid vesicles. More recently, Hsu, U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,996 describes a method of preparing liposomes utilizing aerosolization and Yiournas, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,497 describes a method for preparing liposomes utilizing a high velocity-shear mixing chamber. Methods are also described that use specific starting materials to produce ULVs (Wallach, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,853,228) or OLVs (Wallach, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,474,848 and 5,628,936).\n\n\nA comprehensive review of all the aforementioned lipid vesicles and methods for their preparation are described in “Liposome Technology”, ed. G. Gregoriadis, CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, Fla., Vol. 1, II & III (1984). This and the aforementioned references describing various lipid vesicles suitable for use in the invention are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nFatty acids (i.e., lipids) that can be conjugated to the provided compositions include those that allow the efficient incorporation of the proprotein convertase inhibitors into liposomes. Generally, the fatty acid is a polar lipid. Thus, the fatty acid can be a phospholipid The provided compositions can comprise either natural or synthetic phospholipid. The phospholipids can be selected from phospholipids containing saturated or unsaturated mono or disubstituted fatty acids and combinations thereof. These phospholipids can be dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, dioleoylphosphatidylserine, dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol, dioleoylphosphatidic acid, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylserine, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, palmitoyloleoylphophatidylglycerol, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidic acid, pahnitelaidoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine, palmitelaidoyloleoylphosphatidylserine, palmitelaidoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, palmitelaidoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol, pahnitelaidoyloleoylphosphatidic acid, myristoleoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine, myristoleoyloleoylphosphatidylserine, myristoleoyloleoylphosphatidylethanoamine, myristoleoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol, myristoleoyloleoylphosphatidic acid, dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine, dilinoleoylphosphatidylserine, dilinoleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, dilinoleoylphosphatidylglycerol, dilinoleoylphosphatidic acid, palmiticlinoleoylphosphatidylcholine, palmiticlinoleoylphosphatidylserine, palmiticlinoleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, palmiticlinoleoylphosphatidylglycerol, palmiticlinoleoylphosphatidic acid. These phospholipids may also be the monoacylated derivatives of phosphatidylcholine (lysophophatidylidylcholine), phosphatidylserine (lysophosphatidylserine), phosphatidylethanolamine (lysophosphatidylethanolamine), phophatidylglycerol (lysophosphatidylglycerol) and phosphatidic acid (lysophosphatidic acid). The monoacyl chain in these lysophosphatidyl derivatives may be palimtoyl, oleoyl, palmitoleoyl, linoleoyl myristoyl or myristoleoyl. The phospholipids can also be synthetic. Synthetic phospholipids are readily available commercially from various sources, such as AVANTI Polar Lipids (Albaster, Ala.); Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, Mo.). These synthetic compounds may be varied and may have variations in their fatty acid side chains not found in naturally occurring phospholipids. The fatty acid can have unsaturated fatty acid side chains with C14, C16, C18 or C20 chains length in either or both the PS or PC. Synthetic phospholipids can have dioleoyl (18:1)-PS; palmitoyl (16:0)-oleoyl (18:1)-PS, dimyristoyl (14:0)-PS; dipalmitoleoyl (16:1)-PC, dipalmitoyl (16:0)-PC, dioleoyl (18:1)-PC, palmitoyl (16:0)-oleoyl (18:1)-PC, and myristoyl (14:0)-oleoyl (18:1)-PC as constituents. Thus, as an example, the provided compositions can comprise palmitoyl 16:0.\n\n\niii. In Vivo/Ex Vivo\n\n\nAs described above, the compositions can be administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and can be delivered to the subject's cells in vivo and/or ex vivo by a variety of mechanisms well known in the art (e.g., uptake of naked DNA, liposome fusion, intramuscular injection of DNA via a gene gun, endocytosis and the like).\n\n\nIf ex vivo methods are employed, cells or tissues can be removed and maintained outside the body according to standard protocols well known in the art. The compositions can be introduced into the cells via any gene transfer mechanism, such as, for example, calcium phosphate mediated gene delivery, electroporation, microinjection or proteoliposomes. The transduced cells can then be infused (e.g., in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier) or homotopically transplanted back into the subject per standard methods for the cell or tissue type. Standard methods are known for transplantation or infusion of various cells into a subject.\n\n\n9. Nucleic Acids\n\n\nAlso provided is an isolated nucleic acid encoding any one or more of the disclosed peptides. Thus, for example, provided is an isolated nucleic acid encoding one or more peptides comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:28, SEQ ID NO:51, SEQ ID NO:94, SEQ ID NO:142, SEQ ID NO:143, SEQ ID NO:147, SEQ ID NO:148, SEQ ID NO:149, SEQ ID NO:151, SEQ ID NO:153, SEQ ID NO:156, SEQ ID NO:164, SEQ ID NO:204, SEQ ID NO:206, SEQ ID NO:208, SEQ ID NO:209, SEQ ID NO:212, SEQ ID NO:214, SEQ ID NO:215, SEQ ID NO:216, SEQ ID NO:217, SEQ ID NO:222, SEQ ID NO:223, SEQ ID NO:365, SEQ ID NO:366, SEQ ID NO:367, SEQ ID NO:368, SEQ ID NO:369, SEQ ID NO:370, or a combination thereof.\n\n\nThe disclosed nucleic acids can be made up of, for example, nucleotides, nucleotide analogs, or nucleotide substitutes. Non-limiting examples of these and other molecules are discussed herein. It is understood that, for example, when a vector is expressed in a cell, the expressed mRNA will typically be made up of A, C, G, and U. Likewise, it is understood that if, for example, an antisense molecule is introduced into a cell or cell environment through for example exogenous delivery, it is advantageous that the antisense molecule be made up of nucleotide analogs that reduce the degradation of the antisense molecule in the cellular environment.\n\n\nA nucleotide is a molecule that contains a base moiety, a sugar moiety and a phosphate moiety. Nucleotides can be linked together through their phosphate moieties and sugar moieties creating an internucleoside linkage. The base moiety of a nucleotide can be adenin-9-yl (A), cytosin-1-yl (C), guanin-9-yl (G), uracil-1-yl (U), and thymin-1-yl (T). The sugar moiety of a nucleotide is a ribose or a deoxyribose. The phosphate moiety of a nucleotide is pentavalent phosphate. An non-limiting example of a nucleotide would be 3′-AMP (3′-adenosine monophosphate) or 5′-GMP (5′-guanosine monophosphate). There are many varieties of these types of molecules available in the art and available herein.\n\n\nA nucleotide analog is a nucleotide which contains some type of modification to either the base, sugar, or phosphate moieties. Modifications to nucleotides are well known in the art and would include for example, 5-methylcytosine (5-me-C), 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, and 2-aminoadenine as well as modifications at the sugar or phosphate moieties. There are many varieties of these types of molecules available in the art and available herein.\n\n\nNucleotide substitutes are molecules having similar functional properties to nucleotides, but which do not contain a phosphate moiety, such as peptide nucleic acid (PNA). Nucleotide substitutes are molecules that will recognize nucleic acids in a Watson-Crick or Hoogsteen manner, but which are linked together through a moiety other than a phosphate moiety. Nucleotide substitutes are able to conform to a double helix type structure when interacting with the appropriate target nucleic acid. There are many varieties of these types of molecules available in the art and available herein.\n\n\nIt is also possible to link other types of molecules (conjugates) to nucleotides or nucleotide analogs to enhance for example, cellular uptake. Conjugates can be chemically linked to the nucleotide or nucleotide analogs. Such conjugates include but are not limited to lipid moieties such as a cholesterol moiety. (Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1989, 86, 6553-6556). There are many varieties of these types of molecules available in the art and available herein.\n\n\nA Watson-Crick interaction is at least one interaction with the Watson-Crick face of a nucleotide, nucleotide analog, or nucleotide substitute. The Watson-Crick face of a nucleotide, nucleotide analog, or nucleotide substitute includes the C2, N1, and C6 positions of a purine based nucleotide, nucleotide analog, or nucleotide substitute and the C2, N3, C4 positions of a pyrimidine based nucleotide, nucleotide analog, or nucleotide substitute.\n\n\nA Hoogsteen interaction is the interaction that takes place on the Hoogsteen face of a nucleotide or nucleotide analog, which is exposed in the major groove of duplex DNA. The Hoogsteen face includes the N7 position and reactive groups (NH2 or O) at the C6 position of purine nucleotides.\n\n\n10. Nucleic Acid Delivery Systems\n\n\nAlso provided herein are vectors comprising nucleic acids that encode the disclosed peptides. These vectors can be used to recombinantly express the peptides either in vitro or in vivo. There are a number of compositions and methods which can be used to deliver nucleic acids to cells, either in vitro or in vivo. These methods and compositions can largely be broken down into two classes: viral based delivery systems and non-viral based delivery systems. For example, the nucleic acids can be delivered through a number of direct delivery systems such as, electroporation, lipofection, calcium phosphate precipitation, plasmids, viral vectors, viral nucleic acids, phage nucleic acids, phages, cosmids, or via transfer of genetic material in cells or carriers such as cationic liposomes. Appropriate means for transfection, including viral vectors, chemical transfectants, or physico-mechanical methods such as electroporation and direct diffusion of DNA, are described by, for example, Wolff, J. A., et al., Science, 247, 1465-1468, (1990); and Wolff, J. A. Nature, 352, 815-818, (1991). Such methods are well known in the art and readily adaptable for use with the compositions and methods described herein. In certain cases, the methods will be modified to specifically function with large DNA molecules. Further, these methods can be used to target certain diseases and cell populations by using the targeting characteristics of the carrier.\n\n\nTransfer vectors can be any nucleotide construction used to deliver genes into cells (e.g., a plasmid), or as part of a general strategy to deliver genes, e.g., as part of recombinant retrovirus or adenovirus (Ram et al. Cancer Res. 53:83-88, (1993)).\n\n\nAs used herein, plasmid or viral vectors are agents that transport the disclosed nucleic acids into the cell without degradation and include a promoter yielding expression of the gene in the cells into which it is delivered. In some embodiments the vectors are derived from either a virus or a retrovirus. Viral vectors are, for example, Adenovirus, Adeno-associated virus, Herpes virus, Vaccinia virus, Polio virus, AIDS virus, neuronal trophic virus, Sindbis and other RNA viruses, including these viruses with the HIV backbone. Also preferred are any viral families which share the properties of these viruses which make them suitable for use as vectors. Retroviruses include Murine Maloney Leukemia virus, MMLV, and retroviruses that express the desirable properties of MMLV as a vector. Retroviral vectors are able to carry a larger genetic payload, i.e., a transgene or marker gene, than other viral vectors, and for this reason are a commonly used vector. However, they are not as useful in non-proliferating cells. Adenovirus vectors are relatively stable and easy to work with, have high titers, and can be delivered in aerosol formulation, and can transfect non-dividing cells. Pox viral vectors are large and have several sites for inserting genes, they are thermostable and can be stored at room temperature. A preferred embodiment is a viral vector which has been engineered so as to suppress the immune response of the host organism, elicited by the viral antigens. Preferred vectors of this type will carry coding regions for Interleukin 8 or 10.\n\n\nViral vectors can have higher transaction (ability to introduce genes) abilities than chemical or physical methods to introduce genes into cells. Typically, viral vectors contain, nonstructural early genes, structural late genes, an RNA polymerase III transcript, inverted terminal repeats necessary for replication and encapsidation, and promoters to control the transcription and replication of the viral genome. When engineered as vectors, viruses typically have one or more of the early genes removed and a gene or gene/promotor cassette is inserted into the viral genome in place of the removed viral DNA. Constructs of this type can carry up to about 8 kb of foreign genetic material. The necessary functions of the removed early genes are typically supplied by cell lines which have been engineered to express the gene products of the early genes in trans.\n\n\na. Retroviral Vectors\n\n\nA retrovirus is an animal virus belonging to the virus family of Retroviridae, including any types, subfamilies, genus, or tropisms. Retroviral vectors, in general, are described by Verma, I. M., Retroviral vectors for gene transfer. In Microbiology-1985, American Society for Microbiology, pp. 229-232, Washington, (1985), which is incorporated by reference herein. Examples of methods for using retroviral vectors for gene therapy are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,868,116 and 4,980,286; PCT applications WO 90/02806 and WO 89/07136; and Mulligan, (Science 260:926-932 (1993)); the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nA retrovirus is essentially a package which has packed into it nucleic acid cargo. The nucleic acid cargo carries with it a packaging signal, which ensures that the replicated daughter molecules will be efficiently packaged within the package coat. In addition to the package signal, there are a number of molecules which are needed in cis, for the replication, and packaging of the replicated virus. Typically a retroviral genome, contains the gag, pol, and env genes which are involved in the making of the protein coat. It is the gag, pol, and env genes which are typically replaced by the foreign DNA that it is to be transferred to the target cell. Retrovirus vectors typically contain a packaging signal for incorporation into the package coat, a sequence which signals the start of the gag transcription unit, elements necessary for reverse transcription, including a primer binding site to bind the tRNA primer of reverse transcription, terminal repeat sequences that guide the switch of RNA strands during DNA synthesis, a purine \nrich sequence\n 5′ to the 3′ LTR that serve as the priming site for the synthesis of the second strand of DNA synthesis, and specific sequences near the ends of the LTRs that enable the insertion of the DNA state of the retrovirus to insert into the host genome. The removal of the gag, pol, and env genes allows for about 8 kb of foreign sequence to be inserted into the viral genome, become reverse transcribed, and upon replication be packaged into a new retroviral particle. This amount of nucleic acid is sufficient for the delivery of a one to many genes depending on the size of each transcript. It is preferable to include either positive or negative selectable markers along with other genes in the insert.\n\n\nSince the replication machinery and packaging proteins in most retroviral vectors have been removed (gag, pol, and env), the vectors are typically generated by placing them into a packaging cell line. A packaging cell line is a cell line which has been transfected or transformed with a retrovirus that contains the replication and packaging machinery, but lacks any packaging signal. When the vector carrying the DNA of choice is transfected into these cell lines, the vector containing the gene of interest is replicated and packaged into new retroviral particles, by the machinery provided in cis by the helper cell. The genomes for the machinery are not packaged because they lack the necessary signals.\n\n\nb. Adenoviral Vectors\n\n\nThe construction of replication-defective adenoviruses has been described (Berkner et al., J. Virology 61:1213-1220 (1987); Massie et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 6:2872-2883 (1986); Haj-Ahmad et al., J. Virology 57:267-274 (1986); Davidson et al., J. Virology 61:1226-1239 (1987); Zhang “Generation and identification of recombinant adenovirus by liposome-mediated transfection and PCR analysis” BioTechniques 15:868-872 (1993)). The benefit of the use of these viruses as vectors is that they are limited in the extent to which they can spread to other cell types, since they can replicate within an initial infected cell, but are unable to form new infectious viral particles. Recombinant adenoviruses have been shown to achieve high efficiency gene transfer after direct, in vivo delivery to airway epithelium, hepatocytes, vascular endothelium, CNS parenchyma and a number of other tissue sites (Morsy, J. Clin. Invest. 92:1580-1586 (1993); Kirshenbaum, J. Clin. Invest. 92:381-387 (1993); Roessler, J. Clin. Invest. 92:1085-1092 (1993); Moullier, Nature Genetics 4:154-159 (1993); La Salle, Science 259:988-990 (1993); Gomez-Foix, J. Biol. Chem. 267:25129-25134 (1992); Rich, Human Gene Therapy 4:461-476 (1993); Zabner, Nature Genetics 6:75-83 (1994); Guzman, Circulation Research 73:1201-1207 (1993); Bout, Human Gene Therapy 5:3-10 (1994); Zabner, Cell 75:207-216 (1993); Caillaud, Eur. J. Neuroscience 5:1287-1291 (1993); and Ragot, J. Gen. Virology 74:501-507 (1993)). Recombinant adenoviruses achieve gene transduction by binding to specific cell surface receptors, after which the virus is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, in the same manner as wild type or replication-defective adenovirus (Chardonnet and Dales, Virology 40:462-477 (1970); Brown and Burlingham, J. Virology 12:386-396 (1973); Svensson and Persson, J. Virology 55:442-449 (1985); Seth, et al., J. Virol. 51:650-655 (1984); Seth, et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 4:1528-1533 (1984); Varga et al., J. Virology 65:6061-6070 (1991); Wickham et al., Cell 73:309-319 (1993)).\n\n\nA viral vector can be one based on an adenovirus which has had the E1 gene removed and these virons are generated in a cell line such as the human 293 cell line. In another preferred embodiment both the E1 and E3 genes are removed from the adenovirus genome.\n\n\nc. Adeno-Associated Viral Vectors\n\n\nAnother type of viral vector is based on an adeno-associated virus (AAV). This defective parvovirus is a preferred vector because it can infect many cell types and is nonpathogenic to humans. AAV type vectors can transport about 4 to 5 kb and wild type AAV is known to stably insert into chromosome 19. Vectors which contain this site specific integration property are preferred. An especially preferred embodiment of this type of vector is the P4.1 C vector produced by Avigen, San Francisco, Calif., which can contain the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene, HSV-tk, and/or a marker gene, such as the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein, GFP.\n\n\nIn another type of AAV virus, the AAV contains a pair of inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) which flank at least one cassette containing a promoter which directs cell-specific expression operably linked to a heterologous gene. Heterologous in this context refers to any nucleotide sequence or gene which is not native to the AAV or B19 parvovirus.\n\n\nTypically the AAV and B19 coding regions have been deleted, resulting in a safe, noncytotoxic vector. The AAV ITRs, or modifications thereof, confer infectivity and site-specific integration, but not cytotoxicity, and the promoter directs cell-specific expression. U.S. Pat. No. 6,261,834 is herein incorporated by reference for material related to the AAV vector.\n\n\nThe disclosed vectors thus provide DNA molecules which are capable of integration into a mammalian chromosome without substantial toxicity.\n\n\nThe inserted genes in viral and retroviral usually contain promoters, and/or enhancers to help control the expression of the desired gene product. A promoter is generally a sequence or sequences of DNA that function when in a relatively fixed location in regard to the transcription start site. A promoter contains core elements required for basic interaction of RNA polymerase and transcription factors, and may contain upstream elements and response elements.\n\n\nd. Large Payload Viral Vectors\n\n\nMolecular genetic experiments with large human herpesviruses have provided a means whereby large heterologous DNA fragments can be cloned, propagated and established in cells permissive for infection with herpesviruses (Sun et al., Nature genetics 8: 33-41, 1994; Cotter and Robertson, Curr Opin Mol Ther 5: 633-644, 1999). These large DNA viruses (herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), have the potential to deliver fragments of human heterologous DNA >150 kb to specific cells. EBV recombinants can maintain large pieces of DNA in the infected B-cells as episomal DNA. Individual clones carried human genomic inserts up to 330 kb appeared genetically stable The maintenance of these episomes requires a specific EBV nuclear protein, EBNA1, constitutively expressed during infection with EBV. Additionally, these vectors can be used for transfection, where large amounts of protein can be generated transiently in vitro. Herpesvirus amplicon systems are also being used to package pieces of DNA >220 kb and to infect cells that can stably maintain DNA as episomes.\n\n\nOther useful systems include, for example, replicating and host-restricted non-replicating vaccinia virus vectors.\n\n\nNucleic acids that are delivered to cells which are to be integrated into the host cell genome, typically contain integration sequences. These sequences are often viral related sequences, particularly when viral based systems are used. These viral intergration systems can also be incorporated into nucleic acids which are to be delivered using a non-nucleic acid based system of deliver, such as a liposome, so that the nucleic acid contained in the delivery system can be come integrated into the host genome.\n\n\nOther general techniques for integration into the host genome include, for example, systems designed to promote homologous recombination with the host genome. These systems typically rely on sequence flanking the nucleic acid to be expressed that has enough homology with a target sequence within the host cell genome that recombination between the vector nucleic acid and the target nucleic acid takes place, causing the delivered nucleic acid to be integrated into the host genome. These systems and the methods necessary to promote homologous recombination are known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n11. Expression Systems\n\n\nNucleic acids that are delivered to cells typically contain expression controlling systems. For example, the inserted genes in viral and retroviral systems usually contain promoters, and/or enhancers to help control the expression of the desired gene product. A promoter is generally a sequence or sequences of DNA that function when in a relatively fixed location in regard to the transcription start site. A promoter contains core elements required for basic interaction of RNA polymerase and transcription factors, and may contain upstream elements and response elements.\n\n\ni. Viral Promoters and Enhancers\n\n\nPreferred promoters controlling transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells may be obtained from various sources, for example, the genomes of viruses such as: polyoma, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), adenovirus, retroviruses, hepatitis-B virus and most preferably cytomegalovirus, or from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g. beta actin promoter. The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment which also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication (Fiers et al., Nature, 273: 113 (1978)). The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment (Greenway, P. J. et al., Gene 18: 355-360 (1982)). Of course, promoters from the host cell or related species also are useful herein.\n\n\nEnhancer generally refers to a sequence of DNA that functions at no fixed distance from the transcription start site and can be either 5′ (Laimins, L. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 78: 993 (1981)) or 3′ (Lusky, M. L., et al., Mol. Cell. Bio. 3: 1108 (1983)) to the transcription unit. Furthermore, enhancers can be within an intron (Banerji, J. L. et al., Cell 33: 729 (1983)) as well as within the coding sequence itself (Osborne, T. F., et al., Mol. Cell. Bio. 4: 1293 (1984)). They are usually between 10 and 300 bp in length, and they function in cis. Enhancers function to increase transcription from nearby promoters. Enhancers also often contain response elements that mediate the regulation of transcription. Promoters can also contain response elements that mediate the regulation of transcription. Enhancers often determine the regulation of expression of a gene. While many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, α-fetoprotein and insulin), typically one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus for general expression. Preferred examples are the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers.\n\n\nThe promotor and/or enhancer may be specifically activated either by light or specific chemical events which trigger their function. Systems can be regulated by reagents such as tetracycline and dexamethasone. There are also ways to enhance viral vector gene expression by exposure to irradiation, such as gamma irradiation, or alkylating chemotherapy drugs.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments the promoter and/or enhancer region can act as a constitutive promoter and/or enhancer to maximize expression of the region of the transcription unit to be transcribed. In certain constructs the promoter and/or enhancer region be active in all eukaryotic cell types, even if it is only expressed in a particular type of cell at a particular time. A preferred promoter of this type is the CMV promoter (650 bases). Other preferred promoters are SV40 promoters, cytomegalovirus (full length promoter), and retroviral vector LTR.\n\n\nIt has been shown that all specific regulatory elements can be cloned and used to construct expression vectors that are selectively expressed in specific cell types such as melanoma cells. The glial fibrillary acetic protein (GFAP) promoter has been used to selectively express genes in cells of glial origin.\n\n\nExpression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human or nucleated cells) may also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription which may affect mRNA expression. These regions are transcribed as polyadenylated segments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding tissue factor protein. The 3′ untranslated regions also include transcription termination sites. It is preferred that the transcription unit also contain a polyadenylation region. One benefit of this region is that it increases the likelihood that the transcribed unit will be processed and transported like mRNA. The identification and use of polyadenylation signals in expression constructs is well established. It is preferred that homologous polyadenylation signals be used in the transgene constructs. In certain transcription units, the polyadenylation region is derived from the SV40 early polyadenylation signal and consists of about 400 bases. It is also preferred that the transcribed units contain other standard sequences alone or in combination with the above sequences improve expression from, or stability of, the construct.\n\n\nii. Markers\n\n\nThe disclosed vectors can include nucleic acid sequence encoding a marker product. This marker product is used to determine if the nucleic acid has been delivered to the cell and once delivered is being expressed. Preferred marker genes are the \nE. Coli \nlacZ gene, which encodes 3-galactosidase, and green fluorescent protein.\n\n\nIn some embodiments the marker may be a selectable marker. Examples of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), thymidine kinase, neomycin, neomycin analog G418, hydromycin, and puromycin. When such selectable markers are successfully transferred into a mammalian host cell, the transformed mammalian host cell can survive if placed under selective pressure. There are two widely used distinct categories of selective regimes. The first category is based on a cell's metabolism and the use of a mutant cell line which lacks the ability to grow independent of a supplemented media. Two examples are: CHO DHFR-cells and mouse LTK-cells. These cells lack the ability to grow without the addition of such nutrients as thymidine or hypoxanthine. Because these cells lack certain genes necessary for a complete nucleotide synthesis pathway, they cannot survive unless the missing nucleotides are provided in a supplemented media. An alternative to supplementing the media is to introduce an intact DHFR or TK gene into cells lacking the respective genes, thus altering their growth requirements. Individual cells which were not transformed with the DHFR or TK gene will not be capable of survival in non-supplemented media.\n\n\nThe second category is dominant selection which refers to a selection scheme used in any cell type and does not require the use of a mutant cell line. These schemes typically use a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells which have a novel gene would express a protein conveying drug resistance and would survive the selection. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, (Southern P. and Berg, P., J. Molec. Appl. Genet. 1: 327 (1982)), mycophenolic acid, (Mulligan, R. C. and Berg, P. Science 209: 1422 (1980)) or hygromycin, (Sugden, B. et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 5: 410-413 (1985)). The three examples employ bacterial genes under eukaryotic control to convey resistance to the appropriate drug G418 or neomycin (geneticin), xgpt (mycophenolic acid) or hygromycin, respectively. Others include the neomycin analog G418 and puramycin.\n\n\nB. Methods\n\n\nDisclosed are methods using inhibitors of proprotein convertases such as furin. The disclosed inhibitors can be administered to subjects that have been exposed to, are suspected of being exposed to, may become exposed to or are infected by a pathogen or other harmful organism. The disclosed method is useful where the pathogen requires or makes use of host proprotein convertases. Inhibition of one or more proprotein convertases can, for example, prevent, reduce, interfere with, slow or otherwise affect the pathogen, the effect of the pathogen, the infectivity of the pathogen, the ability of the pathogen to produce or sustain an infection, one or more harmful effects of the pathogen, or a combination. For example, provided is a method of treating a subject with a pathogen infection, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a proprotein convertase inhibitor. Also provided is a method of reducing risk of harm from a pathogen infection in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a proprotein convertase inhibitor. Useful proprotein convertases can be non-toxic. Thus, for example, the furin inhibitor is Dec-RVKR-CMK can be excluded as a proprotein convertase inhibitor.\n\n\nThe type and extent of harm associated with a pathogen infection is dependent on the selected pathogen. However, for the pathogens disclosed herein, the harm is at least partially dependent on the enzymatic processing of pathogenic proteins by proprotein convertase enzymes. Thus, the skilled artisan will be able to ascertain the ability of the disclosed compositions and methods to reduce harm in a given pathogen based on an understanding in the art of the role of enzymatic processing for that pathogen.\n\n\nThus, the pathogen can in some aspects be any pathogen that produces a toxin cleaved by a proprotein convertase. Thus, the method can further comprise identifying a subject suspected of being exposed to or at risk of being exposed to a pathogen that produces toxins cleaved by a proprotein convertase.\n\n\nA proprotein convertase inhibitor, as used herein, is any compound or composition that can inhibit the ability of one or more proprotein convertases to cleave one or more of their substrates. For example, a proprotein convertase inhibitor can in some aspects inhibit the ability of furin to cleave a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:24. Proprotein convertase inhibitors can also be referred to as inhibitors of any or all of the respective proprotein convertase against which the inhibitor is effective. Thus, for example, a proprotein convertase inhibitor that can inhibit furin can be referred to as a furin inhibitor. This is the case regardless of whether the inhibitor inhibits only firinor can also inhibit other proprotein convertases.\n\n\nIn some aspects of the disclosed method, the proprotein convertase inhibitor can inhibit the activity of a plurality of proprotein convertases. For example, the proprotein convertase inhibitor can inhibit the activity of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more proprotein convertases.\n\n\nThe proprotein convertase inhibitor of the disclosed method can comprise a peptide as disclosed herein. In some aspects, the proprotein convertase inhibitor can be a peptide comprising a furin cleavage motif, wherein the peptide is resistant to furin proteolysis. Thus, in some aspects, the peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence R-X-R/K-R (SEQ ID NO:24). In further aspects, the peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence X\n1\nRX\n2\nRRRKKRX\n3\n, wherein X\n1 \nis TP or TPQ, wherein X\n2 \nis A or G, and X\n3 \nis any or no amino acid (SEQ ID NOs:346, 371, 372 and 373).\n\n\nThus, the proprotein convertase inhibitor of the disclosed method can comprise a peptide comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:28, SEQ ID NO:51, SEQ ID NO:94, SEQ ID NO:142, SEQ ID NO:143, SEQ ID NO:147, SEQ ID NO:148, SEQ ID NO:149, SEQ ID NO:151, SEQ ID NO:153, SEQ ID NO:156, SEQ ID NO:164, SEQ ID NO:204, SEQ ID NO:206, SEQ ID NO:208, SEQ ID NO:209, SEQ ID NO:212, SEQ ID NO:214, SEQ ID NO:215, SEQ ID NO:216, SEQ ID NO:217, SEQ ID NO:222, SEQ ID NO:223, SEQ ID NO:365, SEQ ID NO:366, SEQ ID NO:367, SEQ ID NO:368, SEQ ID NO:369, or SEQ ID NO:370.\n\n\nThe proprotein convertase inhibitor of the disclosed method can comprise a peptide consisting essentially of an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:28, SEQ ID NO:51, SEQ ID NO:94, SEQ ID NO:142, SEQ ID NO:143, SEQ ID NO:147, SEQ ID NO:148, SEQ ID NO:149, SEQ ID NO:151, SEQ ID NO:153, SEQ ID NO:156, SEQ ID NO:164, SEQ ID NO:204, SEQ ID NO:206, SEQ ID NO:208, SEQ ID NO:209, SEQ ID NO:212, SEQ ID NO:214, SEQ ID NO:215, SEQ ID NO:216, SEQ ID NO:217, SEQ ID NO:222, SEQ ID NO:223, SEQ ID NO:365, SEQ ID NO:366, SEQ ID NO:367, SEQ ID NO:368, SEQ ID NO:369, or SEQ ID NO:370\n\n\n1. Administration\n\n\nThe disclosed compounds and compositions can be administered in any suitable manner. The manner of administration can be chosen based on, for example, whether local or systemic treatment is desired, and on the area to be treated. For example, the compositions can be administered orally, parenterally (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or intramuscular injection), by inhalation, extracorporeally, topically (including transdermally, ophthalmically, vaginally, rectally, intranasally) or the like. For example, the proprotein convertase inhibitor can be administered to the skin or mucosa of the subject. Additional methods include aerosol, with or without carrier particles such as nanoparticles, and sustained release methods.\n\n\nAs used herein, “topical intranasal administration” means delivery of the compositions into the nose and nasal passages through one or both of the nares and can comprise delivery by a spraying mechanism or droplet mechanism, or through aerosolization of the nucleic acid or vector. Administration of the compositions by inhalant can be through the nose or mouth via delivery by a spraying or droplet mechanism. Delivery can also be directly to any area of the respiratory system (e.g., lungs) via intubation.\n\n\nParenteral administration of the composition, if used, is generally characterized by injection. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution of suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. A more recently revised approach for parenteral administration involves use of a slow release or sustained release system such that a constant dosage is maintained. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,610,795, which is incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\nThe exact amount of the compositions required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, weight and general condition of the subject, the severity of the allergic disorder being treated, the particular nucleic acid or vector used, its mode of administration and the like. Thus, it is not possible to specify an exact amount for every composition. However, an appropriate amount can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation given the teachings herein. Thus, effective dosages and schedules for administering the compositions may be determined empirically, and making such determinations is within the skill in the art. The dosage ranges for the administration of the compositions are those large enough to produce the desired effect in which the symptoms disorder are effected. The dosage should not be so large as to cause adverse side effects, such as unwanted cross-reactions, anaphylactic reactions, and the like. Generally, the dosage will vary with the age, condition, sex and extent of the disease in the patient, route of administration, or whether other drugs are included in the regimen, and can be determined by one of skill in the art. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any counter indications. Dosage can vary, and can be administered in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or several days. Guidance can be found in the literature for appropriate dosages for given classes of pharmaceutical products.\n\n\nFor example, a typical daily dosage of a peptide disclosed herein used alone might range from about 1 μg/kg to up to 100 mg/kg of body weight or more per day, depending on the factors mentioned above. Thus, the a typical daily dosage of a peptide disclosed herein can be from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20 mg/kg.\n\n\nFollowing administration of a disclosed composition for treating, inhibiting, or preventing pathogen harm, the efficacy of the therapeutic can be assessed in various ways well known to the skilled practitioner.\n\n\nThe disclosed compositions that inhibit proprotein convertases may be administered prophylactically to patients or subjects who are at risk for exposure to a pathogen or who have been newly exposed to a viral or bacterial pathogen.\n\n\nThe disclosed compositions and methods can also be used for example as tools to isolate and test new drug candidates for a variety of pathogen related diseases.\n\n\nThe disclosed compositions can be delivered to the target cells in a variety of ways. For example, the compositions can be delivered through electroporation, or through lipofection, or through calcium phosphate precipitation. The delivery mechanism chosen will depend in part on the type of cell targeted and whether the delivery is occurring for example in vivo or in vitro.\n\n\nThus, the compositions can comprise lipids such as liposomes, such as cationic liposomes (e.g., DOTMA, DOPE, DC-cholesterol) or anionic liposomes. Liposomes can further comprise proteins to facilitate targeting a particular cell, if desired. Administration of a composition comprising a compound and a cationic liposome can be administered to the blood afferent to a target organ or inhaled into the respiratory tract to target cells of the respiratory tract. Regarding liposomes, see, e.g., Brigham et al. \nAm. J. Resp. Cell. Mol. Biol. \n1:95-100 (1989); Felgner et al. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n84:7413-7417 (1987); U.S. Pat. No. 4,897,355. Furthermore, the compound can be administered as a component of a microcapsule that can be targeted to specific cell types, such as macrophages, or where the diffusion of the compound or delivery of the compound from the microcapsule is designed for a specific rate or dosage.\n\n\nIn the methods described above which include the administration and uptake of exogenous DNA into the cells of a subject (i.e., gene transduction or transfection), delivery of the compositions to cells can be via a variety of mechanisms. As one example, delivery can be via a liposome, using commercially available liposome preparations such as LIPOFECTIN, LIPOFECTAMINE (GIBCO-BRL, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.), SUPERFECT (Qiagen, Inc. Hilden, Germany) and TRANSFECTAM (Promega Biotec, Inc., Madison, Wis.), as well as other liposomes developed according to procedures standard in the art. In addition, the disclosed nucleic acid or vector can be delivered in vivo by electroporation, the technology for which is available from Genetronics, Inc. (San Diego, Calif.) as well as by means of a SONOPORATION machine (ImaRx Pharmaceutical Corp., Tucson, Ariz.).\n\n\nThe materials may be in solution, suspension (for example, incorporated into microparticles, liposomes, or cells). These may be targeted to a particular cell type via antibodies, receptors, or receptor ligands. The following references are examples of the use of this technology to target specific proteins to tumor tissue, the principles of which can be applied to targeting of other cells (Senter, et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 2:447-451, (1991); Bagshawe, K. D., Br. J. Cancer, 60:275-281, (1989); Bagshawe, et al., Br. J. Cancer, 58:700-703, (1988); Senter, et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 4:3-9, (1993); Battelli, et al., Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 35:421-425, (1992); Pietersz and McKenzie, Immunolog. Reviews, 129:57-80, (1992); and Roffler, et al., Biochem. Pharmacol, 42:2062-2065, (1991)). These techniques can be used for a variety of other specific cell types. Vehicles such as “stealth” and other antibody conjugated liposomes (including lipid mediated drug targeting to colonic carcinoma), receptor mediated targeting of DNA through cell specific ligands, lymphocyte directed tumor targeting, and highly specific therapeutic retroviral targeting of murine glioma cells in vivo. The following references are examples of the use of this technology to target specific proteins to tumor tissue (Hughes et al., Cancer Research, 49:6214-6220, (1989); and Litzinger and Huang, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1104:179-187, (1992)). In general, receptors are involved in pathways of endocytosis, either constitutive or ligand induced. These receptors cluster in clathrin-coated pits, enter the cell via clathrin-coated vesicles, pass through an acidified endosome in which the receptors are sorted, and then either recycle to the cell surface, become stored intracellularly, or are degraded in lysosomes. The internalization pathways serve a variety of functions, such as nutrient uptake, removal of activated proteins, clearance of macromolecules, opportunistic entry of viruses and toxins, dissociation and degradation of ligand, and receptor-level regulation. Many receptors follow more than one intracellular pathway, depending on the cell type, receptor concentration, type of ligand, ligand valency, and ligand concentration. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of receptor-mediated endocytosis has been reviewed (Brown and Greene, DNA and Cell Biology 10:6, 399-409 (1991)).\n\n\n2. Identifying Peptides\n\n\nAlso provided is a method of identifying a peptide that can inhibit the activity of a proprotein convertase, comprising determining the amino acid sequence of a natural cleavage site in a pathogenic toxin cleaved by a proprotein convertase; producing a peptide, wherein at least 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 amino acid residues have at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity to the natural cleavage site; and assaying the peptide for the ability to inhibit the activity of one or more proprotein convertases.\n\n\nThe ability of a peptide to inhibit the activity of a proprotein convertase can be assayed using any method known in the art. For example, a candidate peptide can added to a sample comprising a proprotein convertase and a detection peptide comprising a cleavage motif for said proprotein convertase. The method can then further comprise assaying for the presence of cleavage of the detection peptide. For example, the method can comprise detecting peptide fragments of the detection peptide. The amount of cleavage of the detection peptide can be compared to negative control and/or a reference standard in order to characterize the amount of inhibition. In some aspects, the detection peptide comprises a detectable marker, such as a fluophore. Thus, the detection peptide can be a fluorogenic substrate or a chromogenic substrate.\n\n\nThe toxin for use in the disclosed method can be, for example, selected from the group consisting of Influenza A H5N1 hemagglutin type H5 protein, Newcastle disease virus F fusion protein, parainfluenza HPIV3 F protein, Sindbis virus structural polyprotein p130, cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B (gpUL55), HIV-1 glycoprotein-160, Measles virus fusion protein, infectious bronchitis spike protein, Marburg virus spike glycoprotein, Ebola envelope glycoprotein, Epstein-Barr virus glycoprotein gp100, \nPseudomonas aeruginosa \nexotoxin A, Anthrax protective antigen, Botulinum toxin, Clostridium alpha-toxin, Diphtheria toxin, Aeromonas aerolysin, and \nShigella \nshiga toxin, Borna disease p57/gp94, flaviviral prM protein, Mumps virus F glycoprotein, Varicella zoster gpII, Bovine leukemia gp72, Rous sarcoma env protein, and respiratory syncytial F protein.\n\n\nThe proprotein convertase assessed in the disclosed method can be, for example, Furin (SPC1, PACE, PCSK3), PC2 (SPC2, PCSK2), PC1/3 (SPC3, PC1, PC3, PCSK1), PACE4 (SPC4, PCSK6), PC4, (SPC5, PCSK4), PC5/6 (SPC6, PC5, PC6, PCSK5), or PC7 (SPC7, PC8, LPC, PCSK7).\n\n\nThe peptide of the disclosed method can inhibit the activity of a plurality of proprotein convertases. For example, the disclosed peptide can inhibit the activity of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more proprotein convertases.\n\n\n3. Making the Compositions\n\n\nThe compositions disclosed herein and the compositions necessary to perform the disclosed methods can be made using any method known to those of skill in the art for that particular reagent or compound unless otherwise specifically noted.\n\n\ni. Peptide Synthesis\n\n\nOne method of producing the disclosed proteins, such as SEQ ID NO:23, is to link two or more peptides or polypeptides together by protein chemistry techniques. For example, peptides or polypeptides can be chemically synthesized using currently available laboratory equipment using either Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) or Boc (tert-butyloxycarbonoyl) chemistry. (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, Calif.). One skilled in the art can readily appreciate that a peptide or polypeptide corresponding to the disclosed proteins, for example, can be synthesized by standard chemical reactions. For example, a peptide or polypeptide can be synthesized and not cleaved from its synthesis resin whereas the other fragment of a peptide or protein can be synthesized and subsequently cleaved from the resin, thereby exposing a terminal group which is functionally blocked on the other fragment. By peptide condensation reactions, these two fragments can be covalently joined via a peptide bond at their carboxyl and amino termini, respectively, to form an antibody, or fragment thereof. (Grant GA (1992) Synthetic Peptides: A User Guide. W.H. Freeman and Co., N.Y. (1992); Bodansky M and Trost B., Ed. (1993) Principles of Peptide Synthesis. Springer-Verlag Inc., NY (which is herein incorporated by reference at least for material related to peptide synthesis). Alternatively, the peptide or polypeptide is independently synthesized in vivo as described herein. Once isolated, these independent peptides or polypeptides may be linked to form a peptide or fragment thereof via similar peptide condensation reactions.\n\n\nFor example, enzymatic ligation of cloned or synthetic peptide segments allow relatively short peptide fragments to be joined to produce larger peptide fragments, polypeptides or whole protein domains (Abrahmsen L et al., Biochemistry, 30:4151 (1991)). Alternatively, native chemical ligation of synthetic peptides can be utilized to synthetically construct large peptides or polypeptides from shorter peptide fragments. This method consists of a two step chemical reaction (Dawson et al. Synthesis of Proteins by Native Chemical Ligation. Science, 266:776-779 (1994)). The first step is the chemoselective reaction of an unprotected synthetic peptide-thioester with another unprotected peptide segment containing an amino-terminal Cys residue to give a thioester-linked intermediate as the initial covalent product. Without a change in the reaction conditions, this intermediate undergoes spontaneous, rapid intramolecular reaction to form a native peptide bond at the ligation site (Baggiolini M et al. (1992) FEBS Lett. 307:97-101; Clark-Lewis I et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269:16075 (1994); Clark-Lewis I et al., Biochemistry, 30:3128 (1991); Rajarathnam K et al., Biochemistry 33:6623-30 (1994)).\n\n\nAlternatively, unprotected peptide segments are chemically linked where the bond formed between the peptide segments as a result of the chemical ligation is an unnatural (non-peptide) bond (Schnolzer, M et al. Science, 256:221 (1992)). This technique has been used to synthesize analogs of protein domains as well as large amounts of relatively pure proteins with full biological activity (deLisle Milton R C et al., Techniques in Protein Chemistry IV. Academic Press, New York, pp. 257-267 (1992)).\n\n\nC. Uses\n\n\nThe disclosed compositions can be used in a variety of ways as research tools.

Other uses are disclosed, apparent from the disclosure, and/or will be understood by those in the art.\n\n\nD. kits\n\n\nThe materials described above as well as other materials can be packaged together in any suitable combination as a kit useful for performing, or aiding in the performance of, the disclosed method. It is useful if the kit components in a given kit are designed and adapted for use together in the disclosed method. For example disclosed are kits for XXX, the kit comprising XXX. The kits also can contain XXX. The disclosed kits can also include XXX.\n\n\nE. Uses\n\n\nThe disclosed compositions can be used in a variety of ways as research tools. For example, the disclosed compositions, such an isolated polypeptide comprising SEQ ID NOs:XXX can be used to study the interactions between XXX and XXX, by for example acting as inhibitors of binding. Other uses are disclosed, apparent from the disclosure, and/or will be understood by those in the art. Other uses include XXX. Other uses are disclosed, apparent from the disclosure, and/or will be understood by those in the art.\n\n\nF. Definitions\n\n\nUnless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which the disclosed method and compositions belong. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present method and compositions, the particularly useful methods, devices, and materials are as described. Publications cited herein and the material for which they are cited are hereby specifically incorporated by reference. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the present invention is not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention. No admission is made that any reference constitutes prior art. The discussion of references states what their authors assert, and applicants reserve the right to challenge the accuracy and pertinency of the cited documents.\n\n\nIt must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a peptide” includes a plurality of such peptides, reference to “the peptide” is a reference to one or more peptides and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.\n\n\n“Optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event, circumstance, or material may or may not occur or be present, and that the description includes instances where the event, circumstance, or material occurs or is present and instances where it does not occur or is not present.\n\n\nRanges can be expressed herein as from “about” one particular value, and/or to “about” another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent “about,” it will be understood that the particular value forms another embodiment. It will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. It is also understood that there are a number of values disclosed herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as “about” that particular value in addition to the value itself. For example, if the value “10” is disclosed, then “about 10” is also disclosed. It is also understood that when a value is disclosed that “less than or equal to” the value, “greater than or equal to the value” and possible ranges between values are also disclosed, as appropriately understood by the skilled artisan. For example, if the value “10” is disclosed the “less than or equal to 10” as well as “greater than or equal to 10” is also disclosed. It is also understood that the throughout the application, data is provided in a number of different formats, and that this data, represents endpoints and starting points, and ranges for any combination of the data points. For example, if a particular data point “10” and a particular data point 15 are disclosed, it is understood that greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, less than or equal to, and equal to 10 and 15 are considered disclosed as well as between 10 and 15. It is also understood that each unit between two particular units are also disclosed. For example, if 10 and 15 are disclosed, then 11, 12, 13, and 14 are also disclosed.\n\n\nThroughout the description and claims of this specification, the word “comprise” and variations of the word, such as “comprising” and “comprises,” means “including but not limited to,” and is not intended to exclude, for example, other additives, components, integers or steps.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “subject” means any target of administration. The subject can be a vertebrate, for example, a mammal. Thus, the subject can be a human. The term does not denote a particular age or sex. Thus, adult and newborn subjects, as well as fetuses, whether male or female, are intended to be covered. A patient refers to a subject afflicted with a disease or disorder. The term “patient” includes human and veterinary subjects.\n\n\nBy “treatment” is meant the medical management of a patient with the intent to cure, ameliorate, stabilize, or prevent a disease, pathological condition, or disorder. This term includes active treatment, that is, treatment directed specifically toward the improvement of a disease, pathological condition, or disorder, and also includes causal treatment, that is, treatment directed toward removal of the cause of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder. In addition, this term includes palliative treatment, that is, treatment designed for the relief of symptoms rather than the curing of the disease, pathological condition, or disorder; preventative treatment, that is, treatment directed to minimizing or partially or completely inhibiting the development of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder; and supportive treatment, that is, treatment employed to supplement another specific therapy directed toward the improvement of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder.\n\n\nBy “reduce” or other forms of reduce means lowering of an event or characteristic. It is understood that this is typically in relation to some standard or expected value, in other words it is relative, but that it is not always necessary for the standard or relative value to be referred to. For example, “reduces phosphorylation” means lowering the amount of phosphorylation that takes place relative to a standard or a control.\n\n\n“Inhibit,” “inhibiting,” and “inhibition” mean to decrease an activity, response, condition, disease, or other biological parameter. This can include but is not limited to the complete ablation of the activity, response, condition, or disease. This may also include, for example, a 10% reduction in the activity, response, condition, or disease as compared to the native or control level. Thus, the reduction can be a 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100%, or any amount of reduction in between as compared to native or control levels.\n\n\nThe term “therapeutically effective” means that the amount of the composition used is of sufficient quantity to ameliorate one or more causes or symptoms of a disease or disorder. Such amelioration only requires a reduction or alteration, not necessarily elimination.\n\n\nThroughout this application, various publications are referenced. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this pertains. The references disclosed are also individually and specifically incorporated by reference herein for the material contained in them that is discussed in the sentence in which the reference is relied upon.\n\n\nG. EXAMPLES\n\n\nThe following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how the compounds, compositions, articles, devices and/or methods claimed herein are made and evaluated, and are intended to be purely exemplary and are not intended to limit the disclosure. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.), but some errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, temperature is in ° C. or is at ambient temperature, and pressure is at or near atmospheric.\n\n\n1. Example 1\n\n\nTargeting Host Proteinases as a Therapeutic Strategy Against Viral and Bacterial Pathogens\n\n\ni. Results\n\n\nFurin and related PCs are subtilisin-like endoproteases which cleave the multibasic motifs R-X-R/K-R (SEQ ID NO:24) and transform proproteins into biologically active proteins and peptides. PCs are implicated in many pathogenic states because they also process membrane fusion proteins and pro-toxins of a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, including highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza. The pathogenicity of H5N1 correlates with the extended furin cleavage motif, TPQRERRRKKR ↓GL (SEQ ID NO:224), within the H5 sequence (Subbarao, K. et al. 1998; Chen, J. et al. 1998; Basak, A., et al. 2001). Following furin cleavage, the resulting protein becomes competent to initiate fusion with the host membrane.\n\n\nDisclosed herein is the use of the furin cleavage sequence of H5 as the starting point to obtain peptide sequences that inhibit cleavage of a fluorescent peptide substrate by furin (Fugere, M. et al. 2002). The presence of the Gln residue at position P9 of the TPQRERRRKKRG (SEQ ID NO:174) cleavage motif was not necessary for inhibition. Using alanine scanning mutagenesis a potent inhibitor was found (TPRARRRKKRG (SEQ ID NO:28), Ki=57 nM; \nFIG. 1A\n and Table 2), which was improved further by substitution of the C-terminal glycine by threonine (TPRARRRKKRT (SEQ ID NO:212), Ki=23 nM; \nFIG. 1A\n and Table 3). Other PCs (PACE4, PC4, PC5/6 and PC7) were also inhibited but with less efficiency. Peptides with aromatic C-terminal residues (F or Y) were more selective for furin, while TPQRARRRKKRT (SEQ ID NO:151) and TPRARRRKKRT (SEQ ID NO:212) were potent pan-inhibitors of PCs (Ki=150-300 nM) (\nFIG. 1B\n). Co-incubation of the peptides with furin followed by mass-spectrometry analysis showed that the inhibitory peptides were resistant to furin proteolysis.\n\n\nIt was next determined if the H5-derived peptides could inhibit intoxication by two unrelated pathogens, anthrax and \nPseudomonas \ntoxins. Host cleavage of anthrax Protective Antigen-83 (PA83) is a prerequisite for the translocation of the toxic enzymes, Lethal Factor (LF) and Edema Factor, into the host cell cytosol (Collier, R. J. & Young, J. A. 2003). It was determined that PA83 was cleaved by furin and also by PC4 and PC5/6 while PACE4 and PC7 were less effective. Furin and PC5/6 also efficiently cleaved the recombinant H5 precursor (HA0; Stevens, J. et al. 2004), while other PCs were less efficient (\nFIG. 1C\n).\n\n\nUsing a cell-based assay (glioma U251 cells; Remacle, A. G., et al. 2006), it was determined that TPRARRRKKRX peptides with C-terminal F, W, T and Y (SEQ ID NO:225) were potent inhibitors of PA83 processing (\nFIG. 1D\n). Furthermore, the TPRARRRKKRT (SEQ ID NO:212) peptide inhibited delivery of the PA63-LF complex into the cytosol and protected cells from LF-induced cytotoxicity (\nFIG. 1E\n) with an efficiency similar to that of GM6001 (a hydroxamate inhibitor of LF; Forino, M. et al. 2005). The peptide alone at concentrations ≦0.5 mM displayed no toxicity and had no effect on cell viability.\n\n\nThe peptide was next tested in a mouse model of inhalation anthrax (Collier, R. J. & Young, J. A. 2003; Forino, M. et al. 2005). A/J mice (8 mice/group) received \nB. anthracis \nSterne spores (4×10\n5\n/animal). On the day following infection, mice received the TPRARRRKKRT (SEQ ID NO:212) peptide (12.5 mg/kg i.p.) and then continued to receive injections once daily for the remainder of the experiment. Mice treated with Cipro received 25 mg/kg subcutaneously daily beginning on the fourth day following infection. This post-exposure peptide/Cipro regimen protected 90% of the infected mice from disease, compared with 40% using either the peptide or Cipro alone (\nFIG. 1F\n).\n\n\nA similar set of experiments was carried out with an unrelated toxin, \nPseudomonas \nexotoxin A. Consistent with the earlier data (Chiron, M. F., et al. 1997), \nPseudomonas \nexotoxin A (PEx) was resistant to PC cleavage at pH 7.5 but following unfolding at pH 5.5 PEx (66 kDa) was readily processed by furin, PC4 and PC5/6 to produce the 28 kDa N-terminal fragment and the toxic 37 kDa Cterminal fragment (\nFIG. 3A\n). C57/BL6 mice (5 mice/group) received one intramuscular injection of PEx (500 ng/animal; 2xLD\n50\n; Fogle, M. R., et al. 2002) and one injection of the TPRARRRKKRT (SEQ ID NO:212) peptide (12.5 mg/kg i.p.) either 24 h prior to toxin injection or simultaneously with toxin. Another group of mice, after receiving one injection of the peptide 24 h prior to toxin injection, continued to receive daily injections of the peptide for the remainder of the experiment. Daily injections of the peptide provided good protection (60% survival) from the lethal action of PEx, demonstrating efficacy against a second, otherwise unrelated, furin-dependent pathogen (\nFIG. 3B\n).\n\n\nGiven that cell surface-associated PCs in bronchial epithelial cells are the first to encounter inhaled pathogens, the development of an inhalation drug that could be used for acute treatment or for prophylactic use in civilian or battlefield settings was propose. Peptide immobilization was investigated on silica nanoparticles (SNPs), which have been widely used for biosensing and catalytic applications owing to their favorable surface area-to-volume ratio, straightforward manufacture and the possibility of attaching fluorescent labels, magnetic nanoparticles (Yang, H. H. et al. 2005) and semiconducting nanocrystals (Lin, Y. W., et al. 2006). When peptides with a GGG linker (\nFIG. 1A\n) were immobilized on 15-nm diameter 4-formylbenzoyl chloride-activated SNPs with a density of ˜100 peptide molecules/SNP, it was found that the inhibitory efficacy (on a molar basis) of the immobilized peptides against furin was similar to that of the soluble peptides (\nFIGS. 2B\n and C). Furthermore, SNPs showed no cell toxicity, even at high concentrations [e.g., 50 nM SNPs (3×10\n17 \nSNP particles)/100,000 cells].\n\n\nIn summary, peptides based on the cleavage motif of H5 are efficient inhibitors of furin and related PCs, and these inhibitors prevent the cleavage and activation of different and unrelated viral pathogens. The results provide examples of and a foundation for the development of novel drugs to be used both as therapeutics and prophylactics against a broad range of natural and engineered infectious agents (Fugere, M. & Day, R. 2005; Scamuffa, N., et al. 2006), including bird flu, anthrax, Marburg, Ebola and flaviviral infections and multiple additional furin-dependent acute disease pathogens.\n\n\nii. Materials and Methods\n\n\nReagents: Reagents were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, Mo.) unless indicated otherwise. A TMB/M substrate and GM6001 were from Chemicon (Temecula, Calif.). The furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (DEC-RVKR-CMK) was obtained from Bachem Bioscience (King of Prussia, Pa.). The protease inhibitor cocktail set III, and the fluorescence peptide substrate pyroglutamic acid-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (Pyr-RTKR-AMC; SEQ ID NO: 273) were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, Calif.). Sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate [EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-Long Chain(LC)-biotin] was from Pierce (Rockford, Ill.). Anthrax PA83 and \nPseudomonas \nexotoxin A (PEx) were purchased from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, Calif.). Recombinant human furin, PC5/6, PC4 and PC7, and rat PACE4 were prepared in the S2 \nDrosophila \nexpression system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) and purified to homogeneity as described earlier (Fugere, M. et al. 2002).\n\n\nExpression and purification of H5: The ectodomain of H5 was cloned into the baculovirus pAcGP67A transfer vector (BD Biosciences, Bedford, Mass.) to allow for efficient secretion of the recombinant protein. To facilitate the yield of the stable H5 precursor, the C-terminal region of the contract contained the bacteriophage T4 fibritin “foldon” trimerizing sequence, a thrombin cleavage site and a Hisx6 tag (RSLVPRGSP\nGSGYIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFL\nGHHHHHH (SEQ ID NO:93 the thrombin site, the T4 foldon and His-tag sequences are italicized, underlined and shown in bold, respectively). Infection of Sf9 insect cells with the recombinant plasmid and virus amplification was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.). Infected cells (3×10\n6 \ncells/ml infected at a multiplicity of infection equal to 1-3) were cultured in suspension for 3 days in 4 liters of sf900-II SFM serum-free medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Cells were then removed by centrifugation. The soluble H5 was purified from the supernatant by metal affinity chromatography on an Ni-NTA column followed by the Mono-Q FPLC and size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-200 10/30 column equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 80 mM NaCl. The yield of the purified H5 trimer was 1.5 mg/liter of cell culture.\n\n\nIn vitro cleavage of PA83, H5 and PEx: PA83, PEx and H5 were each labeled with EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (at a 1:20 protein-biotin molar ratio) for 30 min on ice. Biotin-labeled PA83, PEx and H5 (500 ng each) were co-incubated for 3 h at 37° C. with furin, PC7, PACE4, PC4 and PC5/6 (one unit of activity each). The 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) and 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5) buffers were supplemented with 1 mM CaCl\n2 \nand 0.5 mg/ml BSA. One unit of activity was equal to the amount of the enzyme that was required to cleave 1 pmole/min of the Pyr-RTKR-AMC (SEQ ID NO:273) substrate at 37° C. Where indicated, DEC-RVKR-CMK and the inhibitory peptides were added to the samples. The cleavage was stopped by adding a 5×SDS sample buffer. The digest samples were analyzed by Western Blotting with ExtrAvidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and a TMB/M substrate (\nFIG. 1\n and \nFIG. 3A\n).\n\n\nBinding and processing of PA83 by cultured cells: Glioma U251 cells (3×10\n5\n) were incubated for 3 h at 37° C. in serum-free DMEM supplemented with biotin-labeled PA83 (1 μg/ml). Where indicated, DEC-RVKR-CMK (20 μM) and the inhibitory peptides (2-20 μM) were added to the cells. After incubation, cells were washed and lysed in an RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL, pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail set III, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and 10 mM EDTA. To determine the concentrations of cell-associated PA83 and PA63, the samples were analyzed by Western blotting with ExtrAvidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and a TBM/M substrate (\nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\nCytotoxicity Assay: Murine macrophage-like cells RAW 264.7 were grown to confluence in wells of a 48-well plate in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were replenished with fresh medium (0.1 ml/per well) and then incubated with inhibitors for 4 h. To protect the peptide from proteolysis in vivo, the TPRARRRKKRT (SEQ ID NO:212) peptide sequence was amidated at the C-terminus and had β-Ala at the N-terminus. PA83 and LF were then added to the final concentration of 500 ng/ml and 25 ng/ml, respectively. After incubation for an additional hour, cell viability was assessed by 3,[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining. Cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml MTT in DMEM for 45 min at 37° C.; the medium was aspirated, and the blue pigment produced by the viable cells was solubilized with 0.5% SDS/25 mM HCl in 90% isopropyl alcohol. The concentration of oxidized MTT in the samples was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader. Each datum point represents the results of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. The percentage of viable cells was calculated by using the following equation: (A570 of cells treated with LF, PA83 and inhibitor)−(A570 of cells treated with LF and PA83) (A570 of cells treated with LF alone)−(A570 of cells treated with LF and PA83) (\nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\nThe TPRARRRKKRT (SEQ ID NO:212) peptide alone when incubated with cells in concentrations up to 0.5 mM had no effect on cell viability.\n\n\nAnimal experiments with anthrax and Preudomonas PEx: To protect the peptide from proteolysis in vivo, the TPRARRRKKRT (SEQ ID NO:212) peptide sequence was amidated at the C-terminus and had β-Ala at the N-terminus. Purification of anthrax spores and the inhalation model of anthrax using A/J mice was described previously (Sabet, M., et al. 2006; Wu, C.C. N. et al. 2007). A/J mice (8 mice/group) received \nB. anthracis \nSterne spores (4×10\n5\n/animal in 20 μl PBS). On the day following infection, mice received the TPRARRRKKRT (SEQ ID NO:212) peptide (12.5 mg/kg i.p.) in PBS and then continue to receive injections once daily for the remainder of the experiment. Control mice received an equal volume of PBS. Mice treated with Cipro received 25 mg/kg subcutaneously daily beginning on the fourth day following infection (\nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\nC57/BL6 mice (5 mice/group) received one intramuscular injection of PEx (500 ng/animal; 2xLD\n50\n; Fogle, M. R., et al. 2002). Mice received one injection of the TPRARRRKKRT (SEQ ID NO:212) peptide (12.5 mg/kg i.p.) either 24 h prior to toxin injection or simultaneously with toxin. Additional group of mice after receiving one injection of the peptide 24 h prior to toxin injection continued to receive daily injections of the peptide for the remainder of the experiment (\nFIG. 3B\n).\n\n\nPeptides synthesis: A 96-well format centrifugal peptide synthesizer and the techniques for purification and characterization of the peptides were described in detail earlier (Hachmann, J. & Lebl, M. 2006; Kozlov, I. A. et al. 2006; Shiryaev, S. A. et al. 2007). Peptide synthesis was performed in wells of a 96-well flat bottom polypropylene microtiter plate (Evergreen Scientific, Los Angeles, Calif.). The peptides were amidated at the carboxy-terminus. In addition to the C-end amidation, peptides used for their attachment to SNPs exhibited hydroxylaminoacetic acid at the amino-terminus (prepared by attachment of Boc-NHOCH\n2\n—COOH at the last step of the synthesis). The use of freshly alumina-treated ether was critical to avoid the loss of the hydroxylamine functionality because of the carbonyl contaminations in ether. The purity of the peptides was confirmed by use of reverse-phase HPLC and also by massspectrometry.\n\n\nThe peptide for the cell-based assays and in vivo studies was synthesized manually in a plastic syringe equipped with a frit (CSPS Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, Calif.) using Rink resin (1 g, 0.45 mmol/g; Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif.). Diisopropylcarbodiimide was used for coupling (2×1 h) and 20% 4-methylpiperidine (Hachmann, J. & Lebl, M. 2006) for Fmoc group deprotection. Final deprotection and cleavage from the resin was performed by Mixture K (King, D. S., et al. 1990). The peptide sample was precipitated by ether, washed by ether (5×), dissolved in 0.1 M HCl and lyophilized. The peptide was then dissolved in 10 ml of 0.1 M HCl and purified on a Sephadex LH-20 column equilibrated in 0.1 M HCl. Fractions containing the peptide were pooled and lyophilized. HPLC (Waters, Milford Mass., USA; μBondapak C18, 10μ particles, 125 Å pore size, 3.9×150 mm, gradient 0.05% TFA in \nH\n \n \n \n2\n0 to 40% acetonitrile, 0.05% TFA in 15 min, flow rate 1.5 ml/min, detection by UV at 217 nm) of the peptide determined the purity of the material to exceed 95%. MS analysis of the synthesized peptide (HT-Labs, San Diego, Calif., USA) confirmed the identity of the product (calculated molecular weight 1495.81 D, found M+H 1497 D).\n\n\nProtease assays with fluorescence peptides: The assay for PC cleavage activity was performed using a Pyr-RTKR-AMC (SEQ ID NO:273) substrate (24 μM). Enzyme concentrations were 10 nM. The concentrations of the catalytically active proteinases were measured using a fluorescence assay by titration against a standard DEC-RVKR-CMK solution of a known concentration. The buffer for furin cleavage reactions was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM CaCl\n2 \nand 0.5 mg/ml BSA. The buffer for PACE4, PC4, PC5/6 and PC7 was 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, supplemented with 1 mM CaCl\n2\n. The total assay volume was 0.1 ml. Increasing concentrations of the inhibitory peptides were pre-incubated with the enzymes for 30 min at ambient temperature. The steady state rate of substrate hydrolysis was monitored continuously (λ\nex\n=360 nm and λ\nem\n=460 nm) using a Spectramax Gemini EM fluorescence spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.) at 37° C. The IC\n50 \nvalues were derived from fitting the V\n0 \nvs. log [I]\nt \nplots with sigmoidal dose response curves and the inhibition constant (Ki) was derived using the Cheng-Prusoff equation: K\ni\n=IC\n50\n/(1+[S]/K\nm\n), where V\n0 \nis the steady state velocity of substrate hydrolysis, [I]\nt \nis the total inhibitor concentration, [S] is the substrate concentration, K\nm \nis the Michaelis-Menten constant, and K\ni(app) \nis the apparent inhibition constant (\nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\nPreparation of nanoparticles (SNPs) and immobilization of peptides: a cyclohexane, Triton X-100 and n-hexanol 24.8 ml mixture (volume ratio 4.2:1:1) was converted to a nanoemulsion by stirring at room temperature for 1 h. Water (940 μl) and tetramethyl orthosilicate (100.5 μl) were added. The mixture was sonicated for 1 h to facilitate the diffusion of tetramethyl orthosilicate into the encapsulated water droplets in the nanoemulsion. 28% NH3 in water (59 μl) was added to catalyze the hydrolysis of tetramethyl orthosilicate and condensation to form the SNPs. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h, followed by the addition of tetramethyl orthosilicate (10.05 μl) and then, in 30 min, aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (11.8 μl). The mixture was stirred for an additional 24 h, and then the amino-SNPs were precipitated by 25 ml acetone washed with water and anhydrous ethanol. The presence of amino groups on SNPs was confirmed by using fluorescamine in methanol followed by sonication of the sample for 5 min at room temperature and fluorescence analysis (λ\nex\n=390 nm, λ\nem\n=475 nm). An aliquot of SNPs in ethanol was placed on the lacey carbon film covering a 300-mesh copper grid (Ted Pella, Redding, Calif.) and ethanol was then allowed to evaporate. Transmission electron microscope images (\nFIG. 4\n) showed the uniform, 15±1 nm diameter, amino-SNPs. Assuming the density of the SNPs is equal to pure silica (1.96 g/cm\n3\n), the molecular weight of SNPs was calculated to be 2000 kDa. 4-formylbenzoyl chloride/triethylamine (1:3 molar ratio) was allowed to react with amino-SNPs in dimethyl formamide for 40 min at 0° and then at room temperature overnight (\nFIG. 5\n). Aldehyde-SNPs were separated by the addition of water to the sample and extensively washed in water. To accomplish the binding of the peptides to aldehyde-SNPs, a suspension of aldehyde-SNPs (˜0.2 mg/0.1 ml) was co-incubated for 48 h in a shaker with 1 mM solution of the peptides (which exhibited a hydroxylamine group) in 1 M citrate buffer, pH 5.1—DMSO mixture (1:1 v/v). Beads were then centrifuged and washed three times with water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

Example 2\n\n\nN-terminal Truncations\n\n\nThe best inhibitory peptide (TPRARRRKKRT, Ki=15.8 nM against furin) was further shortened from the N-end. The table data show the Ki values of the N-end deletions of this peptide against furin using pyroglutamic acid-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (Pyr-RTKR-AMC; SEQ ID NO:273) as a substrate. The deletion of both Thr and Pro results in RARRRKKRT (SEQ ID NO:366) that has the Ki=8 nM.

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application is a division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/319,557, filed on Jan. 8, 2009, now allowed, which is a continuation of PCT application No. PCT/GB2007/002618, filed on Jul. 13, 2007, which claims the benefit of United Kingdom patent application No. 0614037.0, filed on Jul. 14, 2006. The contents of each of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nThe present invention relates to compounds that are inhibitors of cysteine proteinases, pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds, and their use in therapy. More specifically, but not exclusively, the invention relates to compounds that are inhibitors of cathepsin K and related cysteine proteinases of the CA clan. Such compounds are particularly useful for the in vivo therapeutic treatment of diseases in which participation of a cysteine proteinase is implicated.\n\n\nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION\n\n\nProteinases form a substantial group of biological molecules which to date constitute approximately 2% of all the gene products identified following analysis of several completed genome sequencing programmes. Proteinases have evolved to participate in an enormous range of biological processes, mediating their effect by cleavage of peptide amide bonds within the myriad of proteins found in nature. This hydrolytic action is performed by initially recognising, then binding to, particular three-dimensional electronic surfaces displayed by a protein, which align the bond for cleavage precisely within the proteinase catalytic site. Catalytic hydrolysis then commences through nucleophilic attack of the amide bond to be cleaved either via an amino acid side-chain of the proteinase itself, or through the action of a water molecule that is bound to and activated by the proteinase. Proteinases in which the attacking nucleophile is the thiol side-chain of a Cys residue are known as cysteine proteinases. The general classification of ‘cysteine proteinase’ contains many members found in a wide range of organisms from viruses, bacteria, protozoa, plants and fungi to mammals.\n\n\nCathepsin K and indeed many other crucial proteinases belong to the papain-like CAC1 family. Cysteine proteinases are classified into ‘clans’ based upon a similarity in the three-dimensional structure or a conserved arrangement of catalytic residues within the proteinase primary sequence. Additionally, ‘clans’ may be further classified into ‘families’ in which each proteinase shares a statistically significant relationship with other members when comparing the portions of amino acid sequence which constitute the parts responsible for the proteinase activity (see Barrett, A. J et al, in ‘Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes’, Eds. Barrett, A. J., Rawlings, N. D., and Woessner, J. F. Publ. Academic Press, 1998, for a thorough discussion).\n\n\nTo date, cysteine proteinases have been classified into five clans, CA, CB, CC, CD and CE (Barrett, A. J. et al, 1998). A proteinase from the tropical papaya fruit ‘papain’ forms the foundation of clan CA, which currently contains over 80 distinct and complete entries in various sequence databases, with many more expected from the current genome sequencing efforts. Proteinases of clan CA/family C1 have been implicated in a multitude of house-keeping roles and disease processes. e.g. human proteinases such as cathepsin K (osteoporosis, osteoarthritis), cathepsin S (multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disorders), cathepsin L (metastases), cathepsin B (metastases, arthritis), cathepsin F (antigen processing), cathepsin V (T-cell selection), dipeptidyl peptidase I (granulocyte serine proteinase activation) or parasitic proteinases such as falcipain (malaria parasite \nPlasmodium falciparum\n) and cruzipain (\nTrypanosoma cruzi \ninfection). Recently a bacterial proteinase, staphylopain (\nS. aureus \ninfection) has also been tentatively assigned to clan CA.\n\n\nX-ray crystallographic structures are available for a range of the above mentioned proteinases in complex with a range of inhibitors e.g. papain (PDB entries, 1pad, 1pe6, 1pip, 1pop, 4pad, 5pad, 6pad, 1ppp, 1the, 1csb, 1huc), cathepsin K (1au0, 1au2, 1au3; 1au4, 1atk, 1mem, 1bgo, 1ayw, 1ayu, 1n16, 1nlj, 1q6k, 1snk, 1tu6), cathepsin L (1cs8, 1mhw), cathepsin S (1glo, 1ms6, 1npz), cathepsin V (1fh0), dipeptidyl peptidase I (1jqp, 1k3b), cathepsin B (1gmy, 1csb), cathepsin F (1m6d), cruzain (a recombinant form of cruzipain see Eakin, A. E. et al, 268(9), 6115-6118, 1993) (1ewp, 1aim, 2aim, 1F29, 1F2A, 1F2B, 1F2C), staphylopain (1cv8). Each of the structures displays a similar overall active-site topology, as would be expected by their ‘clan’ and ‘family’ classification and such structural similarity exemplifies one aspect of the difficulties involved in discovering a selective inhibitor of cathepsin K suitable for human use. However, subtle differences in terms of the depth and intricate shape of the active site groove of each CAC1 proteinase are evident, which may be exploited for selective inhibitor design. Additionally, many of the current substrate-based inhibitor complexes of CAC1 family proteinases show a series of conserved hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor and the proteinase backbone, which contribute significantly to inhibitor potency. Primarily a bidentate hydrogen-bond is observed between the proteinase Gly66 (C═O)/inhibitor N—H and the proteinase Gly66(NH)/inhibitor (C═O), where the inhibitor (C═O) and (NH) are provided by an amino acid residue \nNH\nCHR\nCO\n that constitutes the S2 sub-site binding element within the inhibitor (see Berger, A. and Schecter, I. \nPhilos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. [Biol.], \n257, 249-264, 1970 for a description of proteinase binding site nomenclature). A further hydrogen-bond between the proteinase main-chain (C═O) of asparagine or aspartic acid (158 to 163, residue number varies between proteinases) and an inhibitor (N—H) is often observed, where the inhibitor (N—H) is provided by the S1 sub-site binding element within the inhibitor. Thus, the motif X—\nNH\nCHR\nCO\n—\nNH\n—Y is widely observed amongst the prior art substrate-based inhibitors of CAC1 proteinases.\n\n\nCathepsin K is thought to be significant in diseases involving excessive loss of bone or cartilage. Bone consists of a protein matrix incorporating hydroxyapatite crystals. About 90% of the structural protein of the matrix is type I collagen, with the remainder comprising various non-collagenous proteins such as osteocalcin, proteoglycans, osteopontin, osteonectin, thrombospondin, fibronectin and bone sialoprotein.\n\n\nSkeletal bone is not a static structure but continually undergoes a cycle of bone resorption and replacement. Bone resorption is carried out by osteoclasts, which are multinuclear cells of haematopoietic lineage. Osteoclasts adhere to the bone surface and form a tight sealing zone. The membrane on the apical surface of the osteoclasts is folded so as to create a closed extracellular compartment between the osteoclast and the bone surface, which is acidified by proton pumps in the osteoclast membrane. Proteolytic enzymes are secreted into the compartment from the osteoclast. The high acidity in the compartment causes the hydroxyapatite at the surface of the bone to be dissolved and the proteolytic enzymes break down the protein matrix causing a resorption lacuna to be formed. Following bone resorption, osteoblasts produce a new protein matrix that is subsequently mineralised.\n\n\nIn disease states such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease, the bone resorption and replacement cycle is disrupted leading to a net loss of bone with each cycle. This leads to weakening of the bone and therefore to increased risk of bone fracture.\n\n\nCathepsin K is expressed at a high level in osteoclasts and is therefore thought to be essential for bone resorption. Thus, selective inhibition of cathepsin K is likely to be effective in the treatment of diseases involving excessive bone loss. These include osteoporosis, gingival diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis, Paget's disease, hypercalaemia of malignancy and metabolic bone disease.\n\n\nIn addition to osteoclasts, high levels of cathepsin K are also found in chondroclasts from the synovium of osteoarthritic patients. It therefore appears that cathepsin K inhibitors will be of use in the treatment of diseases involving matrix or cartilage degradation, in particular osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nElevated levels of cathepsin K are also found in metastatic neoplastic cells which suggests that cathepsin K inhibitors may also be useful for treating certain neoplastic diseases.\n\n\nIn the prior art, the development of cysteine proteinase inhibitors for human use has recently been an area of intense activity (e.g. see Deaton, D. N. and Kumar, S., Prog. Med. Chem. 42, 245-375, 2004; Bromme, D. and Kaleta, J., Curr. Pharm. Des., 8, 1639-1658, 2002; Kim, W. and Kang, K., Expert Opin. Ther. Patents, 12(3), 419-432, 2002; Leung-Toung, R. et al. Curr. Med. Chem., 9, 979-1002, 2002; Lecaille, F. et al., Chem. Rev., 102, 4459-4488, 2002; Hernandez, A. A. and Roush, W. R., Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., 6, 459-465, 2002). Considering the CAC1 family members, particular emphasis has been placed upon the development of inhibitors of human cathepsins, primarily cathepsin K (osteoporosis), cathepsin S (autoimmune disorders), cathepsin L (metastases), cathepsin B (metastases, arthritis), cathepsin F (antigen processing), cathepsin V (T-cell selection) and dipeptidyl peptidase I (granulocyte serine proteinase activation), through the use of peptide and peptidomimetic nitriles (e.g. see WO-A-03041649, WO-A-03037892, WO-A-03029200, WO-A-02051983, WO-A-02020485, U.S. Pat.

F. and Thompson, S. K., Curr. Opin.

For example, WO-A-9850533 and WO-A-0029408 describe compounds that may be referred to as cyclic ketones (e.g. 1′a-f) and are inhibitors of cysteine proteinases with a particular reference towards papain family proteinases and as a most preferred embodiment, cathepsin K. WO-A-9850533 describes compounds subsequently detailed in the literature as potent inhibitors of cathepsin K with good oral bioavailability (Witherington, J., ‘Tetrahydrofurans as Selective Cathepsin K Inhibitors’, RSC meeting, Burlington House, London, 1999). The compounds of WO-A-9850533 were reported to bind to cathepsin K through the formation of a reversible covalent bond between the tetrahydrofuran carbonyl and the active site catalytic cysteine residue (Witherington, J., 1999). Additionally, the same cyclic ketone compounds are described in WO-A-9953039 as part of a wide-ranging description of inhibitors of cysteine proteinases associated with parasitic diseases, with particular reference to the treatment of malaria by inhibition of falcipain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior Art Cyclic Inhibitors of Cathepsin K\n\n\nThe initial cyclic inhibitors of GSK were based upon potent, selective and reversible 3-amido-tetrahydrofuran-4-ones[1′a], 3-amidopyrrolidin-4-ones [1′b], 4-amidotetrahydropyran-3-ones [1′ c], 4-amidopiperidin-3-ones [1′ d] and 4-amidoazepan-3-ones [1′e, 1′f] (shown above) [see (a) Marquis, R. W. et al, J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 725, and references cited therein; (b) Marquis, R. W. et al, J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 1380, and references cited therein; (c) Yamashita, D. S. et al, J. Med. Chem. 2006, 49(5), 1597-1612].\n\n\nFurther studies revealed that cyclic ketones [1′], in particular the five-membered ring analogues [1′ a] and [1′b], suffered from configurational instability due to facile epimerisation at the centre situated α to the ketone [Marquis, R. W. et al, J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 1380; Fenwick, A. E. et al, J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001, 11, 199; WO 00/69855]. This precluded the pre-clinical optimisation of inhibitors of formulae [1′ a-d] and led to the development of the configurationally more stable azepanone series [1′ e], providing the cathepsin K inhibitor clinical candidate relacatib [1′f]. However, literature clearly states that azepanones are still prone to epimerisation and indeed relacatib [1′f] is reported to exist as a 9:1 thermodynamic mixture of 4-S and 4-R isomers [Yamashita, D. S. et al, J. Med. Chem., 2006, 49(5), 1597-1612]. As an alternative to the ring expansion approach, alkylation of the α-carbon removes the ability of cyclic ketones [1′] to undergo α-enolisation and hence leads to configurational stability. However, studies have shown that α-methylation in the 3-amidopyrrolidin-4-one [1′b] system results in a substantial loss in potency versus cathepsin K from K\ni,app\n≈0.18 to 50 nM.\n\n\nThe cyclic ketone compounds of WO-A-0069855 are considered to be an advance on compounds of WO-A-9850533 due to the presence of the β-substituent on the cyclic ketone ring system that provides improved chiral stability to the α-carbon of the cyclic ketone ring system. However, the compounds of WO-A-0069855 and indeed those of WO-A-9850533 describe a requirement for the presence of the potential hydrogen-bonding motif X—\nNH\nCHR\nCO\n—\nNH\n—Y that is widely observed amongst the prior art substrate-based inhibitors of CAC1 proteinases.\n\n\nMore recent studies have investigated 5,5-bicyclic systems as inhibitors of CAC1 proteinases, for example, N-(3-oxo-hexahydrocyclopenta[b]furan-3a-yl)acylamide bicyclic ketones [2′] [(a) Quibell, M.; Ramjee, M. K., WO 02/57246; (b) Watts, J. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004, 12, 2903-2925], tetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one based scaffolds [3′] [(a) Quibell, M. WO02/57270; (b) Quibell, M. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2004, 12, 5689-5710], cis-6-oxohexahydro-2-oxa-1,4-diazapentalene and cis-6-oxo-hexahydropyrrolo[3,2-c]pyrazole based scaffolds [4′] [Wang, Y. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2005, 15, 1327-1331], and cis-hexahydropyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one based scaffolds [5′] [a) Quibell, M. WO04/07501; (b) Quibell, M. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2005, 13, 609-625].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5,5-bicyclic Inhibitors of CAC1 Cysteinyl Proteinases\n\n\nStudies have shown that the above-described 5,5-bicyclic systems exhibit promising potency as inhibitors of a range of therapeutically attractive mammalian and parasitic CAC1 cysteinyl proteinase targets. Moreover, the 5,5-bicyclic series are chirally stable due to a marked energetic preference for a cis-fused rather than a trans-fused geometry. This chiral stability provides a major advance when compared to monocyclic systems that often show limited potential for preclinical development due to chiral instability.\n\n\nPCT applications WO-A-02057270 and WO-A-04007501 describe bicyclic compounds in which the chirality of the α-aminoketone is stabilised (for a review of energetic considerations within fused ring systems see (a) Toromanoff, E. \nTetrahedron Report No \n96, 36, 2809-2931, 1980; (b) Eliel, E. L. et. al. \nStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\n, Wiley: New York, 1-1267, 1994). These compounds do not contain the X—\nNH\nCHR\nCO\n—\nNH\n—Y motif and yet the compounds are highly potent inhibitors across a broad range of CAC1 cysteine proteinases. In particular, certain of the compounds are potent and selective inhibitors of a range of mammalian and parasitic CAC1 proteinases.\n\n\nMore recently, Quibell, M. et al (\nBioorg. Med. Chem. \n12, 5689-5710, 2004) disclosed two potent and selective cathepsin K inhibitors having a tetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one core, along with in vitro potency and in vitro selectivity data. Further kinetic parameters such as enzyme association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rates were disclosed, as well as basic physiochemical parameters such as plasma and microsome stability, Caco-2 permeability and LogD (pH\n7.4\n) measurements.\n\n\nThe present inventors have now discovered a small genus of tetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-ones that exhibit potent in vitro inhibition versus human cathepsin K. Advantageously, the claimed compounds also display favourable pharmacokinetic properties and potent osteoclast activity versus human cells and a highly preferred subset exhibit potent inhibitory activity in rat osteoclasts.\n\n\nSTATEMENT OF INVENTION\n\n\nA first aspect of the invention relates to compounds of general formula (I), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, complexes and prodrugs thereof,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein:\n\n \n \nR\n3 \nis tert-butylmethyl, sec-butyl or tert-butyl;\n \nX is CH or N; and\n \nR\n4 \nis optionally substituted C\n1-4 \nalkyl or optionally substituted C\n3-8 \ncycloalkyl.\n \n\n\nAs mentioned above, compounds of formula (I) exhibit surprisingly high efficacies for human cathepsin K.

Furthermore, the alkyl group may optionally contain one or more heteroatoms for example, to give ethers, thioethers, sulphones, sulphonamides, substituted amines, amidines, guanidines, carboxylic acids, carboxamides. If the heteroatom is located at a chain terminus then it is appropriately substituted with one or two hydrogen atoms. For example, the group CH\n3\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— is defined within ‘alkyl’ as a C\n4 \nalkyl that contains a centrally positioned heteroatom whereas the group CH\n3\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— is defined within ‘alkyl’ as an unsubstituted C\n4 \nalkyl.\n\n\nPreferably, the alkyl group is a C\n1-8 \nalkyl group, more preferably a C\n1-6 \ngroup, even more preferably a C\n1-4 \nalkyl group.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “cycloalkyl” refers to a cyclic alkyl group (i.e. a carbocyclic ring) which may be substituted (mono- or poly-) or unsubstituted.

compound of the invention is selected from EXAMPLES 3, 4 and 5 as described in the accompanying Examples section.\n\n\nIn an even more highly preferred embodiment, the compound of the invention is EXAMPLE 8 as described in the accompanying Examples section.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention admixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, excipients or carriers. Other active materials may also be present, as may be considered appropriate or advisable for the disease or condition being treated or prevented.\n\n\nEven though the compounds of the present invention (including their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters and pharmaceutically acceptable solvates) can be administered alone, they will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent, particularly for human therapy. The pharmaceutical compositions, may be for human or animal usage in human and veterinary medicine.\n\n\nExamples of such suitable excipients for the various different forms of pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be found in the “Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients,”2\nnd \nEdition, (1994), Edited by A Wade and PJ Weller. The carrier, or, if more than one be present, each of the carriers, must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient.\n\n\nAcceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985).\n\n\nExamples of suitable carriers include lactose, starch, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sorbitol and the like. Examples of suitable diluents include ethanol, glycerol and water.\n\n\nThe choice of pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent can be selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise as, or in addition to, the carrier, excipient or diluent any suitable binder(s), lubricant(s), suspending agent(s), coating agent(s), solubilising agent(s).\n\n\nExamples of suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose, anhydrous lactose, free-flow lactose, beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums, such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethyl cellulose and polyethylene glycol.\n\n\nExamples of suitable lubricants include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like.\n\n\nPreservatives, stabilizers, dyes and even flavoring agents may be provided in the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of preservatives include sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Antioxidants and suspending agents may be also used.\n\n\nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition as described above, the process comprising bringing the active compound(s) into association with the carrier, for example by admixture.\n\n\nIn general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active agent with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. The invention extends to methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising bringing a compound of general formula (I) in conjunction or association with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier or vehicle.\n\n\nSalts/Esters\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention can be present as salts or esters, in particular pharmaceutically and veterinarily acceptable salts or esters.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention include suitable acid addition or base salts thereof. A review of suitable pharmaceutical salts may be found in Berge et al, J Pharm Sci, 66, 1-19 (1977). Salts are formed, for example with strong inorganic acids such as mineral acids, e.g. hydrohalic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide and hydroiodide, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid sulphate, bisulphate, hemisulphate, thiocyanate, persulphate and sulphonic acids; with strong organic carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 4 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with aminoacids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid. Salts which are not pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable may still be valuable as intermediates.\n\n\nPreferred salts include, for example, acetate, trifluoroacetate, lactate, gluconate, citrate, tartrate, maleate, malate, pantothenate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, butyrate, digluconate, cyclopentanate, glucoheptanate, glycerophosphate, oxalate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, nicotinate, palmoate, pectinate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, proprionate, tartrate, lactobionate, pivolate, camphorate, undecanoate and succinate, organic sulphonic acids such as methanesulphonate, ethanesulphonate, 2-hydroxyethane sulphonate, camphorsulphonate, 2-naphthalenesulphonate, benzenesulphonate, p-chlorobenzenesulphonate and p-toluenesulphonate; and inorganic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, bisulphate, hemisulphate, thiocyanate, persulphate, phosphoric and sulphonic acids.\n\n\nEsters are formed either using organic acids or alcohols/hydroxides, depending on the functional group being esterified. Organic acids include carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 12 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with aminoacids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid. Suitable hydroxides include inorganic hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide. Alcohols include alkanealcohols of 1-12 carbon atoms which may be unsubstituted or substituted, e.g. by a halogen).\n\n\nEnantiomers/Tautomers\n\n\nIn all aspects of the present invention previously discussed, the invention includes, where appropriate all enantiomers, diastereoisomers and tautomers of the compounds of the invention. The person skilled in the art will recognise compounds that possess optical properties (one or more chiral carbon atoms) or tautomeric characteristics. The corresponding enantiomers and/or tautomers may be isolated/prepared by methods known in the art.\n\n\nEnantiomers are characterised by the absolute configuration of their chiral centres and described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog. Such conventions are well known in the art (e.g. see ‘Advanced Organic Chemistry’, 3\nrd \nedition, ed. March, J., John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1985).\n\n\nCompounds of the invention containing a chiral centre may be used as a racemic mixture, an enantiomerically enriched mixture, or the racemic mixture may be separated using well-known techniques and an individual enantiomer may be used alone.\n\n\nStereo and Geometric Isomers\n\n\nSome of the compounds of the invention may exist as stereoisomers and/or geometric isomers—e.g. they may possess one or more asymmetric and/or geometric centres and so may exist in two or more stereoisomeric and/or geometric forms. The present invention contemplates the use of all the individual stereoisomers and geometric isomers of those inhibitor agents, and mixtures thereof. The terms used in the claims encompass these forms, provided said forms retain the appropriate functional activity (though not necessarily to the same degree).\n\n\nThe present invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of the agent or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. An isotopic variation of an agent of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine and chlorine such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n17\nO, \n18\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF and \n36\nCl, respectively. Certain isotopic variations of the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as \n3\nH or \n14\nC is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated, i.e., \n3\nH, and carbon-14, i.e., \n14\nC, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., \n2\nH, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. For example, the invention includes compounds of general formula (I) where any hydrogen atom has been replaced by a deuterium atom. Isotopic variations of the agent of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of this invention can generally be prepared by conventional procedures using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents.\n\n\nProdrugs\n\n\nThe invention further includes the compounds of the present invention in prodrug form, i.e. covalently bonded compounds which release the active parent drug according to general formula (I) in vivo. Such prodrugs are generally compounds of the invention wherein one or more appropriate groups have been modified such that the modification may be reversed upon administration to a human or mammalian subject. Reversion is usually performed by an enzyme naturally present in such subject, though it is possible for a second agent to be administered together with such a prodrug in order to perform the reversion in vivo. Examples of such modifications include ester (for example, any of those described above), wherein the reversion may be carried out be an esterase etc. Other such systems will be well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nA prodrug may for example constitute a ketal or hemiketal derivative of the exocyclic ketone functionality present in the tetrahydro-furo[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one scaffold.\n\n\nSolvates\n\n\nThe present invention also includes solvate forms of the compounds of the present invention. The terms used in the claims encompass these forms.\n\n\nPolymorphs\n\n\nThe invention further relates to the compounds of the present invention in their various crystalline forms, polymorphic forms and (an)hydrous forms. It is well established within the pharmaceutical industry that chemical compounds may be isolated in any of such forms by slightly varying the method of purification and or isolation form the solvents used in the synthetic preparation of such compounds.\n\n\nAssays\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention relates to the use of a compound of the invention as defined hereinabove in an assay for identifying further candidate compounds that influence the activity of one or cysteine proteinases.\n\n\nPreferably, the assay is capable of identifying candidate compounds that are capable of inhibiting one or more CAC1 cysteine proteinases.\n\n\nMore preferably, the assay is a competitive binding assay.\n\n\nPreferably, the candidate compound is generated by conventional SAR modification of a compound of the invention.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “conventional SAR modification” refers to standard methods known in the art for varying a given compound by way of chemical derivatisation.\n\n\nThus, in one aspect, the identified compound may act as a model (for example, a template) for the development of other compounds. The compounds employed in such a test may be free in solution, affixed to a solid support, borne on a cell surface, or located intracellularly. The abolition of activity or the formation of binding complexes between the compound and the agent being tested may be measured.\n\n\nThe assay of the present invention may be a screen, whereby a number of agents are tested. In one aspect, the assay method of the present invention is a high through-put screen.\n\n\nThis invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralising antibodies capable of binding a compound specifically compete with a test compound for binding to a compound.\n\n\nAnother technique for screening provides for high throughput screening (HTS) of agents having suitable binding affinity to the substances and is based upon the method described in detail in WO 84/03564.\n\n\nIt is expected that the assay methods of the present invention will be suitable for both small and large-scale screening of test compounds as well as in quantitative assays.\n\n\nPreferably, the competitive binding assay comprises contacting a compound of the invention with a cysteine proteinase in the presence of a known substrate of said enzyme and detecting any change in the interaction between said cysteine proteinase and said known substrate.\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention provides a method of detecting the binding of a ligand to a cysteine proteinase, said method comprising the steps of:\n\n \n \n(i) contacting a ligand with cysteine proteinase in the presence of a known substrate of said enzyme;\n \n(ii) detecting any change in the interaction between said enzyme and said known substrate;\n\n\nand wherein said ligand is a compound of the invention.\n\n \n\n\nOne aspect of the invention relates to a process comprising the steps of\n\n \n \n(a) performing an assay method described hereinabove;\n \n(b) identifying one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain; and\n \n(c) preparing a quantity of said one or more ligands.\n \n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention provides a process comprising the steps of:\n\n \n \n(a) performing an assay method described hereinabove;\n \n(b) identifying one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain; and\n \n(c) preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising said one or more ligands.\n \n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention provides a process comprising the steps of\n\n \n \n(a) performing an assay method described hereinabove;\n \n(b) identifying one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain;\n \n(c) modifying said one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain;\n \n(d) performing the assay method described hereinabove;\n \n(e) optionally preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising said one or more ligands.\n \n\n\nThe invention also relates to a ligand identified by the method described hereinabove.\n\n\nYet another aspect of the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a ligand identified by the method described hereinabove.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention relates to the use of a ligand identified by the method described hereinabove in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of one or more disorders selected from osteoporosis, Paget's disease, Chagas's disease, malaria, gingival disease such as gingivitis or periodontitis, hypercalaemia, metabolic bone disease and diseases involving matrix or cartilage degradation, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, neoplastic diseases and bone cancer disorders such as bone metastases and associated pain.\n\n\nThe above methods may be used to screen for a ligand useful as an inhibitor of one or more cysteine proteinases.\n\n\nCompounds of general formula (I) are useful both as laboratory tools and as therapeutic agents. In the laboratory certain compounds of the invention are useful in establishing whether a known or newly discovered cysteine proteinase contributes a critical or at least significant biochemical function during the establishment or progression of a disease state, a process commonly referred to as ‘target validation’.\n\n\nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of validating a known or putative cysteine proteinase as a therapeutic target, the method comprising:\n\n \n \n(a) assessing the in vitro binding of a compound as described above to an isolated known or putative cysteine proteinase, providing a measure of potency; and optionally, one or more of the steps of:\n \n(b) assessing the binding of the compound to closely related homologous proteinases of the target and general house-keeping proteinases (e.g. trypsin) to provide a measure of selectivity;\n \n(c) monitoring a cell-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity, in the presence of the compound; and\n \n(d) monitoring an animal model-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity in the presence of the compound.\n \n\n\nThe invention therefore provides a method of validating a known or putative cysteine proteinase as a therapeutic target. Differing approaches and levels of complexity are appropriate to the effective inhibition and ‘validation’ of a particular target. In the first instance, the method comprises assessing the in vitro binding of a compound of general formula (I) to an isolated known or putative cysteine proteinase, providing a measure of ‘potency’. An additional assessment of the binding of a compound of general formula (I) to closely related homologous proteinases of the target and general house-keeping proteinases (e.g. trypsin) provides a measure of ‘selectivity’. A second level of complexity may be assessed by monitoring a cell-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity, in the presence of a compound of general formula (I). For example, an ‘osteoclast resorption assay’ has been utilised as a cell-based secondary in vitro testing system for monitoring the activity of cathepsin K and the biochemical effect of proteinase inhibitors (e.g. see WO-A-9850533). An ‘MI-IC-II processing—T-cell activation assay’ has been utilised as a cell-based secondary in vitro testing system for monitoring the activity of cathepsin S and the biochemical effect of proteinase inhibitors (Shi, G-P., et al, \nImmunity, \n10, 197-206, 1999). When investigating viral or bacterial infections such a marker could simply be a functional assessment of viral (e.g. count of mRNA copies) or bacterial loading and assessing the biochemical effect of proteinase inhibitors. A third level of complexity may be assessed by monitoring an animal model-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity, in the presence of a compound of general formula (I). For example, murine models of \nLeishmania \ninfection, \nP. vinckei \ninfection, malaria (inhibition of falcipain) and \nT. cruzi \ninfection (cruzipain), indicate that inhibition of cysteine proteinases that play a key role in pathogen propagation is effective in arresting disease symptoms, ‘validating’ said targets.\n\n\nThe invention therefore extends to the use of a compound of general formula (I) in the validation of a known or putative cysteine proteinase as a therapeutic target.\n\n\nBiological Activity\n\n\nAdvantageously, the compounds of the present invention exhibit surprisingly high efficacies for human cathepsin K. Indeed, all of the compounds prepared to date exhibit potent in vitro inhibition versus human cathepsin K with Ki<50 nM (for example see table 1). In contrast, the majority of the eighty-two prior art compounds detailed in WO-A-02057270 were significantly less potent against human cathepsin K than the preferred compounds of the present invention (for example see table 2). Therefore preferred compounds of the present invention are 4-15 fold more potent in vitro against human cathepsin K than the most potent example from WO-A-02057270 and in the majority of examples greater than 1000-fold more potent.\n\n\nPreferably, the compounds exhibit in vitro inhibition versus human cathepsin K with Ki<40 nM, more preferably <30 nM, even more preferably <20 nM, more preferably still <10 nM, and even more preferably <5 nM. The compounds of the invention exhibit high selectivity against other mammalian cathepsins displaying little or no inhibitory activity for cathepsins S, L, B and V at 1 μM compound.\n\n\nThe presently claimed compounds also exhibit desirable pharmacokinetic properties. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the presence of a piperazine or piperidine ring moiety confers compounds of formula (I) with one or more of the following: favourable HLM stability, improved plasma stability and/or improved solubility, compared with other cathepsin K inhibitors known in the art (for example, those disclosed in WO 02/057270 and prior art compound 23/10 detailed in Quibell, M. et. al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 13, 609-625, 2005; Quibell M, et al Bioorg. Med. Chem., 12, 5689-5710, 2004). In particular, results have shown that compounds of formula (I) as described herein exhibit surprisingly good stability in plasma and microsome assays. For example, preferred compounds of the present invention are significantly more stable in human plasma and against human liver microsomes, e.g. compare stability of prior art compound 23 with any of the presently preferred piperazine or piperidine ring moiety containing analogues (table 1).\n\n\nIn addition, presently claimed compounds exhibit potent osteoclast activity versus human cells. In addition, a highly preferred sub-group of presently claimed compounds, wherein R\n3 \nis tert-butylmethyl such that the central moiety is the aminoacid (S)-tert-butylalanine, additionally exhibit potent osteoclast activity versus rat cells (e.g. compare rat osteoclast data for EXAMPLES (3-5) with those where R\n3 \nis tert-butyl [EXAMPLE 8] or R\n3 \nis sec-butyl [EXAMPLE 9] detailed in table 1). Data suggests that this cross species osteoclast activity is a feature common to the highly preferred sub-group of compounds of the present invention. The literature details significantly reduced potencies for many other cathepsin K inhibitor series when profiled against rat analogues (e.g. see Deaton, D. N. and Kumar, S. \nProg. In Med. Chem. \n42, 245-375, 2004), a factor that has caused major obstacles for the development of alternative series. Thus, highly preferred compounds may be distinguished further as those that show higher potency in human and rat osteoclast assays.\n\n\nLogD is an experimentally determined characteristic of a compound that is considered to reflect the propensity of a compound to transfer across the lipid core of a membrane. LogD is defined as the logarithm of the distribution coefficient (D) at a selected pH, usually assumed to be measured in octanol/water. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that human osteoclast potency and experimentally determined Log D (pH7.4) can be used as a means of further distinguishing highly preferred inhibitors of cathepsin K. For example, prior art compound EXAMPLE 1 which has the increased stability and high in vitro human cathepsin K potency that is afforded by the piperazine moiety, exhibits 55% inhibition of human osteoclast activity at 1 μM. EXAMPLE 2 that is a close analogue of prior art EXAMPLE 1 exhibits 58% inhibition of human osteoclast activity at 1 μM. In contrast, preferred compounds of the present invention which exhibit broadly similar high in vitro human cathepsin K potency when compared to EXAMPLES 1 and 2 show significantly increased inhibition of human osteoclast activity at 72-82% at 1 μM (see table 1). Therefore preferred examples of the present invention show a surprising increase in human osteoclast potency when LogD\n(7.4) \nis greater than 0.8.\n\n\nTherapeutic Use\n\n\nCompounds of general formula (I) are useful for the in vivo treatment or prevention of diseases in which participation of a cysteine proteinase is implicated.\n\n\nIn particular, compounds of general formula I are inhibitors of a wide range of CAC1 cysteinyl proteinases for example cathepsin K, cathepsin S, cathepsin L, cathepsin F, cathepsin B, cathepsin V, cruzipains, falcipains and \nleismania mexicana \nCPB proteinase.\n\n\nPreferably, the compound of general formula I is selective for cathepsin K. As used herein, the term “selective for cathepsin K” means that the inhibitor is selective for cathepsin K over one or more other mammalian CAC1 cysteinyl proteinases for example cathepsin S, cathepsin L, cathepsin F, cathepsin B and cathepsin V. Preferably, the inhibitor exhibits a selectivity ratio for cathepsin K over other mammalian CAC1 cysteinyl proteinases of greater than 2-fold, more preferably greater than 5-fold, more preferably greater than 10-fold, even more preferably greater than 25-fold, more preferably still, greater than 50-fold or 100-fold.\n\n\nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of general formula (I) for use in medicine, especially for preventing or treating diseases in which the disease pathology may be modified by inhibiting a cysteine proteinase.\n\n\nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of a compound of general formula (I) in the preparation of a medicament for preventing or treating diseases in which the disease pathology may be modified by inhibiting a cysteine proteinase.\n\n\nCertain cysteine proteinases function in the normal physiological process of protein degradation in animals, including humans, e.g. in the degradation of connective tissue. However, elevated levels of these enzymes in the body can result in pathological conditions leading to disease. Thus, cySteine proteinases have been implicated in various disease states, including but not limited to, infections by \nPneumocystis carinii, Trypsanoma cruzi, Trypsanoma brucei brucei \nand \nCrithidia fusiculata\n; as well as in osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, autoimmunity, schistosomiasis, malaria, tumour metastasis, metachromatic leukodystrophy, muscular dystrophy, amytrophy, and the like (see WO-A-9404172 and EP-A-0603873 and references cited therein). Additionally, a secreted bacterial cysteine proteinase from \nS. Aureus \ncalled staphylopain has been implicated as a bacterial virulence factor (Potempa, J., et al. J. Biol. Chem., 262(6), 2664-2667, 1998).\n\n\nThe invention is useful in the prevention and/or treatment of each of the disease states mentioned or implied above. The present invention also is useful in a methods of treatment or prevention of diseases caused by pathological levels of cysteine proteinases, particularly cysteine proteinases of the papain superfamily, which methods comprise administering to an animal, particularly a mammal, most particularly a human, in need thereof a compound of the present invention. The present invention particularly provides methods for treating diseases in which cysteine proteinases are implicated, including infections by \nPneumocystis carinii, Trypsanoma cruzi, Trypsanoma brucei, Leishmania mexicana, Clostridium histolyticum, Staphylococcus aureus\n, foot-and-mouth disease virus and \nCrithidia fusiculata\n; as well as in osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, autoimmunity, schistosomiasis, malaria, tumour metastasis, metachromatic leukodystrophy, muscular dystrophy, amytrophy.\n\n\nInhibitors of cathepsin K, particularly cathepsin K-specific compounds, are useful for the treatment of osteoporosis, Paget's disease, gingival diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis, hypercalaemia of malignancy, metabolic bone disease, diseases involving matrix or cartilage degradation, in particular osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and neoplastic diseases.\n\n\nPreferred features for each aspect of the invention are as for each other aspect \nmutatis mutandis. \n \n\n\nAdministration\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be adapted for rectal, nasal, intrabronchial, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial and intradermal), intraperitoneal or intrathecal administration. Preferably the formulation is an orally administered formulation. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, i.e., in the form of discrete portions containing a unit dose, or a multiple or sub-unit of a unit dose. By way of example, the formulations may be in the form of tablets and sustained release capsules, and may be prepared by any method well known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\nFormulations for oral administration in the present invention may be presented as: discrete units such as capsules, gellules, drops, cachets, pills or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent; as a powder or granules; as a solution, emulsion or a suspension of the active agent in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion; or as a bolus etc. Preferably, these compositions contain from 1 to 250 mg and more preferably from 10-100 mg, of active ingredient per dose.\n\n\nFor compositions for oral administration (e.g. tablets and capsules), the term “acceptable carrier” includes vehicles such as common excipients e.g. binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, polyvinylpyrrolidone (Povidone), methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sucrose and starch; fillers and carriers, for example corn starch, gelatin, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium phosphate, sodium chloride and alginic acid; and lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium stearate and other metallic stearates, glycerol stearate stearic acid, silicone fluid, talc waxes, oils and colloidal silica. Flavouring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, cherry flavouring and the like can also be used. It may be desirable to add a colouring agent to make the dosage form readily identifiable. Tablets may also be coated by methods well known in the art.\n\n\nA tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active agent in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may be optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active agent.\n\n\nOther formulations suitable for oral administration include lozenges comprising the active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active agent in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active agent in a suitable liquid carrier.\n\n\nOther forms of administration comprise solutions or emulsions which may be injected intravenously, intraarterially, intrathecally, subcutaneously, intradermally, intraperitoneally or intramuscularly, and which are prepared from sterile or sterilisable solutions. Injectable forms typically contain between 10-1000 mg, preferably between 10-250 mg, of active ingredient per dose.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be in form of suppositories, pessaries, suspensions, emulsions, lotions, ointments, creams, gels, sprays, solutions or dusting powders.\n\n\nAn alternative means of transdermal administration is by use of a skin patch. For example, the active ingredient can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin. The active ingredient can also be incorporated, at a concentration of between 1 and 10% by weight, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilisers and preservatives as may be required.\n\n\nDosage\n\n\nA person of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine an appropriate dose of one of the instant compositions to administer to a subject without undue experimentation. Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the individual undergoing therapy. The dosages disclosed herein are exemplary of the average case. There can of course be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nIn accordance with this invention, an effective amount of a compound of general formula (I) may be administered to inhibit the proteinase implicated with a particular condition or disease. Of course, this dosage amount will further be modified according to the type of administration of the compound. For example, to achieve an “effective amount” for acute therapy, parenteral administration of a compound of general formula (I) is preferred. An intravenous infusion of the compound in 5% dextrose in water or normal saline, or a similar formulation with suitable excipients, is most effective, although an intramuscular bolus injection is also useful. Typically, the parenteral dose will be about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg; preferably between 0.1 and 20 mg/kg, in a manner to maintain the concentration of drug in the plasma at a concentration effective to inhibit a cysteine proteinase. The compounds may be administered one to four times daily at a level to achieve a total daily dose of about 0.4 to about 400 mg/kg/day. The precise amount of an inventive compound which is therapeutically effective, and the route by which such compound is best administered, is readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by comparing the blood level of the agent to the concentration required to have a therapeutic effect. Prodrugs of compounds of the present invention may be prepared by any suitable method. For those compounds in which the prodrug moiety is a ketone functionality, specifically ketals and/or hemiketals, the conversion may be effected in accordance with conventional methods.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention may also be administered orally to the patient, in a manner such that the concentration of drug is sufficient to inhibit bone resorption or to achieve any other therapeutic indication as disclosed herein. Typically, a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound is administered at an oral dose of between about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg in a manner consistent with the condition of the patient. Preferably the oral dose would be about 0.5 to about 20 mg/kg.\n\n\nNo unacceptable toxicological effects are expected when compounds of the present invention are administered in accordance with the present invention. The compounds of this invention, which may have good bioavailability, may be tested in one of several biological assays to determine the concentration of a compound which is required to have a given pharmacological effect.\n\n\nCombinations\n\n\nIn a particularly preferred embodiment, the one or more compounds of the invention are administered in combination with one or more other active agents, for example, existing drugs available on the market. In such cases, the compounds of the invention may be administered consecutively, simultaneously or sequentially with the one or more other active agents.\n\n\nDrugs in general are more effective when used in combination. In particular, combination therapy is desirable in order to avoid an overlap of major toxicities, mechanism of action and resistance mechanism(s). Furthermore, it is also desirable to administer most drugs at their maximum tolerated doses with minimum time intervals between such doses. The major advantages of combining chemotherapeutic drugs are that it may promote additive or possible synergistic effects through biochemical interactions and also may decrease the emergence of resistance.\n\n\nBeneficial combinations may be suggested by studying the inhibitory activity of the test compounds with agents known or suspected of being valuable in the treatment of a particular disorder. This procedure can also be used to determine the order of administration of the agents, i.e. before, simultaneously, or after delivery. Such scheduling may be a feature of all the active agents identified herein.\n\n\nSynthesis\n\n\nSynthesis of 5,5-Bicyclic Core\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention relates to a process of preparing a compound of formula (I) as defined above, said process comprising converting a compound of formula (II), where R\n5 \nis a protecting group, into a compound of formula (I)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment, the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (III) into a compound of formula (II)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny suitable oxidising agent may be used to convert the secondary alcohol group of (III) into the corresponding ketone (II). Suitable oxidising agents will be familiar to the skilled artisan. By way of example, the oxidation may be carried out via a Dess-Martin periodinane reaction [Dess, D. B. et al, J. Org. Chem. 1983, 48, 4155; Dess, D. B. et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 7277], or via a Swem oxidation [Mancuso, A. J. et al, J. Org. Chem. 1978, 43, 2480]. Alternatively, the oxidation can be carried out using SO\n3\n/pyridine/Et\n3\nN/DMSO [Parith, J. R. et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967, 5505; U.S. Pat. No. 3,444,216, Parith, J. R. et al,], P\n2\nO\n5\n/DMSO or P\n2\nO\n5\n/Ac\n2\nO [Christensen, S. M. et al, Organic Process Research and Development, 2004, 8, 777]. Other alternative oxidation reagents include activated dimethyl sulphoxide [Mancuso, A. J., Swern, D. J., Synthesis, 1981, 165], pyridinium chlorochromate [Pianeatelli, G. et al, Sythesis, 1982, 245] and Jones' reagent [Vogel, A, I., Textbook of Organic Chemistry, 6\nth \nEdition].\n\n\nMore preferably, the process comprises treating a compound of formula (III) with Dess-Martin periodinane. Preferably, the reaction is carried out using dichloromethane as solvent.\n\n\nIn a more preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (IV) into a compound of formula (III)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferably, this step involves treating a compound of formula (IV) with a metal triethylborohydride such as lithium, sodium or potassium.\n\n\nIn a more preferred embodiment the R\n5 \nprotecting group in compound (IV) is tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc).\n\n\nIn a yet more preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (IVa) into a compound of formula (III)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (V) into a compound of formula (IV)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore preferably, the process comprises treating a compound of formula (V) with sodium hydride. Preferably, the reaction is carried out in THF.\n\n\nIn an alternative preferred embodiment of the invention, the intra-molecular cyclisation of compound (V) is induced by removal of the protecting group R\n5\n. Preferably, for this embodiment, R\n5 \nis benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), and the process comprises hydrogenating a compound of formula (V) in the presence of a palladium catalyst.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (VI) into a compound of formula (V)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment, the oxidising agent is mCPBA.\n\n\nIn another preferred embodiment, the oxidising agent is a dioxirane.\n\n\nThe use of dioxiranes as oxidising agents is well documented in the literature [see (a) Hodgson, D. M. et al, Synlett, 310 (2002); (b) Adam, W. et al, Acc. Chem. Res. 22, 205, (1989); (c) Yang, D. et al, J. Org. Chem., 60, 3887, (1995); (d) Mello, R. et al, J. Org. Chem., 53, 3890, (1988); (e) Curci, R. et al, Pure & Appl. Chem., 67(5), 811 (1995); (f) Emmons, W. D. et al, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 89, (1955)].\n\n\nPreferably, the dioxirane is generated in situ by the reaction of KHSO\n5 \nwith a ketone. However, the oxidation step can also be carried out using an isolated dioxirane, for example a stock solution of the dioxirane formed from acetone.\n\n\nMore preferably, the dioxirane is generated in situ using Oxone®, which is a commercially available oxidising agent containing KHSO\n5 \nas the active ingredient.\n\n\nThus, in one preferred embodiment, the claimed process involves the in situ epoxidation of a compound of formula (VI) using Oxone® (2KHSO\n5\n.KHSO\n4\n.K\n2\nSO\n4\n) and a ketone co-reactant.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the active ingredient of Oxone® is potassium peroxymonosulfate, KHSO\n5 \n[CAS-RN 10058-23-8], commonly known as potassium monopersulfate, which is present as a component of a triple salt with the formula 2KHSO\n5\n.KHSO\n4\n.K\n2\nSO\n4 \n[potassium hydrogen peroxymonosulfate sulfate (5:3:2:2), CAS-RN 70693-62-8; commercially available from DuPont]. The oxidation potential of Oxone® is derived from its peracid chemistry; it is the first neutralization salt of peroxymonosulfuric acid H\n2\nSO\n5 \n(also known as Caro's acid).\n\n\nK\n+−O—S(═O)\n \n2\n(—OOH)\n\n\n\nPotassium Monopersulfate\n\n\nUnder slightly basic conditions (pH 7.5-8.0), persulfate reacts with the ketone co-reactant to form a three membered cyclic peroxide (a dioxirane) in which both oxygens are bonded to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. The cyclic peroxide so formed then epoxidises the compound of formula VI by syn specific oxygen transfer to the alkene bond.\n\n\nPreferably, the ketone is of formula (XIX)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\na \nand R\nb \nare each independently alkyl, aryl, haloalkyl or haloaryl.\n\n\n\nWhere R\na \nand/or R\nb \nare alkyl, the alkyl group may be a straight chain or branched alkyl group. Preferably, the alkyl group is a C\n1-20 \nalkyl group, more preferably a C\n1-15\n, more preferably still a C\n1-12 \nalkyl group, more preferably still, a C\n1-8 \nor C\n1-6 \nalkyl group, more preferably a C\n1-4 \nalkyl group. Particularly preferred alkyl groups include, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl and hexyl.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “haloalkyl” refers to an alkyl group as described above in which one or more hydrogens are replaced by halo.\n\n\nWhere R\na \nand/or R\nb \nare aryl, the aryl group is typically a C\n6-12 \naromatic group. Preferred examples include phenyl and naphthyl etc.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “haloaryl” refers to an aryl group as described above in which one or more hydrogens are replaced by halo.\n\n\nBy way of example, the reaction of KHSO\n5 \n(Oxone®) with a ketone of formula XVI would form a dioxirane of formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\na \nand R\nb \nare as defined above.\n\n\n\nMore preferably, R\na \nand R\nb \nare each independently alkyl or haloalkyl.\n\n\nIn a highly preferred embodiment, at least one of R\na \nand R\nb \nis a haloalkyl, more preferably, CF\n3 \nor CF\n2\nCF\n3\n.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment, R\na \nand R\nb \nare each independently methyl or trifluoromethyl.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment of the invention, the ketone is selected from acetone and a 1,1,1-trifluoroalkyl ketone.\n\n\nIn a more preferred embodiment of the invention, the trifluoroalkyl ketone is 1,1,1-trifluoroacetone or 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-butanone, more preferably 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-butanone.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (VII) into a compound of formula (VI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferably the process comprises treating a compound of formula (VII) with tosyl chloride in pyridine. Alternatively the process comprises treating a compound of formula (VII) with tosyl chloride in dichloromethane and triethylamine.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (VIII) into a compound of formula (VII)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere W is halogen or tosyl.\n\n\n\nPreferably, this step comprises the steps of:\n\n \n \n(a) reacting a compound of formula (VIII), where W is halogen or OTs, with aqueous ammonia and alcohol; and\n \n(b) converting the product formed in step (a) to a compound of formula (VII).\n \n\n\nPreferably, steps (a) and (b) of the above process are a one-pot process.\n\n\nIn one particularly preferred embodiment, R\n5 \nis benzyloxycarbonyl, and step (b) comprises treating the mixture formed in step (a) with benzyloxycarbonyl chloride.\n\n\nPreferably, W is I, Br or OTs, more preferably, Br or OTs, even more preferably OTs.\n\n\nPreferably, the alcohol is isopropyl alcohol or ethanol.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment of the invention, said compound of formula VIII is prepared from a compound of formula IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferably, the above process comprises treating said compound of formula IX with methyl lithium.\n\n\nMore preferably, compound of formula IX is compound 47 and compound of formula VIII is compound 14; or compound of formula IX is compound 46 and compound of formula VIII is compound 13. Treatment of monobromotosylates 46 or 47 with zinc dust at room temperature in organic/aqueous mixtures (most preferably an isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, water, ammonium chloride mixture) provides alcohols 13 and 14 respectively in high yield. Additionally, completion of the one-pot conversion gives alcohols VIIa and VIIb with defined stereochemistry and in high yield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommencing from the commercially available sugars isomannide and isosorbide, the present invention also provides facile preparation of monobromotosylates 46 and 47 One highly preferred preparation is shown below in Scheme 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsosorbide (43) is converted to the di-tosylate (42) which is obtained following recrystallisation from methanol in 97% yield. Mono-bromination is effected by 2.5 eq lithium bromide in DMSO (or DMF) with temperature control 110° C.→120° C. The product bromide is isolated following extractive work-up and purification either by column chromatography (74%) or attractive for large scale by recrystallisation from methanol giving a first crop of 55% plus mother liquors containing good quality material that may be pooled from batch runs and purified later. Thus, preparation of monobromotosylate (47) with defined stereochemistry by methods in Scheme 15 is attractive for large scale applications. Treatment of monobromotosylate (47) with zinc dust at room temperature in organic/aqueous mixtures (most preferably an isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, water, ammonium chloride mixture) provides alcohol (14) which is derivatised as the Cbz compound (18) through one pot conversion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment of isomannide (40) (Scheme 16) with tosylchloride (2.2 eq) in a bi-phasic potassium hydroxide/dichloromethane/carbon tetrachloride mixture at 0° C. gives ditosylate (39) in 48% yield following simple filtration and trituration with methanol. Alternatively, treatment of isomannide (40) with tosylchloride (0.5 eq) in a bi-phasic potassium hydroxide/dichloromethane/carbon tetrachloride mixture at 0° C. gives monotosylate in 38% yield following simple extraction and re-crystallisation from carbon tetrachloride (conditions as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,858,632). Although the monotosylate can be obtained in higher yield by treatment of isomannide (40) with tosylchloride in pyridine, purification currently requires column chromatography which may becomes undesirable at large scale. Monobromotosylate (46) may then be prepared by treatment of ditosylate (39) with lithium bromide in DMF (29% yield following chromatography) or by treatment of monotosylate under Mitsunobu conditions with carbon tetrabromide (63% yield following chromatography). Treatment of monobromotosylate (46) with zinc dust at room temperature in organic/aqueous mixtures (most preferably an isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, water, ammonium chloride mixture) provides alcohol (13) which is derivatised as the Cbz compound (17) through one pot conversion.\n\n\nIn one highly preferred embodiment of the invention, the 5,5-bicylic core is prepared in accordance with the steps set forth in Scheme 1 below:\n\n\nThe alcohol functionality of (18) may be derivatised as the para-toluene sulphonate (Ts) giving (R)-2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-14(S)-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-yl)ethyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate (32b) which proceeds through the anti-epoxide (R)-2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-1-((1S,2S,5S)-3,6-dioxabicyclo [3.1.0] hexan-2-yl)ethyl 4-methylbenzenesulphonate (33b). Hydrogenation of tosylate (33b) provides free amine that undergoes intramolecular cyclisation. Urethane protection of the secondary amine of the bicyclic intermediate gives (3R,3aR,6R,6aS)-benzyl 3-hydroxy-6-(tosyloxy)tetrahydro-2H-furo[3,2-b]pyrrole-4(5H)-carboxylate (34b) or (3R,3aR,6R,6aS)-tert-butyl 3-hydroxy-6-(tosyloxy)tetrahydro-2H-furo[3,2-b]pyrrole-4(5H)-carboxylate (35b). An analogous reaction scheme can be applied to the enantiomer of (18), namely, benzyl (S)-2-((S)-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-yl)-2-hydroxyethyl carbamate (17), proceeding through the analogous anti-epoxide (S)-2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-1-((1S,2S,5S)-3,6-dioxabicyclo[3.1.0] hexan-2-yl)ethyl 4-methylbenzenesulphonate. Subsequent treatment of tosylate (35b) with super-hydride (for general refs. see (a) Brown, H. C., et al, J. Org. Chem., 45(1), 1-12, 1980; (b) Krishnamurthy, S and Brown; H. C., J. Org. Chem., 41(18), 3064-3066, 1976) reduces out the tosyl group giving the saturated bicycle intermediate. Advantageously, the epoxidation to give the desired anti-epoxide is directed by the presence of the tosylate group whilst only modest stereoselectivity can be achieved for the corresponding saturated alkene. Thus, although this route to the 6-unsubstituted derivatives involves additional synthetic steps, the stereoselectivity of the epoxidation is controlled to allow much higher yields of the desired anti-epoxide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an alternative preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (XII), wherein PG\n2 \nis a protecting group, into a compound of formula (Ha)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferably, said compound of formula (XII) is prepared from a compound of formula (XIII)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment, protecting group R\n5 \nis selected from benzyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl.\n\n\nIn one particularly highly preferred embodiment of the invention, R\n5 \nis tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) or fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc).\n\n\nPreferably, PG\n2 \nis tert-butyl ether.\n\n\nIn one highly preferred embodiment, the reaction proceeds via the process illustrated in Scheme 2 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFmOC(O) denotes the well known amine protecting group 9-fluorenyl methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc, see Atherton, E. and Sheppard, R. C., 1989) and PG\n2 \ndenotes either a free hydroxyl or an hydroxyl protecting group such as tert-butyl ether.\n\n\nAlthough formation of the diazoketone is clearly observed at 1 hr reaction, an overall improvement in isolated yield is obtained by leaving the reaction with ethereal diazomethane for 24 hr.\n\n\nConsidering step (a), synthesis may commence from suitably protected 3-hydroxyproline (XIV), which are accessible through a variety of literature methods e.g. (a) Heffner, R. J., et al, \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc., \n114, 10181-10189, 1992; (b) Hughes, P. Cardy, J., \nJ. Org. Chem., \n54, 3260-3264, 1989, (c) Heffner, R. J., Jouille, M. M., \nTet.

Lett., \n37, 4001-, 1996.\n\n\nActivation of the suitably protected 3-hydroxyproline (XIV) via isobutyl chloroformate mixed anhydride, followed by condensation with diazomethane, yields the diazomethylketone intermediates (XV). Treatment of diazomethylketone intermediate (XV) with lithium chloride in aqueous acetic acid provides the protected tetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one (XVI).\n\n\nSynthesis of Compounds of Formula (I)\n\n\nTo those skilled in the practices of organic chemistry, compounds of general formula (I) may be readily synthesised by a number of chemical strategies, performed either in solution or on the solid phase (see Atherton, E. and Sheppard, R. C. In ‘\nSolid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach\n’, Oxford University Press, Oxford, U.K. 1989, for a general review of solid phase synthesis principles), or a combination thereof.\n\n\nCompounds of general formula (I) may be conveniently considered as a combination of three building blocks (P1, P2 and P3) that respectively occupy the S1, S2 and S3 binding sites of the protease (see Berger, A. and Schechter, I., \nPhilos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. \n[Biol.], 257, 249-264, 1970 for a description of the designation of enzyme S-subsites and substrate P-subsites within enzyme-substrate or enzyme-inhibitor complexes). The notional concepts of P1, P2 and P3 are used herein for convenience only and the above-mentioned compounds are intended to be within the scope of the invention regardless of binding mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA suitably protected and/or activated building block may then be prepared and subsequently chemically bonded (coupled) together with other building blocks to provide compounds of general formula (I).\n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) may be prepared: (1) by the stepwise addition of P3 and P2 to the bicyclic tetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one core; or (2) by reaction of the bicyclic tetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one core with a P3-P2 prescursor molecule; or (3) by introducing the P3-P2 group prior to formation of the bicyclic tetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one core, i.e. prior to the oxidation step or prior to the intramolecular cyclisation step.\n\n\nThus, alternative orders of coupling of the building blocks are possible, for example P2+P1→P2−P1 then addition of P3→P3−P2−P1 or P3+P2→P3−P2 then addition to P1→P3−P2−P1. Within each of these combinations each of the P1, P2 or P3 building blocks may contain additional alternative functionalities that are further transformed following coupling to give the final compound. For example the ketone functionality of the P1 building block may be protected as a ketal during coupling of building blocks and transformed to the final ketone by hydrolysis following completion of the coupling reactions. Alternatively, the ketone functionality of the P1 building block may be initially introduced via a lower oxidation state such as the corresponding alcohol and following completion of the coupling reactions be re-introduced by oxidation of the alcohol. Alternatively, the ketone functionality of the P1 building block may be protected through a semi-carbazone suitable for solid phase synthesis (e.g. see WO 02/057270 and references cited therein) and following completion of the coupling reactions released from the solid phase by acidolytic reaction.\n\n\nThe chemical bond formed by coupling of the building blocks is a secondary amide (P3−P2) or a tertiary amide (P2−P1) that are formed through reaction of an activated carboxylic acid with a primary and secondary amine respectively. Many methods are available for activation of a carboxylic acid prior to coupling to an amine and in principle, any of these methods may be used herein. Typical carboxylic acid activation methods are exemplified but not restricted to the azide method, mixed anhydride method (e.g. via isobutylchloroformate), carbodiimide methods (e.g. via dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3-(3′-dimethylamino propyl)carbodiimide), active ester method (e.g. via p-nitrophenyl ester, N-hydroxysuccinic imido ester, pentafluorophenyl ester), uronium method (e.g. via addition of HBTU, PyBop, BOP), carbonyldiimidazole method or via pre-formation of acyl fluorides or acyl chlorides. In some instances the coupling reaction may be enhanced by the addition of a further activation catalyst such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, or 4-dimethylaminopyridine. A general description of carboxylic acid activation techniques and the use of activation additives may be found in Bodanszky, M. ‘Principles of Peptide Synthesis’, 2\nnd \nrev. ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1993 and references cited therein.\n\n\nThe α-amino group of the P2 aminoacid building block is usually protected during coupling reactions to the P1 building block to avoid the formation of undesired self-condensation products. The art of α-amino protection is well known in peptide chemistry (e.g. see Bodanszky, M. ‘Principles of Peptide Synthesis’, 2\nnd \nrev. ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1993 and references cited therein) and example protection groups include, but are not limited to, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) and trichloroethoxycarbonyl (Treoc). The Fmoc group is particularly well suited for solid phase syntheses (e.g. see Atherton, E.; Sheppard, R. C. in ‘Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis A Practical Approach’, IRL Press, Oxford, U.K., 1989) typically being removed by treatment with 20% v/v piperidine in dimethylformamide or 1% v/v 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene in dimethylformamide. The Boc group is particularly well suited to solution phase syntheses typically being removed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid based mixtures or HCl in dioxane or ethyl acetate. The Cbz group is also particularly well suited for solution phase syntheses typically being removed by catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen and palladium catalysis or by treatment with HBr in acetic acid. Once the coupling sequence is complete, any protecting groups are removed in whatever manner is dictated by the choice of protecting groups (for a general description of protecting groups and their respective stabilities and methods of removal see Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M. ‘Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis’ John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1991 and references therein).\n\n\nIn the simplest example, the entire left hand portion of a compound of general formula (I) (i.e. P3−P2) as the carboxylic acid can be prepared in solution by traditional organic chemistry methods and coupled to ketone, alcohol or ketal intermediates such as compounds (IIb), (IIc) and (IId). Then oxidation of the alcohol intermediate (e.g. Dess-Martin periodinane in DCM) or acidolytic cleavage of the ketal intermediate provides compounds of general formula (I). The alcohol oxidation route is particularly useful when the compound of general formula (I) contains a substituent that is labile to trifluoroacetic acid, this being the final reagent used in each of the solid phase syntheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of these different coupling tactics have been detailed previously (see (i) Quibell, M. et. al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. \n13, 609-625, 2005. (ii) Wang, Y. et. al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. \n15, 1327-1331, 2005) and the optimum synthetic route is dependant upon the specific substituent combinations of the target compound of general formula (I).\n\n\nIn more detail, one preferred strategy for the synthesis of compounds of general formula (I) comprises:—\n\n \n \n(a) Preparation of an appropriately functionalised and protected bicyclic ketone or bicyclic alcohol building block in solution;\n \n(b) Attachment of the building block (a) to the solid phase through a linker that is stable to the conditions of synthesis, but readily labile to cleavage at the end of a synthesis (see James, I. W., \nTetrahedron, \n55(Report No 489), 4855-4946, 1999, for examples of the ‘linker’ function as applied to solid phase synthesis);\n \n(c) Solid phase organic chemistry (see Brown, R. D. J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1, 19, 3293-3320, 1998), to construct the remainder of the molecule;\n \n(d) Compound cleavage from the solid phase into solution; and\n \n(e) Cleavage work-up and compound analysis.\n \n\n\nA second strategy for the synthesis of compounds of general formula (I) comprises:—\n\n \n \n(a) Preparation of an appropriately functionalised and protected bicyclic intermediate building block in solution. Preferred protecting groups for solution phase chemistry are the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), Nα-tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), Nα-benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and Nα-allyloxycarbonyl group (Alloc).\n \n(b) Standard organic chemistry methods for the conversion of building block obtained in step (a) towards compounds of general formula (I).\n \n\n\nAs mentioned above, in one preferred embodiment of the invention, compounds of formula (I) may be prepared using conventional solution phase chemistry, for example, as described in Quibell, M et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 13, 609-625, 2005 (see in particular, Schemes 3 and 4). The solution phase strategy is attractive in being able to generate larger quantities of preferred analogues, typically on a multi-gram to multi-kilogram scale.\n\n\nIn an alternative preferred embodiment of the invention, compounds of formula (I) may be prepared using conventional solid phase chemistry, for example, as described in Quibell M, et al Bioorg. Med. Chem., 12, 5689-5710, 2004, see in particular, Scheme 3 and Section 3.2, and references cited therein; and Bioorg. Med. Chem., 13, 609-625, 2005, see Scheme 5 and Section 2.2, and references cited therein). The solid phase strategy is attractive in being able to generate many thousands of analogues, typically on a 5-100 mg scale, through established parallel synthesis methodologies (e.g. see (a) Bastos, M.; Maeji, N. J.; Abeles, R. H. \nProc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA, \n92, 6738-6742, 1995).\n\n\nThe synthetic strategy is based on reversible anchorage of the ketone functionality via a hydrazide linker bond using general multipin techniques previously described in the art (Watts J. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 12(11), 2903, 2004; Quibell M., et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 5689-5710, 2004; Grabowksa U. et al, J. Comb. Chem. 2000, 2(5), 475).\n\n\nCompounds of formula (II) may be utilised in a solid phase synthesis of inhibitor molecules (I). The solid phase linkage of an aldehyde or ketone, has previously been described by a variety of methods (e.g. see (a) James, I. W., 1999, (b) Lee, A., Huang, L., Ellman, J. A., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 121(43), 9907-9914, 1999, (c) Murphy, A. M., et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 114, 3156-3157, 1992). A suitable method amenable to the reversible linkage of an alkyl ketone functionality is through a combination of the previously described chemistries. The semicarbazide, 4-[[(hydrazinocarbonyl)amino]methyl]cyclohexane carboxylic acid. trifluoroacetate (Murphy, A. M., et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 114, 3156-3157, 1992), may be utilised as illustrated in Scheme 3, exemplified by linkage of the tetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one (II; R\n5\n=Fmoc).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruct (XVII) is prepared through reaction of the linker molecule and the tetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one II (R\n5\n=Fmoc) by refluxing in aqueous ethanol/sodium acetate. Standard solid phase techniques (e.g. see Atherton, E. and Sheppard, R. C., 1989) are used to anchor the construct to an amino-functionalised solid phase through the free carboxylic acid functionality of (XVII), providing the loaded construct (XVIII). Loaded construct (XVIII) be reacted with a wide range of carboxylic acids available commercially or in the literature, to introduce the left-hand portion ‘P3-P2’.\n\n\nThe present invention is further described by way of example.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nGeneral Procedures\n\n\nSolvents were purchased from ROMIL Ltd, U.K. at SpS or Hi-Dry grade unless otherwise stated. \n1\nH NMR and \n13\nC NMR were obtained on a Bruker DPX400 (400 MHz \n1\nH frequency and 100 MHz \n13\nC frequency; QXI probe) or Bruker Avance 500 MHz (TXI probe with ATM) in the solvents indicated.

The data from these types of assays enables compound potency and the rates of reaction to be measured and quantified. This information, either alone or in combination with other information, would allow the amount of compound required to produce a given pharmacological effect to be determined.\n\n\nIn vitro Cathepsin Ki Inhibition Measurements\n\n\nStock solutions of substrate or inhibitor were made up to 10 mM in 100% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Rathburns, Glasgow, U.K.) and diluted as appropriately required. In all cases the DMSO concentration in the assays was maintained at less than 1% (vol./vol.). The equilibrium inhibition constants (K\ni\n \nss\n) for each compound were measured under steady-state conditions monitoring enzyme activity as a function of inhibitor concentration. The values were calculated on the assumption of pure competitive behaviour (Cornish-Bowden, A. \nFundamentals of enzyme kinetics \nPortland Press; 1995, 93-128.). Human recombinant cathepsin K (0.25 nM final; B. Turk, Josef, Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia), was routinely assayed in 100 mM sodium acetate; pH 5.5 containing 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM L-cysteine and 1.8 μM Z-Leu-Arg-AMC ([S]=K\nM\n).\n\n\nMeasurement of the Apparent Macroscopic Binding (Michaelis) Constants K\nM\n \napp\n) for Substrates\n\n\nThe apparent macroscopic binding constant (K\nM\n \napp\n) for each substrate was calculated, from the dependence of enzyme activity as a function of substrate concentration. The observed rates were plotted on the ordinate against the related substrate concentration on the abscissa and the data fitted by direct regression analysis (Prism v 3.02; GraphPad, San Diego, USA) using Equation t (Cornish-Bowden, A. \nFundamentals of enzyme kinetics \nPortland Press; 1995, 93-128).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nmax\n\n\napp\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\no\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\no\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nM\n\n\napp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Equation 1 ‘v\ni\n’ is the observed initial rate, ‘V\nmax\n \napp\n’ is the observed maximum activity at saturating substrate concentration, ‘K\nM\n \napp\n’ is the apparent macroscopic binding (Michaelis) constant for the substrate, ‘[S\no\n]’ is the initial substrate concentration.\n\n\nMeasurement of the Inhibition Constants\n\n\nThe apparent inhibition constant (K\ni\n) for each compound was determined on the basis that inhibition was reversible and occurred by a pure-competitive mechanism.

Assays were carried out by addition of various concentrations of inhibitor to assay buffer containing substrate. Assays were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the reaction mixture and the change in fluorescence monitored over time.

The second order rate constant was obtained from the slope of the line of a plot of k\nobs \nversus the inhibitor concentration (i.e. k\nobs\n/[I]).

All liver microsome incubations were carried out in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, with a final microsomal protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Compounds were taken from 5 mM DMSO stock solutions and diluted in incubation buffer to give a final concentration of 25 with a final DMSO concentration of 0.5% v/v. In brief, compounds were added to the incubation buffer along with the liver microsomes and incubated at 37° C. for 10 minutes. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of NADPH, previously dissolved in incubation buffer, to give a final concentration of 1 mM and re-incubated at 37° C. Aliquots were removed at 2 and 60 minutes and quenched with an equal volume of cold acetonitrile. After mixing vigorously, the precipitated protein matter was removed by filtration (Multiscreen Solvinert filter plates, Millipore, Bedford, Mass., USA) and the filtrate analysed by reverse phase HPLC with mass spectrometric detection, using single ion monitoring of the [M+H]\n+\n species. Metabolic turnover was determined by comparison of peak areas from the ion chromatograms of the parent compound at 2 and 60 minutes and expressed as percent remaining at 1 hour.\n\n\nPlasma Incubations\n\n\nHuman and rat plasma were purchased from Innovative Research Inc. (Southfield. MI, USA). Compounds were taken from 5 mM DMSO stock solutions and added to plasma, which had previously been incubated at 37° C., to give a final concentration of 25 μM and re-incubated. Aliquots were removed at 2 and 60 minutes and quenched with an equal volume of cold acetonitrile. After mixing vigorously, the precipitated protein matter was removed by filtration (Multiscreen Solvinert filter plates, Millipore, Bedford, Mass., USA) and the filtrate analysed by reverse phase HPLC with mass spectrometric detection, using single ion monitoring of the [M+H]\n+\n species. Metabolic turnover was determined by comparison of peak areas from the ion chromatograms of the parent compound at 2 and 60 minutes and expressed as percent remaining at 1 hour:\n\n\nLogD Determinations\n\n\nLogD\n(PBS) \ndeterminations were performed in 96 well microtitre plates using a miniaturised “shake-flask” method. In brief, compounds were taken from 10 mM DMSO stock solutions and added to wells containing equal volumes of phosphate buffered saline (10 mM; pH 7.4) (PBS) and 1-octanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, Dorset, UK) to give a final concentration of 50 μM. The plates were then capped and mixed vigorously for 1 hour on a microtitre plate shaker, after which they were left to stand, allowing the PBS and octanol phases to separate. The PBS layer was analysed by reverse phase HPLC with mass spectrometric detection, using single ion monitoring of the [M+H]\n+\n species. LogD\n(PBS) \nwas determined by comparison of the peak area from the ion chromatogram of the compound in the PBS phase with that of a 50 μM standard of the same compound dissolved in acetonitrile/water (50:50) and calculated using the following formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nLog\n\n\n⁡\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUCstd\n\n\n-\n\n\nAUCpbs\n\n\n\n\nAUCpbs\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere AUCstd and AUCpbs are the peak areas from the standard and test ion chromatograms respectively. LogD\n(PBS) \ndeterminations were also made using PBS at pH6.9 and 5.5 by adjusting the pH of the buffer prior to the start of the assay, with 0.1 M HCL.\n\n\nHuman Osteoclast Resorption Assay\n\n\nBone resorption was studied using a model where human osteoclast precursor cells were cultured on bovine bone slices for 9 days and allowed to differentiate into bone-resorbing osteoclasts. The formed mature osteoclasts were then allowed to resorb bone. The assay was performed by Pharmatest Services Ltd, ItAinen Pitkakatu 4C, Turku, Finland. After the culture period, bone collagen degradation products were quantified from the culture medium as an index of bone resorption. Inhibitor compounds were added into the cell cultures after the differentiation period and their effects on the resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts were determined. The studies included a baseline group without added compounds and a positive control group where a potent cathepsin K inhibitor E-64 was added.\n\n\nHuman peripheral blood monocytes were suspended to culture medium and allowed to attach to bovine bone slices. The bone slices were transferred into 96-well tissue culture plates containing culture medium with appropriate amounts of important growth factors favouring osteoclast differentiation, including M-CSF, RANK-ligand and TGF-β. The cells were incubated in a CO\n2 \nincubator in humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide at 37° C. At day 7 when osteoclast differentiation was complete, the culture medium was replaced with culture medium containing conditions favouring osteoclast activity. The cell culture was continued for an additional 2 days, during which the formed mature osteoclasts were allowed to resorb bone in the presence of vehicle, control inhibitor (E64) or test compounds. At the end of the culture, bone collagen degradation products released into the culture medium were determined using a commercially available ELISA method (CrossLaps® for culture, Nordic Bioscience, Herlev, Denmark) as an index of bone resorption (see Bagger, Y. Z., et al, J. Bone. Miner. Res. 14 (suppl. 1), S370).\n\n\nIn this assay, selected EXAMPLES of the invention exhibited more than 70% inhibition of bone resorption at a concentration of 250 nM.\n\n\nRat Osteoclast Resorption Assay\n\n\nBone resorption was studied using a model where mature osteoclasts derived from rat bone were cultured on bovine bone slices for 3 days and allowed to resorb bone in the presence of inhibitor, positive control (E-64) or vehicle. More specifically, tibia, femori and humeri were removed from 1 day old rat pups. The endosteal surfaces of the bones were scraped with a scapelto release osteoclasts into the culture medium and the osteoclasts were allowed to attach to bovine bone slices. After the culture period, bone collagen degradation products were quantified from the culture medium as an index of bone resorption. The assay was performed by Pharmatest Services Ltd, Itilinen Pitkakatu 4C, Turku, Finland.\n\n\nIn this assay, selected EXAMPLES of the invention exhibited more than 50% inhibition of bone resorption at a concentration of 500 nM.\n\n\nVarious modifications and variations of the described aspects of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.
