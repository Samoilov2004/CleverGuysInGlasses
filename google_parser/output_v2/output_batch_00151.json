No. 60/833,164 filed Jul. 25, 2006, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is related to pyridazinone derivatives, their use as H\n3 \ninhibitors, processes for their preparation, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nHistamine is a well established modulator of neuronal activity. At least four subtypes of histamine receptors have been reported in the literature—H\n1\n, H\nz\n, H\n3\n, H\n4\n. The histamine H\n3 \nreceptors play a key role in neurotransmission in the central nervous system. The H\n3 \nreceptor was discovered in 1983 originally on histamine-containing neurons where it was shown to function presynaptically, regulating the release and synthesis of the biogenic amine histamine (Arrang et al, 1983) now a well established neurotransmitter. H\n3 \nreceptors are predominately expressed in the brain, localizing to the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus and hypothalamus. H\n3 \nreceptors are also localized presynaptically on histaminergic nerve terminals and act as inhibitory autoreceptors (Alguacil and Perez-Garcia, 2003; Passani et al, 2004; Leurs at al, 2005; Celanire et al, 2005; Witkin and Nelson, 2004). When these receptors are activated by histamine, histamine release is inhibited. H\n3 \nreceptors can also be found in the periphery (skin, lung, cardiovascular system, intestine, GI tract, etc). H\n3 \nreceptors are also involved in presynaptic regulation of the release of acetylcholine, dopamine, GABA, glutamate and serotonin (see Repka-Ramirez, 2003; Chazot and Hann, 2001; Leurs et al, 1998). The H\n3 \nreceptor demonstrates a high degree of constitutive or spontaneous activity (e.g., receptor is active in the absence of agonist stimulation) in vitro and in vivo, thus, ligands to the receptor can display, agonist, neutral antagonist or inverse agonist effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe location and function of histaminergic neurons in the CNS suggests that compounds interacting with the H\n3 \nreceptor may have utility in a number of therapeutic applications including narcolepsy or sleep/wake disorders, feeding behavior, eating disorders, obesity, cognition, arousal, memory, mood disorders, mood attention alteration, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease/dementia, schizophrenia, pain, stress, migraine, motion sickness, depression, psychiatric disorders and epilepsy (Leers et al, 2005; Witkin and Nelson, 2004, Hancock and Fox 2004; Esbenshade et al. 2006). An H\n3 \nantagonist/inverse agonist could be important for gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory disorders such as asthma, inflammation, and myocardial infarction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOhtake et al. (US 2006/0178375 A1) disclosed compounds that reportedly exhibit histamine receptor H\n3 \nantagonist or inverse agonist activity and may be useful for the treatment or prevention of obesity, diabetes, hormonal secretion abnormality, or sleep disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCelanire et al. (WO 2006/103057 A1 and WO 2006/103045) have disclosed compounds comprising an oxazoline or thiazoline moiety, processes for preparing them, their pharmaceutical compositions and their uses as H\n3 \nligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBertrand et al. (WO 2006/117609 A2) disclosed novel histamine H\n3 \nreceptor ligands, processes for their preparation, and their therapeutic applications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSchwartz et al. (WO 2006/103546 A2) disclosed certain methods of treatment for Parkinson's disease, obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, dementia with Lewy bodies, and/or vascular dementia using non-imidazole alkylamine derivatives that are antagonists of the H\n3 \nreceptors of histamine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApodaca et al. (EP 1 311 482 B1) disclosed certain non-imidazole aryloxypiperidines as H\n3 \nreceptor ligands, their synthesis, and their use for the treatment of disorders and conditions mediated by the histamine receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nXu et al. disclosed certain 6-substituted phenyl-4,5-dihydro-3(2H)-pyridazinones, their synthesis, and rabbit platelet aggregation inhibitory activity induced by ADP in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, there is a need for novel classes of compounds that possess the beneficial properties. It has been discovered that currently disclosed class of compounds, referred to herein as substituted pyridazinone derivatives, are useful as agents for treating or preventing various diseases or disorders disclosed herein.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention is directed, in part, to novel pyridazinone compounds which may be useful as H\n3 \ninhibitors, and thus may be useful, inter alia, in methods for treating diseases, disorders, and/or conditions that may be mediated or modulated by inhibition of H\n3\n, or otherwise associated with the H\n3 \nreceptor system, including, for example, narcolepsy or sleep/wake disorders, feeding behavior, eating disorders, obesity, cognition, arousal, memory, mood disorders, mood attention alteration, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease/dementia, schizophrenia, pain, stress, migraine, motion sickness, depression, psychiatric disorders, epilepsy, gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory disorders (such as asthma), inflammation, and myocardial infarction.

salt thereof being more preferred.\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a second embodiment, the compounds of formula I are selected from Examples 22 to 38, 49 to 50 and 52 to 55. In a third embodiment, the compounds are selected from Examples 12, and 56 to 61. In a fourth embodiment, the compounds are selected from Examples 1 to 3, 5 to 7, 9 to 11, 13 to 15, 18, 20, 39 to 48, and 81. In a fifth embodiment, the compounds are selected from Examples 51, and 62 to 74. In a sixth embodiment, the compounds are selected from Examples 4, 8, 16 to 17, and 19. In a seventh embodiment, the compounds are selected from Examples 75 to 78. In a eighth embodiment, the compounds are Examples 79 and 80.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention is directed to pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described above. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” includes salts of compounds of the present invention derived from the combination of such compounds with non-toxic acid or base addition salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcid addition salts include inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric, nitric and phosphoric acid, as well as organic acids such as acetic, citric, propionic, tartaric, glutamic, salicylic, oxalic, methanesulfonic, para-toluenesulfonic, succinic, and benzoic acid, and related inorganic and organic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBase addition salts include those derived from inorganic bases such as ammonium and alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, and the like, as well as salts derived from basic organic amines such as aliphatic and aromatic amines, aliphatic diamines, hydroxy alkamines, and the like. Such bases useful in preparing the salts of this invention thus include ammonium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, calcium hydroxide, methylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, cyclohexylamine, ethanolamine and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to pharmaceutically-acceptable salts, other salts are included in the invention. They may serve as intermediates in the purification of the compounds, in the preparation of other salts, or in the identification and characterization of the compounds or intermediates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the present invention can also exist as various solvates, such as with water, methanol, ethanol, dimethylformamide, ethyl acetate and the like. Mixtures of such solvates can also be prepared. The source of such solvate can be from the solvent of crystallization, inherent in the solvent of preparation or crystallization, or adventitious to such solvent. Such solvates are within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also encompasses the pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the compounds disclosed herein. As used herein, “prodrug” is intended to include any compounds which are converted by metabolic processes within the body of a subject to an active agent that has a formula within the scope of the present invention. Since prodrugs are known to enhance numerous desirable qualities of pharmaceuticals (e.g., solubility, bioavailability, manufacturing, etc.) the compounds of the present invention may be delivered in prodrug form. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in \nProdrugs\n, Sloane, K. B., Ed.; Marcel Dekker New York, 1992, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is recognized that compounds of the present invention may exist in various stereoisomeric forms. As such, the compounds of the present invention include both diastereomers and enantiomers. The compounds are normally prepared as racemates and can conveniently be used as such, but individual enantiomers can be isolated or synthesized by conventional techniques if so desired. Such racemates and individual enantiomers and mixtures thereof form part of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well known in the art how to prepare and isolate such optically active forms. Specific stereoisomers can be prepared by stereospecific synthesis using enantiomerically pure or enantiomerically enriched starting materials. The specific stereoisomers of either starting materials or products can be resolved and recovered by techniques known in the art, such as resolution of racemic forms, normal, reverse-phase, and chiral chromatography, recrystallization, enzymatic resolution, or fractional recrystallization of addition salts formed by reagents used for that purpose. Useful methods of resolving and recovering specific stereoisomers described in Eliel, E. L.; Wilen, S. H. \nStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\n; Wiley: New York, 1994, and Jacques, J, et al. \nEnantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions\n; Wiley: New York, 1981, each incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is further recognized that functional groups present on the compounds of Formula I may contain protecting groups. For example, the amino acid side chain substituents of the compounds of Formula I can be substituted with protecting groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl groups. Protecting groups are known per se as chemical functional groups that can be selectively appended to and removed from functionalities, such as hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups. These groups are present in a chemical compound to render such functionality inert to chemical reaction conditions to which the compound is exposed. Any of a variety of protecting groups may be employed with the present invention. Preferred groups for protecting lactams include silyl groups such as t-butyldimethylsilyl (“TBDMS”), dimethoxybenzhydryl (“DMB”), acyl, benzyl (“Bn”), and methoxybenzyl groups. Preferred groups for protecting hydroxy groups include TBS, acyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (“CBZ”), t-butyloxycarbonyl (“Boc”), and methoxymethyl. Many other standard protecting groups employed by one skilled in the art can be found in Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M., “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis” 2d. Ed., Wiley & Sons, 1991.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor therapeutic purposes, the compounds of the present invention can be administered by any means that results in the contact of the active agent with the agent's site of action in the body of the subject. The compounds may be administered by any conventional means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals, either as individual therapeutic agents or in combination with other therapeutic agents, such as, for example, analgesics. The compounds employed in the methods of the present invention including, for example, the compounds of Formula I, I*, I**, I(a-i), and/or II, may be administered by any means that results in the contact of the active agents with the agents' site or site(s) of action in the body of a patient. The compounds of the present invention are preferably administered in therapeutically effective amounts for the treatment of the diseases and disorders described herein to a subject in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA therapeutically effective amount can be readily determined by the attending diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, by the use of conventional techniques. The effective dose will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, the formulation of the active agent with appropriate excipients, and the route of administration. Typically, the compounds are administered at lower dosage levels, with a gradual increase until the desired effect is achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical dose ranges are from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, with a preferred dose from about 0.01 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg of body weight per day. A preferred daily dose for adult humans includes about 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg, and an equivalent dose in a human child. The compounds may be administered in one or more unit dose forms. The unit dose ranges from about 1 to about 500 mg administered one to four times a day, preferably from about 10 mg to about 300 mg, two times a day. In an alternate method of describing an effective dose, an oral unit dose is one that is necessary to achieve a blood serum level of about 0.05 to 20 μg/ml in a subject, and preferably about 1 to 20 μg/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the compounds of the present invention may be administered as the pure chemicals, it is preferable to present the active ingredient as a pharmaceutical composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally speaking, therapeutic compounds of this invention may be administered to a patient alone or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention, for example, compounds of Formula I, I*, I**, I(a-i), and/or II, are preferably combined with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice as described, for example, in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n(Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference, in their entireties. The carrier(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The relative proportions of active ingredient and carrier may be determined, for example, by the solubility and chemical nature of the compounds, chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by admixture with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The excipients are selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice, as described, for example, in \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n20\nth \ned.; Gennaro, A. R., Ed.; Lippincott Williams & Wilkins: Philadelphia, Pa., 2000. The compositions may be formulated to control and/or delay the release of the active agent(s), as in fast-dissolve, modified-release, or sustained-release formulations. Such controlled-release, or extended-release compositions may utilize, for example biocompatible, biodegradable lactide polymers, lactide/glycolide copolymers, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers, or other solid or semisolid polymeric matrices known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions can be prepared for administration by oral means; parenteral means, including intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous routes; topical or transdermal means; transmucosal means, including rectal, vaginal, sublingual and buccal routes; ophthalmic means; or inhalation means. Preferably the compositions are prepared for oral administration, particularly in the form of tablets, capsules or syrups; for parenteral administration, particularly in the form of liquid solutions, suspensions or emulsions; for intranasal administration, particularly in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols; or for topical administration, such as creams, ointments, solutions, suspensions aerosols, powders and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor oral administration, the tablets, pills, powders, capsules, troches and the like can contain one or more of the following: diluents or fillers such as starch, or cellulose; binders such as microcrystalline cellulose, gelatins, or polyvinylpyrrolidones; disintegrants such as starch or cellulose derivatives; lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate; glidants such as colloidal silicon dioxide; sweetening agents such as sucrose or saccharin; or flavoring agents such as peppermint or cherry flavoring. Capsules may contain any of the afore listed excipients, and may additionally contain a semi-solid or liquid carrier, such as a polyethylene glycol. The solid oral dosage forms may have coatings of sugar, shellac, or enteric agents. Liquid preparations may be in the form of aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, elixirs, etc., or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as surfactants, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, diluents, sweetening and flavoring agents, dyes and preservatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may also be administered parenterally. The pharmaceutical forms acceptable for injectable use include, for example, sterile aqueous solutions, or suspensions. Aqueous carriers include mixtures of alcohols and water, buffered media, and the like. Nonaqueous solvents include alcohols and glycols, such as ethanol, and polyethylene glycols; oils, such as vegetable oils; fatty acids and fatty acid esters, and the like. Other components can be added including surfactants; such as hydroxypropylcellulose; isotonic agents, such as sodium chloride; fluid and nutrient replenishers; electrolyte replenishers; agents which control the release of the active compounds, such as aluminum monostearate, and various co-polymers; antibacterial agents, such as chlorobutanol, or phenol; buffers, and the like. The parenteral preparations can be enclosed in ampules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials. Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for the active compounds include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposomes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther possible modes of administration include formulations for inhalation, which include such means as dry powder, aerosol, or drops. They may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or oily solutions for administration in the form of nasal drops, or as a gel to be applied intranasally. Formulations for topical use are in the form of an ointment, cream, or gel. Typically these forms include a carrier, such as petrolatum, lanolin, stearyl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, or their combinations, and either an emulsifying agent, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, or a gelling agent, such as tragacanth. Formulations suitable for transdermal administration can be presented as discrete patches, as in a reservoir or microreservoir system, adhesive diffusion-controlled system or a matrix dispersion-type system. Formulations for buccal administration include, for example lozenges or pastilles and may also include a flavored base, such as sucrose or acacia, and other excipients such as glycocholate. Formulations suitable for rectal administration are preferably presented as unit-dose suppositories, with a solid based carrier, such as cocoa butter, and may include a salicylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical kits useful in, for example, the treatment of pain, which comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention and/or other therapeutic compounds described herein, in one or more sterile containers, are also within the ambit of the present invention. Sterilization of the container may be carried out using conventional sterilization methodology well known to those skilled in the art. The sterile containers of materials may comprise separate containers, or one or more multi-part containers, as exemplified by the UNIVIAL™ two-part container (available from Abbott Labs, Chicago, Ill.), as desired. The compound of the invention and/or other therapeutic compound as described herein may be separate, or combined into a single dosage form as described above. Such kits may further include, if desired, one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as for example, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional vials for mixing the components, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be administered, guidelines for administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the components, may also be included in the kit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be used in methods to bind histamine receptors, more preferably histamine H\n3 \nreceptors. Such binding may be accomplished by contacting the receptor with an effective amount of a compound of Formula I, I*, I**, I(a-i), and/or II. The histamine receptors may be located in the central nervous system or located peripherally to the central nervous system or in both locations. Preferably, the contacting step conducted in an aqueous medium, preferably at physiologically relevant ionic strength, pH, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another aspect, the invention is directed to methods of binding histamine receptors, more preferably histamine H\n3 \nreceptors, comprising the step of administering to a patient in need thereof, an effective amount of a compound of the invention including, for example, a compound of Formula I, I*, I**, I(a-i), and/or II, or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain preferred aspects, the methods comprise the step of administering to said patient an therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I, I*, I**, I(a-i), and/or II, or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some preferred embodiments, the histamine receptors are H\n3 \nhistamine receptors. In certain more preferred embodiments, the compound selectively binds H\n3 \nhistamine receptors relative to H\n1\n, H\n2 \nand/or H\n4 \nreceptors. In certain preferred embodiments, the H\n3 \nhistamine receptors are located in the central nervous system. In some other preferred embodiments, the compound of Formula I, I*, I**, I(a-i), and/or II, or any combination thereof exhibits activity toward the histamine receptors. In certain preferred embodiments, the binding agonizes the activity of the cannabinoid receptors. In other preferred embodiments, the binding antagonizes the activity of the cannabinoid receptors, more preferably as a neutral antagonist. In still other preferred embodiments, the binding inversely agonizes the activity of the cannabinoid receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other preferred embodiments, the compounds of Formula I, I*, I**, I(a-i), and/or II, or any combination thereof exhibit activity toward the histamine receptors in vivo. In alternatively preferred embodiments, the compounds of Formula I, I*, I**, I(a-i), and/or II, or any combination thereof, exhibit activity toward the histamine receptors in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain other preferred aspects of the invention, there are provided methods of treating a disease, disorder or condition that may be affected, modulated or controlled through the binding of histamine, preferably H\n3 \nhistamine receptors. More preferably these diseases, disorders, and/or conditions selected from the group consisting of narcolepsy or sleep/wake disorders, feeding behavior, eating disorders, obesity, cognition, arousal, memory, mood disorders, mood attention alteration, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease/dementia, schizophrenia, pain, stress, migraine, motion sickness, depression, psychiatric disorders, epilepsy, gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory disorders, inflammation, and myocardial infarction. The methods herein provided comprise administering to a subject in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, preferably a compound of formula:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nmore preferably a compound of formula I, I*, I**, I(a-i), and/or II, or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain preferred embodiments, the disorder is narcolepsy or sleep/wake disorders. Alternatively the disorder treated is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs those skilled in the art will appreciate, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein, and the scope of the invention is intended to encompass all such variations.\n\n\n \nSynthesis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be prepared in a number of methods well known to those skilled in the art, including, but not limited to those described below, or through modifications of these methods by applying standard techniques known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. All processes disclosed in association with the present invention are contemplated to be practiced on any scale, including milligram, gram, multigram, kilogram, multikilogram or commercial industrial scale.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe general routes to prepare the examples shown herein are shown in the Schemes 1 and 2. The reagents and starting materials are commercially available, or readily synthesized by well-known techniques by one of ordinary skill in the arts. All substituents in the synthetic Schemes, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCondensation of 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutyric acid or ester, or a derivative there of, with hydrazine or an N-substituted hydrazine derivative in a solvent such as ethanol or 2-propanol provided a route to 4,5-dihydropyridazinone intermediates. Keto-acid intermediates with substitution at the 4- and 5-position (Examples with R\n13/13a \nand R\n14/14a\n) may be readily prepared (Heterocycles, 2002, 57, 39; Indian J.

Pyridazinones with R\n13/13a \nand R\n14/14a \nfused with heteroaryl or cycloalkyl were readily prepared from the corresponding anhydrides. NH(N2) pyridazinones were alkylated with alkyl or substituted alkyl groups using an R\n12\n-halide, a base, for example K\n2\nCO\n3\n, Cs\n2\nCO\n3 \nor NaH, in an inert solvent such as DMF or CH\n3\nCN.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn cases where R\n13 \nor R\n14 \nsubstituted 4,5-dihydropyridazinone formed a mixture of isomers, the isomers were separated by standard methods known in the art. Intermediates wherein R\n12 \nis H may be converted to analogs wherein R\n12 \nis aryl or heteroaryl by standard palladium or copper coupling reactions using the appropriate aryl or heteroaryl halide. The 4,5-dihydropyridazinone may be oxidized to an aromatic pyridazinone using MnO\n2\n, CuCl\n2\n, DDQ, selenium oxide, DMSO/base or sodium 3-nitrobenzenesulfonate in the presence of sodium hydroxide.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Scheme 1, examples of compounds disclosed herein may be obtained by condensation of an intermediate keto acid for example, 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxobutyric acid (or an ester derivative) with hydrazine or an n-substituted hydrazine derivative in a solvent such as ethanol or 2-propanol to produce a dihydropyridazinone intermediate. The keto-acid intermediates not commercially available are readily prepared and described using literature methods. Keto-acid intermediates with R\n13 \nor R\n14 \ngroups in the 4 or 5-positions or fused aryl or heteroaryl groups are described (Heterocycles, 2002, 57, 39; Indian J. Chem, 1977, 16B, 631; Chem Pharm Bull, 1980, 42, 1850; J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46, 2008). The N2 position may be substituted with alkyl or substituted alkyl groups using a base, for example K\n2\nCO\n3\n, Cs\n2\nCO\n3 \nor NaH in an inert solvent such as DMF or CH\n3\nCN. In cases where R\n13 \nor R\n14 \nsubstituted dihydropyridazinone form isomers, the individual isomers may be separated using conventional methods known to the art. R\n13 \naryl or heteroaryl groups may be introduced by standard palladium or copper coupling reactions using the appropriate aryl or heteroaryl halide. Alternatively, the 4,5-position may be oxidized to the pyridazinone intermediate using for example MnO\n2\n, CuCl\n2\n, DDQ or selenium oxide as the oxidizing agent. The N2 nitrogen may be H, or further substituted using methods outlined previously.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs outlined in Scheme 1 and 2, the pyridazinone or dihydro pyridazinone methoxy intermediate is demethylated using BBr\n3 \nin dichloromethane to produce the phenol. Alkylation of the phenol with bromochloropropane or a dibromoalkane intermediate in a suitable solvent such as DMF, acetone, butanone or CH\n3\nCN with K\n2\nCO\n3 \nproduces the halogen intermediate. Alkylation of the halide intermediate with an amine gives the target dihydropyridazinone examples of the invention. Other suitable leaving groups may be used such as mesylates as precursors to amines Mitsunobo reactions with cyclic amino-ethers such as 4-hydroxypiperidine, 3-hydroxypyrrolidine or substituted amino alcohols produce the corresponding examples. Alkyl bridged analogs or linker group with hetero atoms can readily be prepared for example from methoxy indanones, tetralones, benzocycloheptanones, dihydro-2H-benzo[b]oxepinones, dihydro-2H-benzo[b]thiepinones, chromanones, or thiochromanones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs outlined in Schemes 3 and 4, the pyridazinone or 4,5-dihydropyridazinone was demethylated using BBr\n3 \nin dichloromethane to produce phenol intermediates III and Ma. Alkylation of the phenol intermediates with 3-bromo-1-chloropropane or a dibromo intermediate in a suitable solvent such as DMF, acetone, butanone or CH\n3\nCN with K\n2\nCO\n3 \nproduced the corresponding alkylated intermediate.

This was engineered into the pIRES-neo3 mammalian expression vector, which was stably transfected into the CHO-A3 cell line (Euroscreen, Belgium), followed by clonal selection by limiting dilution. Cells were harvested and cell pellets were frozen (−80° C.). Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 with 5 nM EDTA and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor Tablets, Roche Diagnostics).

Histamine, and the H\n3\n-selective agonist (R)-α-methylhistamine (RAMH) induce water drinking behavior in the rat when administered either peripherally or centrally (Kraly, F. S., June, K. R. 1982 \nPhysiol. Behav. \n28: 841; Leibowitz, S. F. 1973 \nBrain Res. \n63:440; Ligneau X., Lin, J-S., Vanni-Mercier G., Jouvet M., Muir J. L., Ganellin C. R., Stark H., Elz S., Schunack W., Schwartz, J-C. 1998 \nJ Pharmcol. Exp. Ther. \n287:658-66; Clapham, J. and Kilpatrick G. J. 1993 \nEur. J. Pharmacol. \n232:99-103) an effect which is blocked by H\n3 \nreceptor antagonists thioperamide and ciproxifan. Compounds of the invention either have demonstrated or are expected to block RAMH induce water drinking behavior.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNovel Object Discrimination:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNovel object discrimination (NOD; also referred to as novel object recognition) is an assay for short-term visual recognition memory that was first described by Ennaceur and Delacour (Ennaceur, A. and Delacour, J. (1988) \nBehav Brain Res \n31: 47-59).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSocial Recognition:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSocial recognition (SR) is an assay for short-term social (olfactory) memory that was first described by Thor and Holloway (1982).

Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to novel chemical conjugates and to uses thereof in therapy and diagnosis and, more particularly, but not exclusively, to novel conjugates of polymers having attached thereto an angiogenesis targeting moiety and an anti-angiogenesis agent and to uses thereof in monitoring and treating medical conditions associated with angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAngiogenesis is a biological process that involves the sprouting of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones and plays a crucial role in disease development and progression. Angiogenesis is a complex process in which endothelial cells serve as a building block for blood vessel expansion. This process involves an extensive interplay among cells, growth factors, and extracellular membrane (ECM) components. It is regulated through a fine balance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPathological angiogenesis has been demonstrated in several diseases, including atherosclerosis, cancer, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and diabetes related complications such as diabetic retinopathy. Tumor growth and metastasis are particularly dependent on the degree of angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis is the proliferation of a network of blood vessels that penetrate into cancerous tumors in order to supply nutrients and oxygen and remove waste products, thus leading to tumor growth. Tumor angiogenesis involves hormonal stimulation and activation of oncogenes, expression of angiogenic growth factors, extravasation of plasma protein, deposition of a provisional ECM, degradation of ECM, and migration, proliferation and elongation of endothelial capillaries.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of further vascular expansion has therefore been the focus of active research for cancer therapy. Many drugs have been developed, which target different steps in this multi-step tumor angiogenesis process. However, most of these drugs were shown to be cytostatic rather than cytotoxic and thus do not cause a substantial reduction of tumor volume during the first stage of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are currently eight approved anti-cancer therapies with recognized antiangiogenic properties. These agents, which interrupt critical cell signaling pathways involved in tumor angiogenesis and growth, can be divided into two primary categories: (1) monoclonal antibodies directed against specific proangiogenic factors and/or their receptors; (Avastin, Erbitux, Vectibix, Herceptin) and (2) small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of multiple proangiogenic growth factor receptors (Tarceva, Nexavar, Sutent, Iressa). Inhibitors of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) represent a third, smaller category of antiangiogenic therapies with one currently approved agent (Torisel). In addition, at least two other approved angiogenic agents may indirectly inhibit angiogenesis through mechanisms that are not completely understood (Velcade, Thalidomide/Celgene)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe first FDA-approved angiogenesis inhibitor, Bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech) a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has recently been approved for metastatic colon cancer treatment in conjunction with standard conventional chemotherapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe largest class of drugs that block angiogenesis are the multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the VEGF receptor (VEGFR). These drugs such as sunitinib (Sutent, Pfizer), Sorafenib (Nexavar, Bayer/Onyx Pharmaceuticals) and Erlotinib (Tarceva, Gennentech/OSI/Roche) have the advantages of hitting multiple targets, convenient oral administration, and cost effectiveness. While these drugs exhibit promising efficacy, their use is limited by their lack of target specificity, which leads to unexpected toxicity [Cabebe et al. \nCurr Treat Options Oncol \n2007; 8:15-27].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor endothelial cells are drug sensitive for long time periods and may be treated with cytotoxic agents in an “anti-angiogenic dosing schedule”. This dosing schedule involves the administration of chemotherapy in low doses, well below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), in close intervals for extended periods of time (“metronomic dosing”). As a result, acute toxicity should be avoided and the drugs may be administered during longer periods, eventually converting cancer to a chronic manageable disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe microtubule-interfering agent Paclitaxel (PTX) is a clinically well-established and highly-effective anti-neoplastic drug used as a monotherapy and in combination therapy mainly for the treatment of prostate, breast, ovarian, and non-small cell lung cancers and it is the drug of choice for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. It has also shown anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic properties [Oldham et al. 2000 \nInt. J. Oncol. \n16:125-132]. However, due to the hydrophobic nature of the drug, solubilizing agents such as Cremophor EL or ethanol are required for its administration. PTX causes severe adverse side effects such as neutropenia, neuropathies, and when solubilized in Cremophor EL causes hypersensitivity reactions. In addition, only a small amount of the drug localizes in the tumor and the drug is substrate to efflux pumps in particular p-glycoprotein, resulting in multiple drug resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWater-soluble copolymers such as hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA) and PGA are biocompatible, non-immunogenic and non-toxic carriers that enable specific delivery into tumor tissue (Satchi-Fainaro et al. Nat Med 2004; 10: 255-261). These macromolecules do not diffuse through normal blood vessels but rather accumulate selectively in the tumor site because of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. This phenomenon of passive diffusion through the hyperpermeable neovasculature and localization in the tumor interstitium is observed in many solid tumors for macromolecular agents and lipids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugation of anti-cancer drugs to copolymers, such as HPMA or PGA, has been suggested so as to restrict the passage through the blood brain barrier and to prolong the circulating half-life of the drugs, hence inhibiting the growth of tumor endothelial and epithelial cells by exposing the cells to the conjugated drugs in the circulation for a longer time compared to the free drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 6,884,817 teaches compositions comprising a chemotherapeutic and/or anti-angiogenic drug, conjugated to a water-soluble polyamino acid or soluble metal chelator. The taught compositions provide water soluble taxoids which overcome the drawbacks associated with the insolubility of the drugs themselves, and further improve the delivery of the drugs to tumor tissue and affect a controlled release of the conjugated drug. According to the teachings of in U.S. Pat. No. 6,884,817, an exemplary such conjugate of the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel and polyglutamate, exhibited superior antitumor activity together with a reduced level of toxicity, as compared with the anti-tumor agent paclitaxel alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugate paclitaxel-polyglutamate OPAXIO™ (paclitaxel poliglumex, CT-2103) (Formerly known as XYOTAX™) showed promising results in phase III trials and is currently being evaluated for marketing approval.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/117,678 having publication No. 2008/0279778 also teaches polyglutamate polymers conjugated to a plurality of drugs for use in drug targeting, stabilizing and imaging applications. A HPMA copolymer conjugate of paclitaxel has also been described by Meerum Terwogt et al. [\nAnticancer drugs \n2001; 12:315-323]. This conjugate was aimed at improving drug solubility and providing controlled release of paclitaxel. In this conjugate, the paclitaxel is linked to the HPMA copolymer through an ester bond, and is hence released from the polymer by non-tissue specific hydrolytic or enzymatic (esterases) degradation of the ester bond, thereby inducing the commonly observed toxicities of paclitaxel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO 03/086382 teaches conjugates of water-soluble polymers and the anti-angiogenesis agent TNP-470, and their use as anti-tumor agents, in particular their use as carriers of TNP-470 into tumor vessels, and their effect on the neurotoxicity of TNP-470. According to the teachings of WO 03/086382, an exemplary such conjugate, HPMA-(TNP-470) conjugate (caplostatin), exhibited superior antitumor activity together with a reduced level of toxicity, as compared with TNP-470 alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO 03/086178 teaches a method for decreasing or inhibiting disorders associated with vascular hyperpermeability by the administration of an effective amount of an anti-angiogenesis compound or a compound capable of increasing cell-cell contacts by stabilizing tight junction's complexes and increasing contact with the basement membrane. The compounds taught by WO 03/086178 are endostatin, thrombospondin, angiostatin, tumastatin, arrestin, recombinant EPO, and polymer conjugated TNP-470. According to the teachings of WO 03/086178, an exemplary such conjugate, HPMA-(TNP-470) inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced vessel hyperpermeability and inhibited endothelial cell mediated angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntegrins are a class of receptors involved in the mechanism of cell adhesion. Alterations in the function of these receptors are responsible for the occurrence of a number of pathologic manifestations, such as, for example, defective embryogenesis, blood coagulation, osteoporosis, acute renal failure, retinopathy and cancer, particularly metastasis. Since the 1980s it is well recognized that integrins play a key role in cell matrix interactions and hence in angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins that compose a diverse family of 19α and eight β subunits. An integrin with a well-characterized involvement in angiogenesis and tumor invasiveness is α\nv\nβ\n3\n. The α\nv\nβ\n3 \nintegrin is a molecular marker that differentiates newly formed capillaries from their mature counterparts. This integrin is expressed in various malignant tumors. Inhibition of the α\nv\nβ\n3 \nmediated cell matrix interaction leads to apoptosis of activated endothelial cells and to disruption of blood vessel formation. In contrast, α\nv\nβ\n3 \nis not strongly expressed on quiescent endothelial cells, thus treatment with α\nv\nβ\n3 \nantagonists does not affect pre-existing blood vessels [Brooks et al. \nScience \n1994; 264:569-571].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nα\nv\nβ\n3 \nintegrins therefore play an important role in adhesion, motility, growth and differentiation of endothelial cells. α\nv\nβ\n3 \nintegrins are known to bind the RGD sequence (Arg-Gly-Asp; SEQ ID NO:1), which constitutes the recognition domain of different proteins, such as laminin, fibronectin and vitronectin. The RGD sequence represent the minimal amino acid domain, in several extracellular matrix proteins, which has been demonstrated to be the binding site of the transmembrane integrins proteins family [Bazzoni et al. 1999\n, Current Opinion in Cell Biology\n; (11) pp. 573-581]. Indeed it was shown that replacement of even a single amino acid of this short sequence results in loss of binding activity to integrins. Integrins mediates the attachment of endothelial cells to submatrix proteins that form the basement membrane of the capillary. Although all endothelial cells use the integrin to anchor to the extraluminal submatrix, the α\nv\nβ\n3 \nintegrins are found on the luminal surface of the endothelial cell only during angiogenesis. Thus, agents that target this integrin actually target endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe α\nv\nβ\n3 \nintegrin is overexpressed on proliferating endothelial cells such as those present in growing tumors, as well as on some tumor cells of various origins. Expression of endothelial α\nv\nβ\n3 \nintegrin receptor in aggressive breast carcinomas and glioblastomas is a marker of poor prognosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been demonstrated that RGD-containing peptides, either isolated from phage peptides library or biochemically synthesized, were able to compete with extracellular matrix proteins on binding to integrins [Haubner et al. 1997\n, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl\n.; (36) pp. 1374-1389]. Tumor-induced angiogenesis can be targeted in vivo by antagonizing the α\nvβ\n \n3 \nintegrin with small peptides containing the RGD amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been further found that the substrate specificity of RGD-containing peptides results from the different conformations of the RGD sequence in different matrix proteins. For example, the bis-cyclic peptide E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:2) is a ligand-based vascular-targeting agent that binds to integrin α\nv\nβ\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEncoded by a growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene, Cyr61 (also known as CCN1) is a cysteine-rich matricellular protein that supports cell adhesion and induces adhesion signaling. Furthermore, Cyr61 stimulates endothelial cell migration and enhances growth factor induced DNA synthesis in culture and therefore induces angiogenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, Cyr61 acts as a non-RGD-containing ligand of integrin receptors. Functional blockade of α\nv\nβ\n3\n, a Cyr61 integrin receptor, is specifically cytotoxic towards Cyr61-overexpressing breast cancer cells and a specific α\nv\nβ\n3\n-RGD peptidomimetic agent prevents α\nv\nβ\n3 \nfrom binding to its ligand, Cyr61.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCyr61 plays a key role in both the maintenance and the enhancement of a malignant phenotype in breast cancer. Cyr61 is overexpressed in about 30% of invasive breast carcinomas, whereas Cyr61 expression levels in normal breast tissues are negligible. It has been recently shown that Cyr61 overexpression can render human breast cancer cells highly resistant to Paclitaxel. Pharmacological interference with the Cyr61/α\nv\nβ\n3 \ninteraction fully restores Paclitaxel efficacy in Cyr61 overexpressors, thus implying that a previously unrecognized Cyr61/α\nv\nβ\n3\n-driven cellular signaling actively modulates breast cancer cell growth and chemosensitivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChen et al. reported [\nJ. Med. Chem. \n2005; 48:1098-1106] the synthesis and antitumor activity of paclitaxel (PTX) conjugated with a bis-cyclic RGD (E[RGDyK]2) (SEQ ID NO:3) in a metastatic breast cancer cell line.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMitra et al. report [\nJournal of Controled Release \n2006; 28: 175-183] the biodistribution and tumor targeting properties of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer based conjugates of mono-(RGDfK) (SEQ ID NO:4) and doubly cyclized (RGD4C; SEQ ID NO:5) α\nv\nβ\n3 \nbinding peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO 2006/012355 teaches an anti-angiogenic polymer conjugate (APC) for treatment of solid tumors comprising a chemical moiety targeting cell-surface proteins of endothelial cells at an angiogenic site. The chemical moiety taught in the application may be a ligand such as RGD4C (SEQ ID NO:5) or RGDfK (SEQ ID NO:4) for a cell-surface receptor, such as, for example, an integrin. The polymer conjugate taught by WO 2006/012355 may further comprise at least one side chain comprising a chelator capable of chelating a pharmaceutically acceptable radioactive label. The scintigraphic images and biodistribution of an exemplary such conjugate, HPMA copolymer-RGD4C-\n99m\nTc conjugate (SEQ ID NO: 6), indicated specific in vivo tumor targeting as well as prolonged retention of the conjugate at the tumor site. Treatment of SCID mice bearing DU145 human prostate carcinoma xenografts with another exemplary conjugate, HPMA copolymer-RGD4C comprising the beta particle emitter \n90\nY (SEQ ID NO:7), resulted in significant decrease of tumor volume as compared to the control (also reported by Mitra et al. in [\nNuclear Medicine and Biology \n2006; 33:43-52])\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWan et al.

HUVEC (5×10\n4 \ncells/100 μl) were challenged with polyglutamic acid polymer alone (PGA); Paclitaxel alone (PTX); bis-cyclic RGD peptide alone (E-[c(RGDfk)\n2]\n; SEQ ID NO:2); the inactive cyclic peptide c(RADfk) (c(RADfk); SEQ ID NO:28); Polyglutamic acid conjugated to Paclitaxel (PGA-PTX); Polyglutamic acid polymer conjugated to bis-cyclic RGD peptide (PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2]\n; SEQ ID NO:15); Polyglutamic acid polymer conjugated to inactive cyclic peptide c(RADfk) (PGA-c(RADfk); SEQ ID NO:14); a combination of free Paclitaxel together with free the bis-cyclic RGD peptide (PTX+E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] having SEQ ID NO:2); a combination of free Paclitaxel together with free inactive cyclic peptide c(RADfk) (PTX+c(RADfk) having SEQ ID NO:28); Polyglutamic acid polymer conjugated to Paclitaxel and to the inactive cyclic peptide c(RADfk) (PGA-PTX−c(RADfk); SEQ ID NO:19) and Polyglutamic acid polymer conjugated to Paclitaxel and to bis-cyclic RGD peptide (PGA-PTX-[c(RGDfk)\n2]\n; SEQ ID NO:18).

The florescence probe Oregon Green-cadaverine (OG), was conjugated to PGA, PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:15) and PGA-c(RADfk) (SEQ ID NO:14). SCID male were inoculated s.c. with 2×10\n6 \nmCherry-labeled U87 human osteosarcoma or with 5×10\n6 \nmCherry-labeled MG-63 human osteosarcoma and injected i.v. with PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]-OG (SEQ ID NO:25; 50 μM-RGD) or PGA-c(RADfk)-OG (SEQ ID NO: 24; 50 μM-RGD-equivalent dose) or PGA as control (n=3 mice/group). One hour after injection, tumors were removed, dissected to thin slices and examined under Zeiss Meta LSM 510 confocal imaging system. Shown in \nFIG. 17A\n are fluorescent images of tumor slices from the treated mice showing that only PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO: 15) was able to accumulate in the tumor tissue. \nFIG. 17B\n presents comparative plots of the accumulation of PGA-PTX−E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]-OG (SEQ ID NO:25), PGA-PTX−c(RADfk)-OG (SEQ ID NO:24) and PGA-PTX-OG, as detected via FACS, in the mCherry-labeled-MG-63 cells from homogenized tumors of the treated mice.

The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “angiogenesis” describes a biological process that involves the sprouting of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones and plays a crucial role in disease development and progression [Folkman J. \nN Engl J Med \n1995, 333:1757-1763]. Angiogenesis is a complex process in which endothelial cells serve as a building block for blood vessel expansion. It is regulated through a fine balance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPathological angiogenesis has been demonstrated in several diseases, including cancer, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy. Tumor growth and metastasis are particularly dependent on the degree of angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of further vascular expansion has therefore been the focus of active research for cancer therapy. Many drugs have been developed, which target different steps in this multi-step tumor angiogenesis process. However, most of these drugs were shown to be cytostatic rather than cytotoxic and thus do not cause a substantial reduction of tumor volume during the first stage of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a search for novel agents for treating medical conditions associated with angiogenesis, the present inventors have devised and successfully prepared and practiced novel conjugates of a biocompatible polymer, which has a therapeutically active agent that is useful as an anti-cancer agent and/or an anti-angiogenesis agent and at least one Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing moiety (SEQ ID NO: 1) as an angiogenesis targeting moiety attached thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, these novel conjugates were shown to inhibit angiogenesis and angiogenesis related processes, and thus were shown to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation, migration ability of cells to form capillary-like tube structures and adhesion onto fibrinogen coated plates (see, \nFIGS. 12-16\n). Furthermore, in vivo experiments showed enhanced accumulation of an exemplary conjugate according to some embodiments of the present invention, denoted as PGA-PTX−E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:18), in osteosarcoma tumor cells in mice (\nFIG. 17\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese conjugates can therefore be beneficially used for the treatment of medical conditions characterized by excessive angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, according to one aspect of embodiments of the invention there is provided a polymeric conjugate comprising a polymeric backbone having attached thereto a therapeutically active agent and an angiogenesis targeting moiety, the angiogenesis targeting moiety comprising a least one Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing moiety (SEQ ID NO:1) and the therapeutically active agent being an anti-angiogenesis agent and/or an anti-cancer agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention, the conjugates described herein comprise a polymeric backbone comprised of a plurality of backbone units, whereby a portion of these backbone units have the therapeutically active agent attached thereto and another portion of these backbone units have the angiogenesis targeting moiety attached thereto. Those backbone units within the polymeric backbone that are not linked to another moiety are referred to herein as “free” or “non-functionalized” backbone units.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the polymeric backbone in the conjugates described herein is composed of some backbone units that have the therapeutically active agent attached thereto, some backbone units that have the targeting moiety attached thereto, and optionally some free backbone units, these conjugates represent co-polymers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “therapeutically active agent” describes a compound which exhibits a beneficial pharmacological effect when administered to a subject and hence can be used in the treatment of a condition that benefits from this pharmacological effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “subject” (alternatively referred to herein as “patient”) as used herein refers to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, who has been the object of treatment, observation or experiment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “anti-cancer agent”, as used herein, describes any therapeutic agent that directly or indirectly kills cancer cells or directly or indirectly inhibits, stops or reduces the proliferation of cancer cells. Anti-cancer agents include those that result in cell death and those that inhibit cell growth, proliferation and/or differentiation. In some embodiments, the anti-cancer agent is selectively toxic against certain types of cancer cells but does not affect or is less effective against normal cells. In some embodiments, the anti-cancer agent is a cytotoxic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “cytotoxic agent”, as used herein, describes a compound that mediates cell death. Cell death mediation can be exhibited by a mechanism such as, but not limited to, apoptosis, inhibition of metabolism or DNA synthesis, interference with cytoskeletal organization, destabilization or chemical modification of DNA, etc. As used herein, the phrase “cytotoxic agent” encompasses any suitable chemotherapeutic agent, including small organic molecules, peptides, oligonucleotides and the like as well as radiotherapeutic agents such as, for example, radioactive iodine \n131\nI and beta particle emitter \n90\nY. The agent may act, for example, as an anti-proliferative agent or as a pro-apoptotic agent, which induces apoptosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary cytotoxic agents include, without limitation, Anthracycline Antibiotics such as Doxorubicin and Daunorubicin, Taxanes such as Taxol™, Docetaxel, Vinca alkaloids as Vincristine and Vinblastine, 5-Fluorouracil (5 FU), Leucovorin, Irinotecan, Idarubicin, Mitomycin C, Oxaliplatin, Raltitrexed, Tamoxifen and Cisplatin, Carboplatin, Methotrexate, Actinomycin D, Mitoxantrone or Blenoxane or Mithramycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe agent can also be a member of the Bio-Reductive drugs that are activated under hypoxic cellular conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome anti-cancer agents act as angiogenesis inhibitors, as discussed hereinabove.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “anti-angiogenesis agent”, which is also referred to herein interchangeably as “anti-angiogenic agent” or “angiogenesis inhibitor”, describes an agent having the ability to (a) inhibit endothelial cell proliferation or migration, (b) kill proliferating endothelial cells, and/or (c) inhibit the formation of new blood vessels in a tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed hereinabove, some anti-angiogenesis agents are useful in the treatment of cancer and hence can also be referred to as anti-cancer agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the anti-angiogenesis agent is Paclitaxel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chemical structure of Paclitaxel is shown in \nFIG. 2B\n. The microtubule-interfering agent Paclitaxel is a drug commonly used for the treatment of advanced metastatic breast cancer. However, it is neurotoxic, it causes hematological toxicity and many breast tumors develop resistance thereto. It has been recently shown that Paclitaxel at ultra low doses inhibits angiogenesis. However, Paclitaxel is poorly soluble in aqueous solutions and the excipients Cremophor EL or ethanol used today to solubilize its commercial form, cause hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated in the Examples section which follows, a conjugate comprising Paclitaxel, according to some embodiments of the invention, at a concentration in which Paclitaxel has been known to exhibit anti-angiogenesis activity, has been tested for its anti-angiogenesis activity. Specifically, the conjugate being a Polyglutamic acid co-polymer in which two RGD-containing cyclic peptides and Paclitaxel are conjugated to the polymeric backbone (PGA-E-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-PTX; SEQ ID NO:18) has been shown to exhibit anti-angiogenesis activity, namely inhibit endothelial cell proliferation, migration, ability of cells to form capillary-like tube structures and adhesion onto fibrinogen coated plates (see, \nFIGS. 12-16\n). Another conjugate being a Polyglutamic acid polymer linked to one RGD-containing cyclic peptide and to Paclitaxel (PGA-c(RGDfk)-PTX; SEQ ID NO:16) has been also shown to exhibit anti-angiogenesis activity (see, \nFIGS. 13B and 15\n). These results demonstrate the ability of the conjugates described herein, to inhibit angiogenesis and therefore to serve as potent anti-angiogenesis agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the anti-angiogenesis agent is TNP-470.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTNP-470 is a low molecular weight synthetic analogue of fumagillin, which is capable of selectively inhibiting endothelial growth in vitro. In clinical trials, this drug was found to slow tumor growth in many patients with metastatic cancer and exhibited a promising efficacy when used in combination with conventional chemotherapy. However, at the doses required for tumor regression, many TNP-470-treated patients experienced neurotoxicity. Due to its dose-limiting neurotoxicity, no further clinical studies were conducted for using TNP-470 per se. A representative chemical structure of a TNP-470 containing conjugate (PGA-TNP-470-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]; SEQ ID NO:21), according to some embodiments of the present invention, is presented in \nFIG. 4D\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther anti-angiogenesis agents that are suitable for use in the context of embodiments of the invention include, but are not limited to, paclitaxel, 2-methoxyestradiol, prinomastat, batimastat, BAY 12-9566, carboxyamidotriazole, CC-1088, dextromethorphan acetic acid, dimethylxanthenone acetic acid, endostatin, IM-862, marimastat, a matrix metalloproteinase, penicillamine, PTK787/ZK 222584, RPI.4610, squalamine lactate, SU5416, thalidomide, combretastatin, tamoxifen, COL-3, neovastat, BMS-275291, SU6668, anti-VEGF antibody, Medi-522 (Vitaxin II), CAI, Interleukin-12, IM862, Amilloride, Angiostatin®Protein, Angiostatin K1-3, Angiostatin K1-5, Captopril, DL-alpha-Difluoromethylornithine, DL-alpha-Difluoromethylornithine HCl, His-Tag® Endostatin™Protein, Endostar™, Fumagillin, Herbimycin A, 4-Hydroxyphenylretinamide, Juglone, Laminin, Laminin Hexapeptide, Laminin Pentapeptide, Lavendustin A, Medroxyprogesterone, Medroxyprogesterone Acetate, Minocycline, Minocycline HCl, Placental Ribonuclease Inhibitor, Suramin, Sodium Salt Suramin, Human Platelet Thrombospondin, Neutrophil Granulocyte, monoclonal antibodies directed against specific proangiogenic factors and/or their receptors (e.g. Avastin, Erbitux, Vectibix, Herceptin); small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of multiple pro-angiogenic growth factor receptors (e.g. Tarceva, Nexavar, Sutent, Iressa); inhibitors of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) (e.g. Torisel); interferon alpha, beta and gamma; IL-12; matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) inhibitors (e.g. COL3, Marimastat, Batimastat); EMD121974 (Cilengitide); ZD6474, SU11248, Vitaxin; Squalamin; COX-2 inhibitors; PDGFR inhibitors (e.g., Gleevec); NM3 and 2-ME2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the anti-angiogenesis agent is selected from the group consisting of Paclitaxel, monoclonal antibodies directed against specific proangiogenic factors and/or their receptors (e.g. Avastin, Erbitux, Vectibix, Herceptin); small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of multiple proangiogenic growth factor receptors (e.g. Tarceva, Nexavar, Sutent, Iressa); inhibitors of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) (e.g. Torisel); interferon alpha, beta and gamma; IL-12; matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) inhibitors (e.g. COL3, Marimastat, Batimastat); EMD121974 (Cilengitide); Vitaxin; Squalamin; COX-2 inhibitors; PDGFR inhibitors (e.g., Gleevec); NM3; 2-ME2 and Bisphosphonates (e.g., Zoledronate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “COX-2 inhibitor” refers to a non-steroidal drug that relatively inhibits the enzyme COX-2 in preference to COX-1. Preferred examples of COX-2 inhibitors include, but are no limited to, celecoxib, parecoxib, rofecoxib, valdecoxib, meloxicam, and etoricoxib.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “angiogenesis targeting moiety” describes a chemical moiety that can bind to a location in a mammal in which neovascularization, such as neovascularization of tumor cells, occurs. The phrase “neovascularization” is meant to encompass two unique processes: vasculogenesis, the de novo assembly of blood vessels, and angiogenesis, the formation of new capillary sprouts from pre-existing vessels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe angiogenesis targeting moiety described herein is derived from compounds that can selectively bind to a location in a mammal in which neovascularization occurs and hence may serve to deliver the conjugate described herein to the desired location.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the targeting moiety is capable of binding to an angiogenesis-associated integrin. In some embodiments, the targeting moiety targets the α\nv\nβ\n3 \nintegrin receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntegrins are a class of receptors involved in the mechanism of cell adhesion. The integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins that compose a diverse family of 19α and eight β subunits. An integrin with a well-characterized involvement in angiogenesis and tumor invasiveness is α\nv\nβ\n3 \n[Stromblad and Cheresh, \nChem Biol \n1996; 3:881-885]. The α\nv\nβ\n3 \nintegrin is overexpressed on proliferating endothelial cells such as those present in growing tumors, as well as on some tumor cells of various origins. The RGD sequence (SEQ ID NO:1) represent the minimal amino acid domain, in several extracellular matrix proteins, which has been demonstrated to be the binding site of the transmembrane integrins proteins family [Bazzoni et al. 1999\n, Current Opinion in Cell Biology\n; (11) pp. 573-581].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in some embodiments, the angiogenesis targeting moiety comprises a least one Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) moiety (SEQ ID NO:1), or a peptidomimetic thereof, and can optionally further include other amino acids, amino acid derivatives, or other chemical groups (e.g., alkylene chains).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the RGD-containing moiety (SEQ ID NO:1) is an oligopeptide. The oligopeptide can be a cyclic oligopeptide (including, for example, monocyclic, bicyclic and tricyclic oligopeptides) or a linear oligopeptide, and can include, in addition to the Arg-Gly-Asp amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:1), from 1 to 10 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been further found that the substrate specificity of RGD-containing moieties (SEQ ID NO:1) results from the different conformations of the RGD sequence in different matrix proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, the oligopeptide is a cyclic peptide being c[Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Lys] (SEQ ID NO:9).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the angiogenesis targeting moiety comprises two or more Arg-Gly-Asp-containing moieties (SEQ ID NO:1), wherein the moieties can be the same or different.\n\n\n \n \nExemplary Arg-Gly-Asp-containing moieties (SEQ ID NO:1) that are suitable for use in the context of embodiments of the invention include, but are not limited to c(RGDfk) (SEQ ID NO:9), RGD4C (SEQ ID NO:5), and other RGD-containing cyclic peptides such as those described in Haubner et al. [\nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n1996, 118, 7881-7891] and Capello, et al. [\nJ. Nucl. Med. \n2004, 45(10), 1716-20] and in WO 97/06791 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,412. Exemplary effective RGD cyclic peptides are the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) cyclic pentapeptides in which two amino acids such as D-tyrosine and lysine were added to the RGD and the pentapeptide was transformed into cyclic pentapeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the RGD-containing moiety can comprise two or more -Arg-Gly-Asp-moieties (SEQ ID NO:1), being either linked to one another or being spaced by one or more amino acids or any other spacer, as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, an RGD-containing moiety c(RGDfk)\n2 \nconjugated to a PGA polymeric backbone (SEQ ID NO:15) bound to a greater extent to cells expressing the α\nv\nβ\n3 \nintegrin as compared to a PGA conjugate of the inactive RAD moiety or PGA alone (SEQ ID NO:14) (see, \nFIGS. 11B and 11C\n), thereby demonstrating that the RGD moiety plays a key role in the interaction and subsequent internalizations of the conjugates into the cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the anti-angiogenesis agent is Paclitaxel and the angiogenesis targeting moiety comprises a cyclic oligopeptide being c[Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Lys] (SEQ ID NO:9).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the anti-angiogenesis agent is Paclitaxel and the angiogenesis targeting moiety comprises two cyclic oligopeptides each being c[Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Lys] (SEQ ID NO:9). Such a conjugate is referred to herein as a conjugate that contains a bis-cyclic RGD-containing moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHerein, the phrases “loading onto the polymer”, or simply “load”, are used to describe the amount of an agent that is attached to the polymeric backbone of the conjugates described herein, and is represented herein by the mol % of this agent in the conjugate, as defined hereinafter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “mol %” describes the number of moles of an attached moiety per 1 mol of the polymeric conjugate, multiplied by 100.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, for example, a 1 mol % load of an angiogenesis targeting moiety describes a polymeric conjugate composed of 100 backbone units, whereby 1 backbone unit has a targeting moiety attached thereto and the other 99 backbone units are either free or have other agents attached thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe optimal degree of loading of the therapeutically active agent and angiogenesis targeting moiety for a given conjugate and a given use is determined empirically based on the desired properties of the conjugate (e.g., water solubility, therapeutic efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, toxicity and dosage requirements), and optionally on the amount of the conjugated moiety that can be attached to a polymeric backbone in a synthetic pathway of choice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe % loading can be measured by methods well known by those skilled in the art, some of which are described hereinbelow under the Materials and Methods of the Examples section that follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the loading of the therapeutically active agent in the polymer is greater than 1 mol %.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the loading of the therapeutically active agent in the conjugate ranges from 1 mol % to 99 mol %, from 1 mol % to 50 mol %, from 1 mol % to 20 mol %, from 1 mol % to 10 \nmol\n 5, or from 1 mol % to 5 mol %.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the loading of the angiogenesis targeting moiety in the polymer is greater than 1 mol %.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the loading of the angiogenesis targeting moiety in the conjugate ranges from 1 mol % to 99 mol %, from 1 mol % to 50 mol %, from 1 mol % to 20 mol %, from 1 mol % to 10 mol %, or from 1 mol % to 5 mol %.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs exemplified in the Examples section that follows, conjugates having a different % loading of the therapeutically active agent and angiogenesis targeting moiety were synthesized (see, Table 1) and their anti-angiogenesis activity was determined. Specifically, an anti-angiogenesis activity was shown for both a PGA-PTX−E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18) having a 3.9 mol % E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] and 5.5 mol % PTX loading (see, FIGS. \n12\n and \n14\n-\n16\n) as well as for the PGA-PTX−E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18) having a 5 mol % E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] and 2.6 mol % PTX loading (see, \nFIGS. 13A and 15\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs further demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing moiety (SEQ ID NO: 1), for example E-[(cRGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO: 2), has inherent anti-angiogenesis characteristic namely the inhibition of endothelial cell migration toward the chemoattractant VEGF and attachment to fibrinogen coated plates (see, \nFIGS. 14 and 15\n). No antagonistic activity of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing moiety (SEQ ID NO:1) against the anti-angiogenesis activity of Paclitaxel was observed, as assessed by the anti-proliferative activity against HUVEC, but rather the anti-proliferative activity of the E-[(cRGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:2) and Paclitaxel, when the cells were subjected to both drugs together, was additive in nature (see, \nFIG. 12\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCyr61 (also known as CCN1) is a Cysteine-rich matricellular protein that supports cell adhesion and induces adhesion signaling. Furthermore, Cyr61 stimulates endothelial cell migration and enhances growth factor induced DNA synthesis in culture and therefore induces angiogenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, Cyr61 acts as a non-RGD-containing ligand of integrin receptors. Functional blockade of αvβ\n3\n, a Cyr61 integrin receptor, is specifically cytotoxic towards Cyr61-overexpressing breast cancer cells and a specific αvβ\n3\n-RGD peptidomimetic agent (SEQ ID NO: 28) prevents αvβ3 from binding to its ligand, Cyr61. It has been recently shown that Cyr61 overexpression can render human breast cancer cells highly resistant to Paclitaxel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the conjugates described herein act as specific antagonists of αvβ3 and consequently inhibit the Cyr61-integrin receptor signal transduction cascade, thereby serving to inhibit Cyr-61 dependent cancer cell growth and chemoresistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the polymeric conjugates described herein are composed of a polymeric backbone, formed from a plurality of backbone units that are covalently linked to one another, wherein at least a portion of this plurality of backbone units has a therapeutically active agent, as described herein, attached thereto, and at least another portion of the plurality of backbone units has the angiogenesis targeting moiety (the RGD containing moiety, (SEQ ID NO:1) as described herein), attached thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose backbone units that have the therapeutically active agent attached thereto and those backbone units that have the angiogenesis targeting moiety attached thereto can be randomly dispersed within the polymeric backbone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymeric backbone can further include non-functionalized backbone units, as discussed hereinbelow, to which none of the therapeutically active agent and the angiogenesis targeting moiety are attached.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the polymeric backbone of the conjugates described constitutes polymers (or co-polymers) to which the angiogenesis targeting moiety and the therapeutically active agent are attached.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymers which are suitable for use in the context of the present embodiments are biocompatible, non-immunogenic and non-toxic. The polymers serve as carriers that enable specific delivery into tumor tissue. As described hereinabove, the specific delivery is due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect discussed hereinabove. Furthermore, conjugation to polymers should restrict the passage through the blood brain barrier and would prolong the circulating half-life of the drugs, hence inhibiting the growth of tumor endothelial and epithelial cells by exposing the cells to the conjugated drugs in the circulation for a longer time compared to the free drugs. Additionally, polymer-drug conjugates may act as drug depots for sustained release, producing prolonged drug exposure to tumor cells. Finally, water soluble polymers (e.g., water soluble polyamino acids) may be used to stabilize drugs, as well as to solubilize otherwise insoluble compounds such as, for example TNP-470 and Paclitaxel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “polymer” describes an organic substance composed of a plurality of repeating structural units (backbone units) covalently connected to one another. The term “polymer” as used herein encompasses organic and inorganic polymers and further encompasses one or more of a homopolymer, a copolymer or a mixture thereof (a blend). The term “homopolymer” as used herein describes a polymer that is made up of one type of monomeric units and hence is composed of homogenic backbone units. The term “copolymer” as used herein describes a polymer that is made up of more than one type of monomeric units and hence is composed of heterogenic backbone units. The heterogenic backbone unit can differ from one another by the pendant groups thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymer is comprised of backbone units formed by polymerizing the corresponding monomeric units whereby the therapeutically active agent and the angiogenesis targeting moiety are attached to at least a portion of these backbone units. Some or all of these backbone units are typically functionalized prior to conjugation so as to have a reactive group for attaching the anti-angiogenesis agent and the bone targeting moiety. Those backbone units that are not functionalized and/or do not participate in the conjugations of the therapeutically active agent and the angiogenesis targeting moiety are referred to herein as “free” backbone units.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymer may be a biostable polymer, a biodegradable polymer or a combination thereof. The term “Biostable” describes a compound that is not degraded in vivo, i.e., is not biodegradable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “biodegradable”, describes a substance that which can decompose under physiological and/or environmental conditions into breakdown products. Such physiological and/or environmental conditions include, for example, hydrolysis (decomposition via hydrolytic cleavage), enzymatic catalysis (enzymatic degradation), and mechanical interactions. This term typically refers to substances that decompose under these conditions such that 50 weight percents of the substance decompose within a time period shorter than one year.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymers can be water-soluble or water-insoluble. In some embodiments, the polymers are water soluble at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymers can further be charged polymers or non-charged polymers. Charged polymers can be cationic polymers, having positively charged groups and a positive net charge at a physiological pH; or anionic polymers, having negatively charged groups and a negative net charge at a physiological pH. Non-charged polymers can have positively charged and negatively charged group with a neutral net charge at physiological pH, or can be non-charged.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the polymer has an average molecular weight in the range of 100 Da to 800 kDa. In some embodiments, the polymer has an average molecular weight lower than 100 kDa or lower than 60 kDa. In some embodiments, the polymer's average molecular weight range is 10 kDa to 40 kDa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymeric substances that have a molecular weight higher than 10 kDa typically exhibit an EPR effect, as described herein, while polymeric substances that have a molecular weight of 100 kDa and higher have relatively long half-lives in plasma and an inefficient renal clearance. Accordingly, a molecular weight of a polymeric conjugate can be determined while considering the half-life in plasma, the renal clearance, and the accumulation in the tumor of the conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymer used in the context of embodiments of the invention can be a synthetic polymer or a naturally-occurring polymer. In some embodiments, the polymer is a synthetic polymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymeric backbone of the polymer described herein may be derived from, for example, polyacrylates, polyvinyls, polyamides, polyurethanes, polyimines, polysaccharides, polypeptides, polycarboxylates, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary polymers which are suitable for use in the context of the present embodiments include, but are not limited to, dextran, a water soluble polyamino acid, a polyethylenglycol (PEG), a polyglutamic acid (PGA), a polylactic acid (PLA) a polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), a poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLA/PLGA), a poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylamide), a polyglycerol, a polyamidoamine (PAMAM), and a polyethylenimine (PEI).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the polymeric backbone is derived from a poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylamide) or a copolymer thereof. Such a polymeric backbone comprises methacrylamide backbone units.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPoly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylamide) (HPMA) polymers are a class of water-soluble synthetic polymeric carriers that have been extensively characterized as biocompatible, non-immunogenic and non-toxic. One advantage of HPMA polymers over other water-soluble polymers is that they may be tailored through relatively simple chemical modifications, in order to regulate their respective drug and targeting moiety content. Further, the molecular weight and charge of these polymers may be manipulated so as to allow renal clearance and excretion from the body, or to alter biodistribution while allowing tumor targeting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to some embodiments, the polymer is Polyglutamic acid (PGA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chemical structure of PGA is shown in \nFIG. 2A\n. PGA contains a large number of side chain carboxylic functional groups which can be readily utilized for drug attachment. PGA can be readily degraded by lysosomal enzymes such as Cathepsin B, to its nontoxic basic components, L-glutamic acid, D-glutamic acid and D,L-glutamic acid. Sodium glutamate has been reported to prevent manifestations of neuropathy induced by Paclitaxel, thus enabling higher doses of Paclitaxel to be tolerated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “a polyglutamic acid” or “polyglutamic acid polymer” encompasses poly(L-glutamic acid), poly(D-glutamic acid), poly(D,L-glutamic acid), poly(L-gamma glutamic acid), poly(D-gamma glutamic acid) and poly(D,L-gamma glutamic acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the polyglutamic acid comprises at least 50% of its backbone units as glutamic acid, and optionally comprises, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100% of its backbone units as glutamic acid. The polyglutamic acid can be substituted by naturally occurring or chemically modified amino acids, preferably hydrophilic amino acids, provided that when conjugated to the therapeutically active agent and the angiogenesis targeting moiety, the substituted polyglutamic acid polymeric backbone has improved aqueous solubility and/or improved efficacy relative to the unconjugated therapeutic agent, and is preferably non-immunogenic. Up to 50% of the backbone units of the polyglutamic acid polymeric backbone can be substituted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA representative general formula of a polyglutamic acid based conjugate wherein the polymeric backbone has a therapeutically active agent conjugated thereto through a degradable linker and further has an angiogenesis targeting moiety conjugated thereto, is shown in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to some embodiments, the polymer is polyethylenglycol (PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPEG is a unique polyether diol, usually manufactured by the aqueous anionic polymerization of ethylene oxide, although other polymerization initiators can be employed. This polymer is amphiphilic and dissolves in organic solvents as well as in water; it is also non-toxic and is eliminated by a combination of renal and hepatic pathways. Furthermore, PEG has the lowest level of protein or cellular absorption of any known polymer and hence is advantageous for drug conjugation. The structure of a PEG based conjugate, according to the embodiments of the present invention, is shown in \nFIG. 5\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that the polymers as discussed herein describe those polymers that are formed from homogenic or heterogenic, non-functionalized monomeric units, and that the polymeric backbone constituting the polymeric conjugate corresponds to such polymers by being comprised of the same monomeric units, while some of these monomeric units are functionalized, as described herein. Thus, the polymeric backbone of the polymeric conjugate is similar to that of the polymers described herein, and differs from the polymers by having the above-described agents attached to some of the backbone units therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed hereinabove, the tumor vasculature possesses an enhanced capacity for the uptake of macromolecules and colloidal drug carriers having a high molecular weight and large hydrodynamic diameter due to the EPR effect. Therefore, a conjugate as described herein, having a large enough hydrodynamic diameter is beneficial. The term “large enough” is used herein to describe a conjugate having a hydrodynamic diameter which leads to an increase in the ratio of conjugate accumulated in the tumor tissue as compared to other tissues. The determination of the optimal ratio is well within the capability of those skilled in the art. For example, the ratio may be 1.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc. In some embodiments, the hydrodynamic diameter is in the range of from 10 nm to 200 nm. In some embodiments, the hydrodynamic diameter is in the range of from 10 nm to 100 nm. In some embodiments the hydrodynamic diameter is in the range of from 20 nm to 50 nm. In yet another embodiment the hydrodynamic diameter is 40 nm. In yet another embodiment the hydrodynamic diameter is 30 nm. The hydrodynamic diameter can be measured as described below under the Materials and Methods of the Example section which follows hereinbelow. The hydrodynamic diameter of nano-scale particles of a Polyglutamate copolymer to which Paclitaxel and a bis-cyclic RGD containing peptide (PGA-PTX−E-[c(RGDfk)\n2]\n; SEQ ID NO:18) were conjugated to the polymeric backbone as well as a Polyglutamate copolymer to which Paclitaxel and a monocyclic RGD containing peptide (PGA-PTX−c[RGDfk]; SEQ ID NO:16) was conjugated to the polymeric backbone is shown in \nFIG. 9\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn each of the conjugates described herein, the therapeutically active agent and the angiogenesis targeting moiety can each be linked to the respective portion of the backbone units in the polymeric backbone directly, or indirectly, through a linker moiety (also referred to herein as a linker, a linker group or a linking group), whereby, in some embodiments, the direct/indirect linkage is designed as being cleavable at conditions characterizing the desired bodily site (e.g., by certain enzymes or pH), as detailed hereinbelow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHence, according to some embodiments, at least one of the therapeutically active agent and the targeting moiety is attached to the polymer via a linker. In some embodiments, each of the therapeutically active agent and the targeting moiety is attached to the polymer via a linker. The linker linking the therapeutically active agent to the polymer and the linker linking the angiogenesis targeting moiety to the polymer may be the same or different.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe linker described herein refers to a chemical moiety that serves to couple the angiogenesis targeting moiety and/or the therapeutically active agent to the polymeric backbone while not adversely affecting either the targeting function of the angiogenesis targeting moiety or the therapeutic effect of the angiogenesis targeting moiety and/or therapeutically active agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the linker is a biodegradable linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “biodegradable linker”, as used herein, describes a linker that is capable of being degraded, or cleaved, when exposed to physiological conditions. Such physiological conditions can be, for example, pH, a certain enzyme, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the linker is capable of being cleaved by pre-selected cellular enzymes, for instance, those found in osteoblasts, osteoclasts, lysosomes of cancerous cells or proliferating endothelial cells. Alternatively, an acid hydrolysable linker could comprise an ester or amide linkage and be for instance, a cis-aconityl linkage. Such linkers further enhance the therapeutic activity and reduced toxicity of the conjugates described herein, by allowing the release of the anti-angiogenesis drug and/or the alendronate only at the desired bodily site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, according to some embodiments, the biodegradable linker is a pH-sensitive linker or an enzymatically-cleavable linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pH-sensitive linker comprises a chemical moiety that is cleaved or degraded only when subjected to a certain pH condition, such as acidic pH (e.g., lower than 7), neutral pH (6.5-7) or basic pH (higher than 7).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch a linker may, for example, be designed to undergo hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions, and thus, the conjugate remains intact and does not release the agents attached to the polymer in the body, until its reaches a physiological environment where a pH is either acidic or basic, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary pH-sensitive linkers include, but are not limited to a hydrazone bond, an ester (including orthoester) bond, an amide bond of, for example, a cis-aconytil residue, a trityl group, an acetal, a ketal, an Alanine ester, a Gly-ester and a -[Gly-Phe-Gly]-moiety (SEQ ID NO: 29).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the biodegradable linker is an enzymatically-cleavable linker. Such a linker is typically designed so as to include a chemical moiety, typically, but not exclusively, an amino acid sequence that is recognized by a pre-selected enzyme. Such an amino acid sequence is often referred to in the art as a “recognition motif”. A conjugate comprising such a linker typically remains substantially intact in the absence of the pre-selected enzyme in its environment, and hence does not cleave or degrade so as to the release the agent attached thereto until contacted with the enzyme.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the enzymatically cleavable linker is cleaved by an enzyme which is overexpressed in tumor tissues. A conjugate comprising such a linker ensures, for example, that a substantial amount of the conjugated therapeutically active agent is released from the conjugate only at the tumor tissue, thus reducing the side effects associated with non-selective administration of the drug and further enhancing the concentration of the drug at the tumor site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary enzymes which are suitable for use in the context of these embodiments include, but are not limited to the group consisting of Cathepsin B, Cathepsin K, Cathepsin D, Cathepsin H, Cathepsin L, legumain, MMP-2 and MMP-9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable linkers include, but are not limited to, alkyl chains; alkyl chains optionally substituted with one or more substituents and in which one or more carbon atoms are optionally interrupted by a nitrogen, oxygen and/or sulfur heteroatom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable linkers include amino acids and/or oligopeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch alkyl chains and/or oligopeptides can optionally be functionalized so as allow their covalent binding to the moieties linked thereby (e.g., the polymeric backbone and the targeting moiety, the polymer and the therapeutically active agent). Such a functionalization may include incorporation or generation of reactive groups that participate in such covalent bindings, as detailed hereinunder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiment, the linker is a biodegradable oligopeptide which contains, for example, from 2 to 10 amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the linker is a Cathepsin B-cleavable linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCathepsin B is a lysosomal enzyme overexpressed in both epithelial and endothelial tumor cells. Suitable linkers having cathepsin-B cleavable sites include amino acid sequences such as, but are not limited to -[Cit-Val]-(SEQ ID NO: 29), -[Arg]-, -[Arg-Arg]-(SEQ ID NO:31), -[Phe-Lys]-(SEQ ID NO:12), [Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly] (SEQ ID NO: 10), -[Gly-Phe-Ala-Leu]-(SEQ ID NO: 32) and -[Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu]-(SEQ ID NO: 33), -[Gly-Leu-Gly]-(SEQ ID NO: 34), -[Gly-Phe-Gly]-(SEQ ID NO: 35), -[Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly-Phe-Lys]-(SEQ ID NO: 36) and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the linker comprises the amino acid sequences -[Gly-Leu-Gly]-(SEQ ID NO: 34), -[Gly-Phe-Gly]-(SEQ ID NO: 35), -[Gly-Leu-Phe-Gly]-(SEQ ID NO: 37), -[Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly]-(SEQ ID NO: 10), -[Phe-Lys]-(SEQ ID NO: 12) and -[Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly-Phe-Lys]-(SEQ ID NO: 36). In some embodiments, the linker consists of these amino acid sequences or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed hereinabove, PGA can be readily degraded by Cathepsin B, to its nontoxic basic components, L-glutamic acid, D-glutamic acid and D,L-glutamic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, Cathepsin B releases the anti-angiogenesis agent Paclitaxel from a conjugate of the drug with PGA polymer (see, \nFIG. 10\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMatrix metalloproteinases (MMP), in particular MMP-2 and MMP-9, have been identified as important proteases for the progression of malignant tumors. Suitable linkers having MMP-2 and MMP-9 cleavable sites include, but are not limited to, -[Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly-Ile-Ala-Gly-Gln]-(SEQ ID NO:38), -[Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ile-Ala-Gly-Gln]-(SEQ ID NO:11), (SEQ ID NO:39) and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the linker comprises -[Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly]-(SEQ ID NO:10).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the linker comprises -[Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ile-Ala-Gly-Gln]-(SEQ ID NO:11).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn oligopeptide linker which contains the pre-selected amino acid sequence (recognition motif) can also be constructed such that the recognition motif is repeated several times within the linker, to thereby enhance the selective release of the attached agent. Various recognition motifs of the same or different enzymes can also be incorporated within the linker. Similarly, the linker may comprise multiple pH sensitive bonds or moieties. Linkers comprising such multiple cleavable sites can enhance the selective release of the therapeutically active agent at the desired bodily site, thereby reducing adverse side effects, and further enhance the relative concentration of the released drug at the bodily site when it exhibits its activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn cases where the angiogenesis targeting moiety and/or the therapeutically active agent is bound directly to the polymeric backbone, the bond linking these moieties can also be biodegradable, for example, an enzymatically-cleavable bond or a pH-sensitive bond. Such a bond can be formed upon functionalizing the polymeric backbone, the angiogenesis targeting moiety and/or the therapeutically active agent, so as to include compatible reactive groups, as defined herein, for forming the required bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide linker may also include a peptide sequence which serves to increase the length of the linker. Longer peptides may be advantageous due to a more efficient steric interaction of the linker with the cleaving enzyme due to enhanced accessibility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the angiogenesis targeting moiety is linked to the polymeric backbone or to the linker via a spacer. In some embodiments the therapeutically active agent is linked to the polymeric backbone or to the linker via a spacer. The spacers can be the same or different.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “spacer” as used herein describes a chemical moiety that is covalently attached to, and interposed between, the polymeric backbone and the linker, or the angiogenesis targeting moiety/therapeutically active agent thereby forming a bridge-like structure between the polymeric backbone and/or the angiogenesis targeting moiety/therapeutically active agent. Alternatively, the spacer may be covalently attached to, and interposed between, the linker and the therapeutically active agent and/or the angiogenesis targeting moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHence, according to some embodiments at least one of the therapeutically active agent and the angiogenesis targeting moiety is attached to the polymeric backbone and/or to the linker via a spacer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable spacers include, but are not limited to, alkylene chains, optionally substituted by one or more substituents and which are optionally interrupted by one or more nitrogen, oxygen and/or sulfur heteroatom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable spacers include amino acids and amino acid sequences, optionally functionalized with one or more reactive groups for being coupled to the polymeric backbone/angiogenesis targeting moiety/therapeutically active agent/linkers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer has the formula G-(CH\n2\n)n-K, wherein n is an integer from 1 to 10; and G and K are each a reactive group such as, for example, NH, O or S. In some embodiments, G and K are each NH and n is 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary spacer is —[NH—(CH\n2\n)\nm\nNH\n2\n]— wherein “m” stands for an integer ranging from 1-10. Preferably m is 2. A conjugate wherein the spacer linking the anti-angiogenesis agent (i.e. TNP470) to a Polyglutamate polymeric unit is -[NH—(CH\n2\n)\n2\nNH\n2\n]— is shown in \nFIGS. 4B\n, \n4\nC and \n4\nD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid sequence, optionally an inert amino acid sequence (namely, does not affect the affinity or selectivity of the conjugate). Such a spacer can be utilized for elongating or functionalizing the linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is a glutamate residue (-E-). For example, a conjugate wherein the spacer linking the angiogenesis targeting moiety to a polyglutamate polymeric backbone is a glutamate residue (-E-), is shown in \nFIG. 4D\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, a spacer is utilized for enabling a more efficient and simpler attachment of the angiogenesis targeting moiety and/or therapeutically active agent to the polymeric backbone or linker, in terms of steric considerations (renders the site of the polymer to which coupling is effected less hindered) or chemical reactivity considerations (adds a compatible reactive group to the site of the polymer to which coupling is effected). In some cases, the spacer may contribute to the performance of the resulting conjugate. For example, the spacer may render an enzymatically cleavable spacer less sterically hindered and hence more susceptible to enzymatic interactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases the spacer is utilized for enabling a more efficient and simpler synthesis of the conjugate by altering the solubility of the therapeutically active agent and/or the angiogenesis targeting moieties to which the spacer is attached (i.e. either more hydrophobic or more hydrophilic).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is a degradable spacer, which is capable of undergoing degradation reactions so as to release the agent attached thereto. In some embodiments, the spacer is biodegradable, as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is a multivalent moiety that is used so as to attach two or more moieties to a backbone unit in the polymeric backbone. Exemplary such a spacer is a glutamate residue, which is used, for example, to attach two cyclic RGD-containing moieties to a polymeric backbone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA spacer may also be used in order to attach other agents (e.g., a labeling agent, as described hereinbelow) to the conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe spacer may be varied in length and in composition, depending on steric consideration and may be used to space the angiogenesis targeting moiety and/or therapeutically active agent form the polymeric backbone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed hereinabove, the optimal degree of loading of the therapeutically active agent and the angiogenesis targeting moiety is determined empirically based on the desired properties of the conjugate (e.g., water solubility, therapeutic efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, toxicity and dosage requirements), and synthetic considerations (e.g., the amount of the conjugated moiety that can be conjugated to the polymeric backbone in the synthesis mode utilized).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe number of backbone units within the polymeric backbone that have a therapeutically active agent conjugated thereto is defined herein as “y”, the number of backbone units within the polymeric backbone that have an angiogenesis targeting moiety conjugated thereto is herein defined as “w” and the number of free backbone units in the polymeric backbone (which are not bound to an additional moiety) is herein defined as “x”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to some embodiments, the conjugate described herein can be represented by the general formula I:\n\n\n \n \n \n[A\n1\n]x[A\n2\n-L\n1\n-B]y[A\n3\n-L\n2\n-D]w  Formula I\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nx is an integer having a value such that x/(x+y+w) multiplied by 100 is in the range of from 0.01 to 99.9;\n\n\n \n \n \n \ny is an integer having a value such that y/(x+y+w) multiplied by 100 is in the range of from 0.01 to 99.9;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nw is an integer having a value such that w/(x+y+w) multiplied by 100 is in the range of from 0.01 to 99.9;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA\n1\n, A\n2 \nand A\n3 \nare each backbone units covalently linked to one another and forming the polymeric backbone, wherein:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB is the therapeutically active agent, as described herein;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nD is the angiogenesis targeting moiety, as described herein;

Optionally, the labeling agent is attached to any one of a linker, a spacer or the therapeutically active agent or the targeting moiety. The attachment of a labeling agent to the conjugate enables utilizing these conjugates for monitoring medical conditions associated with angiogenesis, for example, monitoring the therapeutic effect exhibited by the conjugate described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrase “labeling agent” describes a detectable moiety or a probe. Exemplary labeling agents which are suitable for use in the context of the these embodiments include, but are not limited to, a fluorescent agent, a radioactive agent, a magnetic agent, a chromophore, a bioluminescent agent, a chemiluminescent agent, a phosphorescent agent and a heavy metal cluster.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “radioactive agent” describes a substance (i.e. radionuclide or radioisotope) which loses energy (decays) by emitting ionizing particles and radiation. When the substance decays, its presence can be determined by detecting the radiation emitted by it. For these purposes, a particularly useful type of radioactive decay is positron emission. Exemplary radioactive agents include \n99m\nTc, \n18\nF, \n131\nI and \n125\nI.,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “magnetic agent” describes a substance which is attracted to an externally applied magnetic field. These substances are commonly used as contrast media in order to improve the visibility of internal body structures in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The most commonly used compounds for contrast enhancement are gadolinium-based. MRI contrast agents alter the relaxation times of tissues and body cavities where they are present, which, depending on the image weighting, can give a higher or lower signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “chromophore” describes a chemical moiety that, when attached to another molecule, renders the latter colored and thus visible when various spectrophotometric measurements are applied.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “bioluminescent agent” describes a substance which emits light by a biochemical process\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “chemiluminescent agent” describes a substance which emits light as the result of a chemical reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “fluorescent agent” refers to a compound that emits light at a specific wavelength during exposure to radiation from an external source.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “phosphorescent agent” refers to a compound emitting light without appreciable heat or external excitation as by slow oxidation of phosphorous.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA heavy metal cluster can be for example a cluster of gold atoms used, for example, for labeling in electron microscopy techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the conjugates described herein may further include an additional moiety conjugated thereto. Such an additional moiety can be conjugated either to backbone units within and throughout the polymeric backbone, or be attached at one or both ends of the polymeric backbone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch an additional moiety can be a labeling agent, as described herein, or an additional targeting moiety or an additional therapeutically active agent, which may improve the performance of the formed conjugate. Such an additional moiety can further be a moiety that improves the solubility, bioavailability, and/or any other desired feature of the formed conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed hereinabove, the conjugates described herein comprise a polymer having tumor targeting characteristics (due to the EPR effect), an angiogenesis targeting moiety and an anti-cancer agent/anti-angiogenesis agent. Therefore, the conjugates described herein are targeted to bodily sites characterized by angiogenesis and or cancer tissue. As further described hereinabove, the conjugates described herein are capable of inhibiting angiogenesis as well as cell proliferation and therefore can be utilized for the treatment of disease conditions characterized by pathologically excessive angiogenesis wherein the inhibition of angiogenesis and/or cell proliferation is beneficial.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPathological angiogenesis has been demonstrated in several diseases, such as cancer, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy. Tumor growth and metastasis are particularly dependent on the degree of angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis is the proliferation of a network of blood vessels that penetrate into cancerous tumors in order to supply nutrients and oxygen and remove waste products, thus leading to tumor growth. Tumor angiogenesis involves hormonal stimulation and activation of oncogenes, expression of angiogenic growth factors, extravasation of plasma protein, deposition of a provisional extracellular matrix (ECM), degradation of ECM, and migration, proliferation and elongation of endothelial capillaries. Inhibition of further vascular expansion has therefore been the focus of active research for cancer therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, the conjugates described herein were able to exhibit anti-angiogenesis activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, according to another aspect of embodiments of the invention there is provided a method of treating a medical condition associated with angiogenesis in a subject in need thereof. The method is effected by administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of any of the conjugates described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, according to another aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there are provided uses of the conjugates described herein as a medicament. In some embodiments, the medicament is for treating a medical condition associated with angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another aspect of some embodiments of the present invention, the conjugates described herein are identified for use in the treatment of a medical condition associated with angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “method” refers to manners, means, techniques and procedures for accomplishing a given task including, but not limited to, those manners, 30 means, techniques and procedures either known to, or readily developed from known manners, means, techniques and procedures by practitioners of the chemical, pharmacological, biological, biochemical and medical arts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “treating” includes abrogating, substantially inhibiting, slowing or reversing the progression of a condition, substantially ameliorating clinical or aesthetical symptoms of a condition or substantially preventing the appearance of clinical or aesthetical symptoms of a condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is understood that the conjugates of the present invention may be administered in conjunction with other drugs, including other anti-cancer and anti-angiogenesis drugs. Such combinations are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the treatable condition is cancer the term would encompass any inhibition of tumor growth or metastasis, or any attempt to inhibit, slow or abrogate tumor growth or metastasis. The method includes killing cancer cells by non-apoptotic as well as apoptotic mechanisms of cell death.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is noted herein that by targeting a therapeutically active agent via the methodologies described herein, the toxicity of the therapeutically active agent is substantially reduced, due to the conjugate selectivity towards sites of excessive angiogenesis. Consequently, besides the use of the conjugates described herein in a clinically evident disease, optionally in combination with other drugs, these conjugates may potentially be used as a long term-prophylactic for individuals who are at risk for relapse due to residual dormant cancers. The use of non-toxic targeted conjugates for the treatment of asymptomatic individuals who are at risk for relapse of a cancer, may lead to a major paradigm shift in cancer treatment from current methods where treatment is generally not initiated until the cancer becomes clinically evident.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cancer cells” describes a group of cells which display uncontrolled growth (division beyond the normal limits).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “therapeutically effective amount” describes the amount of a compound which is sufficient to effect treatment when administered to a subject in need of such treatment or prevention. As used herein this phrase describes the amount of conjugate which is sufficient to reduce or prevent angiogenesis (i.e. inhibit the formation of new blood vessels in a tissue) and/or cell proliferation and/or kill preexisting cancer cells in tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMedical conditions associated with angiogenesis and which are treatable by the conjugates described herein include, but are not limited to, atherosclerosis, cancer, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and diabetes related complications such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration (MD). The terms “cancer” and “tumor” are used interchangeably herein to describe a class of diseases in which a group of cells display uncontrolled growth (division beyond the normal limits). The term “cancer” encompasses malignant and benign tumors as well as disease conditions evolving from primary or secondary tumors. The term “malignant tumor” describes a tumor which is not self-limited in its growth, is capable of invading into adjacent tissues, and may be capable of spreading to distant tissues (metastasizing). The term “benign tumor” describes a tumor which is not malignant (i.e. does not grow in an unlimited, aggressive manner, does not invade surrounding tissues, and does not metastasize). The term “primary tumor” describes a tumor that is at the original site where it first arose. The term “secondary tumor” describes a tumor that has spread from its original (primary) site of growth to another site, close to or distant from the primary site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancers treatable by the conjugates described herein include, but are not limited to, solid, including carcinomas, and non-solid, including hematologic malignancies. Carcinomas include and are not limited adenocarcinomas and epithelial carcinomas. Hematologic malignancies include leukemias, lymphomas, and multiple myelomas. The following are non-limiting examples of the cancers treatable with the conjugates described herein: ovarian, pancreas, brain, colon, rectal, colorectal, melanoma, lung, breast, kidney, and prostate cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cancer metastases” describes cancer cells which have “broken away”, “leaked”, or “spilled” from a primary tumor, entered the lymphatic and/or blood vessels, circulated through the lymphatic system and/or bloodstream, settled down and proliferated within normal tissues elsewhere in the body thereby creating a secondary tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “arteriosclerosis” describes a hardening of the arteries, and occurs when the normal lining of the arteries deteriorates, the walls of arteries thicken, and deposits of fat and plaque build up, causing narrowing (or even blockage) of the arteries. Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of heart attacks, heart disease and strokes. Essentially, the plaque build-up on the arterial walls becomes so significant that it begins to block the flow of blood. When vital organs, such as the heart or lungs, are deprived of oxygen rich blood, atherosclerosis becomes a life-threatening condition. Other complications of atherosclerosis are detachment of plaque build up and blood clots that travel and become lodged elsewhere in the body.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “diabetes” is used interchangeably with the term “diabetes mellitus” and describes a metabolic disorder of multiple etiology characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The effects of diabetes mellitus include long-term damage, dysfunction and failure of various organs. Presently, diabetes mellitus is classified into type I and type II. The majority of patients with type I diabetes have autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells as the underlying cause, have an absolute requirement for insulin therapy and will develop ketoacidosis without treatment. In type II, there is relative insulin deficiency and resistance to insulin. A causal association between glycemic control and the development and progression of the microvascular complications i.e. (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy) is well-established. By virtue of microvascular involvement any tissue can be effected by diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “diabetes” encompasses diabetes related complications which are mainly caused by damage to blood vessels (angiopathy). Exemplary diabetes complications include, but are not limited to diabetic retinopathy (damage to the retina), which can eventually lead to blindness; diabetic neuropathy which is characterized by abnormal and decreased sensation, usually in a ‘glove and stocking’ distribution starting with the feet but potentially in other nerves, later often fingers and hands; diabetic nephropathy characterized by damage to the kidney which can lead to chronic renal failure; and diabetic cardiopathy which is characterized by damage to the heart leading to diastolic dysfunction and eventually heart failure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “hypertension” describes a medical condition in which the blood pressure is chronically elevated. In current usage, the word “hypertension” without a qualifier normally refers to systemic, arterial hypertension. Hypertension can be classified as either essential (primary) or secondary. Essential hypertension indicates that no specific medical cause can be found to explain a patient's condition. A \nbout\n 95% of hypertension is essential hypertension. Secondary hypertension indicates that the high blood pressure is a result of (i.e., secondary to) another condition, such as kidney disease or tumors (adrenal adenoma or pheochromocytoma). Persistent hypertension is one of the risk factors for strokes, heart attacks, heart failure and arterial aneurysm, and is a leading cause of chronic renal failure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “rheumatoid arthritis” describes is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder that may affect many tissues and organs, but principally attacks the joints producing a inflammatory synovitis that often progresses to destruction of the articular cartilage and ankylosis of the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can also produce diffuse inflammation in the lungs, pericardium, pleura, and sclera, and also nodular lesions, most common in subcutaneous tissue under the skin. Although the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, autoimmunity plays a pivotal role in its chronicity and progression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDue to the ability of the conjugates described herein to be targeted to bodily sites characterized by angiogenesis the conjugates can be further utilized for monitoring the level of angiogenesis within a body of a patient. The method according to these embodiments of the invention is effected by administering to the subject any of the conjugates described herein, having a labeling agent attached to the polymer, as described herein, and employing an imaging technique for monitoring a distribution of the conjugate within the body or a portion thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the level of angiogenesis in tumor sites can serve as a measure of the size of a tumor as well as the level of metabolic activity in the tumor cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther examples of disease conditions in which the monitoring of the level of angiogenesis by the conjugates described herein may be beneficial, are atherosclerosis, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and diabetes related complications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, according to another aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there are provided uses of any of the conjugates described herein, having a labeling agent as described herein, as diagnostic agents and/or in the manufacture of a diagnostic agent for monitoring a medical condition associated with angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another aspect of some embodiments of the present invention, each of the conjugates described herein, which comprises a labeling agent, is identified for use a diagnostic agent, for monitoring a medical condition associated with angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable imaging techniques include but are not limited to positron emission tomography (PET), gamma-scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) computed axial tomography (CAT) scans, ultrasound, fluoroscopy and conventional X-ray imaging. The choice of an appropriate imaging technique depends on the nature of the labeling agent, and is within the skill in the art. For example, if the labeling agent comprises Gd ions, then the appropriate imaging technique is MRI; if the labeling agent comprises radionuclides, an appropriate imaging technique is gamma-scintigraphy; if the labeling agent comprises an ultrasound agent, ultrasound is the appropriate imaging technique, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugates described hereinabove may be administered or otherwise utilized in this and other aspects of the present invention, either as is, or as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, enantiomer, diastereomer, solvate, hydrate or a prodrug thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to a charged species of the parent compound and its counter ion, which is typically used to modify the solubility characteristics of the parent compound and/or to reduce any significant irritation to an organism by the parent compound, while not abrogating the biological activity and properties of the administered compound. The neutral forms of the compounds are preferably regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in a conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the present invention. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” is meant to encompass salts of the active compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When conjugates of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral (i.e., non-ionized) form of such conjugates with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When conjugates of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such conjugates with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts”, Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 1977, 66, 1-19). Certain specific conjugates of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the conjugates to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe neutral forms of the conjugates are preferably regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent conjugate in a conventional manner. The parent form of the conjugate differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the conjugate for the purposes of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “prodrug” refers to an agent, which is converted into the active compound (the active parent drug) in vivo. Prodrugs are typically useful for facilitating the administration of the parent drug. The prodrug may also have improved solubility as compared with the parent drug in pharmaceutical compositions. Prodrugs are also often used to achieve a sustained release of the active compound in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugates described herein may possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers and individual isomers are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “enantiomer” describes a stereoisomer of a compound that is superposable with respect to its counterpart only by a complete inversion/reflection (mirror image) of each other. Enantiomers are said to have “handedness” since they refer to each other like the right and left hand. Enantiomers have identical chemical and physical properties except when present in an environment which by itself has handedness, such as all living systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugates described herein can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain conjugates of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present invention and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “solvate” refers to a complex of variable stoichiometry (e.g., di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and so on), which is formed by a solute (the conjugate described herein) and a solvent, whereby the solvent does not interfere with the biological activity of the solute. Suitable solvents include, for example, ethanol, acetic acid and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “hydrate” refers to a solvate, as defined hereinabove, where the solvent is water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another aspect of embodiments of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an active ingredient, any of the conjugates described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in any of the methods and uses described herein, any of the conjugates described herein can be provided to an individual either per se, or as part of a pharmaceutical composition where it is mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a “pharmaceutical composition” refers to a preparation of one or more of the conjugates described herein (as active ingredient), or physiologically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof, with other chemical components including but not limited to physiologically suitable carriers, excipients, lubricants, buffering agents, antibacterial agents, bulking agents (e.g. mannitol), antioxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite), anti-inflammatory agents, anti-viral agents, chemotherapeutic agents, anti-histamines and the like. The purpose of a pharmaceutical composition is to facilitate administration of a compound to a subject. The term “active ingredient” refers to a compound, which is accountable for a biological effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “physiologically acceptable carrier” and “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” which may be interchangeably used refer to a carrier or a diluent that does not cause significant irritation to an organism and does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the administered compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHerein the term “excipient” refers to an inert substance added to a pharmaceutical composition to further facilitate administration of a drug. Examples, without limitation, of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques for formulation and administration of drugs may be found in “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences” Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., latest edition, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention thus may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries, which facilitate processing of the compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. The dosage may vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition (see e.g., Fingl et al., 1975, in “The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics”, Ch. 1 p. 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition may be formulated for administration in either one or more of routes depending on whether local or systemic treatment or administration is of choice, and on the area to be treated. Administration may be done orally, by inhalation, or parenterally, for example by intravenous drip or intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection, or topically (including ophtalmically, vaginally, rectally, intranasally).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for topical administration may include but are not limited to lotions, ointments, gels, creams, suppositories, drops, liquids, sprays and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for oral administration include powders or granules, suspensions or solutions in water or non-aqueous media, sachets, pills, caplets, capsules or tablets. Thickeners, diluents, flavorings, dispersing aids, emulsifiers or binders may be desirable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for parenteral administration may include, but are not limited to, sterile solutions which may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives. Slow release compositions are envisaged for treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of a composition to be administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, the judgment of the prescribing physician, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition may further comprise additional pharmaceutically active or inactive agents such as, but not limited to, an anti-bacterial agent, an antioxidant, a buffering agent, a bulking agent, a surfactant, an anti-inflammatory agent, an anti-viral agent, a chemotherapeutic agent and an anti-histamine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to an embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical composition described hereinabove is packaged in a packaging material and identified in print, in or on the packaging material, for use in the treatment of a medical condition associated with angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical composition is packaged in a packaging material and identified in print, in or on the packaging material, for use in monitoring a medical condition associated with angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions of the present invention may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device, such as an FDA approved kit, which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may, for example, comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration. The pack or dispenser may also be accommodated by a notice associated with the container in a form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency of the form of the compositions or human or veterinary administration. Such notice, for example, may be of labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prescription drugs or of an approved product insert.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile reducing the present invention to practice, the present inventors have designed and successfully practiced a novel process for conjugating to polymer a therapeutically active agent, an angiogenesis targeting moiety and optionally a labeling agent. It is noted that synthesizing such a polymeric conjugate is subjected to various limitations, imposed by a different solubility of the moieties to be conjugates, complicated desired structural features that are required for optimal performance of the conjugate, incompatibility of the reactants, and the like. Hence, devising a process that overcomes these limitations and is designed to obtain a conjugate that exhibits at least a reasonable performance, is highly advantageous.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another aspect of embodiments of the invention, there is provided a process of preparing the conjugates described herein. The process is effected by:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) co-polymerizing a plurality of monomeric units that form the polymeric backbone, at least one of the monomeric units terminating by a first reactive group, and at least one of the monomeric units terminating by a second reactive group, to thereby obtain a co-polymer that comprises a plurality of backbone units, at least one backbone unit having the first reactive group and at least one backbone unit having the second reactive group, said first reactive group being capable of reacting with the angiogenesis targeting moiety and the second reactive being capable of reacting with the therapeutically active agent;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) reacting the co-polymer with the angiogenesis targeting moiety or a derivative thereof, via the first reactive group, to thereby obtain a copolymer having the angiogenesis targeting moiety attached to a polymeric backbone thereof; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) further reacting the co-polymer with the therapeutically active agent or a derivative thereof, via the second reactive group, to thereby obtain the co-polymer having the therapeutically active agent attached to a polymeric backbone thereof,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nthereby obtaining the conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiment, (b) is performed subsequent to, concomitant with or prior to (c). Thus, the process may be effected such that the therapeutically active agent is first reacted with the functionalized polymeric backbone, thereby obtaining the polymeric backbone having the therapeutically active agent attached thereto and then the angiogenesis targeting moiety is reacted with the functionalized polymeric backbone thereby obtaining the conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe copolymerization can be effected by any polymerization method known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the at least one monomeric unit that terminates with the first reactive group comprises a first plurality of the monomeric units.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the at least one monomeric unit that terminates with the second reactive group comprises a second plurality of the monomeric units.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monomeric units described herein, which terminate by a reactive group, are also referred to herein as functionalized monomers or functionalized monomeric units.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe co-polymer formed by the co-polymerization is also referred to herein as a functionalized co-polymer or a functionalized polymeric backbone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the co-polymerization can be effected in the presence of monomeric units which form the polymeric backbone, and which are non-functionalized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the first and second reactive groups can be protected prior to the respective conjugation thereto. In such cases, the process further comprises deprotecting the reactive group prior to the respective conjugation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis allows a regio-controlled conjugation of, for example, the therapeutically active agent to those backbone units that comprises a biodegradable linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “reactive group” describes a chemical group that is capable of reacting with another group so as to form a chemical bond, typically a covalent bond. Optionally, an ionic or coordinative bond is formed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA reactive group is termed as such if being chemically compatible with a reactive group of an agent or moiety that should be desirably attached thereto. For example, a carboxylic group is a reactive group suitable for conjugating an agent or a moiety that terminates with an amine group, and vice versa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther exemplary reactive groups include, but are not limited to, hydroxy, nitro, halo, haloalkyl, carboxylates, thiol, thiocarboxylates, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA reactive group can be inherently present in the monomeric units of the polymer and/or angiogenesis targeting moiety and the therapeutically active agent, or be generated therewithin by terms of chemical modifications of the chemical groups thereon or by means of attaching to these chemical groups a spacer or a linker that terminates with the desired reactive group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA discussed hereinabove, the conjugates described herein are designed so as to release the therapeutically active agent and angiogenesis targeting moiety in the desired bodily site (i.e. sites of extensive angiogenesis). Thus, the therapeutically active agent and angiogenesis targeting moiety are linked to the polymer via a direct linkage or via an indirect linkage, through a linker group, whereby, in some embodiments, the direct/indirect linkage is designed as being cleavable at conditions characterizing the desired bodily site (e.g., by certain enzymes or pH).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, when the polymer is polyglutamic acid (PGA), the process may include the attachment of the therapeutically active agent and angiogenesis targeting moiety directly to the carboxylic groups of the glutamate amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the process may include the use of a linker as described herein whereby the linker is attached to the monomeric units, prior to co-polymerizing, so as to obtain a polymeric backbone in which a portion of the backbone units have the linker attached thereto. Further alternatively, the linker can be attached to the reactive groups in the functionalized polymeric backbone. Optionally, the linkers may be attached first to the therapeutically active agent and/or the angiogenesis targeting moiety and then be attached to the respective reactive group in the functionalized polymeric backbone. The linker attaching the therapeutically active agent and the linker attaching the angiogenesis targeting moiety may be the same or different.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHence, in some embodiments, the process described herein, is such that at least one of the monomer unit of (a) comprises a linker as described herein, wherein the linker terminates with a reactive group and wherein the angiogenesis targeting moiety is linked to the polymer via the linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the process described herein, is such that at least one of the monomer unit of (a) comprises a linker as described herein wherein the linker terminates with a reactive group and wherein the therapeutically active agent is linked to the polymer via the linker. Preferably, the process described herein, is such that the angiogenesis targeting moiety is also linked to the polymer via the linker as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, the process may include attachment of a spacer as described herein to the backbone units of the polymer and then to therapeutically active agent and/or angiogenesis targeting moiety. Alternatively, the spacer may be attached first to the therapeutically active agent and/or to the angiogenesis targeting moiety and then to the polymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in the case of the polymer being PGA, the process may be effected, for example, by the attachment of a spacer (such as, for example, NH\n2\n(CH\n2\n)\n2\nNH\n2\n) to the therapeutically active agent and/or angiogenesis targeting moiety followed by attaching the spacer to the carboxylic groups of the glutamate amino acids (for example, by attaching the amine group of the spacer to the carboxylic group of the PGA thereby obtaining an amide bond).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be appreciated that the spacers and linkers utilized for coupling the therapeutically active agent and/or the angiogenesis targeting moiety to the polymer are designed so as to allow a smooth and efficient conjugation of the respective moiety and an optimal performance of the obtained conjugate, as discussed elaborately hereinabove.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of the polymer and/or the therapeutically active agent and/or the angiogenesis targeting moiety further comprising a linker the process of synthesis may include attaching the spacer to the linker moiety rather than directly to polymer/agent/moiety comprising the linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the therapeutically active agent or angiogenesis targeting moiety can be attached to the monomeric units of the polymer, or to the backbone units of the copolymer, by means of a functional group that is already present in the native molecule and/or the backbone units of the polymer or otherwise can be introduced by well-known procedures in synthetic organic chemistry without altering the activity of the agent. For example, the angiogenesis targeting moiety and the therapeutically active agent can be attached to the polymer via an amide bond between the terminal carboxylic group of a peptidic linker and an amine group located in the angiogenesis targeting moiety and/or the therapeutically active agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the process further comprises attaching a labeling agent, as defined herein, to the formed conjugate. The labeling agent can be attached to either of functionalized monomeric units, prior to co-polymerization or to the formed co-polymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the labeling agent is attached to the co-polymer concomitantly with the angiogenesis targeting moiety.

Following Tris-Buffered Saline Tween (TBS-T) washes, peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Jackson) is added, the membrane washed again with TBS-T and immunoreactive bands is detected by West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce).\n\n\n \nFlow Cytometry Analysis:\n\n\n \n \n \nFor evaluation of the level of apoptosis in a cell culture, following different treatments with PGA copolymer-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel (SEQ ID NO:18) and HPMA copolymer-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel (SEQ ID NO:23), representative conjugates according to the embodiments of the present invention, cells are harvested, fixed with methanol, and re-suspended in PBS. The fluorescent marker, Propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) is added for nuclear staining and the cells are analyzed in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS unit, Inter-departmental Facilities, Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University).\n\n\n \nCell Proliferation Assay:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-angiogenesis and anti-proliferative activity of the conjugates described herein was evaluated by the effect of the conjugates on the proliferation of HUVEC, U87 and PANC02 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHUVEC were plated onto 24-well plate (1×10\n4 \ncells/well) in endothelial cell basal medium 2 (EBM-2; Cambrex, USA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Following 24 hours of incubation (37° C.; 5% CO\n2\n) medium was replaced with Endothelial cell growth medium-2 (EGM-2; Cambrex, USA). U87 and PANC02 cells were plated onto 96 well plate (2×10\n3 \ncells/well) in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and incubated for 24 hours (37° C.; 5% CO\n2\n). Following 24 hours of incubation the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were challenged with the tested compounds at serial concentrations for 72 hours. After incubation the number of HUVEC were counted by Coulter Counter and U87, and PANC02 cells were counted by XTT respectively.\n\n\n \n \nαvβ3 Expression Detection:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHUVEC, U87 and Panc02 were harvested with PBS containing 2.5 mM EDTA, followed by re-suspension of the cells in serum free medium (EBM-2 for HUVEC and DMEM for U87 and Panc02) and incubation for 30 minutes. The cells were divided and further re-suspended in PBS containing Mg\n2+\nand Ca\n2+\n. The cells were then incubated together with the primary antibody MAB1976-anti αvβ\n3 \nintegrin (Chemicon, 1:20) for 30 minutes, at room temperature, in gentle rocking. Serving as control were cells not incubated with any antibody. Then, the cells were washed and re-suspended in PBS with the second antibody anti mouse-FITC (Jackson, 1:50) and incubated in the dark for 30 minutes, at room temperature, in gentle rocking. The cells (1×10\n5\n) were collected by Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS), and statistical analysis was performed using WinMDI software.\n\n\n \n \nαvβ3 Interaction with Fluorescently Labeled Conjugates:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fluorescence probe, Oregon Green-cadaverine (OG), was conjugated to PGA conjugates through the free carboxylic groups (see Example 5 for synthesis description), in order to study the cellular uptake and trafficking.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHUVEC were plated onto 6 mm plates (5×10\n5 \ncells/plate) in EBM-2 (Cambrex, USA) supplemented with 5% FBS. Following 24 hours of incubation (37° C.; 5% CO\n2\n), cells were challenged with either PGA-OG, PGA-c(RADfk)-OG (SEQ ID NO: 24) or PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2]\n-OG (SEQ ID NO:25) diluted in EGM-2 medium for 5, 10, 15, 30 or 60 minutes. Cells were then washed in PBS (X3), harvested with PBS containing 2.5 mM EDTA and analyzed with the \nImageStream\n 100 imaging flow cytometer (Amnis). Analysis was performed using IDEAS software.\n\n\n \nCapillary-Like Tube Formation Assay:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-angiogenesis activity of the conjugates was evaluated by the effect of the conjugates on the ability of HUVEC cells to form capillary-like tube structures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe surface of 24-well plates was coated with Matrigel matrix (50 μl/well) (BD Biosciences, USA) on ice and was then allowed to polymerize at 37° C. for 30 minutes. HUVEC (3×10\n4 \ncells) were challenged with the tested compounds, and were seeded on coated plates in the presence of complete EGM-2 medium. After 8 hours of incubation (37° C.; 5% CO\n2\n), wells were imaged using Nikon TE2000E inverted microscope integrated with Nikon DS5 cooled CCD camera by 4× objective, brightfield technique. During the tube formation assay endothelial cells directionally migrate to align, branch and form polygonal networks (i.e. tube like structures). The extent of capillary-like tube structures is inversely proportional to the anti-angiogenesis activity of the compounds.\n\n\n \nMigration Assay:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-angiogenesis activity of the conjugates was evaluated by examining the effect of the conjugates on the ability of HUVEC to migrate toward the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell migration assay was performed using modified 8 μm Boyden chambers Transwells® (Costar Inc., USA) coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin HUVEC (15×10\n4 \ncells/100 μl) were challenged with the tested compounds that were added to the upper chamber of the transwells for 2 hours. Following incubation, cells were allowed to migrate to the underside of the chamber for 4 hours in the presence or absence of VEGF (20 ng/ml) in the lower chamber. Cells were then fixed and stained (\nHema\n 3 Stain System; Fisher Diagnostics, USA). The stained migrated cells were imaged using Nikon TE2000E inverted microscope integrated with Nikon DS5 cooled CCD camera by 10× objective, brightfield illumination. Migrated cells from the captured images per membrane were counted using NIH image software. Migration was normalized to the percent of migration toward VEGF of HUVEC which were not incubated with any compound. The extent of migration is inversely proportional to the anti-angiogenesis activity of the compounds.\n\n\n \nEndothelial Cell Adhesion Assay:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] and E-c(RGDfk) moieties (SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 41) in the conjugates to inhibit endothelial attachment to cellular matrix after conjugation, was assessed using an adhesion assay. Flat bottom 96-well culture plates (Nunc, Denmark) were coated with 0.5 μg/well fibrinogen overnight at 4° C. After washing three times with Phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the wells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 hour at 37° C. and washed three times again with PBS. HUVEC were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, 1.4 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, pH 7.3) with 2.5 mM EDTA and resuspended in EBM-2 serum-free media (Clonetics). HUVEC were incubated for 30 minutes, at room temperature, with the tested compounds. The treated HUVEC were plated at 5×10\n4 \ncells per well and were allowed to attach for 1 hour at 37° C. After incubation, the unattached cells were removed by rinsing the wells with PBS. The attached cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, stained with 0.5% crystal violet and were imaged using Nikon TE2000E inverted microscope integrated with Nikon DS5 cooled CCD camera by 4× objective, brightfield technique. The number of attached cells was quantified with NIH ImageJ processing and analysis software. Non-specific binding was determined by adhesion of HUVEC cells, which were not incubated with any of the tested compounds, to BSA-coated plates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of % of Free Paclitaxel and Free Peptide in the Conjugates Synthesized:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to determine the free Paclitaxel (PTX) and free peptide [either c(RGDfk)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 26) or c(RGDfk) (SEQ ID NO: 9) or control free c(RADfk)] (SEQ ID NO:40) content in the conjugates synthesized, aqueous solutions of the conjugates (1 mg/ml) were prepared, and an aliquot (100 pd) from each conjugate solution was added to a polypropylene tube followed by the addition of water up to a volume of 1 ml. Then, 5 ml of CHCl\n3 \nand 2-propanol at a ratio of 4:1 was added and the aliquot samples were thoroughly extracted by vortexing (3×10 seconds). The upper aqueous layer was carefully removed and the solvent evaporated under N\n2\n. The dry residue was dissolved in 200 μl of HPLC grade methanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar procedure was carried out for the free compound (PTX or peptide) (in which case a aliquots of 200 μl from a 1 mg/ml solution of the compounds was added to polypropylene tubes). Addition of 1 ml of MeOH to redissolve the product gave a 200 μg/ml stock from which a range of concentrations was prepared (2 to 100 μg/ml).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the aliquot of the conjugates solution as well as the free compound solution were purified by a pre-made RP column with a C18 Porous 50 resin using a mixture of MeOH:AcCN as the eluents. The solvent was then evaporated under N\n2(g)\n. The dry residue was then dissolved in 200 μl of HPLC grade methanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe free amount of drug in the conjugates was determined by HPLC using a Lichrospher® C18 (150×3.9 mm) column. Flow rate of 1 ml/min using an acetonitrile gradient in aqueous 0.1% TFA (to simultaneously determine PTX and the peptide, a gradient from 10% to 90% of acetonitrile in 28 min was used). The retention time was r.t.=16.9 minutes for PTX, r.t.=8.0 minutes for E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO: 2) and r.t.=5.3 minutes for c(RADfk) (SEQ ID NO:40) and r.t.=5.7 minutes for c(RGDfk) (SEQ ID NO: 9)=220 nm).\n\n\n \nQuantitative Evaluation of PGA Conjugates Hydrodynamic Diameter and Size Distribution:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe mean hydrodynamic diameter of the PGA conjugates was evaluated using a real time particle analyzer (NanoSight LM20™) containing a solid-state, single mode laser diode (<20 mW, 655 nm) configured to launch a finely focused beam through a 500 μl sample chamber. The tested conjugate was dissolved in PBS to a final concentrations of 9.9 mg/ml. The samples were then injected into the chamber by syringe and allowed to equilibrate to a unit temperature (23° C.) for 30 seconds. The particles dynamics were visualized at 30 frames per second (fps) for 60 seconds at 640×480 resolution by the device CCD camera. The paths the particles take under Brownian motion over time were analyzed using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) software. The diffusion coefficient and hence sphere equivalent hydrodynamic radius of each particle was separately determined and the particle size distribution profiles were generated. Each sample was measured three times in triplicates, and the results represent the mean diameter.\n\n\n \n \nRelease of PTX from PGA Copolymer -E−C(RGDfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel Conjugate (SEQ Id NO:18) in the Presence of Cathepsin B:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of Cathepsin B to cleave and therefore release PTX from PGA copolymer-E−c(RGDfk)\n2\n-PTX (SEQ ID NO:18) was assessed as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCathepsin B (5 U) was added last to a 1 ml solutions containing 3 mg of the tested conjugates and 20 mM sodium acetate, 2 mM EDTA and 5 mM DTT at a pH of 6 and at a temperature of 37° C. Solutions containing free PGA polymer and free PTX served as control. Sample aliquots (100 μl) were taken at various time points up to 72 hours, frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen, until assayed by HPLC (by Porous 50 resin) and/or by Gel permeation chromatography (GPC; direct analysis of 50 μl aliquots). PGA polymer incubated in buffer alone (without addition of cathepsin B) served as an additional control to assess non-enzymatic hydrolytic cleavage. The amount of free PTX released from the tested compounds was assessed by HPLC=220 nm). Doxycycline was used as internal standard in all cases. In addition, an LC-MS analysis of the released compounds was also carried out to in order determine the major metabolites released. The MW of the conjugates was determined by diluting 50 pd aliquots of the conjugate containing solution to a final volume of 200 μl with PBS buffer and subjecting the aliquots to GPC analysis (Viscotek TDA detector).\n\n\n \nStability of the Conjugates in Plasma:\n\n\n \n \n \nStability in plasma was assessed by incubating each of the conjugates (3 mg/ml), for 24 hours, at 37° C., in plasma freshly extracted from Wistar rats. At various time points, samples of 100 μl were collected. 15 μl of 0.2 mg/ml solution of doxycycline in MeOH served as an internal standard, and 135 μl of a mixture of MeCN:MeOH 50:50 with 2% ZnSO\n4 \nwere added to each sample in order to precipitate serum proteins. The samples were centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 5 minutes, and 150 μl of the supernatant were subjected to analysis by HPLC as described hereinabove. The amount of PTX release from the conjugates in the presence of serum was determined to be insignificant.\n\n\n \n \nαvβ3 Interaction with E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] in vivo:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSCID male were inoculated s.c. with 2×10\n6 \nmCherry-labeled U87 human osteosarcoma or with 5×10\n6 \nmCherry-labeled MG-63 human osteosarcoma. Mice bearing an average volume of 175 mm\n3 \nU87 human osteosarcoma tumors were injected i.v. with PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]-OG (SEQ ID NO: 25; 50 μM-RGD) or PGA-c(RADfk)-OG (SEQ ID NO: 24; 50 μM-RGD-equivalent dose) (n=3 mice/group). One hour after injection, tumors were removed, dissected to thin slices and examined under Zeiss Meta LSM 510 confocal imaging system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice bearing 600 mm\n3 \nMG-63 human osteosarcoma tumors were injected i.v. with PGA-PTX−E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]-OG (SEQ ID NO: 25; 50 μM-RGD), PGA-PTX-OG or PGA-PTX−c(RADfk)-OG (SEQ ID NO: 24; 50 μM-RGD-equivalent dose) (n=3 mice/group). 30 and 60 min after injection, tumors were removed washed several times with cold PBS, fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at RT and washed with PBS again.\n\n\n \n \nTumors were then homogenized and analyzed with the ImageStream 100 (amnis). Analysis was performed using IDEAS software.\n\n\n \nConfocal Microscopy:\n\n\n \n \n \nCellular colocalization of OG labeled PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO: 25) conjugate was monitored utilizing a Zeiss Meta LSM 510 confocal imaging systems with 40oil objectives. All images were taken using a multi-track channel acquisition to prevent emission cross-talk between fluorescent dyes. Single XY, XZ plane-images were acquired in 1024×1024 resolution.\n\n\n \nStatistical Methods:\n\n\n \n \n \nData are expressed as mean±SD. Statistical significance was determent using an unpaired t-test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical tests are two-sided.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nSynthesis of HPMA copolymer-E-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel (SEQ ID NO: 23)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe general synthesis of an HPMA copolymer-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel (SEQ ID NO:23) (Compound 2) is depicted in \nFIG. 6\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 6\n, the HPMA-c(RDGfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel conjugate (SEQ ID NO:23) is prepared in a two-step synthesis, as follows: The peptide linker, Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly (SEQ ID NO:10) is a cathepsin B-cleavable linker. Cathepsin B is a lysosomal enzyme overexpressed in both epithelial and endothelial tumor cells. First, the conjugation of c(RDGfk)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:26) to HPMA copolymer-Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly (SEQ ID NO:42) by non-specific aminolysis using the amino group of the lysine is effected. Next, the conjugation of Paclitaxel to the polymer through an ester bond is effected. HPMA copolymer-Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly (\nGFLG\n 10 mol %)-p-nitrophenol (ONp) (SEQ ID NO:43) is used as multivalent polymeric precursor, therefore a maximum of 10 mol % functionalization is allowed. In order to keep an appropriate Paclitaxel loading a maximum of 5 mol %, c(RDGfk)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:26) loading is considered.\n\n\n \nSynthesis of HPMA-E-c(RDGfk)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:44) (Compound 1):\n\n\n \n \n \nHPMA copolymer-Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly-ONp (SEQ ID NO:43) is dissolved in anhydrous Dimethylformamide (DMF) under nitrogen atmosphere. c(RDGfk)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:26) is conjugated through aminolysis to the HPMA copolymer-Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly-ONp (SEQ ID NO:43) in DMF and then mixed together. c(RDGfk)\n2\nTFA (SEQ ID NO 45) in anhydrous DMF is then added together with TEA. The reaction is allowed to proceed for 8 hours at room temperature. TLC is used to monitor the reaction. The solvent is thereafter removed under high vacuum and the conjugate is purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), Sephadex LH-20 using methanol as mobile phase. For further purification, the conjugate is redissolved in a minimum amount of water, dialyzed and lyophilized yielding the desired \ncompound\n 1 in a high percentage of purity. UV spectroscopy is used to determine the peptide content of the conjugate. In order to characterize the c(RDGfk)\n2 \nloading (SEQ ID NO: 26) on the conjugates a calibration curve is carried out in DMF RT=25° C., at a maximum Absorbance of 266 nm.\n\n\n \nSynthesis of HPMA-copolymer-E-c(RDGfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel (SEQ ID NO:23) (Compound 2):\n\n\n \n \n \nPaclitaxel is dissolved in DMF and added to the HPMA-c(RDGfk)\n2 \nconjugate (SEQ ID NO:44) dissolved in DMF as well. The conjugate is re-purified, lyophilized and characterized by HPLC analysis at 254 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugate HPMA copolymer-TNP-470-RGD4C (SEQ ID NO:46) is similarly prepared.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nSynthesis and Characterization of a PGA Copolymer-E-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel Conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18)\n\n\nSynthesis of PGA-Copolymer -E-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel Conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe general synthesis of a PGA-E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n]-Paclitaxel (SEQ ID NO:18) (Compound 4) is depicted in \nFIG. 7\n. The ester linker is hydrolytically labile and PTX release is expected to occur under lysosomal acidic pH. The PGA-E-[c(RDGfk)\n2\n]-Paclitaxel conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18) was prepared in two steps: first, the PTX was conjugated to the PGA polymer followed by the conjugation of the -E-[c(RDGfk)\n2\n] peptide (SEQ ID NO:2) to the PTX−conjugated polymer. The ester linker between the carboxylic groups of the glutamate monomeric units and the PTX as well as the [c(RDGfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO: 26) are hydrolytically labile and under lysosomal acidic pH are cleaved thus releasing both PTX and -E-[c(RDGfk)\n2] (SEQ ID NO:\n2). The peptide linkage between the glutamate monomeric units is a hydrolytically labile linker, which is also susceptible to cathepsin B-cleavage. The E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n] peptide (SEQ ID NO:2) was conjugated to the PTX containing polymer through a glutamic acid (-E-) peptidic linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPGA was used as a multivalent polymeric precursor. The starting PGA was synthesized via N-Carboxyanhydride (NCA) polymerization of glutamic acid. Transition metal macroinitiators were used in order to overcome the well-known limitations of conventional NCA polymerizations such as the presence side-reactions that restrict control over MW and prohibit formation of well-defined block copolymers. The synthetic method was performed as previously described [Curtin et al. 1999\n, Journal of the American Chemical Society \n121: 7427-7428].\n\n\n \nSynthesis of a PGA-Paclitaxel conjugate (Compound 3)\n\n\n \n \n \nPTX was conjugated to the PGA (Mw 18,200, Mw/Mn 1.4) by carbodiimide coupling. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 24 hours. Thin layer chromatography (TLC, silica) showed a complete conversion of the free PTX (R\nf\n=0.6) to the PTX-polymer conjugate (Compound 3) (R\nf\n=0, CH\n2\nCl\n2\n/MeOH=90:10). The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 24 hours without product isolation.\n\n\n \nSynthesis of PGA-Copolymer -E-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel (SEQ ID NO: 18) (Compound 4)\n\n\n \n \n \nFollowing the completion of the PTX conjugation reaction N-hydroxysuccinimide (OHSuc) was added to the reaction mixture in order to activate the remaining carboxylic groups of the glutamate monomers for subsequent conjugation of the E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n] peptide (SEQ ID NO:2). The carboxylic group activation is important in order to avoid side-reactions (namely cross linking between two E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n] compounds (SEQ ID NO:2) via the carboxylic groups of their aspartic acids). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 hours and was then stopped by pouring the reaction mixture into CHCl\n3\n. The resulting precipitate was collected and washed with acetone and MeOH in order to remove the unreacted OHSuc. The precipitate was further collected and dried under vacuum. CHCl\n3 \nwas kept to determine total drug loading (PTX) by HPLC through an indirect measurement. The solid intermediate was redissolved in anhydrous DMF and E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n] peptide (SEQ ID NO:2) was conjugated with PGA through the -E-peptidic spacer using DMAP as a base catalyst. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 72 hours and was then stopped by pouring the reaction mixture into CHCl\n3\n. Thin layer chromatography (TLC, silica) showed complete conversion of the free E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n] (R\nf\n=0.3) (SEQ ID NO:2) to the polymer conjugated E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO: 18) (R\nf\n=0, AcOH/MeOH=1:99). The resulting precipitate was collected and dried in vacuum thus yielding the desired \nCompound\n 4.

Lyophilization of the purified fractions yielded the desired product as a white powder (70%-80% yield).\n\n\n \nSynthesis of a Conjugate of PGA with a Single c(RGDfK) Moiety (SEQ ID NO:17)\n\n\n \n \n \nPGA-RGDfk (SEQ ID NO:17; MW 200.37 g/mol) and the conjugate PGA-PTX-RGDfk (SEQ ID NO:19; MW 216.53 g/mol) were also similarly synthesized and the % of drug loading is presented in Table 1. The chemical structures of PGA-PTX-RGDfk conjugate (SEQ ID NO: 19) and the conjugate PGA-RGDfk (SEQ ID NO:17; are presented in \nFIGS. 2F and 2G\n, respectively.\n\n\n \nSyntheses of “Control” Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nFor use as control compounds in the experiments described hereinbelow, other conjugates were also synthesized: PGA-PTX, PGA-c(RADfk) (SEQ ID NO:14), PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:15) and PGA-PTX−c(RADfk) (SEQ ID NO:19).

The general synthesis of a PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:15; Compound 5) is depicted in \nFIG. 8\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPGA was dissolved in anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) under nitrogen atmosphere and the glutamate carboxylic acids were activated using OHSuc. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 hours. The resultant PGA-OSuc product was isolated by precipitation in CHCl\n3 \nand washed with acetone and methanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nE-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO: 2) was then conjugated through the succinimidyl-activated esters to the PGA in DMF, as follows: E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO: 2) was added to the PGA-OSuc and the reaction was allowed to proceed in DMF for 48 hours at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by pouring the reaction mixture into CHCl\n3\n. Thin layer chromatography (TLC, silica) showed a complete conversion of the free E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO: 2) (R\nf\n=0.3) to the polymer conjugated E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO: 15) (R\nf\n=0, AcOH/MeOH=1:99). The resulting precipitate was collected and dried under vacuum thus yielding the desired \nCompound\n 5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sodium salt of the conjugate (SEQ ID NO:48) was obtained by dissolving the product in 1.0 M NaHCO\n3\n, followed by purification by SEC (Sephadex G25) using water as mobile phase, in order to remove low molecular weight contaminants and salt excesses.

The total PTX content in these polymeric conjugates was determined by UV (λ=227 nm and 230 nm, calibration curve carried out at RT in MeOH) and HPLC (indirect analysis wherein the PTX content in reaction residues at λ=220 nm, from 35 to 80% of acetonitrile in 25 min, r.t.=10.8 minutes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe total E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n] peptide (SEQ ID NO:2), E-c(RGDfK) peptide (SEQ ID NO:41) or control inactive peptide, E-c(RADfk) (SEQ ID NO:40) content in these polymeric conjugates was determined by UV (λ=254 nm and 260 nm, calibration curve carried out at RT in MeOH), HPLC (indirect analysis of peptide content in reaction residues, flow \nrate\n 1 ml/minute using an acetonitrile gradient in aqueous 0.1% TFA from 5 to 75% of acetonitrile in 25 min, λ=220 nm, r.t.=7.9 minutes) and amino acid analysis (briefly, 3 mg of each conjugate synthesized were hydrolyzed with 5N HCl at 160° C. for 4 hours, and samples were then lyophilized and sent to Parc Cientific Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain) for analysis by LC-MS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe % loading of PTX and the peptides in the synthesized conjugates is presented in Table 1.

The mean hydrodynamic diameter of the conjugate [PGA-PTX−E-c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:18) with PTX loading of 5.5 mol % and -E-c(RGDfk)\n2 \nloading of 3.9 mol % (i.e. second conjugate) was about 30 nm (see, \nFIG. 9A\n). The mean hydrodynamic diameter of the conjugate [PGA-PTX−E-c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:18) with PTX loading of 2.6 mol % and -E-c(RGDfk)\n2 \nloading of 5 mol % (i.e. first conjugate) was about 40 nm (see, \nFIG. 9B\n). The mean hydrodynamic diameter of the conjugate [PGA-PTX−E-c(RGDfk)] (SEQ ID NO:16) with PTX loading of 2.3 mol % and with -E-c(RGDfk) loading of 5 mol % was about 35 nm (see, \nFIG. 9C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe average molecular weight (MW), polydispersity (Mw/Mn) and the behavior of PGA conjugates and control non-conjugated PGA in solution were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Both techniques showed that the PGA conjugates have a more compact conformational structure and greater sedimentation coefficient (S) as compared to the control nonconjugated PGA. The MW was determined, by SEC, as 17700 Da (MW/Mn=1.3) for PGA and 48600 Da (MW/Mn=1.4) for the PGA-PTX−c(RGDfk)\n2 \nconjugate (SEQ ID NO:18) (the second conjugate) and 35700 Da (Mw/Mn=1.4) for PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] conjugate (SEQ ID NO:15).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPTX Release from PGA Copolymer-E-c(RGD)\n2\n-Paclitaxel Conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18) by Cathepsin B:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of the conjugates of the present invention to release PTX in the presence of preselected cellular enzymes, for instance, the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B, was tested. The results are presented in \nFIG. 10\n and show that the conjugates synthesized exhibited a time-dependent and drug loading dependent drug release kinetics in the enzymatic experiments. It is important to mention that in all cases the main metabolite released from the polymer was PTX as determined by LC/MS experiments using a MALDI-TOF as MS detector. PGA-PTX−E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:18; having 3.9 mol % E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n], 5.5 mol % PTX loadings) showed slightly faster release kinetics compared to all other conjugates, including PGA-PTX−E-c(RGDfk) (SEQ ID NO:16) (\nFIG. 2A\n). Interestingly, PTX release was greater with the second conjugate, bearing greater PTX loading (5.5 mol %) and lower E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] content (3.9 mol %), after 48 hours as compared to the first conjugate synthesized having a lower PTX loading (2.6 mol %) and higher E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] content (5 mol %). These differences could be due to a different conformation adopted as these polymer conjugates form unimolecular micelles in solution. For stability studies under hydrolytical conditions and in the presence of plasma, non-significant PTX release was observed in the conjugates analyzed (data not shown).\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nSynthesis of Fluorescently Labeled Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nA fluorescence probe, Oregon Green-cadaverine (OG), was conjugated to the various PGA conjugates through the free carboxylic groups, namely PGA-OG, PGA-c(RADfk)-OG (SEQ ID NO:24) and PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]-OG (SEQ ID NO:25) were synthesized in order to study the cellular uptake and trafficking. The conjugates were dissolved in the minimum amount of anhydrous DMF, then N,N′-diisoproprylcarbodiimmide (DIC) and 1′-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) were added, using a DIC/HOBT/COOH groups molar ratio of 1.5:1.5:1. Finally, a DMF solution of Oregon Green-cadaverine (OG) was added with a OG/COOH groups molar ratio of 1:100. The reactions were monitored by TLC and eluted with MeOH followed by DMF evaporation by vacuum. The residues were dissolved in an aqueous solution of NaHCO\n3 \n(1.5:1 molar ratio of NaHCO\n3 \nand the COOH groups) and loaded onto a PD10 column, eluted with water, with collecting fractions of 1 ml to 2 μl of each fraction. 498 μl of MeOH was added to each fraction, in order to measure the fluorescence and identify the fractions containing the PGA-OG conjugates and to quantify the amount of conjugated OG. OG loading ranged from 0.7 to 0.9 mol %.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nAnti-Angiogenesis Activity of HPMA Copolymer-c(RGDfK)\n2\n-Paclitaxel Conjugate (SEQ ID NO:23)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of Paclitaxel (PTX) and the cyclic RGD-containing peptide c(RGDfk)\n2 \nwhen conjugated to the HPMA copolymer (SEQ ID NO:23), as compared to free Paclitaxel and c(RGDfk)\n2\n, to inhibit endothelial and tumor cell proliferation, migration towards the chemoattractant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and to adhere to a fibrinogen matrix is tested in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell Proliferation Assay:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) or MCF7 or MCF7/Cyr61 breast cancer cells are seeded on gelatinized plates. Following 24 hours of incubation, cells are challenged with serial concentrations of either PTX or c(RGDfk)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:26) or HPMA copolymer-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-PTX (SEQ ID NO:23) in the presence of growth factors. Cells are counted after 72 hours using Beckman Culter Counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMigration Assay:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA migration assay is performed in order to evaluate the effect of free PTX, or c(RGDfk)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:26) or HPMA copolymer-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-PTX (SEQ ID NO:23) on the ability of breast tumor cells, MCF7 or MCF7/Cyr61 or HUVEC to migrate through endothelial cell monolayer in a transwell system using vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a migration stimulator in the bottom chamber. This imitates their ability to cross the endothelium and metastasize in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cell migration assay is performed as described above for HUVEC. Briefly, HUVEC, MCF7 or MCF7/Cyr61 (5×10\n4 \ncells/100 μl) are challenged with free PTX, c(RGDfk)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:26), or HPMA copolymer-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-PTX (SEQ ID NO:23), and are then plated on the upper chamber of the transwell for a 2 hours incubation period. Following incubation, cells are allowed to migrate to the underside of the chamber in the presence or absence of VEGF in the lower chamber. Cells are then fixed and stained and the number of migrated cells per membrane is determined. Migration is normalized to percent migration, with 100% representing VEGF dependent migration of cells which are not incubated with any compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEndothelial Cell Adhesion Assay:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of c(RDGfk)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:26), c(RDGfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel (SEQ ID NO:49) and HPMA copolymer-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel conjugate (SEQ ID NO:23) to inhibit endothelial cell adherence to a fibrinogen coated matrix is determined. Trypsinized HUVEC are incubated with the tested conjugate and with the inactive c(RADfk)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 50) or c(RADfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel (SEQ ID NO: 51) as controls. The treated HUVECs are then plated on fibrinogen-coated 96-well culture plates and allowed to attach. The attached cells are then fixed and dyed and their number is determined using Nikon TE2000E inverted microscope and NIH image software.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nBinding of PGA-Conjugated c(RGDfK)\n2 \nto the αvβ\n3 \nIntegrin Receptor\n\n\n \n \n \nαvβ\n3 \nintegrin expression on HUVEC, U87 glioblastoma and PANC02 cells was determined using αvβ\n3 \nintegrin immunostaining and FACS. αvβ\n3 \nintegrin was highly expressed on HUVEC and U87 glioblastoma cells, but was absent from PANC02 cells (see, \nFIG. 11A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing amnis \nImageStream\n 100 imaging flow cytometer and the fluorescence probe Oregon Green-cadaverine (OG), the interaction of PGA-OG, PGA-c(RADfk)-OG (SEQ ID NO:24) and PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2]\n-OG (SEQ ID NO:25) with αvβ\n3 \nintegrin receptor of the conjugates was evaluated in HUVEC. Conjugate-cell adherence was observed for PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]-OG (SEQ ID NO:25) as early as 10 minutes following cell incubation with the conjugate, which further continued to enhance, thereby suggesting cell internalization of the conjugate. PGA-c(RADfk)-OG (SEQ ID NO:24) started adhering to cell surface a little later, at 15 minutes (see, \nFIGS. 11B and 11C\n). In contrast, the conjugate which did not comprise the RGD moiety (PGA-c(RADfk)-OG; SEQ ID NO:24) bound to a much lesser extent to the cells (see, \nFIG. 11B\n), thereby demonstrating a role for the RGD moiety in the interaction and subsequent internalizations of the conjugates into the cells, most likely via the αvβ\n3 \nintegrin receptor.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nAnti-Angiogenesis Activity of PGA-Copolymer-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]-Paclitaxel Conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18) Cell Proliferation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to evaluate whether similar to PTX, c(RGDfk)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 26) and PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]-PTX, (SEQ ID NO:18) a representative conjugate according to the embodiments of the present invention, possesses anti-angiogenic properties, HUVEC proliferation, capillary-like tube formation and migration assays were performed. The cyclic peptide c(RADfk) (SEQ ID NO:40) served as a negative control for the -E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:2) since this peptide has low affinity binding to integrin receptors. The activity of the PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2]\n-PTX conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18) was compared to the activity of the polyglutamate polymer alone (PGA), Paclitaxel alone (PTX), a conjugate of PGA-PTX, a conjugate of PGA with the negative control RAD containing peptide (PGA-c(RADfk); SEQ ID NO:14) and a conjugate of PGA with the bis-cyclic RGD-containing peptide (PGA-E-c(RGDfk)\n2\n; SEQ ID NO:15). The chemical structure of these conjugates is presented in \nFIG. 2\n. The activity of the PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]-PTX conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18) was also compared to a similar conjugate only with the RGD-containing peptide being replaced by the negative control RAD peptide (SEQ ID NO:19) (chemical structures of these two conjugates are presented in \nFIG. 3\n). The IC\n50 \nvalues measured for the tested conjugates are presented in Table 2. Table 2 presents data for 5 experiments performed, whereby in each experiment the IC\n50 \nof the various compounds (detailed on the left column) were compared to the IC\n50 \nof a specific conjugate using a specific cell line (as indicated in the upper first and second rows). When the conjugate comprised only one RGD moiety than it was compared to control compounds comprising only one RGD moiety (i.e. the x in Table 2 equals 1). When the conjugate comprised two RGD moieties than it was compared to control compounds also comprising two RGD moieties (i.e. the x in Table 2 equals 2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe proliferation of HUVEC was inhibited similarly by the PGA-PTX, PGA-PTX−E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:18) and PGA-PTX−c(RADfk) (SEQ ID NO:19) conjugates at PTX equivalent concentrations in which more than 50% of the cells were inhibited at concentrations lower than 0.2 and higher than 17 nM (see, \nFIG. 12A\n). Free PTX by itself and in combination with E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:2) or c(RADfk) (SEQ ID NO:40) inhibited HUVEC proliferation more efficiently, demonstrating an IC\n50 \nvalue of about 0.01 nM PTX. E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n] peptide, alone (SEQ ID NO:2) or conjugated to PGA (SEQ ID NO:15), inhibited HUVEC proliferation by itself but only at high concentrations. c(RADfk) peptide (SEQ ID NO:40), or PGA showed no effect even at those high concentrations (for IC\n50 \nvalues see, Table 2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor U87 cells, another αvβ\n3 \nexpressing cell type, proliferation inhibition was very similar to that of HUVEC. Free PTX, or combined with E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:2) or c(RADfk) (SEQ ID NO:40) at equivalent doses had similar effect, exhibiting an IC\n50 \nof about 0.01 nM PTX, as it was for HUVEC. Moreover, PGA-PTX, PGA-PTX−E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] and PGA-PTX−c(RADfk) conjugates (SEQ ID NOs:18 and 19 respectively) at equivalent doses had an exact similar bell-shaped effect, as was seen on HUVEC, in which more than 50% of the cells were inhibited at concentrations lower than about 0.055 and higher than 70 nM PTX (\nFIG. 12B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA different inhibition pattern was seen for the non-expressing αvβ\n3\nPANC02 cells. Free PTX, or combined with E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] or c(RADfk) (SEQ ID NOs:2 and 40 respectively) at equivalent doses inhibited cells proliferation with an IC\n50 \nof about 200 nM PTX. As apposed to HUVEC and U87 cells, PGA-PTX−E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18) had a more significant effect with IC\n50 \nof about 650 nM PTX, were PGA-PTX and PGA-PTX−c(RADfk) (SEQ ID NO: 19) had an IC\n50 \nof about 2000 nM PTX (\nFIG. 12C\n). On these cells, bell-shaped pattern of conjugate inhibition was not observed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese results show that the anti-angiogenesis agent Paclitaxel maintained its anti-proliferative activity when conjugated, together with the angiogenesis targeting moiety c(RGDfk)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:26), to a PGA polymer.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC50 (nM) of\n\n\nIC50 (nM) of\n\n\nIC50 (nM) of\n\n\nIC50 (nM) of\n\n\nIC50 (nM) of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPGA-PTX-E-\n\n\nPGA-PTX-E-\n\n\nPGA-PTX-E-\n\n\nPGA-PTX-E-\n\n\nPGA-PTX-E-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc(RGDfk)\n\n\n[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]\n\n\n[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]\n\n\n[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]\n\n\n[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 16)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 18)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 18)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 18)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 18)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2.1 mol % PTX,\n\n\n2.6 mol % PTX,\n\n\n5 mol % PTX,\n\n\n5 mol % PTX,\n\n\n5 mol % PTX,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5 mol % RGD\n\n\n5 mol % RGD\n\n\n3.9 mol % RGD\n\n\n3.9 mol % RGD\n\n\n3.9 mol % RGD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCell type\n\n\nHUVEC\n\n\nHUVEC\n\n\nHUVEC\n\n\nU87\n\n\nPANCO2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPGA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nc(RADfK)\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 40)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-[c(RGDfK)\nX\n]\n\n\nNA\n\n\n8000\n\n\n4000\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX = 1 or 2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NOs: 41\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nor 2 respectively)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPTX\n\n\n0.0085\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n0.009\n\n\n0.045\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPGA-E-[c(RGDfK)\nX\n]\n\n\nNA\n\n\n2900\n\n\n7000\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX = 1 or 2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NOs: 17 or\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n15respectively)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPGA-c(RADfK)\n\n\n1000\n\n\n5000\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 14)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPGA-PTX\n\n\n0.38-10\n\n\n0.23-20\n\n\n 0.4-15\n\n\n0.1-80\n\n\n2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPTX+ c(RADfK)\n\n\n0.0085\n\n\n0.02\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 40)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPTX+\n\n\n0.006\n\n\n0.017\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n680\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-[c(RGDfK)\nX\n]\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nX = 1 or 2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NOs: 41 or\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 respectively)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPGA-PTX-c(RADfK)\n\n\n0.42-10\n\n\n0.19-19\n\n\n0.38-18\n\n\n65\n\n\n2600\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 19\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPGA-PTX-E-\n\n\n0.28-20\n\n\n25\n\n\n 0.2-18\n\n\n0.055-70\n\n\n650\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[c(RGDIK)\nX\n]\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nX = 1 or 2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NOs: 16 or\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n18respectively)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC\n50 \nvalues for all the compounds and all combinations were calculated from the proliferation assays results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe presented data is for the different loading percentage of PTX and the different loading percentage of E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] or E-c(RGDfk).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNA-Non applicable, did not reach IC\n50 \nin the concentrations used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar results on HUVEC proliferation were obtained for the PGA-PTX−E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18) having a 5 mol % E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] and 2.6 mol % PTX loading (see, \nFIG. 13A\n) as well as for the PGA-PTX−E-c(RGDfk) conjugate (SEQ ID NO:16) (see, \nFIG. 13B\n) whereby both showed a similar bell shaped effect, with an IC\n50 \nof ˜0.2 and 20 nM PTX respectively.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-Angiogenesis Activity of PGA-Copolymer-E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n]-Paclitaxel Conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18)\n\n\n \nMigration Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nNext, the effect of PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]-PTX conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18) on the ability of HUVEC to migrate towards VEGF was tested.

PTX alone, the combination of PTX and -E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:2) or c(RADfk) (SEQ ID NO:40) and PGA-PTX conjugate had greater inhibitory effect of about 55%. PGA served as control and had no inhibitory effect on the ability of HUVEC to migrate towards VEGF while -E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:40) and c(RADfk) (SEQ ID NO: 40) had an inhibitory effect of about 30%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese results show that the anti-angiogenesis agent Paclitaxel as well as the c(RGDfk)\n2 \npeptide (SEQ ID NO: 26) both inhibited endothelial cell migration, although the latter to a lesser extent. Furthermore, Paclitaxel inhibition ability was preserved when conjugated together with c(RGDfk)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:26) to the PGA.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nAnti-Angiogenesis Activity of PGA-Copolymer-E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n]-Paclitaxel Conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18) Endothelial Cell Adhesion Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nOne of the principle stages of angiogenesis involves the adhesion of endothelial cell to the extracellular matrix and is mediated through integrin receptors. Therefore, drugs which interact and inhibit the activity of the integrin receptor inhibit endothelial cell adhesion and consequently, serve as antiangiogenesis agents. α\nv\nβ\n3 \nintegrins are known to bind the RGD sequence (Arg-Gly-Asp; SEQ ID NO:1), which constitutes the recognition domain of different proteins, such as laminin, fibronectin and vitronectin. Tumor-induced angiogenesis can be targeted in vivo by antagonizing the αvβ\n3 \nintegrin with small peptides containing the RGD amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, endothelial cell adhesion assay was performed in order to evaluate in vitro the targeting specificity (i.e. ability to bind to the integrin receptors) of the cyclic RGD containing peptides -E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:2) or c(RGDfk) (SEQ ID NO:9) when conjugated to PTX and PGA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPresented in \nFIG. 15\n are bar graphs of the percent of observed cell adhesion of HUVEC to fibrinogen coated plates when incubated with one of the tested compounds. The results were normalized to the percent of cell adhesion when no compound was added. All RGD-bearing PGA-PTX conjugates at equivalent concentrations of 50 μM RGD were able to inhibit HUVEC adhesion to fibrinogen by ˜60%. PGA-PTX−c(RADfk) conjugate (SEQ ID NO:19) served as control to each RGD conjugate. When PGA-PTX−c(RADfk) conjugate (SEQ ID NO:19) was compared to bis-cyclic RGD-bearing conjugates, with a similar amount of PTX, it had a minor inhibitory effect of ˜20%. When it was compared to monocyclic RGD-bearing conjugate, with a similar amount of PTX, it inhibited HUVEC adhesion as well as PGA-PTX−E-c(RGDfk) (SEQ ID NO:16) (˜50%). Free PTX, as PGA, and all their combinations, had a negligent effect on endothelial cell adhesion. The free peptides E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:2) or E-c(RGDfk) (SEQ ID NO:41) and c(RADfK) (SEQ ID NO:40) served as controls. As expected, the RGD peptidomimetics completely abrogated HUVEC adhesion at 50 μM while at the same concentration the c(RADfK) peptide (SEQ ID NO:40) had no effect on the adhesion of the cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe first PGA-PTX−E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18; having a loading of 3.9 mol % E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] and 5.5 mol % PTX) was more effective than the second PGA-PTX−E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] conjugate synthesized (SEQ ID NO:18; having a loading of 5 mol % E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n], and 2.6 mol % PTX). Both conjugates inhibited the adhesion more effectively than the monocyclic RGDfk peptide conjugate PGA-PTX−E-c(RGDfk) (SEQ ID NO:16).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese results show that the cyclic peptides E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:2) and c(RGDfk) (SEQ ID NO:9) maintained the ability to bind α\nv\nβ\n3 \nintegrins and inhibit endothelial cell adhesion when conjugated together with PTX to a PGA polymer (SEQ ID NOs: 18 and 16 respectively.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nAnti-Angiogenesis Activity of PGA-Copolymer-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel Conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18)\n\n\nCapillary-Like Tube Formation of Endothelial Cells In Vitro\n\n\n \n \n \nHaving shown that conjugated PTX and [c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO: 26) have anti-angiogenic potential by inhibiting the proliferation, adhesion and migration of HUVEC, the effect of the PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2]\n-PTX conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18) on the ability of HUVEC to form capillary-like tube structures on Matrigel was examined (see, \nFIG. 16\n). This assay aims to imitate the capability of endothelial cells to form 3-D vascular structures in vivo as an important step in the angiogenic cascade. PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]-PTX conjugate (SEQ ID NO:18; 5 mol % E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n], 2.6 mol % PTX loadings i.e. second conjugate synthesized), PGA-c(RADfk)-PTX conjugate (SEQ ID NO:19) as control, and the combinations of PTX and E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] (SEQ ID NO:2) at equivalent concentrations of 10 nM and 19 nM, respectively, inhibited the formation of tubular structures of HUVEC by about 40% (see, \nFIG. 16B\n). PTX alone had greater inhibitory effect of about 50% and PGA, which served as control, had no inhibitory effect on the ability of HUVEC to form tubular structures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese results show that Paclitaxel maintained its inhibitory effect on the ability of endothelial cell to form capillary-like tube structures, when conjugated with E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n] to a PGA polymer (SEQ ID NO:18).\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nSpecific Antagonism of αvβ\n3 \n \n\n\n \n \n \nCyr61 (also known as CCN1) is a Cysteine-rich matricellular protein that supports cell adhesion and induces adhesion signaling. Furthermore, Cyr61 stimulates endothelial cell migration and enhances growth factor induced DNA synthesis in culture and therefore induces angiogenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, Cyr61 acts as a non-RGD-containing ligand of integrin receptors. Functional blockade of αvβ\n3\n, a Cyr61 integrin receptor, is specifically cytotoxic towards Cyr61-overexpressing breast cancer cells and a specific αvβ3-RGD peptidomimetic agent (SEQ ID NO:28) prevents αvβ3 from binding to its ligand, Cyr61.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of HPMA copolymer-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel conjugate (SEQ ID NO:23), PGA copolymer-E-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel (SEQ ID NO:18) and the polymer PGA copolymer-E-c(RGDfk)-Paclitaxel conjugate (SEQ ID NO:16) to act as a specific antagonist of αvβ3 and thus to inhibit the Cyr61-integrin receptor signal transduction cascade is evaluated in CYR61-overexpressing and control MCF-7 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDownregulation of PI-3′K and ERK1/ERK2 Cascades:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the phenotypic changes dictated by the Cyr61-driven αvβ3 signaling, like enhanced endothelial cell survival and proliferation, are dependent upon activation of \nphosphatidylinositol\n 3′-kinase (PI-3′K/AKT) and ERK1/ERK2 MAPK cascades. Those pathways were recently found to be unregulated in Cyr61-overexpressing MCF-7 cells. Based on those findings, the same cell line is used to analyze the efficacy of the conjugates as αvβ\n3 \nantagonists. Protein extracts are prepared from Cyr61-overexpressing MCF-7 cells before and after treatment with the conjugates, and the levels of PI-3′K/AKT and ERK1/ERK2 MAPK activation is monitored by Western blot.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhancement of the Apoptosis Level:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFunctional blockade of αvβ\n3 \nsynergistically enhances Paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in Cyr61-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Thus, the apoptosis level of Cyr61-overexpressing and control MCF-7 cells is analyzed by flow cytometry, before and after treatment with the conjugates. Cell extracts are also analyzed by Western blot for the expression level of different apoptotic proteins, like Bax, cleaved-PARP and several caspases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \np53 Accumulation:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPaclitaxel-induced apoptosis involves a dose- and time-dependent accumulation of the tumor suppressor p53. αvβ\n3 \nhyperactivation by Cyr61 overexpression impairs Paclitaxel-induced accumulation of p53. Using western blotting techniques, the level of p53 protein, in cell extracts of CYR61-overexpressing MCF-7 cells in the presence/absence of the conjugates is evaluated.\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nEvaluation of Antitumor Activity of the Conjugates in Mice Bearing Mammary Tumors\n\n\n \n \n \nPaclitaxel has already been used successfully in the treatment of breast cancer both in animal models and in the clinic. SCID mice bearing MCF or MCF/Cyr61-Luciferase breast cancer cells in the mammary fat pad are treated with free Paclitaxel, Paclitaxel-c(RDGfk)\n2 \nconjugate (SEQ ID NO:49), HPMA copolymer-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel conjugate (SEQ ID NO:23), PGA copolymer-E-c(RGDfk)-Paclitaxel (SEQ ID NO:16) or PGA copolymer-E-c(RGDfk)\n2\n-Paclitaxel (SEQ ID NO:18), in the following manner: the animals are treated with one of the tested drugs at a equivalent dose of Paclitaxel (5 mg/kg weekly). Animals treated with saline, HPMA copolymer, PGA or c(RDGfk)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:26) are used as controls. The animals are monitored daily for general health, weight loss and tumor progression. Once a week the mice are imaged following administration of luciferase i.v. using the Biospace Photon Imager in order to follow up the tumor progression. All treatments are evaluated at three time points: (i) early treatment at the hyperplasic stage (10 days after tumor cells inoculation) in order to block the angiogenic switch before the initial formation of solid tumors (prevention trial), (ii) treatment of mice bearing small (asymptomatic) solid tumors (15-30 days after tumor cells inoculation) in order to determine whether their expansive growth and progression to deleterious stages could be inhibited (intervention trial), and (iii) treatment of mice with substantial tumor burden and near death (around 45 days after tumor cells inoculation) to ascertain whether these conjugates can induce tumor regression (regression trial). At termination, animals are examined by post-mortem; tumors are dissected and analyzed by: a) immunohistochemistry: PCNA for proliferation, TUNEL for apoptosis, CD-31 for vessel density quantification; b) ELISA of angiogenic growth factors (VEGF, bFGF, TGF-β) to evaluate the effects of the therapy on those angiogenic factors and prognosis markers (kits by R&D); c) FACS analysis and Western blotting to determine the αvβ\n3 \nexpression and phosphorylation changes before and after therapy.\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\nEvaluation of Antitumor Activity of the PGA-PTX−E-[c(RGDfK)\n2\n] Conjugate in Mice Bearing Human Osteosarcoma Tumors\n\n\n \n \n \nIn vivo evaluation of RGD-bearing conjugates was preformed in two methods: First, confocal microscopy analysis of mCherry labeled tumors dissected from mice treated with PGA-E-[c(RGDfk)\n2]\n-OG (SEQ ID NO: 25) revealed high accumulation of the conjugate at the tumor site, as opposed to PGA-c(RADfk)-OG (SEQ ID NO:24) or PGA-OG conjugates (see, \nFIG. 17A\n). Second, the mCherry-labeled-MG63 cells from homogenized tumors treated with PGA-PTX-OG different conjugates were FACS-sorted by ImageStrim. The results show that PGA-PTX−E-[c(RGDfk)\n2\n]-OG (SEQ ID NO:25) efficiently interacts with tumor cells compared with PGA-PTX−c(RADfk)-OG (SEQ ID NO:24) and PGA-PTX-OG (see, \nFIG. 17B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to glucagon analogues and their medical use, for example in the treatment of excess food intake, obesity and excess weight.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nPreproglucagon is a 158 amino acid precursor polypeptide that is differentially processed in the tissues to form a number of structurally related proglucagon-derived peptides, including glucagon (Glu), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), and oxyntomodulin (OXM). These molecules are involved in a wide variety of physiological functions, including glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, gastric emptying and intestinal growth, as well as regulation of food intake.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon is a 29-amino acid peptide that corresponds to amino acids 53 to 81 of pre-proglucagon and has the sequence His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr (SEQ ID NO: 1). Oxyntomodulin (OXM) is a 37 amino acid peptide which includes the complete 29 amino acid sequence of glucagon with an octapeptide carboxyterminal extension (amino acids 82 to 89 of pre-proglucagon, having the sequence Lys-Arg-Asn-Arg-Asn-Asn-Ile-Ala (SEQ ID NO: 2) and termed “intervening peptide 1” or IP-1; the full sequence of human oxyntomodulin is thus His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr-Lys-Arg-Asn-Arg-Asn-Asn-Ile-Ala) (SEQ ID NO: 3). The major biologically active fragment of GLP-1 is produced as a 30-amino acid, C-terminally amidated peptide that corresponds to amino acids 98 to 127 of pre-proglucagon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon helps maintain the level of glucose in the blood by binding to glucagon receptors on hepatocytes, causing the liver to release glucose—stored in the form of glycogen—through glycogenolysis. As these stores become depleted, glucagon stimulates the liver to synthesize additional glucose by gluconeogenesis. This glucose is released into the bloodstream, preventing the development of hypoglycemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOXM is released into the blood in response to food ingestion and in proportion to meal calorie content. OXM has been shown to suppress appetite and inhibit food intake in humans (Cohen et al, Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism, 88, 4696-4701, 2003; WO 2003/022304). In addition to those anorectic effects, which are similar to those of GLP-1, OXM must also affect body weight by another mechanism, since rats treated with oxyntomodulin show less body weight gain than pair-fed rats (Bloom, Endocrinology 2004, 145, 2687). Treatment of obese rodents with OXM also improves their glucose tolerance (Parlevliet et al, Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab, 294, E142-7, 2008) and suppresses body weight gain (WO 2003/022304).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOXM activates both the glucagon receptor and the GLP-1 receptor with a two-fold higher potency for the glucagon receptor over the GLP-1 receptor, but is less potent than native glucagon and GLP-1 on their respective receptors. Glucagon is also capable of activating both receptors, though with a strong preference for the glucagon receptor over the GLP-1 receptor. GLP-1 on the other hand is not capable of activating the glucagon receptor. The mechanism of action of oxyntomodulin is not well understood. In particular, it is not known whether the effects of the hormone are mediated exclusively through the glucagon receptor and the GLP-1 receptor, or through one or more as-yet unidentified receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther peptides have been shown to bind and activate both the glucagon and the GLP-1 receptor (Hjort et al, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 269, 30121-30124, 1994) and to suppress body weight gain and reduce food intake (WO 2006/134340; WO 2007/100535; WO 2008/101017).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObesity, classified is a globally increasing health problem and is associated with various diseases, particularly cardiovascular disease (CVD), \ntype\n 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. As a result, obesity has been found to reduce life expectancy. According to 2005 projections by the World Health Organization there are 400 million adults (age >15) classified as obese worldwide. In the US, obesity is now believed to be the second-leading cause of preventable death after smoking.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rise in obesity drives an increase in diabetes, and approximately 90% of peoble with \ntype\n 2 diabetes may be classified obese. There are 246 million people worldwide with diabetes, and by 2025 it is estimated that 380 million will have diabetes. Many have additional cardiovascular risk factors including high/aberrant LDL and triglycerides and low HDL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeople with diabetes are 2 to 4 times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than people without diabetes, making it the most common complication of diabetes. Cardiovascular disease accounts for about 50% of the mortality in people with diabetes. Young adults with diabetes have rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) 12-40 times higher than those in young adults without diabetes and together with the high incidence and prevalence of obesity and \ntype\n 2 diabetes, the morbidity and mortality rates relating to these metabolic disorders underscore the medical need for efficacious treatment options\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, there is a strong medical need for treating obesity and improving glucose tolerance.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a first aspect, the invention provides a compound having the formula R\n1\n—X—Z—R\n2 \n \n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\nR\n1 \nis H, C\n1-4 \nalkyl, acetyl, formyl, benzoyl or trifluoroacetyl;\n\n\n\n \nR\n2 \nis OH or NH\n2\n;\n\n\n \n \n \nX is a peptide which has the formula I:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 4)\n \n \n \nHis-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Lys-Ala-Ala-His-Asp-Phe-Val-Glu-\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTrp-Leu-Leu-Arg-Ala\n \n \n \n \n \n\nor differs from formula I at up to 4 of the following positions whereby, if different from formula I:\n\n\nthe residue at \nposition\n 2 is selected from: Aib, D-Ser;\n\n\nthe residue at \nposition\n 12 is selected from: Leu, Arg, Dpu, Dpr, Orn;\n\n\nthe residue at position 16 is selected from: Arg, His, Lys, Glu, Asp;\n\n\nthe residue at position 17 is selected from: Arg, Leu, Dpu, Dpr, Orn;\n\n\nthe residue at position 18 is selected from: Arg, Lys, His, Ser, Tyr;\n\n\nthe residue at position 20 is selected from: Gln, Lys, Arg, Glu, Asp;\n\n\nthe residue at position 21 is Glu;\n\n\nthe residue at position 24 is selected from: Gln, Leu, Ala, Lys, Arg, Asp;\n\n\nthe residue at position 27 is selected from: Met, Cys, Lys, Arg, Glu;\n\n\nthe residue at position 28 is selected from: Asn, Ser, Lys, Glu, Ala, Leu, Asp;

By “preventing” is meant inihibiting or reducing weight gain when compared to the absence of treatment, and is not necessarily meant to imply complete cessation of weight gain. The peptides may cause a decrease in food intake and/or increased energy expenditure, resulting in the observed effect on body weight. Independently of their effect on body weight, the compounds of the invention may have a beneficial effect on glucose tolerance and circulating cholesterol levels, being capable of lowering circulating LDL levels and increasing HDL/LDL ratio. Thus the compounds of the invention can be used for direct or indirect therapy of any condition caused or characterised by excess body weight, such as the treatment and/or prevention of obesity, morbid obesity, obesity linked inflammation, obesity linked gallbladder disease, obesity induced sleep apnea. They may also be used for the treatment of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, type-2 diabetes, hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidimia, atherosclerois, arteriosclerosis, coronary heart disease, or stroke. Their effects in these conditions may be as a result of or associated with their effect on body weight, or may be independent thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus the invention provides use of a compound of the invention in the treatment of a condition as described above, in an individual in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a compound of the invention for use in a method of medical treatment, particularly for use in a method of treatment of a condition as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides the use of a compound of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a condition as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs already described, the invention extends to expression vectors comprising the above-described nucleic acid sequence, optionally in combination with sequences to direct its expression, and host cells containing the expression vectors. Preferably the host cells are capable of expressing and secreting the compound of the invention. In a still further aspect, the present invention provides a method of producing the compound, the method comprising culturing the host cells under conditions suitable for expressing the compound and purifying the compound thus produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides a nucleic acid of the invention, an expression vector of the invention, or a host cell capable of expressing and secreting a compound of the invention, for use in a method of medical treatment. It will be understood that the nucleic acid, expression vector and host cells may be used for treatment of any of the disorders described herein which may be treated with the compounds themselves. References to a therapeutic composition comprising a compound of the invention, administration of a compound of the invention, or any therapeutic use thereof, should therefore be construed to encompass the equivalent use of a nucleic acid, expression vector or host cell of the invention except where the context demands otherwise.\n\n\n \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n. Effect of ZP2669 on oral glucose tolerance in db/db mice. Db/db mice were fasted overnight and an initial blood sample (fasting blood glucose level) taken just before administration (i.p.) of vehicles or ZP2669 (45 nmol/kg). Fifteen minutes later an oral dose of glucose (1 g/kg in 5 ml/kg) was given and BG levels were measured at t=30 min, t=60 min, t=120 min and t=240 min. Difference from baseline (t=0) was calculated for each time point and AUC\n0-240 \nmin values were determined. ZP2669 significantly improved glucose tolerance in diabetic db/db mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n. Effect of ZP2669 on food intake in mice. Groups of stratified mice stratified after body weight were fasted overnight and treated with PYY\n3-36 \n(30 nmol/kg) (internal positive control), glucagon (500 nmol/kg), ZP2669 (500 nmol/kg) or vehicle. After one hour pre-weighed food was introduced to the mice and food intake measured by weighing the remaining food after one hour and expressed relative to body weight (mg food/g BW). PYY(3-36) showed an anorectic effect as expected from previous findings. ZP2669 (500 nmol/kg) significantly decreased food intake during the first hour following injection of peptide. Glucagon had no effect on food intake.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n. Effect of 28 day treatment with ZP2669 on body weight in diet induced obese (DIO) mice. C57BI/6 male mice were put on high fat diet (HFD) and treated (b.i.d.; s.c.) with ZP2669 (500 nmol/kg) or vehicle. A non-obese control group maintained on regular chow was treated with vehicle (CHOW) in the same treatment regimen as the DIO groups. Body weights were recorded daily and used to administer the body weight-corrected doses of peptide throughout the study. ZP2669 decreased body weight gain to a level similar to that observed with chow feeding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n. Effect of dual GIuGLP-1 agonist treatment of DIO mice for 4 weeks (b.i.d.) on concentrations of LDL cholesterol.

PBS (pH 7.4) was the vehicle used for OXM, exendin-4 while acetate (pH 5.0) was the vehicle used for ZP2669. The effect of OXM (P=0.2%) and ZP2669 (P=0.05%) were significant compared to vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 6\n: The chemical modification of 17-Lys in compound ZP2872.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThroughout this specification, the conventional one letter and three letter codes for naturally occurring amino acids are used, as well as generally accepted three letter codes for other amino acids, such as Aib (α-aminoisobutyric acid), Orn (ornithine), Dbu (2,4 diaminobutyric acid) and Dpr (2,3-diaminopropanoic acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “native glucagon” refers to native human glucagon having the sequence H-His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr-OH (SEQ ID NO: 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “oxyntomodulin” and “OXM” refer to native human oxyntomodulin having the sequence H-His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr-Lys-Arg-Asn-Arg-Asn-Asn-Ile-Ala-OH (SEQ ID NO: 3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides compounds as defined above. For the avoidance of doubt, in the definitions provided herein, it is generally intended that the sequence of X only differs from Formula I at those positions which are stated to allow variation. Amino acids within the sequence X can be considered to be numbered consecutively from 1 to 29 in the conventional N-terminal to C-terminal direction. Reference to a “position” within X should be construed accordingly, as should reference to positions within native human glucagon and other molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may carry one or more intramolecular bridge within the peptide sequence X. Each such bridge is formed between the side chains of two amino acid residues of X which are typically separated by three amino acids in the linear sequence of X (i.e. between amino acid A and amino acid A-14).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, the bridge may be formed between the side chains of residue pairs 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 17 and 21, 20 and 24, or 24 and 28. The two side chains can be linked to one another through ionic interactions, or by covalent bonds. Thus these pairs of residues may comprise oppositely charged side chains in order to form a salt bridge by ionic interactions. For example, one of the residues may be Glu or Asp, while the other may be Lys or Arg. The pairings of Lys and Glu and Lys and Asp, may also be capable of reacting to form a lactam ring. Likewise, a Tyr and a Glu or a Tyr and a Asp are capable of forming a lactone ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the residues at positions 20 and 24 may be capable of forming an intramolecular bridge. Examples of suitable pairs of residues at these positions include:\n\n\n \n20-Asp, 24-Lys;\n\n\n20-Glu, 24-Lys;\n\n\n20-Asp, 24-Arg;\n\n\n20-Glu, 24-Arg;\n\n\n20-Lys, 24-Asp;\n\n\n20-Arg, 24-Asp;\n\n\n20-Lys, 24-Glu; and\n\n\n20-Arg, 24-Glu.\n\n\n \n \n \nWithout wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that such intramolecular bridges stabilise the alpha helical structure of the molecule and so increase potency and/or selectivity at the GLP-1 receptor and possibly also the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA substitution at position 12 (e.g. of Arg or Leu) may increase potency and/or selectivity at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe presence of a basic amino acid (Arg, Lys or His) at position 16 may enhance the molecule's solubility and may enhance bioavailability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe arginine residues at positions 17 and 18 of native glucagon appear to provide significant selectivity for the glucagon receptor. A number of substitutions at one or more of these positions can increase potency and/or selectivity for both the GLP-1 receptor and the glucagon receptor. Lys, or Leu at position 17 may increase potency at the glucagon receptor. Lys may be particularly effective, especially when there is a negatively charged residue (e.g. Asp) at postion 21, because of the potential to form an intramolecular bridge. A hydrophobic or small hydrophilic residue (e.g. Ala or Ser) at position 18 may increase potency at both GLP-1 and glucagon receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe residues at positions 27, 28 and 29 of native glucagon appear to provide significant selectivity for the glucagon receptor. Substitutions at one, two, or all three of these positions with respect to the native glucagon sequence may increase potency at and/or selectivity for the GLP-1 receptor, potentially without significant reduction of potency at the glucagon receptor. Particular examples include Leu at position 27, Arg at position 28 and Ala at position 29. 28-Arg may be particularly preferred when there is a negatively charged amino acid (e.g. Glu) at position 24 with which it can form an intramolecular bridge, which may increase its effect on potency at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution of the naturally-occurring Met residue at position 27 (e.g. with Leu, Lys or Glu) also reduces the potential for oxidation, so increasing the chemical stability of the compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution of the naturally-occurring Asn residue at position 28 (e.g. by Arg or Leu) also reduces the potential for deamidation in acidic solution, so increasing the chemical stability of the compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPotency and/or selectivity at the GLP-1 receptor may also be increased by introducing residues that are likely to form an amphipathic helical structure, potentially without significant loss of potency at the glucagon receptor. This may be achieved by introduction of charged residues at one or more of positions 16, 20, 24, and 28. Thus the residues of positions 24 and 28 may all be charged, the residues at positions 20, 24, and 28 may all be charged, or the residues at positions 16, 20, 24, and 28 may all be charged. For example, the residue at position 20 may be His or Arg, particularly His. The residue at position 24 may be Glu, Asp Lys or Arg, particularly Glu. The residue at position 28 may be Arg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution of one or both of the naturally-occurring Gin residues at positions 20 and 24 also reduces the potential for deamidation in acidic solution, so increasing the chemical stability of the compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound may comprise a C-terminal peptide sequence Z of 1-20 amino acids, for example to stabilise the conformation and/or secondary structure of the glucagon analogue peptide, and/or to make the glucagon analogue peptide more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis, e.g. as described in WO99/46283.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen present, Z represents a peptide sequence of 1-20 amino acid residues, e.g. in the range of 1-15, more preferably in the range of 1-10 in particular in the range of 1-7 amino acid residues, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 amino acid residues, such as 6 amino acid residues. Each of the amino acid residues in the peptide sequence Z may independently be selected from Ala, Leu, Ser, Thr, Tyr, Cys, Glu, Lys, Arg, Dbu (2,4 diaminobutyric acid), Dpr (2,3-diaminopropanoic acid) and Orn (ornithine). Preferably, the amino acid residues are selected from Ser, Thr, Tyr, Cys, Glu, Lys, Arg, Dbu, Dpr and Orn, more preferably may be selected exclusively from Glu, Lys, and Cys. The above-mentioned amino acids may have either D- or L-configuration, but preferably have an L-configuration. Particularly preferred sequences Z are sequences of four, five, six or seven consecutive lysine residues (i.e. Lys\n3\n, Lys\n4\n, Lys\n6\n, Lys\n6 \nor Lys\n7\n), and particularly five or six consecutive lysine residues. Other exemplary sequences of Z are shown in WO 01/04156. Alternatively the C-terminal residue of the sequence Z may be a Cys residue. This may assist in modification (e.g. PEGylation) of the compound. In such embodiments, the sequence Z may, for example, be only one amino acid in length (i.e. Z=Cys) or may be two, three, four, five, six or even more amino acids in length. The other amino acids therefore serve as a spacer between the peptide X and the terminal Cys residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide sequence Z has no more than 25% sequence identity with the corresponding sequence of the IP-1 portion of human OXM (which has the sequence Lys-Arg-Asn-Arg-Asn-Asn-Ile-Ala).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity” of a given peptide or polypeptide sequence with respect to another polypeptide sequence (e.g. IP-1) is calculated as the percentage of amino acid residues in the given peptide sequence that are identical with corresponding amino acid residues in the corresponding sequence of that other polypeptide when the two are aligned with one another, introducing gaps for optimal alignment if necessary. % identity values may be determined by WU-BLAST-2 (Altschul et al., Methods in Enzymology, 266:460-480 (1996)). WU-BLAST-2 uses several search parameters, most of which are set to the default values. The adjustable parameters are set with the following values: overlap span=1, overlap fraction=0.125, word threshold (T)=11. A % amino acid sequence identity value is determined by the number of matching identical residues as determined by WU-BLAST-2, divided by the total number of residues of the reference sequence (gaps introduced by WU-BLAST-2 into the reference sequence to maximize the alignment score being ignored), multiplied by 100.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, when Z is aligned optimally with the 8 amino acids of IP-1, it has no more than two amino acids which are identical with the corresponding amino acids of IP-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more of the amino acid side chains in the compound of the invention may be conjugated to a lipophilic substituent. The lipophilic substituent may be covalently bonded to an atom in the amino acid side chain, or alternatively may be conjugated to the amino acid side chain by a spacer. The amino acid may be part of the peptide X, or part of the peptide Z.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that the lipophilic substituent binds albumin in the blood stream, thus shielding the compounds of the invention from enzymatic degradation which can enhance the half-life of the compounds. The spacer, when present, is used to provide a spacing between the compound and the lipophilic substituent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lipophilic substituent may be attached to the amino acid side chain or to the spacer via an ester, a sulphonyl ester, a thioester, an amide or a sulphonamide. Accordingly it will be understood that preferably the lipophilic substituent includes an acyl group, a sulphonyl group, an N atom, an O atom or an S atom which forms part of the ester, sulphonyl ester, thioester, amide or sulphonamide. Preferably, an acyl group in the lipophilic substituent forms part of an amide or ester with the amino acid side chain or the spacer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lipophilic substituent may include a hydrocarbon chain having 4 to 30 C atoms. Preferably it has at least 8 or 12 C atoms, and preferably it has 24 C atoms or fewer, or 20 C atoms or fewer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hydrocarbon chain may be linear or branched and may be saturated or unsaturated. It will be understood that the hydrocarbon chain is preferably substituted with a moiety which forms part of the attachment to the amino acid side chain or the spacer, for example an acyl group, a sulphonyl group, an N atom, an O atom or an S atom. Most preferably the hydrocarbon chain is substituted with acyl, and accordingly the hydrocarbon chain may be part of an alkanoyl group, for example palmitoyl, caproyl, lauroyl, myristoyl or stearoyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the lipophilic substituent may have the formula shown below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA may be, for example, an acyl group, a sulphonyl group, NH, N-alkyl, an O atom or an S atom, preferably acyl. n is an integer from 3 to 29, preferably at least 7 or at least 11, and preferably 23 or less, more preferably 19 or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hydrocarbon chain may be further substituted. For example, it may be further substituted with up to three substituents selected from NH\n2\n, OH and COOH. If the hydrocarbon chain is further substituted, preferably it is further substituted with only one substituent. Alternatively or additionally, the hydrocarbon chain may include a cycloalkane or heterocycloalkane, for example as shown below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably the cycloalkane or heterocycloalkane is a six-membered ring. Most preferably, it is piperidine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the lipophilic substituent may be based on a cyclopentanophenanthrene skeleton, which may be partially or fully unsaturated, or saturated. The carbon atoms in the skeleton each may be substituted with Me or OH. For example, the lipophilic substituent may be cholyl, deoxycholyl or lithocholyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, the lipohphilic substituent may be conjugated to the amino acid side chain by a spacer. When present, the spacer is attached to the lipophilic substituent and to the amino acid side chain. The spacer may be attached to the lipophilic substituent and to the amino acid side chain independently by an ester, a sulphonyl ester, a thioester, an amide or a sulphonamide. Accordingly, it may include two moieties independently selected from acyl, sulphonyl, an N atom, an O atom or an S atom. The spacer may have the formula:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein B and D are each independently selected from acyl, suiphonyl, NH, N-alkyl, an O atom or an S atom, preferably from acyl and NH. Preferably, n is an integer from 1 to 10, preferably from 1 to 5. The spacer may be further substituted with one or more substituents selected from C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n0-6 \nalkyl amine, C\n0-6 \nalkyl hydroxy and C\n0-6 \nalkyl carboxy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the spacer may have two or more repeat units of the formula above. B, D and n are each selected independently for each repeat unit. Adjacent repeat units may be covalently attached to each other via their respective B and D moieties. For example, the B and D moieties of the adjacent repeat units may together form an ester, a sulphonyl ester, a thioester, an amide or a sulphonamide. The free B and D units at each end of the spacer are attached to the amino acid side chain and the lipophilic substituent as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably the spacer has five or fewer, four or fewer or three or fewer repeat units. Most preferably the spacer has two repeat units, or is a single unit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe spacer (or one or more of the repeat units of the spacer, if it has repeat units) may be, for example, a natural or unnatural amino acid. It will be understood that for amino acids having functionalised side chains, B and/or D may be a moiety within the side chain of the amino acid. The spacer may be any naturally occurring or unnatural amino acid. For example, the spacer (or one or more of the repeat units of the spacer, if it has repeat units) may be Gly, Pro, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Met, Cys, Phe, Tyr, Trp, His, Lys, Arg, Gin, Asn, α-Glu, γ-Glu, Asp, Ser Thr, Gaba, Aib, β-Ala, 5-aminopentanoyl, 6-aminohexanoyl, 7-aminoheptanoyl, 8-aminooctanoyl, 9-aminononanoyl or 10-aminodecanoyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the spacer may be a single amino acid selected from γ-Glu, Gaba, b-Ala and α-Gly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lipophilic substituent may be conjugated to any amino acid side chain in the compounds of the invention. Preferably, the amino acid side chain includes an carboxy, hydroxyl, thiol, amide or amine group, for forming an ester, a sulphonyl ester, a thioester, an amide or a sulphonamide with the spacer or lipophilic substituent. For example, the lipophilic substituent may be conjugated to Asn, Asp, Glu, Gln, His, Lys, Arg, Ser, Thr, Tyr, Trp, Cys or Dbu, Dpr or Orn. Preferably, the lipophilic substituent is conjugated to Lys. However, any amino acid shown as Lys in the formulae provided herein may be replaced by Dbu, Dpr or Orn where a lipophilic substituent is added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn example lipophilic substituent and spacer is shown in the formula below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHere, a Lys from the compound of the present invention (e.g. from X) is covalently attached to γ-Glu (the spacer) by via an amide moiety. Palmitoyl is covalently attached to the γ-Glu spacer via an amide moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment of the present invention, the compound comprises or consists of peptide X having the sequence:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 17)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHSQGTFTSDYSKYLDSK(isoGlu(Palm))AAHDFVEWLLRA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively or additionally, one or more amino acid side chains in the compound of the invention may be conjugated to a polymeric moiety, for example, in order to increase solubility and/or half-life in vivo (e.g. in plasma) and/or bioavailability. Such modification is also known to reduce clearance (e.g. renal clearance) of therapeutic proteins and peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymeric moiety is preferably water soluble (amphiphilic or hydrophilic), non-toxic, and pharmaceutically inert. Suitable polymeric moieties include polyethylene glycol (PEG), homo- or co-polymers of PEG, a monomethyl-substituted polymer of PEG (mPEG), or polyoxyethylene glycerol (POG). See, for example, \nInt. J. Hematology \n68:1 (1998); \nBioconjugate Chem. \n6:150 (1995); and \nCrit. Rev. Therap. Drug Carrier Sys. \n9:249 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable polymeric moieties include poly-amino acids such as poly-lysine, poly-aspartic acid and poly-glutamic acid (see for example Gombotz, et al. (1995), Bioconjugate Chem., vol. 6: 332-351; Hudecz, et al. (1992), Bioconjugate Chem., vol. 3, 49-57; Tsukada, et al. (1984), J. Natl. Cancer Inst., vol 73,: 721-729; and Pratesi, et al. (1985), Br. J. Cancer, vol. 52: 841-848).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymeric moiety may be straight-chain or branched. It may have a molecular weight of 500-40,000 Da, for example 500-10,000 Da, 1000-5000 Da, 10,000-20,000 Da, or 20,000-40,000 Da.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound may comprise two or more such moieties, in which case the total molecular weight of all such moieties will generally fall within the ranges provided above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymeric moiety may be coupled (by covalent linkage) to an amino, carboxyl or thiol group of an amino acid side chain. Preferred examples are the thiol group of Cys residues and the epsilon amino group of Lys residues, and the carboxyl groups of Asp and Glu residues may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled reader will be well aware of suitable techniques which can be used to perform the coupling reaction. For example, a PEG moiety carrying a methoxy group can be coupled to a Cys thiol group by a maleimido linkage using regents commercially available from Nektar Therapeutics AL. See also WO 2008/101017, and the references cited above for details of suitable chemistry.\n\n\n \nPeptide Synthesis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention may be manufactured either by standard synthetic methods, recombinant expression systems; or any other state of the art method. Thus the glucagon analogues may be synthesized in a number of ways including for example, a method which comprises:\n\n\n \n \n(a) synthesizing the peptide by means of solid phase or liquid phase methodology either stepwise or by fragment assembling and isolation and purification of the final peptide product;\n\n\n(b) expressing a nucleic acid construct that encodes the peptide in a host cell and recovering the expression product from the host cell culture; or\n\n\n(c) effecting cell-free in vitro expression of a nucleic acid construct that encodes the peptide and recovering the expression product;\n\n\nor any combination of methods of (a), (b), and (c) to obtain fragments of the peptide, subsequently ligating the fragments to obtain the peptide, and recovering the peptide.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is preferred to synthesize the analogues of the invention by means of solid phase or liquid phase peptide synthesis. In this context, reference is given to WO 98/11125 and, amongst many others, Fields, G B et al., 2002, “Principles and practice of solid-phase peptide synthesis”. In: Synthetic Peptides (2nd Edition) and the Examples herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor recombinant expression, the nucleic acid fragments of the invention will normally be inserted in suitable vectors to form cloning or expression vectors carrying the nucleic acid fragments of the invention; such novel vectors are also part of the invention. The vectors can, depending on purpose and type of application, be in the form of plasmids, phages, cosmids, mini-chromosomes, or virus, but also naked DNA which is only expressed transiently in certain cells is an important vector. Preferred cloning and expression vectors (plasmid vectors) of the invention are capable of autonomous replication, thereby enabling high copy-numbers for the purposes of high-level expression or high-level replication for subsequent cloning.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general outline, an expression vector comprises the following features in the direction and in operable linkage: a promoter for driving expression of the nucleic acid fragment of the invention, optionally a nucleic acid sequence encoding a leader peptide enabling secretion (to the extracellular phase or, where applicable, into the periplasma), the nucleic acid fragment encoding the peptide of the invention, and optionally a nucleic acid sequence encoding a terminator. They may comprise additional features such as selectable markers and origins of replication. When operating with expression vectors in producer strains or cell lines it may be preferred that the vector is capable of integrating into the host cell genome. The skilled person is very familiar with suitable vectors and is able to design one according to their specific requirements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe vectors of the invention are used to transform host cells to produce the compound of the invention. Such transformed cells, which are also part of the invention, can be cultured cells or cell lines used for propagation of the nucleic acid fragments and vectors of the invention, or used for recombinant production of the peptides of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred transformed cells of the invention are micro-organisms such as bacteria (such as the species \nEscherichia \n(e.g. \nE. coli\n), \nBacillus \n(e.g. \nBacillus subtilis\n), \nSalmonella\n, or \nMycobacterium \n(preferably non-pathogenic, e.g. \nM. bovis \nBCG), yeasts (such as \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n), and protozoans. Alternatively, the transformed cells may be derived from a multicellular organism, i.e. it may be fungal cell, an insect cell, a plant cell, or a mammalian cell. For the purposes of cloning and/or optimised expression it is preferred that the transformed cell is capable of replicating the nucleic acid fragment of the invention. Cells expressing the nucleic fragment are useful embodiments of the invention; they can be used for small-scale or large-scale preparation of the peptides of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen producing the peptide of the invention by means of transformed cells, it is convenient, although far from essential, that the expression product is secreted into the culture medium.\n\n\n \nEfficacy\n\n\n \n \n \nBinding of the relevant compounds to GLP-1 or glucagon (Glu) receptors may be used as an indication of agonist activity, but in general it is preferred to use a biological assay which measures intracellular signalling caused by binding of the compound to the relevant receptor. For example, activation of the glucagon receptor by a glucagon agonist will stimulate cellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation. Similarly, activation of the GLP-1 receptor by a GLP-1 agonist will stimulate cellular cAMP formation. Thus, production of cAMP in suitable cells expressing one of these two receptors can be used to monitor the relevant receptor activity. Use of a suitable pair of cell types, each expressing one receptor but not the other, can hence be used to determine agonist activity towards both types of receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled person will be aware of suitable assay fomats, and examples are provided below. The GLP-1 receptor and/or the glucagon receptor may have the sequence of the receptors as described in the examples. For example, the assays may make use the human glucagon receptor (Glucagon-R) having primary accession number GI: 4503947 and/or the human glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) having primary accession number GI:166795283. (Where sequences of precursor proteins are referred to, it should of course be understood that assays may make use of the mature protein, lacking the signal sequence).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEC\n50 \nvalues may be used as a numerical measure of agonist potency at a given receptor. An EC\n50 \nvalue is a measure of the concentration of a compound required to achieve half of that compound's maximal activity in a particular assay. Thus, for example, a compound having EC\n50\n-[GLP-1R] lower than the EC\n50\n-[GLP-1R] of native glucagon in a particular assay may be considered to have higher potency at the GLP-1R than glucagon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds described in this specification are typically Glu-GLP-1 dual agonists, i.e. they are capable of stimulating cAMP formation at both the glucagon receptor and the GLP-1 receptor. The stimulation of each receptor can be measured in independent assays and afterwards compared to each other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy comparing the EC\n50 \nvalue for the glucagon receptor (EC\n50 \n[Glucagon-R]) with the EC\n50 \nvalue for the GLP-1 receptor, (EC\n50 \n[GLP-1R]) for a given compound the relative glucagon selectivity (%) of that compound can be found:\n\n\n \n \n \nRelative Glucagon-R selectivity[Compound]=(1/EC\n50\n[Glucagon-R])×100/(1/EC\n50\n[Glucagon-R]+1/EC\n50\n[GLP−1R])\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe relative GLP-1R selectivity can likewise be found:\n\n\n \n \n \nRelative GLP-1R selectivity[Compound]=(1/EC\n50\n[GLP-1R])×100/(1/EC\n50\n[Glucagon-R]+1/EC\n50\n[GLP-1R])\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound's relative selectivity allows its effect on the GLP-1 or glucagon receptor to be compared directly to its effect on the other receptor. For example, the higher a compound's relative GLP-1 selectivity is, the more effective that compound is on the GLP-1 receptor as compared to the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing the assays described below, we have found the relative GLP-1 selectivity for human glucagon to be approximately 5%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention have a higher relative GLP-1R selectivity than human glucagon. Thus, for a particular level of glucagon-R agonist activity, the compound will display a higher level of GLP-1R agonist activity (i.e. greater potency at the GLP-1 receptor) than glucagon. It will be understood that the absolute potency of a particular compound at the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors may be higher, lower or approximately equal to that of native human glucagon, as long as the appropriate relative GLP-1R selectivity is achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNevertheless, the compounds of this invention may have a lower EC\n50 \n[GLP-1R] than human glucagon. The compounds may have a lower EC\n50\n-[GLP-1-R] than glucagon while maintaining an EC\n50 \n[Glucagon-R] that is less than 10-fold higher than that of human glucagon, less than 5-fold higher than that of human glucagon, or less than 2-fold higher than that of human glucagon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may have an EC\n50 \n[Glucagon-R] that is less than two-fold that of human glucagon. The compounds may have an EC\n50 \n[Glucagon-R] that is less than two-fold that of human glucagon and have an EC\n50 \n[GLP-1R] that is less than half that of human glucagon, less than a fifth of that of human glucagon, or less than a tenth of that of human glucagon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe relative GLP-1 selectivity of the compounds may be between 5% and 95%. For example, the compounds may have a relative selectivity of 5-20%, 10-30%, 20-50%, 30-70%, or 50-80%; or of 30-50%, 40-60,%, 50-70% or 75-95%.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Uses\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may provide an attractive treatment option for obesity and metabolic \ndiseases including type\n 2 diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabetes mellitus, often referred to simply as diabetes, is a syndrome of disordered metabolism, usually due to a combination of hereditary and environmental causes, resulting in abnormally high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood glucose levels are controlled by the hormone insulin made in the beta cells of the pancreas. Diabetes develops due to destruction of insulin producing pancreatic beta-cells (in type 1 diabetes) or resistance to the effects of insulin (in gestational diabetes) followed by beta cell loss (in \ntype\n 2 diabetes). Both types of diabetes lead to hyperglycemia, which largely causes the acute signs of diabetes: excessive urine production, resulting compensatory thirst and increased fluid intake, blurred vision, unexplained weight loss, lethargy, and changes in energy metabolism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolic syndrome is characterized by a group of metabolic risk factors in one person. They include abdominal obesity (excessive fat tissue around the abdominal internal organs), atherogenic dyslipidemia (blood fat disorders including high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and/or high LDL cholesterol, which foster plaque buildup in artery walls), elevated blood pressure (hypertension), insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, prothrombotic state (e.g. high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in the blood), and proinflammatory state (e.g., elevated C-reactive protein in the blood).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndividuals with the metabolic syndrome are at increased risk of \ntype\n 2 diabetes as well as coronary heart disease and other diseases related to other manifestations of arteriosclerosis (e.g., stroke and peripheral vascular disease). The dominant underlying risk factors for this syndrome appear to be abdominal obesity and insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, prothrombotic state (e.g. high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in the blood), and proinflammatory state (e.g., elevated C-reactive protein in the blood).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the compounds of the invention act as GluGLP-1 dual agonists. The dual agonist combines the effect of glucagon on fat metabolism with the effects of GLP-1 on blood glucose levels and food intake. They might therefore act in a synergistic fashion to accelerate elimination of excessive fat deposition, induce sustainable weight loss, and directly decrease morbid glucose levels to normal levels, without the risk of hypoglycemia, which is associated with concomitant use of GLP-1 agonists and sulphonylurea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synergetic effect of dual GluGLP-1 agonists may also result in reduction of cardiovascular risk factors such as high cholesterol and LDL, as well as an improvement in glucose tolerance, which may be entirely independent of their effect on body weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can therefore be used as pharmaceutical agents for preventing weight gain, promoting weight loss, reducing excess body weight or treating obesity (e.g. by control of appetite, feeding, food intake, calorie intake, and/or energy expenditure), including morbid obesity, as well as associated diseases and health conditions including but not limited to obesity linked inflammation, obesity linked gallbladder disease and obesity induced sleep apnea. The compounds of the invention may also be used for treatment of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, \ntype\n 2 diabetes, hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidimia, atherosclerois, arteriosclerosis, coronary heart disease and stroke. These are all conditions which can be associated with obesity. However, the effects of the compounds of the invention on these conditions may be mediated in whole or in part via an effect on body weight, or may be independent thereof.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention, or salts thereof, may be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions prepared for storage or administration, which typically comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, or a salt thereof, in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention will depend on the route of administration, the type of mammal being treated, and the physical characteristics of the specific mammal under consideration. These factors and their relationship to determining this amount are well known to skilled practitioners in the medical arts. This amount and the method of administration can be tailored to achieve optimal efficacy, and may depend on such factors as weight, diet, concurrent medication and other factors, well known to those skilled in the medical arts. The dosage sizes and dosing regimen most appropriate for human use may be guided by the results obtained by the present invention, and may be confirmed in properly designed clinical trials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn effective dosage and treatment protocol may be determined by conventional means, starting with a low dose in laboratory animals and then increasing the dosage while monitoring the effects, and systematically varying the dosage regimen as well. Numerous factors may be taken into consideration by a clinician when determining an optimal dosage for a given subject. Such considerations are known to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985). For example, sterile saline and phosphate-buffered saline at slightly acidic or physiological pH may be used. pH buffering agents may be phosphate, citrate, acetate, tris/hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS), N-Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-3-aminopropanesulphonic acid (TAPS), ammonium bicarbonate, diethanolamine, histidine, which is a preferred buffer, arginine, lysine, or acetate or mixtures thereof. The term further encompases any agents listed in the US Pharmacopeia for use in animals, including humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to the salt of the compounds. Salts include pharmaceutically acceptable salts such as acid addition salts and basic salts. Examples of acid addition salts include hydrochloride salts, citrate salts and acetate salts. Examples of basic salts include salts where the cation is selected from alkali metals, such as sodium and potassium, alkaline earth metals, such as calcium, and ammonium ions \n+\nN(R\n3\n)\n3\n(R\n4\n), where R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nindependently designates optionally substituted C\n1-6\nalkyl, optionally substituted C\n2-6\n-alkenyl, optionally substituted aryl, or optionally substituted heteroaryl. Other examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are described in “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences”, 17th edition. Ed. Alfonso R. Gennaro (Ed.), Mark Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., U.S.A., 1985 and more recent editions, and in the Encyclopaedia of Pharmaceutical Technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Treatment” is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired clinical results. For the purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. “Treatment” can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. “Treatment” is an intervention performed with the intention of preventing the development or altering the pathology of a disorder. Accordingly, “treatment” refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those in which the disorder is to be prevented\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be in unit dosage form. In such form, the composition is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of the preparations, for example, packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. The unit dosage form can also be a capsule, cachet, or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these packaged forms: It may be provided in single dose injectable form, for example in the form of a pen. Compositions may be formulated for any suitable route and means of administration. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents include those used in formulations suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, and transdermal) administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubcutaneous or transdermal modes of administration may be particularly suitable for the compounds described herein.\n\n\n \nCombination Therapy\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compound of the invention may be administered as part of a combination therapy with an agent for treatment of diabetes, obesity or hypertension.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn such cases, the two active agents may be given together or separately, and as part of the same pharmaceutical formulation or as separate formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus the compound of the invention (or the salt thereof) can be used in combination with an anti-diabetic agent including but not limited to metformin, a sulfonylurea, a glinide, a DPP-IV inhibitor, a glitazone, or insulin. In a preferred embodiment the compound or salt thereof is used in combination with insulin, DPP-IV inhibitor, sulfonylurea or metformin, particularly sulfonylurea or metformin, for achieving adequate glycemic control. In an even more preferred embodiment the compound or salt thereof is used in combination with insulin or an insulin analogue for achieving adequate glycemic control. Examples of insulin analogues include but are not limited to Lantus, Novorapid, Humalog, Novomix, and Actraphane HM\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound or salt thereof can further be used in combination with an anti-obesity agent including but not limited to a glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 agonist, peptide YY or analogue thereof, cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist, lipase inhibitor, \nmelanocortin receptor\n 4 agonist, or melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe analogue compound or salt thereof can be used in combination with an anti-hypertension agent including but not limited to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker, diuretics, beta-blocker, or calcium channel blocker.\n\n\n \nMethods\n\n\nGeneral Synthesis of Glucagon Analogues\n\n\n \n \n \nSolid phase peptide synthesis was performed as SPPS on a microwave assisted synthesizer using standard Fmoc strategy in NMP on a polystyrene resin (TentaGel S Ram). HATU was used as coupling reagent together with DIPEA as base. Piperidine (20% in NMP) was used for deprotection. Pseudoprolines: Fmoc-Phe-Thr(.Psi. Me, Me pro)-OH and Fmoc-Asp-Ser(.Psi., Me, Me pro)-OH (purchased from NovaBiochem) were used where applicable.\n\n\n \nCleavage:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe crude peptide was cleaved from the resin by treatment with 95/2.5/2.5% (v/v) TFA/TIS/water at r.t. for 2 h. For peptides with a methionine in the sequence a mixture of 95/5% (v/v) TFA/EDT was used. Most of the TFA was removed at reduced pressure and the crude peptide was precipitated and washed with diethylether and allowed to dry to constant weight at ambient temperature.\n\n\n \nHPLC Purification of the Crude Peptide\n\n\n \n \n \nThe crude peptides were purified by standard reverse phase HPLC on a PerSeptive Biosystems VISION Workstation. VISION 3.0 software was used for instrument control and data acquisition. The peptides were analysed using MS and purified to greater than 90% as determined by HPLC.\n\n\n \nGeneral Synthesis of Acylated Glucagon Analogues\n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptide backbone is synthesized as described above for the general synthesis of glucagon analogues, with the exception that it is acylated on the side chain of a lysine residue with the peptide still attached to the resin and fully protected on the side chain groups, except the epsilon-amine on the lysine to be acylated. The lysine to be acylated is incorporated with the use of Fmoc-Lys(ivDde)-OH. The N-terminal of the peptide is protected with a Boc group using Boc\n2\nO in NMP. While the peptide is still attached to the resin, the ivDde protecting group is selectively cleaved using 2% hydrazine hydrate in NMP. The unprotected lysine side chain is then first coupled with a spacer amino acid like Fmoc-Glu-OtBu, which is deprotected with piperidine and acylated with a fatty acid using standard peptide coupling methodology as described above.

The DNA encoding the Glucagon-R or the GLP-1-R was amplified by PCR using primers encoding terminal restriction sites for subcloning. The 5′-end primers additionally encoded a near Kozak consensus sequence to ensure efficient translation. The fidelity of the DNA encoding the Glucagon-R and the GLP-1-R was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The PCR products encoding the Glucagon-R or the GLP-1-R were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector containing a neomycin (G418) resistance marker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mammalian expression vectors encoding the Glucagon-R or the GLP-1-R were transfected into HEK293 cells by a standard calcium phosphate transfection method. 48 hr after transfection cells were seeded for limited dilution cloning and selected with 1 mg/ml G418 in the culture medium. Three weeks later 12 surviving colonies of Glucagon-R and GLP-1-R expressing cells were picked, propagated and tested in the Glucagon-R and GLP-1-R efficacy assays as described below. One Glucagon-R expressing clone and one GLP-1-R expressing clone were chosen for compound profiling.\n\n\n \nGlucagon Receptor and GLP-1-Receptor Efficacy Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nHEK293 cells expressing the human Glucagon-R, or human GLP-1-R were seeded at 40,000 cells per well in 96-well microtiter plates coated with 0.01% poly-L-lysine and grown for 1 day in culture in 100 μl growth medium. On the day of analysis, growth medium was removed and the cells washed once with 200 μl Tyrode buffer. Cells were incubated in 100 μl Tyrode buffer containing increasing concentrations of test peptides, 100 μM IBMX, and 6 mM glucose for 15 min at 37° C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 25 μl 0.5 M HCl and incubated on ice for 60 min. The cAMP content was estimated using the FlashPlate® cAMP kit from Perkin-Elmer. EC\n50 \nand relative efficacies compared to reference compounds (glucagon and GLP-1) were estimated by computer aided curve fitting.\n\n\n \nLipolysis in Primary Rat Adipocytes\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of glucagon analogues on lipolysis was assesed in primary cultures of rat adipocytes. Adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat dissected from normal young adult Sprague-Dawley rats. The fat lumps were minced, incubated and shaken (220 rpm) with collagenase (1 mg/ml) in Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 4% BSA (KRB-BSA) for 60 minutes at 37° C. The suspension was filtered through a nylon filter (160 μm pore size) and the filtrate centrifuged at 200×g for 3 min. The subjacent medium beneath the upper floating layer of adipocytes was removed with a Pasteur-pipette. The adipocytes were washed 3 times in KRB-BSA buffer by re-suspension and centrifugation. The adipocytes were re-suspended in KRB-BSA, mixed, incubated in and shaken with test compounds in 96-deep well plates (50,000 cells/well) in a total volume of 1 ml at 37° C. for 60 min. The plates were placed on ice for at least 10 min after incubation followed by centrifugation at 200×g for 3 min. 300 μl of the buffer beneath the adipocyte layer were collected in a 96-deep well plate. This process was repeated two more times and the 3 extracts collected from each culture pooled together. The glycerol formed by the lipolysis in the adipocyte cultures was measured by adding free glycerol reagent (200 μl) to aliquots (25 μl) of adipocyte extract, incubate at room temperature for 15 min and measure the absorbance at 540 nm.\n\n\n \n \nOral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) in db/db Mice\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDb/db mice were fasted overnight and an initial blood sample (fasting blood glucose level) taken just before administration (i.p.) of vehicle (Acetate buffer, 20 mM acetic acid, 250 mM mannitol, pH 5.0) or the test compound ZP2669 (SEQ ID NO: 4) (45 nmol/kg in acetate buffer). The animals were kept fasted during the experiment to prevent confounding food intake. Fifteen minutes later an oral dose of glucose (1 g/kg in 5 ml/kg) was given and BG levels were measured at t=30 min, t=60 min, t=120 min and t=240 min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifference from baseline (t=0) was calculated for each time point and AUC\n0-240 min \nvalues were determined. Statistical analyses of AUC values by one-way ANOVA and Dunnetts post-hoc analyses were performed with \nGraphPad Prism version\n 4. Differences were considered significant at the p<0.05 level.\n\n\n \nFood Intake in Normal Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nOne week before study C57BI/6 mice (8 weeks) (N=9-12 animals in each group) were conditioned to treatment by daily injections (s.c.) of 0.2 ml vehicle and acclimatized to handling by weighing them twice a week. Mice were stratified one day before start of experiment into groups with similar body weight (BW). Groups of stratified mice were fasted overnight treated (10 μl test solution/g BW, s.c.) with PYY\n3-36 \n(30 nmol/kg)(internal positive control), glucagon (500 nmol/kg) and ZP2669 (SEQ ID NO: 4) (500 nmol/kg) or vehicle. After one hour pre-weighed food was introduced to the mice and food intake measured by weighing the remaining food after one hour and expressed relative to body weight (mg food/g BW). Statistical analyses of food intake data by one-way ANOVA and Dunnetts post-hoc analyses were performed with \nGraphPad Prism version\n 4. Differences were considered significant at the p<0.05 level.\n\n\n \n \nEffects of 28 Day Treatment of Diet Induced Obese (D10) Mice with ZP2669 (SEQ ID NO: 4) Agonist on Body Weight Gain and Plasma Cholesterols\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour weeks before drug treatments, C57BI/6 male mice (7 weeks)) (N=10-12 animals in each group) were put on high fat diet (HFD) and their day-night cycle reversed with lights On/Off at 2000/0800 hour. Experimental animals were conditioned to treatment by daily injections (s.c.) of 0.1 ml vehicle and acclimatized to handling by weighing them twice a week one week before start of drug administrations. The day before start of experiment, mice were stratified into groups with similar body weight (BW) and the next day groups of stratified mice were treated (b.i.d.; s.c.) with ZP2669 (SEQ ID NO: 4) (500 nmol/kg) or vehicle (Acetate-buffer). ZP2669 (SEQ ID NO: 4) was given in isotonic acetate buffer (pH 4.8; 2.5 μl/g BW). A non-obese control group maintained on regular chow was treated with vehicle in the same treatment regime as the DIO groups. Body weights were recorded daily and used to administer the body weight-corrected doses of peptide throughout the study. Animals were fasted overnight before sacrifice. An eye blood sample (0.6 ml EDTA) was obtained the following morning immediately before cervical dislocation. Blood plasma samples were stored at −80° C. until analyzed for cholesterol, HDL and LDL using commercially available kits. Body weight gains throughout the treatment period were calculated for each animal by subtracting its weight at the initiation of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effects of treatment on body weight gain and cholesterols were assessed by 2-way ANOVA with repeated measures and Bonferoni post-hoc analyses, using \nGraphPad Prism version\n 4. Differences were considered significant at the p<0.05 level.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nPeptide Stability\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults for recovery measured by RP-HPLC after stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZP\n\n\nRecovery (%)\n\n\nRecovery (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nSolid peptide\n\n\n0.1M HCl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon\n\n\n91\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2669\n\n\n98\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of incubation in HCl stress solutions are shown in table 2.

The potency of ZP2668 (SEQ ID NO: 5) was in the same order of magnitude as OXM. The finding that 4 weeks treatment of DIO mice with ZP2669 (SEQ ID NO: 4) significantly decreased fat deposition concurs with the effect observed (Table 4) on lipid metabolism in primary adipocyte cultures.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nEffect on Oral Glucose Tolerance in db/db Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nZP2669 (SEQ ID NO: 4) significantly (P<0.01) improved glucose tolerance measured during an OGTT in diabetic db/db mice (\nFIG. 1\n).
