No. 60/884,489, filed Jan. 11, 2007, and also claims benefit of U.S. provisional application U.S. Ser. No. 60/884,504, filed Jan. 11, 2007, each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates generally to compounds, compositions and methods for treatment of cancer.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nCancer, irrespective of its pathogenesis, is characterized by uncontrolled growth and survival of cells. Common to most forms of cancer is an error in the cellular mechanism responsible for balancing cell survival and cell death.\n\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 20% of all lung cancers. The 5-year survival rate for small cell lung cancer is about 15%.\n\n\nCertain thiosemicarbazones, such as those disclosed in British Patent No. 1,026,401, International Patent Application No. WO2004/066725, Japanese Patent No. 56-95161 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,927,843, have been used to treat, for example, a variety of viruses. Other thiosemicarbazones, however, may be used to treat cancer. French Patent No. 2,879,194 is directed to certain thiosemicarbazones that may be used in the treatment or prevention of cancer, in dermatological treatment, in the treatment of cardiovascular and immune diseases, lipid-metabolism related diseases and modulate PPAR's. International Patent Application No. WO 2006/009765 is directed to specific thiosemicarbazones that may be used in anti-cancer therapy that mitigates the development of drug resistance. U.S. Pat. No. 4,593,027 is directed to hydrazone derivatives that may be used as a chemotherapeutic.\n\n\nThere is a need, however, for new therapeutic drug treatments to treat cancers more efficiently, and lung cancer in particular. Current treatment regimes for small cell lung cancer involve surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. While timely surgery can be curative, new therapies are necessary when timely surgery is not an option.\n\n\nAll patents and patent applications referenced herein are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn accordance with an aspect, there is provided a compound of Formula I:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nand/or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, tautomer, optical isomer, or combination thereof; wherein:\n\n\n\nR\n1 \nand R\n2 \ntogether form a substituted or unsubstituted polycyclic ring comprising at least two ring systems, said at least two ring systems comprising a first ring system bonded to C1 and a second ring system fused to the first ring system, wherein:\n\n\nthe first ring system is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group, the second ring system is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group, a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaromatic group, a substituted or unsubstituted carbocyclic group, or a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group; or\n\n\nthe first ring system is a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaromatic group, the second ring system is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group, a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaromatic group, a substituted or unsubstituted carbocyclic group, or a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group; or\n\n\nthe first ring system is a substituted or unsubstituted saturated carbocyclic group, the second ring system is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group, a substituted or unsubstituted unsaturated carbocyclic group, a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group, or a substituted or unsubstituted ring B:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein X\n1 \nto X\n6 \nare each independently selected from carbon or a heteroatom; or\n\n\n\nthe first ring system is a substituted or unsubstituted unsaturated carbocyclic group, the second ring system is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group, a substituted or unsubstituted carbocyclic group, a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group, or a substituted or unsubstituted ring B:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein X\n1 \nto X\n6 \nare each independently selected from carbon or a heteroatom; or\n\n\n\nthe first ring system is a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group, the second ring system is a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaromatic group, a substituted or unsubstituted carbocyclic group, or a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group; and\n\n\nR\n3 \nto R\n11 \nare each independently selected from H, a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon group, a substituted or unsubstituted heterogeneous group, a substituted or unsubstituted carbocyclic group, a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group, substituted or unsubstituted aromatic, or a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaromatic;\n\n\nR\n12 \nis selected from H or a hydrocarbyl group;\n\n\nY is selected from a heteroatom or a carbon atom;\n\n\nA is selected from a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon group, a substituted or unsubstituted heterogeneous group, a substituted or unsubstituted carbocyclic group, a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group, substituted or unsubstituted aromatic, or a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaromatic; and\n\n\nn is an integer.\n\n\nIn a further aspect, there is provided a composition comprising the compound of Formula I.\n\n\nIn another aspect, there is provided a method of administration of the compound of Formula I or composition thereof to treat a cancer.\n\n\nIn yet another aspect, there is provided use of the compound of Formula I or composition thereof to treat a cancer.\n\n\nOther features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description.

CHEMSAS® is a robust proprietary computational platform for accelerated drug discovery, optimization and lead selection based upon a unique combination of traditional and modern pharmacology principles, statistical modeling and machine learning technologies. At the centre of the CHEMSAS® platform is a hybrid machine learning technology that may be used to: find, profile and optimize new targeted lead compounds; find novel uses for known compounds; and, solve problems with existing or potential drugs. In using the CHEMSAS® platform, first a therapeutic target was selected, in this case cancer and more particularly Small Cell Lung Cancer. The second step involved the design of a candidate molecule library containing thousands of potential compounds through the assembly of privileged molecular fragments. Thirdly, the candidate library was profiled and optimized using a combination of validated computational models and traditional expert medicinal chemistry. In this step, the CHEMSAS® platform developed 244 molecular descriptors for each candidate therapeutic compound. For example, molecular properties relating to a candidate compound's therapeutic efficacy, expected human toxicity, oral absorption, cumulative cellular resistance and/or kinetics were assessed. In some instances, comparative properties relating to commercially relevant benchmark compounds were also assessed. Potential lead compounds were then selected from the candidate library using a proprietary decision making tool designed to identify candidates with the optimal physical chemical properties, efficacy, ADME/Toxicity profile, etc. according to a pre-determined set of design criteria. The lead compounds selected from the candidate library were then synthesized for further pre-clinical development.\n\n\nThe properties of certain compounds according to the present invention, specifically COTI-217, COTI-220, COTI-219, COTI-2 and COTI-5, that were assessed in-silico using the CHEMSAS® computational platform are shown in Tables 1 to 13. Some of the predicted properties are validated by the experimental data provided herein, while other properties have been validated elsewhere during the development of other clinical candidates. The CHEMSAS® platform therefore provides a means of determining, predicting and/or testing the properties of a compound, particularly when used to determine the properties of compounds according to the present invention. The CHEMSAS® platform is also particularly useful in comparing the properties of compounds according to the invention with prior art compounds on a relative basis in silico.\n\n\nTables 1A and 1B: Physical Chemical Properties\n\n\nTables 1A and 1B shows that COTI-217, COTI-220, COTI-219, COTI-2 and COTI-5 are “drug-like” with good drug like physical properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMolID\n\n\nFORMULA\n\n\nMolWeight\n\n\nMnLogP\n\n\nHBndDon\n\n\nHBndAcc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOTI217\n\n\nC17H22N6S\n\n\n342.469\n\n\n1.859199\n\n\n1\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOTI220\n\n\nC18H20N6S\n\n\n352.464\n\n\n2.078432\n\n\n1\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOTI219\n\n\nC17H18N6S\n\n\n338.437\n\n\n1.7646\n\n\n1\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOTI2\n\n\nC19H22N6S\n\n\n366.491\n\n\n3.041311\n\n\n1\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOTI5\n\n\nC20H24N6S\n\n\n380.518\n\n\n2.22023\n\n\n1\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 1B\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMolID\n \nTPSA\n \nRotBnds\n \nLipinskiAlerts\n \nVeber\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCOTI217\n \n37.5435\n \n3\n \n0\n \n0\n \n \n \n \n \nCOTI220\n \n53.3605\n \n3\n \n0\n \n0\n \n \n \n \n \nCOTI219\n \n53.3605\n \n3\n \n0\n \n0\n \n \n \n \n \nCOTI2\n \n53.3605\n \n4\n \n0\n \n0\n \n \n \n \n \nCOTI5\n \n53.3605\n \n4\n \n0\n \n0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nLegend for Table 1:\n\n \n \nMolWeight stands for Molecular Weight measured in Daltons and is a size descriptor;\n \nMnLogP is an average of MLogP, ALogP98 and CLogP, all of which are calculated lipophilicity/solubility estimates;\n \nHBndDon stands for Hydrogen Bond Donor and refers to the number of atoms able to donate electrons to potentially form Hydrogen bonds;\n \nHBndAcc stands for Hydrogen Bond Acceptor and refers to the number of atoms able to accept electrons to potentially form Hydrogen bonds;\n \nTPSA stands for Topological Polar Surface Area and is a measure of Molecular Surface Charge/Polarity;\n \nRotBnds stands for Rotatable Bonds which is a count of freely rotatable single bonds in the molecule;\n \nLipinski Alerts If any 2 of (Molecular weight >500 Daltons, Hydrogen Bond Donors >5, Hydrogen Bond Acceptors >10, MLogP >4.15) are true, then a molecule is likely to have poor bioavailability;\n \nVeber Alerts: If TPSA >140 or number of Rotatable Bonds is >10, then bioavailability is likely to be poor.\n\n\nTables 2A and 2B: Solubility Properties\n\n \n\n\nTables 2A and 2B shows that COTI-217, COTI-220, COTI-219, COTI-2 and COTI-5 are expected to have acceptable solubility values for drug-like compounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMolID\n\n\nFORMULA\n\n\nMnLogP\n\n\nLogD(pH 7)\n\n\nLogS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOTI217\n\n\nC17H22N6S\n\n\n1.859199\n\n\n0.309304\n\n\n−3.09009\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOTI220\n\n\nC18H20N6S\n\n\n2.078432\n\n\n0.992417\n\n\n−4.20136\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOTI219\n\n\nC17H18N6S\n\n\n1.7646\n\n\n1.067558\n\n\n−3.78407\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOTI2\n\n\nC19H22N6S\n\n\n3.041311\n\n\n2.380243\n\n\n−4.52904\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOTI5\n\n\nC20H24N6S\n\n\n2.22023\n\n\n1.019701\n\n\n−4.49499\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 2B\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMolID\n \n \nFORMULA\n \n \nAcid pKa\n \n 2\n \n \nBase pKa\n \n1\n \n \nBase pKa\n \n 2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCOTI217\n \nC17H22N6S\n \nNone\n \n7.65056\n \nNone\n \n \n \nCOTI220\n \nC18H20N6S\n \nNone\n \n7.65056\n \n4.71559\n \n \n \nCOTI219\n \nC17H18N6S\n \nNone\n \n7.65056\n \n3.90139\n \n \n \nCOTI2\n \nC19H22N6S\n \nNone\n \n5.65356\n \n4.882592\n \n \n \nCOTI5\n \nC20H24N6S\n \nNone\n \n7.870707\n \n5.617688\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nLegend for Table 2:\n\n\n\nMnLogP is an average of MLogP, ALogP98 and CLogP, all of which are calculated lipophilicity/solubilty estimates;\n\n \n \nLogD(7.4) is a measure of relative solubility in octanol vs water at a specific pH, in this case pH=7.4;\n \nLogS is the logarithm of the calculated solubility in pure water usually measured at 25 degrees centigrade;\n \npKa is a calculated estimate of the pH at which the drug or substructures of the drug is 50% ionized and 50% is unionized.\n\n\nTable 3: Efficacy (LagGI50)\n\n \n\n\nTable 3 shows that COTI-217, COTI-220, COTI-219, COTI-2 and COTI-5 are predicted to have sub-micromolar in vitro activity vs human SCLC cell lines.

Briefly, cells were plated in plastic tissue culture plates and grown under standard conditions for each cell line, in carbon dioxide/oxygen atmosphere in plastic tissue culture plates, in the presence of COTI-2 or COTI-219 compounds at 35° C. for 3 days. Control cultures were treated with vehicle minus compound. Cells were counted after 3 days in culture and at a cell density of no more than 80%. The following cell lines, obtained from the National Cancer Institute, were tested: human SCLC cell lines DMS153, DMS114, SHP77; human NSCLC cell lines H226, A460, A560; human breast cancer cell lines T47D, MCF7; human colon cancer cell line HT29; and, human Leukemia cell lines K562, HL60.

Both drugs had an IC50 of less than 850 nM for the SHP77 cell line, which is known to be resistant to several conventional therapeutic agents. COTI-2 did not possess nanomolar level activity against NSCLC cell types and COTI-219 was not tested against those cell types. At least COTI-2 therefore exhibits selectivity in lung cancer treatment towards SCLC cell types. The in vitro data also confirms the in-silico predictions of efficacy, which estimated that less than 1 μM (1000 nM) would be required for efficacy in the SHP 77 and DMS 114 cell lines.\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nIn Vivo Efficacy in SCLC Treatment\n\n\nThe nude mouse model of human SCLC was used to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of compounds of the present invention in comparison with several known chemotherapeutic agents. Nude mice were obtained form the National Cancer Institute and the SHP-77 human SCLC cell line was chosen for metastatic tumor xenografts. The control group consisted of 10 animals, each of which were administered bilateral thigh injections of a prescribed volume of tumor cells. There were 6 treatment groups, each containing 5 animals: COTI-2, COTI-4, COTI-219, Taxotere® (docetaxel), Cisplatin® (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) and Tarceva® (erlotinib) The therapeutic agent was administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection on alternate days beginning on \nDay\n 3 post tumor cell injection. Each animal in a treatment group was administered bilateral thigh injections with the same prescribed volume of tumor cells as the control animals. Treatment continued for 31 days, following which the animals were euthanized and tissues were collected for subsequent analysis. The final tumor size in mm\n3 \nis reported in \nFIG. 1\n and the number of tumors is reported in \nFIG. 2\n.\n\n\nReferring to \nFIG. 1\n, compounds according to the invention showed a marked decrease in tumor growth as compared with both the control and conventional agents. Control animals produced tumors having a mean volume of 260+/−33 mm\n3\n. Animals treated with COTI-2 produced tumors of mean volume 9.9 mm\n3\n, while those treated with COTI-219 produced tumors having mean volume 53+/−28 mm\n3\n. This compared well with those treated with Cisplatin®, which produced tumors having means volume 132+/−26 mm\n3 \nand those treated with Taxotere®, which produced tumors having mean volume 183 mm\n3\n. Animals treated with Tarceva® died before study conclusion at 31 days.\n\n\nReferring to \nFIG. 2\n, compounds according to the invention showed a marked decrease in number of tumors as compared with both the control and conventional agents. Control animals produced an average of 0.9 tumors per injection site, whereas those treated with COTI-2 produced 0.28, those treated with COTI-219 produced 0.38, those treated with Cisplatin® produced 0.48 and those treated with Taxotere® produced 0.48. Animals treated with Tarceva® died before study conclusion at 31 days.\n\n\nThe above data show the efficacy of compounds according to the invention in vivo against SCLC cell lines. Furthermore, compounds according to the invention show better efficacy compared to conventionally administered therapeutic agents.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nIn Vivo Effect of COTI-2 in SCLC Treatment on N417 Tumor Xenografts\n\n\nMalignant N417 human SCLC cells in Matrigel™ were injected sub-cutaneously into hind legs of nude mice and xenograft tumors were allowed to grow to about 100 mm\n3\n. Mice were then administered daily intraperitoneal injections with indicated concentrations of COTI-2 (in isotonic saline, as a cloudy liquid, total volume of 1 ml per injection) for one week. Tumor volumes were estimated by caliper measurement. The results are shown in \nFIG. 3\n.\n\n\nReferring to \nFIG. 3\n, tumor volumes were graphed as means ±standard error (S E).\n\n\nA significant difference in tumor growth was observed at all dosage levels. The decrease in efficacy seen at the 8 mg/kg level relative to other treatment levels is attributed to an error in solubilizing the compound, since a small amount of undissolved material was observed at the bottom of the treatment vial. Percentage values reported on \nFIG. 3\n are for efficacy of the compound expressed in terms of inhibition of tumor growth according to the following formula:\n\n\n(1−(\nTf−Ti\n)/(\nCf−Ci\n))*100\n\n\nwherein Tf is the final tumor volume, Ti is the initial tumor volume at the onset of treatment, Cf is the final control tumor volume and Ci is the initial control tumor volume at the onset of treatment. Even when the 8 mg/kg dose is included, tumor growth inhibition of 30% or more was observed across all dosage levels. It is noted that the N417 cell line is generally regarded as the hardest SCLC cell line to treat. The compounds according to the invention therefore exhibit in vivo efficacy against a number of different SCLC cell lines.\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nResistance Testing\n\n\nIn order to evaluate the induction of resistance in vitro, compounds according to the invention were tested in head to head comparisons against conventional therapeutic agents Cisplatin® and Taxotere®. The compound designated COTI-4 (which is the subject of Applicant's co-pending U.S. provisional patent application entitled “Composition and Method for Treatment” filed Dec. 26, 2007) was also tested. The structure for COTI-4 is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 values were obtained using methods known to persons skilled in the art with two different human SCLC cell lines (DMS153 and SHP77) obtained from the National Cancer Institute. The surviving 50% of cells from the initial IC50 tested were harvested and cultured for 5 days, after which time this new generation of cells was re-treated with the same agent and a new IC50 value was established. The procedure was repeated for a total of 5 generations. Emerging resistance was identified by increasing IC50 values in successive generations. The results are shown in \nFIGS. 4 and 5\n (DMS153 and SHP77 cell lines, respectively), where the ordinate axis is provided in terms of the ratio of the IC50 value to the IC50 value of the parental generation.\n\n\nReferring to \nFIGS. 4 and 5\n, both COTI-2 and 219 exhibited little to no emerging resistance over 5 generations. This was in marked contrast to the conventional therapies Cisplatin® and Taxotere® (labeled Paclitaxel in the figures), which showed significant increases in IC50 for both cell lines. The SHP77 cell line in particular is known to be resistant to conventional agents; however, neither \nCOTI\n 2 nor 219 showed any tendency towards resistance in this cell line. In fact, COTI-2 demonstrated a statistically significant tendency to decrease resistance (IC50's less than 1 for successive generations) in both cell lines. COTI-2 therefore exhibits a collateral sensitivity whereby the resistance of cells is decreased over successive generations and the drug might actually become more effective over time against these cell lines. This corroborates the in-silico predictions for COTI-2 and 219; COTI-2 was predicted to be a strong P-glycoprotein inhibitor, which is consistent with decreasing the tendency towards drug resistance, whereas COTI-219 was predicted to be both a P-glycoprotein inhibitor and/or a weak substrate for P-glycoprotein, also consistent with minimal accumulation in resistance over successive generations. The in-silico predictions for resistance profile of compounds according to the invention are therefore confirmed by these assays.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nIn Vitro Efficacy in Brain Cancer\n\n\nIn order to determine the efficacy of the present invention against human Glioma and Astrocytoma cell lines, IC50 values were determined by in vitro assay of four malignant human brain cancer cell lines (U87MG, grade III glioblastoma/astrocytoma; SNB-19, glioma/astrocytoma Grade IV, glioblastoma multiforme; SF-268, glioma; SF-295, glioma). Human brain cancers are notoriously difficult to treat.\n\n\nCell lines were obtained from the Human Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC), grown and maintained under ATCC-specified conditions, and tested to ensure viability and lack of contaminating mycoplasma and common viruses. Healthy cells were plated in 96-well culture plates in medium plus fetal bovine serum and allowed to adhere for 16 h, followed by addition of COTI-2, COTI-219, Cisplatin®, or BCNU (1,3-Bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea) at multiple concentrations ranging from those that had no effect on proliferation to those that inhibited proliferation by 90% or more. A viability stain (alamar Blue) was added to cells after 4-7 days of drug exposure (approximately 4 doublings of control cells; maximum cell density in wells approximately 80%), and assayed for total cellular metabolic activity (a function of population density of live cells) by absorbance. Concentrations of the agent required to inhibit proliferation by 50% (IC50 value) were derived by interpolation of plotted data (mean values derived from 3 independent experiments ±standard error). Results are reported in Table 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 values for Human Glioma/Astrocytoma cell Lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCOTI-2\n\n\nCOTI-219\n\n\nCisplatin\n\n\nBCNU\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCell Line\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU87\n\n\n48 +/− 9\n\n\n2370+/−\n\n\n490 +/− 9 \n\n\n1520 +/− 130\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNB-19\n\n\n 8 +/− 3\n\n\n1990+/−\n\n\n870 +/− 40\n\n\n2250 +/− 700\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSF-268\n\n\n66 +/− 8\n\n\n1170+/−\n\n\nNot tested\n\n\nNot tested\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSF-295\n\n\n184 +/− 23\n\n\n2390+/−\n\n\nNot tested\n\n\nNot tested\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least the COTI-2 compounds were shown to have better efficacy against glioma/astrocytoma cell lines as compared with the conventional agents Cisplatin® and BCNU. COTI-2 showed an order of magnitude greater efficacy than Cisplatin® against U87 and two orders of magnitude greater efficacy against SNB-19. These results show that at least COTI-2 compounds have efficacy against glioma/astrocytoma cell lines.\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nIn Vivo Effect of COTI-2 on Cancerous Brain Tumours\n\n\nMalignant U87 human glioma (brain tumour) cells in Matrigel™ were injected sub-cutaneously into hind legs of nude mice, allowed to grow to 200-300 mm\n3\n, then treated 3 times per week (Mon, Wed, Fri) with indicated concentrations of COTI-2 (in isotonic saline, as a cloudy liquid, total volume of 1 ml per injection). Tumour volumes were estimated by caliper measurement. The results are shown in \nFIGS. 6A and 6B\n.\n\n\nIn \nFIG. 6A\n, tumour volumes were graphed as means ±standard error (SE) (n=11-14 for each data point). The asterisk indicates a significant difference (p<0.05) between the 8 mg/kg treatment group and both the saline control and 4 mg/kg treatment groups. There was no significant difference between the 4 mg/kg group and the saline control group.\n\n\nIn \nFIG. 6B\n, tumour volumes were graphed as fractional increase in volume, to correct for differences in starting volume, ±SE. The asterisk indicates a significant difference (p<0.05) between the 8 mg/kg treatment group and both the saline control and 4 mg/kg treatment groups. There was no significant difference between the 4 mg/kg group and the saline control group. The flag \n indicates a significant difference between the 8 mg/kg group and the saline group, but not between the 8 mg/kg group and the 4 mg/kg group.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 6A and 6B\n show that compounds of the present invention are effective in the treatment of established human brain tumors. The compounds delayed tumor growth by about 25% at a dosage of 8 mg/kg given just three times per week. Although no significant effect was observed at a dosage of 4 mg/kg, more frequent administration may have produced a significant effect at this dosage.\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nToxicity Testing\n\n\nAn escalating dose acute toxicity study was conducted with COTI-2, COTI-4 and COTI-219. Standard lab mice were divided into four treatment groups (control, 4, 8, 16 mg/kg) with four animals per group. It should be noted that the highest dose was approximately 10 times the estimated effective dose. Mice were given alternate day IP injections for 28 days. Weight loss/gain of the mice was measured and the mice were observed for adverse effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, etc. Blood and tissue samples were harvested for histopathology. None of the drugs produced any weight loss at any of the administered doses over the entire 28 day period. No evidence of acute toxicity was obtained and no adverse effects were observed. The compounds according to the present invention are therefore believed to be safe and non-toxic.\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nIn Vitro Metabolic Stability in Human Liver Microsomes\n\n\nTo evaluate the stability of these compounds in terms of clearance by the liver, human liver microsomes (HLM) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml were incubated with 0.823 mM NADPH, 5 mM UDPGA, 1 mM MgCl\n2 \nand COTI-2 or 219 at concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 μM. Sampling was conducted at 1, 20, 40, 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes and the remaining concentration of each compound was evaluated. A half life (T\n1/2\n) was calculated at each concentration, along with the rate of clearance by the liver (C\nL\n). The results are provided in Table 16 for each compound. The C\nL \nvalues compare favorably with published values for other marketed therapeutic agents under identical conditions. The half life of compounds according to the invention is therefore likely to be long enough to permit convenient dosing, while not being so long as to lead to accumulation in patients with potential long term toxicity effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalf-life and Liver Clearance Rate by HLM at 0.5 mg/mL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nConcentration (μM)\n\n\nT\n1/2 \n(min)\n\n\nC\nL \n(μL/min/mg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOTI-2\n\n\n1\n\n\n102.1\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n285.7\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n683.1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOTI-219\n\n\n1\n\n\n301.2\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n420.7\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n508.5\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average half life for COTI-2 was 6 hours and for COTI-219 was 6.8 hours. The in-silico prediction for CL in the 95% confidence interval was from 3.1-14.3 for COTI-2 and from 1.4-6.6 for COTI-219; this compares well with the data presented in Table 3.\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\nMechanism of Action\n\n\nWithout wishing to be limited by theory, it is believed that molecules according to the present invention, particularly COTI-2, act in the treatment of cancer in a manner consistent with the following mechanistic observations. The following observations were obtained using gene expression profiling techniques and targeted in vitro testing. Molecules of the present invention are believed to function as kinase inhibitors. Molecules of the present invention are also believed to function as promoters of apoptosis. Promotion of apoptosis is achieved by decreasing phosphorylation of \nCaspase\n 9; this has the effect of increasing \nactive Caspase\n 9 and inducing apoptosis via \nCaspase\n 3.\n\n\nTo confirm this mechanism SHP77 cells were treated with 250 nM of COTI-2 and incubated for 3 and 6 hours. Western blots of the cellular lysates are presented in \nFIG. 7\n. Phospho-Akt expression was decreased as compared to control at both 3 and 6 hours, with corresponding increases in Akt levels. There was no change in phospho-STAT3 expression, although a slight decrease in total STAT3 (˜30%) was observed at 6 hrs. There was no observed reactivation of \nCaspase\n 8; its level of expression remained constant in treated and control cells. However, the most dramatic change was a profound suppression of phospho-\nCaspase\n 9 at both 3 and 6 hrs of incubation. These results confirm the proposed mechanism of action.\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\nIn-Silico Comparative Data\n\n\nThe in-silico model was used to test properties of compounds described in PCT Publication No. WO2006/009765: NSC716768, NSC73306, NSC73303, NSC668496, and NSC693323.
