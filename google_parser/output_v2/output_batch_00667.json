Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis Application is a §371 National Stage Application of International Application No. PCT/IB2006/001018, filed Apr. 26, 2006; which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/678,242, filed May 6, 2005, and from European Patent Application 05290948.8, filed Apr. 29, 2005.\n\n\nThe present patent application concerns new ligands of the H\n3\n-receptor, their process of preparation and their therapeutic use.\n\n\nAntagonists of histamine H\n3\n-receptor are known especially to increase synthesis and release of cerebral histamine. Through this mechanism, they induce an extended wakefulness, an improvement in cognitive processes, a reduction in food intake and a normalization of vestibular reflexes (Schwartz et al., \nPhysiol. Rev., \n1991, 71: 1-51).\n\n\nHistamine H\n3\n-receptor agonists are known to inhibit the release of several neurotransmitters including histamine, monoamines and neuropeptides and thereby exert sedative and sleep-promoting effects in brain. In peripheral tissues, H\n3\n-receptor agonists exert namely anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, gastro-intestinal, antisecretory smooth muscle decontracting activities.\n\n\nH\n3 \nreceptor antagonist or agonist compounds previously known resemble histamine in possessing an imidazole ring generally monosubstituted in 4(5)-position (Ganellin et al., \nArs Pharmaceutica, \n1995, 36:3, 455-468; Stark et al., \nDrug of the Future, \n1996, 21(5), 507-520).\n\n\nNumerous patents and patent applications are directed to antagonist and/or agonist compounds having such structure, in particular EP 197 840, EP 494 010, WO 93/14070, WO 96/29315, WO 92/15 567, WO 93/20061, WO 93/20062, WO 95/11894, U.S. Pat. No. 5 486 526, WO 93/12107, WO 93/12108, WO 95/14007, WO 95/06037, WO 97/29092, EP 680 960, WO 96/38141, WO 96/38142, WO 96/40126.\n\n\nIn the literature, Plazzi et al., \nEur. J. Med. Chem., \n1995, 30, 881, Clitherow et al., \nBioorg\n. & \nMed. Chem. Lett., \n6 (7), 833-838 (1996), Wolin et al., \nBioorg\n. & \nMed. Chem. Lett., \n8, 2157 (1998) can be cited also in this respect.\n\n\nNevertheless, such imidazole derivatives may show drawbacks such as poor blood-brain barrier penetration, interaction with cytochrome P-450 proteins and/or some hepatic and ocular toxicities.\n\n\nNon-imidazole known neuro-active compounds such as betahistine (J-M. Arrang et al., \nEur. J. Pharmacol., \n1985,111: 72-84), phencyclidine (J-M. Arrang et al., \nEur. J. Pharmacol., \n1988,157: 31-35), dimaprit (J.-C. Schwartz et al., \nAgents Actions, \n1990, 30: 13-23), clozapine (M. Kathmann et al., \nPsychopharmacology \n1994, 116: 464-468), and sesquiterpenes (M. Takigawa et al., JP 06 345 642 (20 Dec. 1994)) were suggested to display H\n3\n-receptor antagonism but all these compounds have only very low potency.\n\n\nThese compounds were previously known as therapeutic agent before the discovery and characterization of the histamine H\n3\n-receptor, in particular as neuro-active agents for example as neuroleptic (clozapine) or psychotomimetic (Phencyclidine) agent.\n\n\nWhen tested at the H\n3\n-receptor, these compounds were shown to display much lower potency than the imidazole-containing compounds described in patent applications quoted above.\n\n\nContrary to previous attempts, the inventors succeeded at developing potent H\n3\n-receptor ligands not containing imidazole ring that reduced the above-mentioned drawbacks. These compounds, their preparation and therapeutical applications thereof have been described in the international patent application WO 00/06254.\n\n\nMore specifically, WO 00/06254 discloses, inter allia, compounds of formula (IIa):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore precisely, formula (IIa) depicts a general pharmacophore that is furthermore widely exemplified in the above-mentioned patent.\n\n\nFor pharmaceutical use, it is desirable to have compounds that are metabolically stable. A general way for metabolising aromatics is the para oxidation. So it is wise to focus on compounds having a substituent in this position or a bulky substituent in the meta position.\n\n\nHowever, the inventors have found that compounds of WO 00/06254 exhibiting a para-substituted group generally inhibit cytochromes 2D6 or 3A4. This is particularly deleterious for pharmaceuticals as these cytochromes are both involved in metabolisation of xenobiotics and biotransformation of endogenous products.\n\n\nSurprisingly, the inventors have now discovered that some specific modifications on these structures both afford compounds displaying a very good affinity for the human H\n3 \nreceptor (Ki<7 nM) together with a dramatically reduced inhibition of cytochromes 2D6 and 3A4. This is expressed by a Ki largely over the micromolar and/or a percentage of inhibition clearly under 50% when the compound is assessed at 1 μM.\n\n\nThe present invention is directed to these novel compounds which fulfill these requirements.\n\n\nAdditionally, preferred compounds of the invention exhibit a low HERG activity. Those showing a good bioavailability are particularly preferred.\n\n\nAccording to a first object, the present invention concerns new compounds of formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n

The term “controlling” is intended to refer to all processes wherein there may be a slowing, interrupting, arresting, or stopping of the progression of the diseases and conditions described herein, but does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all disease and condition symptoms, and is intended to include prophylactic treatment.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to those compounds, materials, compositions, or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem complications commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.\n\n\nAs used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfanic, phosphoric, nitric and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, glucuronic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, toluenesulfonic, oxalic, fumaric, maleic, and the like.

Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two. Generally, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n17\nth \ned., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 1418, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nThe compounds of the general formula (I) having geometrical and stereoisomers are also a part of the invention.\n\n\nAccording to a further object, the present invention is also concerned with the process of preparation of the compounds of formula (I).\n\n\nThe compounds and process of the present invention may be prepared in a number of ways well known to those skilled in the art. The compounds can be synthesized, for example, by application or adaptation of the methods described below, or variations thereon as appreciated by the skilled artisan. The appropriate modifications and substitutions will be readily apparent and well known or readily obtainable from the scientific literature to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nIn particular, such methods can be found in R. C. Larock, \nComprehensive Organic Transformations\n, VCH publishers, 1989.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that the compounds of the present invention may contain one or more asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms, and may be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Thus, all chiral, diastereomeric, racemic forms and all geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated. It is well known in the art how to prepare and isolate such optically active forms. For example, mixtures of stereoisomers may be separated by standard techniques including, but not limited to, resolution of racemic forms, normal, reverse-phase, and chiral chromatography, preferential salt formation, recrystallization, and the like, or by chiral synthesis either from chiral starting materials or by deliberate synthesis of target chiral centers.\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention may be prepared by a variety of synthetic routes. The reagents and starting materials are commercially available, or readily synthesized by well-known techniques by one of ordinary skill in the arts. All substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined.\n\n\nIn the reactions described hereinafter it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice, for examples see T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts in \nProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\n, John Wiley and Sons, 1991; J. F. W. McOmie in \nProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\n, Plenum Press, 1973.\n\n\nSome reactions may be carried out in the presence of a base. There is no particular restriction on the nature of the base to be used in this reaction, and any base conventionally used in reactions of this type may equally be used here, provided that it has no adverse effect on other parts of the molecule. Examples of suitable bases include: sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, triethylamine, alkali metal hydrides, such as sodium hydride and potassium hydride; alkyllithium compounds, such as methyllithium and butyllithium; and alkali metal alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide and sodium ethoxide.\n\n\nUsually, reactions are carried out in a suitable solvent. A variety of solvents may be used, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction or on the reagents involved. Examples of suitable solvents include: hydrocarbons, which may be aromatic, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene and xylene; amides, such as dimethylformamide; alcohols such as ethanol and methanol and ethers, such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran.\n\n\nThe reactions can take place over a wide range of temperatures. In general, we find it convenient to carry out the reaction at a temperature of from 0° C. to 150° C. (more preferably from about room temperature to 100° C.). The time required for the reaction may also vary widely, depending on many factors, notably the reaction temperature and the nature of the reagents. However, provided that the reaction is effected under the preferred conditions outlined above, a period of from 3 hours to 20 hours will usually suffice.\n\n\nThe compound thus prepared may be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional means. For example, the compounds may be recovered by distilling off the solvent from the reaction mixture or, if necessary after distilling off the solvent from the reaction mixture, pouring the residue into water followed by extraction with a water-immiscible organic solvent and distilling off the solvent from the extract. Additionally, the product can, if desired, be further purified by various well known techniques, such as recrystallization, reprecipitation or the various chromatography techniques, notably column chromatography or preparative thin layer chromatography.\n\n\nThe process of preparation of a compound of formula (I) of the invention is a further object of the present invention.\n\n\nAccording to a first aspect, compounds of the invention of formula (I) can be obtained from corresponding compounds of formula (II)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein A′, B′, R\n1\n′, R\n2\n′, R\n3\n′, R\n4\n′, R\n5\n′, R\n6\n′ and R\n7\n′ represent respectively A, B, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6 \nand R\n7 \nor a precursor group of respectively A, B, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6 \nand R\n7\n.\n\n\n\nAccording to the present invention, the expression “precursor group” of a functional group refers to any group which can, by one or more reactions, lead to the desired function, by means of one or more suitable reagents. Those reactions include the de-protecting group, as well as usual addition, substitution or functionalization reactions.\n\n\nPreferably, a compound of formula (I) in which B represents an alkyl chain can be prepared from a corresponding compound of formula (II) in which B′ represents an alkenyl chain, by a hydrogenation reaction. Generally, this reaction is carried out under catalytic conditions by using a catalyst such as Pd/C or platinum oxide. Preferably, this reaction can be carried out by simultaneously deprotecting any protective group of A, B, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6 \nand R\n7 \nwhich may be present in compound of formula (II).\n\n\nAccording to a second aspect, compounds of the invention of formula (I) can be obtained by reacting corresponding compounds of formula (III) and (IV):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nin which wherein A′, B′, R\n1\n′, R\n2\n′, R\n3\n′, R\n4\n′, R\n5\n′, R\n6\n′ and R\n7\n′ represent respectively A, B, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6 \nand R\n7 \nor a precursor group of respectively A, B, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6 \nand R\n7 \nand X represents a halogen atom. Generally, this reaction is carried out under basic conditions.\n\n\n\nAccording to a further aspect, compounds of the invention of formula (I) can be obtained by reacting corresponding compounds of formula (V) and (VI):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nin which wherein A′, B′, R\n1\n′, R\n2\n′, R\n3\n′, R\n4\n′, R\n5\n′, R\n6\n′ and R\n7\n′ represent respectively A, B, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6 \nand R\n7 \nor a precursor group of respectively A, B, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6 \nand R\n7 \nand Y represents a leaving group, such as OMs or halogen for example. Generally, this reaction is carried out under basic conditions.\n\n\n\nAccording to a further aspect, compounds of the invention of formula (I) can be obtained by reacting corresponding compounds of formula (VII) and (VIII):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nin which wherein A′, B′, R\n1\n′, R\n2\n′, R\n3\n′, R\n4\n′, R\n5\n′, R\n6\n′ and R\n7\n′ represent respectively A, B, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6 \nand R\n7 \nor a precursor group of respectively A, B, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6 \nand R\n7 \nand Z represents a halogen atom. Generally, this reaction is carried out under basic conditions.\n\n\n\nFurther, the process of the invention may also comprise the additional step of isolating the compound of formula (I). This can be done by the skilled person by any of the known conventional means, such as the recovery methods described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe starting products are commercially available or may be obtained by applying or adapting any known methods or those described in the examples.\n\n\nThe synthesis may also be carried out in one pot as a multicomponent reaction.\n\n\nAccording to a further object, the present invention is also concerned with pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula (I) together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier.\n\n\nThe antagonists are advantageously used as active ingredient in particular, of medicaments having psychotropic effects, promoting wakefulness, attention, memory and improving mood, in treatment of pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive disorders in aged persons, depressive or simply asthenic states. Preferably, said compounds may be used to treat and/or prevent CNS disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, attention, wakefulness, memorization disorders, cognitive deficits in psychiatric pathologies, in particular in aged persons, depressive or asthenia states.\n\n\nTheir nootropic effects can be useful to stimulate vigilance, attention and memorization capacity in healthy humans. The compounds of the invention can also be useful to facilitate night work or adaptation to time shift in humans.\n\n\nIn addition, these agents can be useful in treatment of obesity, vertigo and motion sickness.\n\n\nIt can also be useful to associate the compounds of the invention with other psychiatric agents such as neuroleptics to increase their efficiency and reduce their side effects.\n\n\nApplication in certain forms of epilepsy is also foreseen.\n\n\nTheir therapeutic applications involve also peripheral organs mainly a stimulant of secretions or gastrointestinal motricity.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment of CNS disorders of aged persons.\n\n\nAdditionally, said antagonists or inverse agonists may also be useful in treating and/or preventing epilepsy.\n\n\nAs used herein, “epilepsy” denotes a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain sometimes signal abnormally. Epilepsy is also known as a seizure disorder. A seizure is a sudden surge of electrical activity in the brain. Epilepsy is usually diagnosed after a person has had at least two seizures that were not caused by some known medical condition like alcohol withdrawal or extremely low blood sugar.\n\n\nPreferably, epilepsy is selected from the group consisting in absence epilepsy, in children and adults, pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe seizures, and photosensitive seizures.\n\n\nAdditionally, the present application also concerns the use of the compounds of the invention for treating and/or preventing Parkinson's disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), dementia with Lewy bodies and/or vascular dementia and in particular the treatment of their symptoms thereof.\n\n\nAs used herein, “obstructive sleep apnea” (also referred to herein as “OSA”) denotes a breathing disorder that occurs primarily during sleep with consequences that may persist throughout the waking hours in the form of sleepiness. This increasingly well-recognized disease is characterized by periodic collapse of the upper airway during sleep with apneas (periodic cessation of breathing), hypopneas (repetitive reduction in breathing) or a continuous or sustained reduction in ventilation and excessive daytime sleepiness, neurocognitive defects and depression. It affects almost every system in the body, resulting namely in increased incidence of cardiovascular disorders (Qureshi and Ballard, J. Allergy and \nClin. Immunol., \n2003, 112, 643). There is no known pharmacological treatment for OSA.\n\n\n“Parkinson's disease” (“PD”) is mainly associated with a degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal tract from which derive the motor impairments and neuropsychiatric disorders characteristic of the disease. Whereas some other aminergic neuron classes might be affected in the parkinsonian brain, post-mortem neurochemical and immunohistochemical studies have shown that histaminergic neurons are completely spared from the degeneration process (Garbarg et al., \nLancet, \n1983, 1, 74; Nakamura et al., \nNeurology, \n1996, 4, 1693). In addition, in a model of “Parkinsonian” rat, in which the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons had been previously destroyed by unilateral administration of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine, the effect of the antiparkinsonian drug levodopa on the turning behaviour, a reflect of its antiparkinsonian activity, was not modified by co-administration of thioperamide, a prototypical H\n3\nR antagonist/inverse agonist (Huotary et al., \nParkinsonism Relat. Disord., \n2000, 6, 159). This absence of effect is not attributable to either an absence of H\n3\nR sites in the nigrostriatal complex where, on the contrary, they abund (Pillot et al., \nNeuroscience, \n2002, 114, 176) or a disappearance of H\n3\nR sites as a result of the neuronal degeneration process, since the number of these sites is, on the contrary, elevated in the same animal model (Ryu et al., \nNeurosci. Letters, \n1994, 178, 19). Taken together these findings suggested the lack of therapeutic interest of this class of drugs in the management of PD.\n\n\nIn addition to the major signs of PD in the movement initiation and control which constitute the core of the disease, it has become apparent during the last decades that a large proportion (as large as 74-81%) of PD patients display sleep and vigilance disorders (Garcia-Borreguero et al., \nSleep Med. Rev., \n2003, 7, 115). These include disorders of sleep initiation and maintenance, sleep fragmentation, parasomnias (including nocturnal hallucinations), sleep disordered breathing and excessive daytime sleepiness (including “sleep attacks”, i.e. inappropriate and unintended falls into sleep while in daytime activity). It is not entirely clear whether this group of disorders is purely related to the PD itself or whether there is also some participation of the treatment by direct or indirect dopaminergic agonists. The treatment of this class of disorders, which may all result from a loss of circadian rythmicity, is poorly efficient: for instance, modafinil treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness was tried with limited success and the indication for this stimulant drug of essentially unknown mechanism of action has not been recognized by health authorities.\n\n\nPD refers to idiopathic PD or idiopathic parkinsonism described by James Parkinson in 1817. The clinical tetrad of PD includes tremor at repose, bradykinesia (slowness of voluntary movement) or akinesia (reduced or absent movement), cogwheel or leadpipe rigidity, and postural impairment causing difficulty in turning and a stooped posture. The pathologic hallmark is the presence of intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions (Lewy bodies) in addition to loss of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In addition to the major signs of PD in the movement initiation and control which constitute the core of the disease, a large proportion of PD patients display sleep and vigilance disorders. These “sleep and vigilance disorders associated with PD” include in particular insomnia, disorders of sleep initiation and maintenance, sleep fragmentation, parasomnias, sleep disordered breathing, excessive daytime sleepiness (including “sleep attacks”) and circadian dysrhythmia (inversion of sleep-wake rhythm).\n\n\nDementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) results from the accumulation of such bodies in the cortex (whereas their accumulation in the nigro-striatal complex is observed in PD, a related degenerative disease). It is characterized by cognitive impairment, aftentional disturbances, hallucinations, depression and sleep disorders.\n\n\nVascular dementia, the second most frequent cause of dementia, after Alzheimer's disease, is characterized by acute loss of memory, orientation and executive functions and is often associated with demonstrable cerebrovascular lesions in patients suffering from hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea for several years.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention can also be useful for the treatment and/or prevention of vertigo, motion sickness, obesity, diabetis and so-called “metabolic syndrome”. Metabolic syndrome was first defined as syndrome X by Reaven (Diabetes 1988, 37, 1595-607). It refers to a cluster of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipidemia, low HDL-cholesterol, hypertension, microalbuminuria, obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disorders and/or abnormalities of fibrinolysis and of coagulation.\n\n\nAdditionally, the compounds of the invention can be useful for treating and/or preventing sleep disorders, stress, psychotropic disorders, convulsion, depression, narcolepsy, disorders of the hypothalamohypophyseal secretion, the cerebral circulation and/or immune system.\n\n\nThe present invention also concerns the corresponding methods of treatment comprising the administration of a compound of the invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient to a patient in the need thereof.\n\n\nThe identification of those subjects who are in need of treatment of herein-described diseases and conditions is well within the ability and knowledge of one skilled in the art. A clinician skilled in the art can readily identify, by the use of clinical tests, physical examination and medical/family history, those subjects who are in need of such treatment.\n\n\nA therapeutically effective amount can be readily determined by the attending diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, by the use of conventional techniques and by observing results obtained under analogous circumstances. In determining the therapeutically effective amount, a number of factors are considered by the attending diagnostician, including, but not limited to: the species of subject; its size, age, and general health; the specific disease involved; the degree of involvement or the severity of the disease; the response of the individual subject; the particular compound administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristic of the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the use of concomitant medication; and other relevant circumstances.\n\n\nThe amount of a compound of formula (I), which is required to achieve the desired biological effect, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the dosage of the drug to be administered, the chemical characteristics (e.g. hydrophobicity) of the compounds employed, the potency of the compounds, the type of disease, the diseased state of the patient, and the route of administration.\n\n\n“Pharmaceutically” or “pharmaceutically acceptable” refer to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward reaction when administered to an animal, or a human, as appropriate.\n\n\nAs used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes any diluents, adjuvants, excipients, or vehicles, such as preserving agents, fillers, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions.\n\n\nIn the context of the invention, the term “treating” or “treatment”, as used herein, means reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing the disorder or condition to which such term applies, or one or more symptoms of such disorder or condition.\n\n\n“Therapeutically effective amount” means an amount of a compound/medicament according to the present invention effective in producing the desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\nAccording to the invention, the term “patient”, or “patient in need thereof”, is intended for a human or non-human mammal affected or likely to be affected with a neuropsychological disorder. Preferably, the patient is a human.\n\n\nIn general terms, the compounds of this invention may be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing 0.1 to 10% w/v compound for parenteral administration. Typical dose ranges are from 1 μg/kg to 0.1 g/kg of body weight per day; a preferred dose range is from 0.01 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg of body weight per day. A preferred daily dose for adult humans includes 5, 50, 100 and 200 mg, and an equivalent dose in a human child. The preferred dosage of drug to be administered is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the compound excipient and its route of administration.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are capable of being administered in unit dose forms, wherein the term “unit dose” means a single dose which is capable of being administered to a patient, and which can be readily handled and packaged, remaining as a physically and chemically stable unit dose comprising either the active compound itself, or as a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, as described hereinafter. As such, typical daily dose ranges are from 0.01 to 10 mg/kg of body weight. By way of general guidance, unit doses for humans range from 0.1 mg to 1000 mg per day. Preferably the unit dose range is from 1 to 500 mg administered one to four times a day, and even more preferably from 10 mg to 300 mg, two times a day. Compounds provided herein can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by admixture with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Such compositions may be prepared for use in oral administration, particularly in the form of tablets or capsules; or parenteral administration, particularly in the form of liquid solutions, suspensions or emulsions; or intranasally, particularly in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols; or dermally, for example, topically or via transdermal patches.\n\n\nThe compositions may conveniently be administered in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the pharmaceutical art, for example, as described in \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n20\nth \ned.; Gennaro, A. R., Ed.; Lippincott Williams & Wilkins: Philadelphia, Pa., 2000. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition.

Capsules can be in the form of a hard capsule or soft capsule, which are generally made from gelatin blends optionally blended with plasticizers, as well as a starch capsule. In addition, dosage unit forms can contain various other materials that modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for example, coatings of sugar, shellac, or enteric agents. Other oral dosage forms syrup or elixir may contain sweetening agents, preservatives, dyes, colorings, and flavorings. In addition, the active compounds may be incorporated into fast dissolve, modified-release or sustained-release preparations and formulations, and wherein such sustained-release formulations are preferably bi-modal.\n\n\nPreferred formulations include pharmaceutical compositions in which a compound of the present invention is formulated for oral or parenteral administration, or more preferably those in which a compound of the present invention is formulated as a tablet. Preferred tablets contain lactose, cornstarch, magnesium silicate, croscarmellose sodium, povidone, magnesium stearate, or talc in any combination. It is also an aspect of the present disclosure that a compound of the present invention may be incorporated into a food product or a liquid.\n\n\nLiquid preparations for administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. The liquid compositions may also include binders, buffers, preservatives, chelating agents, sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, and the like.

Intravenous vehicles can include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers, such as those based on Ringer's dextrose, and the like. Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for these active compounds include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposomes.\n\n\nAlternative modes of administration include formulations for inhalation, which include such means as dry powder, aerosol, or drops.

Among the xenobiotic-metabolizing CYPs, five forms, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 appear to be the major CYP isoforms responsible for the oxidative metabolism of drugs or xenobiotics. Inhibition of CYP-mediated metabolism, often the mechanism for drug-drug interactions, can limit the use of a drug because of adverse clinical effects. The potential for CYP enzyme inhibition is routinely assessed by performing in vitro inhibition studies by measuring the rates of metabolism of a probe biotransformation in the presence and absence of test molecules.\n\n\nThe ability of drug in human to inhibit the catalytic activity of cytochrome P-450 isoforms was assayed using microtiter plate-based, fluorometric assays for the activities of the five human major CYP forms. Inhibition potential was determined in vitro after incubation of fluorescent model substrates over various incubation time with human recombinant cytochrome isoforms in the absence or in presence of increasing concentrations of test molecules (from 1 nM to 100 μM), in comparison with specific CYP isoform inhibitors. Data were expressed as quantitative inhibition parameters [inhibitor concentration that produces 50% inhibition (IC\n50 \nvalue)].\n\n\nIncubation of drug was carried out at 37° C.±0.5° C. under agitation in the presence of human recombinant cytochrome P-450 isoforms and a NADPH generating system.

Description\n\n\n\n\n C-RING MODIFIED TRICYCLIC BENZONAPHTHIRIDINONE PROTEIN KINASE INHIBITORS AND USE THEREOF\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to protein kinase inhibitors, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such inhibitors, and methods of use thereof.\n\n\nBackground of the Invention Protein kinases represent a large family of proteins, which play a central role in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes, thus maintaining control over cellular function. A partial list of such kinases includes Akt, AxI, Aurora A, Aurora B, Lck, Fyn, Lyn, Yes, dyrk2, epha2, fgfr3, vegfr3, igflr, IKK2, JNK3, Vegfr2, MEKl, MET, Ron, Rskl, CHKl, P70s6K, PM, RSKl, Src, TrkA, Zap70, cKit, bRaf, EGFR, Jak2, PI3K, NPM-AIk, c-Abl, BTK, FAK, PDGFR, TAKl, LimK, Flt3, Fltl, PDKl and Erk.\n\n\nAbnormal cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated events produce a variety of diseases. These include autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and asthma, Alzheimer's disease and hormone-related diseases.\n\n\nAccordingly, there has been a substantial effort in medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors that are effective as therapeutic agents.\n\n\nSmall molecule inhibitors of protein kinases like the Aurora kinases have been reported recently, but their effect on cytokinesis has yet to be investigated in detail. The Aurora family of conserved serine/threonine kinases perform essential functions during cell division. The three mammalian paralogues, Aurora A, B and C, are very similar in sequence, but differ significantly in their localization, function, substrates and regulatory partners. One highly selective and potent small-molecule inhibitor of the Aurora kinases, VX-680, blocks cell-cycle progression and induces apoptosis in a diverse range of human tumor types (Harrington EA, et al., Natl. J. Med., (2004) 10: 262-267). Another novel cell cycle inhibitor, JNJ-7706621, showed potent inhibition \n\n of several cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and Aurora kinases, and selectively blocked proliferation of tumor cells of various origins (Emanuel S., et al., Cancer Res., 2005, 65:9038-9046). Additional cellular effects due to inhibition of Aurora kinases included endoreduplication and inhibition of histone H3 phosphorylation. Aurora kinase inhibitors also have been identified by Hauf et al. (J. Cell. Biol.,\n\n\n2003, 161:281-294), who described the indolinone (Hesperadin) as an inhibitor of Aurora B that causes cells to enter anaphase with monooriented chromosomes; and Ditchfield et al. (/. Cell. Biol., 2003, 161:267-280) who disclosed ZM447439 ((4-(4- (N-benzoylamino)anilino)-6-methoxy-7-(3-(l-morpholino)propoxy) quinazoline), an Aurora kinase inhibitor that interferes with chromosome alignment, segregation, and cytokinesis.\n\n\nAprea AB described 9H-carbazole derivatives that inhibit tumor cell growth by disrupting the interaction between the wildtype p53 tumor suppressor gene and HDM2, an oncogene protein, thereby restoring the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis via protein kinase signal transduction (WO 2004/035580 Al).\n\n\nTakeda Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., disclosed pyrido-indole derivatives that are inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and cyclin-dependent kinases, and so are useful as antitumor, antibacterial and anti-viral agents (WO 2008/016184).\n\n\nHowever, the need exists for a protein kinase inhibitor that is capable of inhibiting, modulating and/or regulating signal transduction by aberrant protein kinases, thereby effectively treating proliferative diseases such as cancers and cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, inflammatory, and endocrine -related diseases. It is also desirable for this protein kinase inhibitor to be useful in combination therapies for disease treatment and as a diagnostic tool. These compounds of the present invention and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them are presented either individually or in kit form. Included in this invention also are processes for preparing the compounds that actively modulate or inhibit unregulated protein kinase activity.\n\n\nAdditional objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description and claims.\n\n\n- ? - \n\n Summary of the Invention\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention are selective and highly potent adenosine triphosphate (ATP) competitive inhibitors of Aurora kinases A, B and C, and LimK, Fyn, Lyn, Yes Lck ,Src, KDR, Met, Ron, AxI, Flt-3, and FGFR3 protein kinases. The present invention also provides pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives, solvates, salts, tautomers and stereoisomers of these compounds, including mixtures thereof in all ratios.

Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below. For brevity, the term \"aryl\" when used in combination with other terms, such as for example, aryloxy, arylthioxy, or arylalkyl, optionally includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above. Thus, the term \"arylalkyl\" or \"aralkyl\" optionally includes those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group (e.g. , benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (e.g., a methylene group) has been replaced by, for example, an oxygen atom (e.g., phenoxymethyl, 2-pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(l-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like).

Exemplary species for R include H, halogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, and substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"fused ring system\" means at least two rings, wherein each ring has at least 2 atoms in common with another ring. \"Fused ring systems may include aromatic as well as non aromatic rings. Examples of \"fused ring systems\" are naphthalenes, indoles, quinolines, chromenes, norbornanes, and the like.\n\n\nThe term \"treatment\" as used herein refers both to prevention of a particular disease or treatment of a pre-existing condition.\n\n\nThe phrase \"therapeutically effective amount\" as used herein means that amount of a compound, material, or composition comprising a compound of the present invention which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect by simultaneous blocking or inhibiting of protein kinase receptors in a mammal, thereby blocking the biological consequences of that pathway in the treated cells, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. \n\n The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salts\" includes salts of the active compounds that are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge et ah, J. Pharma. Science 1977, 66: 1-19). Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.\n\n\nThe neutral forms of the compounds are preferably regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the present invention. The compounds according to the invention can be used in their final non-salt form. On the other hand, the present invention also encompasses the use of these compounds in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which can be derived from various organic and inorganic acids and bases by procedures known in \n\n the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of the compounds of the formula I are for the most part prepared by conventional methods. If the compound of the formula I contains a carboxyl group, one of its suitable salts can be formed by reacting the compound with a suitable base to give the corresponding base-addition salt. Such bases are, for example, alkali metal hydroxides, including potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide; alkaline earth metal hydroxides, such as barium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; alkali metal alkoxides, for example potassium ethoxide and sodium propoxide; and various organic bases, such as piperidine, diethanolamine and N methylglutamine.

Salts of the compounds of the Formula I which are derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, substituted amines, also including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchanger resins, for example arginine, betaine, caffeine, chloroprocaine, choline, N,N'- dibenzylethylenediamine (benzathine), dicyclohexylamine, diethanolamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2- dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N- ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lidocaine, lysine, meglumine, N-methyl-D- glucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethanolamine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine and tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine (tromethamine), but this is not intended to represent a restriction.\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention which contain basic nitrogen-containing groups can be quaternised using agents such as (Cl-C4)alkyl halides, for example methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and tert-butyl chloride, bromide and iodide; di(Cl-C4)alkyl sulfates, for example dimethyl, diethyl and diamyl sulfate; (C10-C18)alkyl halides, for example decyl, dodecyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chloride, bromide and iodide; and aryl(Cl-C4)alkyl halides, for example benzyl chloride and phenethyl bromide.

The free base can be regenerated by bringing the salt form into contact with a base and isolating the free base in a conventional manner. The free base forms differ in a certain respect from the corresponding salt forms thereof with respect to certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents; for the purposes of the invention, however, the salts otherwise correspond to the respective free base forms thereof.\n\n\nAs stated, the pharmaceutically acceptable base-addition salts of the compounds of the formula I are formed with metals or amines, such as alkali metals and alkaline earth metals or organic amines. Preferred metals are sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium. Preferred organic amines are N,N'- dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N methyl-D-glucamine and procaine. The base-addition salts of acidic compounds according to the invention are prepared by bringing the free acid form into contact with a sufficient amount of the desired base, causing the formation of the salt in a conventional manner. The free acid can be regenerated by bringing the salt form into contact with an acid and isolating the free acid in a conventional manner. The free acid forms differ in a certain respect from the corresponding salt forms thereof with respect to certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents; for the purposes of the invention, however, the salts otherwise correspond to the respective free acid forms thereof.\n\n\nIf a compound according to the invention contains more than one group that is capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts of this type, the invention also encompasses multiple salts. Typical multiple salt forms include, for example, bitartrate, diacetate, difumarate, dimeglumine, diphosphate, disodium and trihydrochloride, but this is not intended to represent a restriction.\n\n\nThe term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" as contained herein means an active ingredient which comprises a compound of the Formula I in the form of one of its salts, in particular if this salt form imparts improved pharmacokinetic properties on the active ingredient compared with the free form of the active ingredient or any other salt form of the active ingredient used earlier. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt \n\n form of the active ingredient can also provide this active ingredient for the first time with a desired pharmacokinetic property which it did not have earlier and can even have a positive influence on the pharmacodynamics of this active ingredient with respect to its therapeutic efficacy in the body. The invention furthermore relates to medicaments comprising at least one compound of the Formula I and/or pharmaceutically usable derivatives, solvates and stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios, and optionally excipients and/or adjuvants.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"prodrug\" means a form of the compound that readily undergoes one or more chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide an active form of the compound of the present invention. For instance, typical prodrugs include carboxylic acid ester forms of the compounds of the invention. In an exemplary embodiment, the prodrug is suitable for treatment /prevention of those diseases and conditions that require the drug molecule to cross the blood brain or other membrane barrier. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present invention when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent. Certain compounds of the present invention exist in \"unsolvated\" forms as well as \"solvated\" forms, including \"hydrated\" forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms, and both are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms may be used in the methods contemplated herein and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention. The phrase \"a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, polymorph or solvate of a compound\" is meant to include both a material that exists in one or more than one of these states.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"heteroatom\" includes oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), silicon (Si), boron (B), and phosphorus (P).\n\n\nThe term \"heteroalkyl,\" by itself or in combination with another term, unless otherwise stated, means a stable straight or branched chain, cyclic hydrocarbon \n\n radical, or combinations thereof, consisting of the stated number of carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, Si, B, P, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) O, N, S, B, P, and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to,\n\n\n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-O-CH\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-NH-CH\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-N(CH\n3\n)-CH\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-S-CH\n2\n-CH\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-CH\n25\n-S(O)-CH\n3\n, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-S(O)\n2\n-CH\n3\n, -CH=CH-O-CH\n3\n, -Si(CH\n3\n)\n3\n, -CH\n2\n- CH=N-OCH\n3\n, and -CH=CH-N(CH\n3\n)-CH\n3\n. Up to two heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, -CH\n2\n-NH-OCH\n3\n and -CH\n2\n-O-Si(CH\n3\n)\n3\n. Similarly, the term \"heteroalkylene\" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-S- CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n- and -CH\n2\n-S-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-NH-CH\n2\n-. For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group for alkylene and heteroalkylene is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula -CO\n2\nR'- represents both -C(O)OR' and - OC(O)R'.\n\n\nThe terms \"cycloalkyl\" or \"carbocycle\" and \"heterocycloalkyl\", by themselves or in combination with other terms, unless otherwise stated, mean cyclic versions of \"alkyl\" and \"heteroalkyl\", respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom occupies any position in the cycle. A \"cycloalkyl\", \"carbocycle\" or \"heterocycloalkyl\" substituent may be attached to the remainder of the molecule directly or through a linker, wherein the linker is, for example, alkyl. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1- cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, norbornanyl, norbornene, and the like. The term \"carbocycle\" as used herein refers to any fully saturated ring structure, including without limitation, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and the like, and also includes mono-, bi- and tri-cyclic forms of the same. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, 1-(1, 2,5,6- tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyl, 3- \n\n morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl, tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1-piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"C-ring modified tricyclic benzonaphthiridine\" means a third ring added to a benzonaphthiridine scaffold depicted by the following structural arrangement,\n\n\n \n\n wherein the C ring optionally may be substituted and may vary in size from 4 - 7 members, of which each member may be a carbon or heteroatom. Unless otherwise stated, the terms \"halo\" or \"halogen,\" by themselves or as part of another substituent, mean a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally, terms such as \"haloalkyl,\" are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For example, the term \"halo(Ci-C\n4\n)alkyl\" is mean to include, but not be limited to, trifluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, fluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4- chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.\n\n\nReagents utilized in the syntheses contained herein, unless otherwise noted, have the following meanings: \"S-Phos\" is 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',6'- dimethoxybiphenyl; \"Pd(OAc)\n2\n\" is palladium(II) acetate; \"K\n2\nCO3\" is potassium carbonate; \"KOH\" is potassium hydroxide; \"X-Phos\" is 2-dicyclohexylphosphino- 2',4',6'-triisopropylbiphenyl; \"NaOtBu\" is sodium tert-butoxide; and 'V-BuOH\" is tertiary-butyl hydroxide.\n\n\nCertain compounds of the present invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers and individual isomers are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Optically active (R)- and (^-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of \n\n geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are included.\n\n\nThe term \"host 'or \"patient in need thereof as used herein may be any mammalian species, for example a primate species, particularly humans; rodents; rabbits; horses, cows, sheep, dogs, cats, etc. Animal models are of interest for veterinary treatment and for experimental investigations, providing a model for treatment of human disease.\n\n\nBy \"therapeutically effective amount\" of a compound means the amount of the compound that, upon administration, provides the desired beneficial result in a host or patient in need thereof. This amount depends on a number of factors, including, for example, the age and weight of the host, the precise condition that requires treatment and its severity, the nature of the formulation, and the method of administration, and is ultimately determined by the a physician or veterinarian. An effective amount of a compound according to the invention for the treatment of neoplastic growth, for example, is generally in the range from 0.1 to 100 mg/kg/day of body weight of the host recipient. More particularly it is in the range from 1 to 10 mg/kg/day of body weight. Thus, the actual amount per day for an adult mammal weighing 70 kg is usually between 70 and 700 mg, where this amount can be administered as a single dose per day, or may also be administered in a series of partial doses such as, for example, two, three, four, five or six per day, so that the total daily dose is the same. An effective amount of a salt or solvate or of a physiologically functional derivative thereof can be determined as the fraction of the effective amount of the compound according to the invention per se. It can be assumed that similar doses are suitable for the treatment of other conditions mentioned above.\n\n\nAny drug dosage depends upon the specific compound active agent, the specific disease, patient status, etc. A therapeutic dose typically is considered sufficient at the level at which it reduces the undesired cell population in the target tissue while the viability of the patient is maintained. The treatment is generally continued until a reduction in cell population has occurred, for example, minimally about 50% reduction in cell burden, and may be continued until essentially no more undesired cells are detected in the body.\n\n\n- 99 - \n\n III. Pharmaceutical Compositions, Dosages and Routes of Administration\n\n\nWhile compounds of the present invention can be administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present them as a pharmaceutical composition. Thus, one aspect of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and optionally one or more other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) are \"acceptable\" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" includes vehicles, diluents, excipients and other elements appropriate for incorporation into a pharmaceutical formulation.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of Formula I may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing an effective dose, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose typically varies with the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and the route of administration. The dose, and perhaps the dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, body weight and response of the individual patient. In general, the total daily dose ranges from about 0.1 mg per day to about 7000 mg per day, preferably about 1 mg per day to about 100 mg per day, and more preferably, about 25 mg per day to about 50 mg per day, in single or divided doses. Preferred dosage unit formulations are those that comprise a daily dose or partial dose, as indicated above, or a corresponding fraction thereof of an active ingredient. Furthermore, pharmaceutical formulations of this type can be prepared using a process that is generally known in the pharmaceutical art. In some embodiments, the total daily dose may range from about 50 mg to about 500 mg per day, and preferably, about 100 mg to about 500 mg per day. Normally it is recommended that children, patients over 65 years old, and those with impaired renal or hepatic function, initially receive low doses and that the dosage is titrated based on individual responses and/or blood levels. It may be necessary to use dosages outside these ranges in some cases, as will be apparent to those in the art. Further, it is noted \n\n that the clinician or treating physician knows how and when to interrupt, adjust or terminate therapy in conjunction with individual patient's response.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations can be adapted for administration via any desired suitable method, for example by oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual or transdermal), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intradermal) methods. Such formulations can be prepared using all processes known in the pharmaceutical art by, for example, combining the active ingredient with the excipient(s) or adjuvant(s).\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration can be administered as separate units, such as, for example, capsules or tablets; powders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or foam foods; or oil-in-water liquid emulsions or water-in-oil liquid emulsions. The active ingredient also may be present as a bolus, electuary or paste.\n\n\nThus, for example, in the case of oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active-ingredient component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable inert excipient, such as, for example, ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Powders are prepared by comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing it with a pharmaceutical excipient comminuted in a similar manner, such as, for example, an edible carbohydrate like starch or mannitol. A flavor, preservative, dispersant and dye may likewise be present.\n\n\nCapsules are produced by preparing a powder mixture as described above and filling shaped gelatin shells therewith. Glidants and lubricants, such as, for example, highly disperse silicic acid, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate or polyethylene glycol in solid form, can be added to the powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrant or solubiliser like agar-agar, calcium carbonate or sodium carbonate, may likewise be added in order to improve the availability of the medicament after the capsule has been taken.\n\n\nIn addition, if desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants and disintegrants as well as dyes can be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars, such as, for example, glucose or beta-lactose, sweeteners made from maize, natural and synthetic rubber like acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, and the like. \n\n The lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. The disintegrants include, without being restricted hereto, starch, methylcellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like. Tablets are formulated by preparing a powder mixture, granulating or dry-pressing the mixture, adding a lubricant and a disintegrant and pressing the entire mixture to give tablets. A powder mixture is prepared by mixing the compound comminuted in a suitable manner with a diluent or a base as described above, and optionally with a binder, such as carboxymethylcellulose, an alginate, gelatine or polyvinylpyrrolidone, a dissolution retardant, such as, for example, paraffin, an absorption accelerator, such as a quaternary salt, and/or an absorbent like bentonite, kaolin or dicalcium phosphate. The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting it with a binder, such as a syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage or solutions of cellulose or polymer materials, and pressing it through a sieve. As an alternative to granulation, the powder mixture can be run through a tabletting machine, giving lumps of non-uniform shape, which are broken up to form granules. The granules can be lubricated by addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil in order to prevent sticking to the tablet casting molds. The lubricated mixture is then pressed to give tablets. The compounds according to the invention can also be combined with a free-flowing inert excipient and then pressed directly to give tablets without carrying out the granulation or dry- pressing steps. A transparent or opaque protective layer consisting of a shellac-sealing layer, a layer of sugar or polymer material, and a gloss layer of wax may be present. Dyes can be added to these coatings in order to be able to differentiate between different dosage units. Oral liquids, such as solutions, syrups and elixirs, can be prepared in the form of dosage units so that a given quantity comprises a pre-specified amount of the compound. Syrups can be prepared by dissolving the compound in an aqueous solution with a suitable flavour, while elixirs are prepared using a non-toxic alcoholic vehicle. Suspensions can be formulated by dispersion of a compound of Formula I in a non-toxic vehicle. Solubilisers and emulsifiers like ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and poly oxy ethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavor additives, such as peppermint oil, natural sweeteners or saccharin, or other artificial sweeteners and the like, also can be added. \n\n The unit dosage formulations for oral administration, if desired, can be encapsulated in microcapsules. The formulation can also be prepared in such a way that the release is extended or retarded, such as, for example, by coating or embedding of particulate material in polymers, wax and the like. The compounds of Formula I and salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives thereof can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, like small or large unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from various phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines. The compounds of Formula I and salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives thereof also can be delivered using monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are coupled. The compounds further may be coupled to soluble polymers as targeted medicament carriers. Such polymers encompass polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidophenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidophenol or polyethylene oxide polylysine, substituted by palmitoyl radicals. The compounds may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers which are suitable for achieving controlled release of a medicament, for example polylactic acid, poly-epsilon- caprolactone, polyhydroxybutyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydroxypyrans, polycyanoacrylates and crosslinked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for transdermal administration can be administered as independent plasters for extended, close contact with the epidermis of the recipient. Thus, for example, the active ingredient can be delivered from the plaster by iontophoresis, as described in general terms in Pharmaceutical Research, (1986) 3(6):318.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compounds adapted for topical administration can be formulated as ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols or oils. For the treatment of the eye or other external tissue, for example mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as topical ointment or cream. In the case of a formulation to give an ointment, the active ingredient can be employed either \n\n with a paraffinic or a water-miscible cream base. Alternatively, the active ingredient can be formulated to give a cream with an oil-in-water cream base or a water-in-oil base. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical application to the eye include eye drops, in which the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, in particular an aqueous solvent.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical application in the mouth encompass lozenges, pastilles and mouthwashes.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for rectal administration can be administered in the form of suppositories or enemas. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for nasal administration in which the carrier substance is a solid comprise a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range 20-500 microns, which is administered by rapid inhalation via the nasal passages from a container containing the powder held close to the nose. Suitable formulations for administration as nasal spray or nose drops with a liquid as carrier substance encompass solutions of the active-ingredient in water or oil.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for administration by inhalation encompass finely particulate dusts or mists, which can be generated by various types of pressurised dispensers with aerosols, nebulisers or insufflators.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for vaginal administration can be administered as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions comprising antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostatics and solutes, by means of which the formulation is rendered isotonic with the blood of the recipient to be treated; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions, which may comprise suspension media and thickeners. The formulations can be administered in single-dose or multidose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and stored in freeze-dried (lyophilised) state, so that only the addition of the sterile carrier liquid, for example water for injection purposes, immediately before use is necessary. Injection solutions and suspensions prepared in accordance with the recipe can be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Formulations for \n\n rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with the usual carriers such as cocoa butter or polyethylene glycol. Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example, buccally or sublingually, include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a basis such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.\n\n\nThe formulations may also comprise other agents usual in the art with respect to the particular type of formulation. Thus, for example, formulations that are suitable for oral administration may comprise flavors. A formulation of the compound or composition includes any suitable form for parenteral (subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, peritoneal and intraarticular), rectal, ionotophoretic, intranasal, inhalation, and oral (including dermal, buccal, sublingual and intraocular) administration. The most suitable route will depend upon the condition and disorder of the recipient. All methods include the step of bringing into association a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof (\"active ingredient\") with the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier that constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping this formulation into the desired product shape. Oral formulations are well known to those skilled in the art, and general methods for preparing them are found in any standard pharmacy textbook, for example, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy., A.R. Gennaro, ed. (1995), Lippincott.\n\n\nOne aspect of the present invention contemplates the treatment of the disease/condition with the pharmaceutically active agent that may be sold in kit form. The kit comprises a compound of the present invention contained within a syringe, box, bag, and the like. Typically, the kit comprises directions for the administration of the compound. The kit form is particularly advantageous when different dosage concentrations and/or forms (e.g., oral and parenteral) are sold, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician.\n\n\nAn example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of \n\n pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). They generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. The tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. Particular dosage information normally is stamped onto each blister pack.\n\n\nIn another specific embodiment of the invention, a dispenser designed to dispense the daily doses one at a time in the order of their intended use is provided.\n\n\nIV. Methods of Treatment or Prevention\n\n\nIn a further aspect the invention provides a method for treating or preventing a disease or condition that is a member selected from kinase-related malfunction, and especially for diseases such as angiogenesis, cancers, tumor formation, growth and propagation, arteriosclerosis, ocular diseases, such as age-induced macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularisation and diabetic retinopathy, inflammatory diseases, arthritis, thrombosis, fibrosis, glomerulonephritis, neurodegeneration, psoriasis, restenosis, wound healing, transplant rejection, metabolic diseases, autoimmune diseases, haematological diseases, cirrhosis, diabetes and vascular and immune diseases in mammals. The method includes administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, prodrug, tautomer, enantiomer, or racemic mix thereof:\n\n\nSubjects for treatment according to the present invention include humans (patients) and other mammals in need of therapy for the stated condition.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention possess unique pharmacological characteristics with respect to inhibition of cellular division and influence the activity of the Aurora kinase enzymes in cells. Therefore, these compounds are effective in treating conditions and disorders, especially cancer-related tumors and disorders, which are modulated by Aurora kinase activity. In one embodiment, compounds of the invention are associated with diminished side effects compared to other current standards of treatment. \n\n Compounds of the invention are typically more selective than known anticancer drugs, and demonstrate higher selectivity for inhibiting certain protein kinase activity. The compounds also exhibit an advantageous profile of activity including good bioavailability. Accordingly, they offer advantages over many art-known methods for treating disorders associated with unregulated or disturbed protein kinase activity.\n\n\nThe anti-cancer treatment defined herein may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve, in addition to the compound of the invention, conventional surgery or radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Such chemotherapy may include one or more of the following categories of anti- tumour agents:\n\n\n(i) antiproliferative/antineoplastic/DNA-damaging agents and combinations thereof, as used in medical
