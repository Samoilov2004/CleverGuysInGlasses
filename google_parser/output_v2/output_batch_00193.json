The contents of each of these applications is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compounds that are inhibitors of cysteine proteinases, pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds, and their use in therapy. More specifically, but not exclusively, the invention relates to compounds that are inhibitors of cathepsin K and related cysteine proteinases of the CA clan. Such compounds are particularly useful for the in vivo therapeutic treatment of diseases in which participation of a cysteine proteinase is implicated.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nProteinases form a substantial group of biological molecules which to date constitute approximately 2% of all the gene products identified following analysis of several completed genome sequencing programmes. Proteinases have evolved to participate in an enormous range of biological processes, mediating their effect by cleavage of peptide amide bonds within the myriad of proteins found in nature. this hydrolytic action is performed by initially recognising, then binding to, particular three-dimensional electronic surfaces displayed by a protein, which align the bond for cleavage precisely within the proteinase catalytic site. Catalytic hydrolysis then commences through nucleophilic attach of the amide bond to be cleaved either via an amino acid side-chain of the proteinase. Proteinases in which the attacking nucleophile is the thiol side-chain of a Cys residue are know as cysteine proteinases. The general classification of ‘cysteine proteinase’ contains many members found in a wide range of organisms from viruses, bacteria, protozoa, plants and fungi to mammals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCathepsin K and indeed many other crucial proteinases belong to the papain-like CAC1 family. Cysteine proteinases are classified into ‘clans’ based upon a similarity in the three-dimensional structure or a conserved arrangement of catalytic residues within the proteinase primary sequence. Additionally, ‘clans’ may be further classified into ‘families; in which each proteinase shares a statistically significant relationship with other members when comparing the portions or amino acid sequence with constitute the parts responsible for the proteinase activity (see Barrett, A. J et al, in ‘Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes’, Eds. Barrett, A. J., Rawlings, N. D., and Woessner, J. F. Publ. Academic Press, 1998, for a thorough discussion).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo date, cysteine proteinases have been classified into five clans, CA, CB, CC, CD and CE (Barrett, A. S. et al, 1998). A proteinase from the tropical papaya fruit ‘papain’ forms the foundation of clan CA, which currently contains over 80 distinct and complete entries in various sequence databases, with many more expected from the current genome sequencing efforts. Proteinases of clan CA/family C1 have been implicated in a multitude of house-keeping roles and disease processes. e.g. human proteinases such as cathepsin K (osteoporosis, osteoarthritis), cathepsin S (multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disorders), cathepsin L (metastases), cathepsin B (metastases, arthritis), cathepsin F (antigen processing), cathepsin V (T-cell selection), dipeptidyl peptidase I (granulocyte serine proteinase activation) or parasitic proteinases such as falcipain (malaria parasite \nPlasmodium falciparum\n) and cruzipain (\nTrypanosoma cruzi \ninfection). Recently a bacterial proteinase, staphylopain (\nS. aureus \ninfection) has also been tentatively assigned to clan CA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nX-ray crystallographic structures are available for a range of the above mentioned proteinases in complex with a range of inhibitors e.g. papain (PDB entries, 1pad, 1pe6, 1pip, 1pop, 4pad, 5pad, 6pad, 1 ppp, 1the, 1csb, 1huc), cathepsin K (1au0, 1au2, 1au3, 1au4, 1atk, 1mem, 1bgo, 1ayw, 1ayu, 1n16, 1nlj, 1q6k, 1snk, 1tu6), cathepsin L (1 cs8, 1mhw), cathepsin S (1glo, 1ms6, 1npz), cathepsin V (1fh0), dipeptidyl peptidase (1jqp, 1k3b), cathepsin B (1gmy, 1csb), cathepsin F (1m6d), cruzain (a recombinant form of cruzipain see Eakin, A. E. et al, 268(9), 6115-6118, 1993) (1ewp, 1aim, 2aim, 1F29, 1F2A, 1F2B, 1F2C), staphylopain (1cv8). Each of the structures displays a similar overall active-site topology, as would be expected by their ‘clan’ and ‘family’ classification and such structural similarity exemplifies one aspect of the difficulties involved in discovering a selective inhibitor of cathepsin K suitable for human use. However, subtle differences in terms of the depth and intricate shape of the active site groove of each CAC1 proteinase are evident, which may be exploited for selective inhibitor design. Additionally, many of the current substrate-based inhibitor complexes of CAC1 family proteinases show a series of conserved hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor and the proteinase backbone, which contribute significantly to inhibitor potency. Primarily a bidentate hydrogen-bond is observed between the proteinase Gly66 (C═O)/inhibitor N—H and the proteinase Gly66(NH)/inhibitor (C═O), where the inhibitor (C═O) and (NH) are provided by an amino acid residue \nNH\nCHR\nCO\n that constitutes the S2 sub-site binding element within the inhibitor (see Berger, A. and Schecter, I. \nPhilos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. [Biol.], \n257, 249-264, 1970 for a description of proteinase binding site nomenclature). A further hydrogen-bond between the proteinase main-chain (C═O) of asparagine or aspartic acid (158 to 163, residue number varies between proteinases) and an inhibitor (N—H) is often observed, where the inhibitor (N—H) is provided by the S1 sub-site binding element within the inhibitor. Thus, the motif X—\nNH\nCHR\nCO\n—\nNH\n—Y is widely observed amongst the prior art substrate-based inhibitors of CAC1 proteinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCathepsin K is thought to be significant in diseases involving excessive loss of bone or cartilage. Bone consists of a protein matrix incorporating hydroxyapatite crystals. About 90% of the structural protein of the matrix is type I collagen, with the remainder comprising various non-collagenous proteins such as osteocalcin, proteoglycans, osteopontin, osteonectin, thrombospondin, fibronectin and bone sialoprotein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSkeletal bone is not a static structure but continually undergoes a cycle of bone resorption and replacement. Bone resorption is carried out by osteoclasts, which are multinuclear cells of haematopoietic lineage. Osteoclasts adhere to the bone surface and form a tight sealing zone. The membrane on the apical surface of the osteoclasts is folded so as to create a closed extracellular compartment between the osteoclast and the bone surface, which is acidified by proton pumps in the osteoclast membrane. Proteolytic enzymes are secreted into the compartment from the osteoclast. The high acidity in the compartment causes the hydroxyapatite at the surface of the bone to be dissolved and the proteolytic enzymes break down the protein matrix causing a resorption lacuna to be formed. Following bone resorption, osteoblasts produce a new protein matrix that is subsequently mineralised.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn disease states such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease, the bone resorption and replacement cycle is disrupted leading to a net loss of bone with each cycle. This leads to weakening of the bone and therefore to increased risk of bone fracture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCathepsin K is expressed at a high level in osteoclasts and is therefore thought to be essential for bone resorption. Thus, selective inhibition of cathepsin K is likely to be effective in the treatment of diseases involving excessive bone loss. These include osteoporosis, gingival diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis, Paget's disease, hypercalaemia of malignancy and metabolic bone disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to osteoclasts, high levels of cathepsin K are also found in chondroclasts from the synovium of osteoarthritic patients. It therefore appears that cathepsin K inhibitors will be of use in the treatment of diseases involving matrix or cartilage degradation, in particular osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElevated levels of cathepsin K are also found in metastatic neoplastic cells which suggests that cathepsin K inhibitors may also be useful for treating certain neoplastic diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the prior art, the development of cysteine proteinase inhibitors for human use has recently been an area of intense activity (e.g. see Deaton, D. N. and Kumar, S., Prog. Med. Chem. 42, 245-375, 2004; Bromine, D. and Kaleta, J., Curr. Pharm. Des., 8, 1639-1658, 2002; Kim, W. and Kang, K., Expert Opin. Ther.

Considering the CAC1 family members, particular emphasis has been placed upon the development of inhibitors of human cathepsins, primarily cathepsin K (osteoporosis), cathepsin S (autoimmune disorders), cathepsin L (metastases), cathepsin B (metastases, arthritis), cathepsin F (antigen processing), cathepsin V (T-cell selection) and dipeptidyl peptidase I (granulocyte serine proteinase activation), through the use of peptide and peptidomimetic nitriles (e.g. see WO-A-03041649, WO-A-03037892, WO-A-03029200, WO-A-02051983, WO-A-02020485, US-A-20020086996, WO-A-01096285, WO-A-0109910, WO-A-0051998, WO-A-0119816, WO-A-9924460, WO-A-0049008, WO-A-0048992, WO-A-0049007, WO-A-0130772, WO-A-0055125, WO-A-0055126, WO-A-0119808, WO-A-0149288, WO-A-0147886), linear and cyclic peptide and peptidomimetic ketones (e.g. see Veber, D.

For example, WO-A-9850533 and WO-A-0029408 describe compounds that may be referred to as cyclic ketones (e.g. 1′a-f) and are inhibitors of cysteine proteinases with a particular reference towards papain family proteinases and as a most preferred embodiment, cathepsin K. WO-A-9850533 describes compounds subsequently detailed in the literature as potent inhibitors of cathepsin K with good oral bioavailability (Witherington, J., ‘Tetrahydrofurans as Selective Cathepsin K Inhibitors’, RSC meeting, Burlington House, London, 1999). The compounds of WO-A-9850533 were reported to bind to cathepsin K through the formation of a reversible covalent bond between the tetrahydrofuran carbonyl and the active site catalytic cysteine residue (Witherington, J., 1999). Additionally, the same cyclic ketone compounds are described in WO-A-9953039 as part of a wide-ranging description of inhibitors of cysteine proteinases associated with parasitic diseases, with particular reference to the treatment of malaria by inhibition of falcipain.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe initial cyclic inhibitors of GSK were based upon potent, selective and reversible 3-amido-tetrahydrofuran-4-ones [1′a], 3-amidopyrrolidin-4-ones [1′b], 4-amido-tetrahydropyran-3-ones [1′c], 4-amidopiperidin-3-ones [1′d] and 4-amidoazepan-3-ones [1′e, 1′f] (shown above) [see (a) Marquis, R. W. et al, J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 725, and references cited therein; (b) Marquis, R. W. et al, J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 1380, and references cited therein; (c) Yamashita, D. S. et al, J. Med. Chem. 2006, 49(5), 1597-1612].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther studies revealed that cyclic ketones [1′], in particular the five-membered ring analogues [1′a] and [1′b], suffered from configurational instability due to facile epimerisation at the centre situated a to the ketone [Marquis, R. W. et al, J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 1380; Fenwick, A. E. et al, J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001, 11, 199; WO 00/69855]. This precluded the pre-clinical optimisation of inhibitors of formulae [1′a-d] and led to the development of the configurationally more stable azepanone series [1′e], providing the cathepsin K inhibitor clinical candidate relacatib [1′f]. However, literature clearly states that azepanones are still prone to epimerisation and indeed relacatib [1′f] is reported to exist as a 9:1 thermodynamic mixture of 4-S and 4-R isomers [Yamashita, D. S. et al, J. Med. Chem., 2006, 49(5), 1597-1612]. As an alternative to the ring expansion approach, alkylation of the α-carbon removes the ability of cyclic ketones [1′] to undergo α-enolisation and hence leads to configurational stability. However, studies have shown that α-methylation in the 3-amidopyrrolidin-4-one [1′b] system results in a substantial loss in potency versus cathepsin K from K\ni,app\n≈0.18 to 50 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclic ketone compounds of WO-A-0069855 are considered to be an advance on compounds of WO-A-9850533 due to the presence of the β-substituent on the cyclic ketone ring system that provides improved chiral stability to the α-carbon of the cyclic ketone ring system. However, the compounds of WO-A-0069855 and indeed those of WO-A-9850533 describe a requirement for the presence of the potential hydrogen-bonding motif X—\nNH\nCHR\nCO\n—\nNH\n—Y that is widely observed amongst the prior art substrate-based inhibitors of CAC1 proteinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore recent studies have investigated 5,5-bicyclic systems as inhibitors of CAC1 proteinases, for example, N-(3-oxo-hexahydrocyclopenta[b]furan-3a-yl)acylamide bicyclic ketones [2′] [(a) Quibell, M.; Ramjee, M. K., WO 02/57246; (b) Watts, J. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004, 12, 2903-2925], tetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one based scaffolds [3′] [(a) Quibell, M. WO02/57270; (b) Quibell, M. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2004, 12, 5689-5710], cis-6-oxohexahydro-2-oxa-1,4-diazapentalene and cis-6-oxo-hexahydropyrrolo[3,2-c]pyrazole based scaffolds [4′] [Wang, Y. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2005, 15, 1327-1331], and cis-hexahydropyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one based scaffolds [5′] [a) Quibell, M. WO04/07501; (b) Quibell, M. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2005, 13, 609-625].\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies have shown that the above-described 5,5-bicyclic systems exhibit promising potency as inhibitors of a range of therapeutically attractive mammalian and parasitic CAC1 cysteinyl proteinase targets. Moreover, the 5,5-bicyclic series are chirally stable due to a marked energetic preference for a cis-fused rather than a trans-fused geometry. This chiral stability provides a major advance when compared to monocyclic systems that often show limited potential for preclinical development due to chiral instability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT applications WO-A-02057270 and WO-A-04007501 describe bicyclic compounds in which the chirality of the α-aminoketone is stabilised (for a review of energetic considerations within fused ring systems see (a) Toromanoff, E. \nTetrahedron Report No \n96, 36, 2809-2931, 1980; (b) Eliel, E. L. et. al. \nStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\n, Wiley: New York, 1-1267, 1994). These compounds do not contain the X—\nNH\nCHR\nCO\n—\nNH\n—Y motif and yet the compounds are highly potent inhibitors across a broad range of CAC1 cysteine proteinases. In particular, certain of the compounds are potent and selective inhibitors of a range of mammalian and parasitic CAC1 proteinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore recently, Quibell, M. et al (\nBioorg. Med. Chem. \n12, 5689-5710, 2004) disclosed two potent and selective cathepsin K inhibitors having a tetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one core, along with in vitro potency and in vitro selectivity data. Further kinetic parameters such as enzyme association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rates were disclosed, as well as basic physiochemical parameters such as plasma and microsome stability, Caco-2 permeability and LogD (pH\n7.4\n) measurements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present inventors have now discovered a small genus of 6-alkyltetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-ones that exhibit potent in vitro inhibition versus human cathepsin K.\n\n\n \nSTATEMENT OF INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nA first aspect of the invention relates to a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, complex or pro-drug thereof,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein:\n\n\none of R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nis H, and the other is selected from C\n1-8\n-alkyl, C\n3-6\n-cycloalkyl and C\n1-8\n-alkyl-C\n5-10\n-aryl;\n\n\nR\n3 \nis selected from tert-butylmethyl, iso-propylmethyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and 1-methylcyclopentyl;\n\n\nR\n9 \nis selected from the following:\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein:\n\n\nR\n4 \nis selected from C\n1-8\n-alkyl and C\n3-8\n-cycloalkyl;\n\n\nG is selected from:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCH\n1\n, \nCMe and N;\n\n\nE is selected from:\n\n \nO, S, \nSO\n2\n, \nNH, \nNMe and N-oxide (\nN→O);\n\n\nJ and R are independently selected from:\n\n \n \nCH, N and N-oxide (\nN→O); and\n\n\nR\n41 \nis selected from amino, methylamino, dimethylamino, isopropylamino, isopropyl(methyl)amino, cyclopropylamino, cyclopropyl(methyl)amino, cyclopentylamino, morpholino, piperidin-1-yl, piperidin-1-ylmethyl, morpholinomethyl, 4-methylpiperazin-1-yl, 4-(2-methoxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl, 1-morpholino ethyl, 1-(dimethylamino)ethyl, 1-(methylamino)ethyl, 4-fluoro-1-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl, 4,4-difluoropiperidin-1-yl, 1-methylpiperidin-4-yl, pyridin-3-ylamino, pyridin-2-ylamino, 1-methylpyrrolidin-3-yl, methyl, isopropyl.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, compounds of formula (I) exhibit surprisingly high efficacies for human cathepsin K.

Preferred examples include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, hexyl, heptyl and any simple isomers thereof. Suitable substituents include, for example, one or more C\n1-6 \nalkoxy, OH, COOH, COOMe, NH\n2\n, NMe\n2\n, NHMe, NO\n2\n, CN, CF\n3 \nand/or halo groups. Additionally, where the alkyl group contains two or more contiguous carbon atoms, an alkene group (—CH═CH—) or alkyne group (—C≡C—) may be present. Furthermore, the alkyl group may optionally contain one or more heteroatoms for example, to give ethers, thioethers, sulphones, sulphonamides, substituted amines, amidines, guanidines, carboxylic acids, carboxamides. If the heteroatom is located at a chain terminus then it is appropriately substituted with one or two hydrogen atoms. For example, the group CH\n3\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— is defined within ‘alkyl’ as a C\n4 \nalkyl that contains a centrally positioned heteroatom whereas the group CH\n3\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— is defined within ‘alkyl’ as an unsubstituted C\n4 \nalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the alkyl group is a C\n1-8 \nalkyl group, more preferably a C\n1-6 \ngroup, even more preferably a C\n1-4 \nalkyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “cycloalkyl” refers to a cyclic alkyl group (i.e. a carbocyclic ring) which may be substituted (mono- or poly-) or unsubstituted.

Preferably, the cycloalkyl group is a C\n3-8 \ncycloalkyl group, more preferably a C\n3-6\n-cycloalkyl, even more preferably a C\n3-4 \ncycloalkyl group. Examples include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and the like. In addition, the carbocyclic ring itself may optionally contain one or more heteroatoms, for example, to give a heterocycloalkyl group such as tetrahydrofuran, pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine or morpholine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term ‘alkyl-aryl’ as applied herein includes an alkyl group as defined above in combination with an aryl group. The aryl group may be an aromatic ring, for, example, a stable 5 or 6-membered monocyclic or a stable 9 or 10-membered bicyclic ring which is unsaturated. The aryl group may optionally comprise one or more heteroatoms selected from O, N and S. In addition, the aryl group may be optionally substituted, for example, by one or more C\n1-6 \nalkoxy, OH, COOH, COOMe, NH\n2\n, NMe\n2\n, NHMe, NO\n2\n, CN, CF\n3 \nand/or halo groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the alkyl-aryl group is a C\n1-8\n-alkyl-C\n5-10\n-aryl group, even more preferably a C\n1-8\n-alkyl-phenyl group. More preferably still, the alkyl-aryl group is selected from CH\n2\nPh and CH\n2\nOCH\n2\nPh.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n‘Halogen’ or ‘halo’ as applied herein encompasses F, Cl, Br, I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n‘Heteroatom’ as applied herein encompasses O, S, P and N, more preferably, O, S and N.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes all salts, hydrates, solvates, complexes and prodrugs of the compounds of this invention.

from Examples 1-8, 12, 16-18, 22-30 and 38-42 described hereinbelow.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nA further aspect of the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention admixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, excipients or carriers. Other active materials may also be present, as may be considered appropriate or advisable for the disease or condition being treated or prevented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEven though the compounds of the present invention (including their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters and pharmaceutically acceptable solvates) can be administered alone, they will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent, particularly for human therapy. The pharmaceutical compositions may be for human or animal usage in human and veterinary medicine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of such suitable excipients for the various different forms of pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be found in the “Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 2\nnd \nEdition, (1994), Edited by A Wade and P J Weller. The carrier, or, if more than one be present, each of the carriers, must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable carriers include lactose, starch, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sorbitol and the like. Examples of suitable diluents include ethanol, glycerol and water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe choice of pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent can be selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise as, or in addition to, the carrier, excipient or diluent any suitable binder(s), lubricant(s), suspending agent(s), coating agent(s), solubilising agent(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose, anhydrous lactose, free-flow lactose, beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums, such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethyl cellulose and polyethylene glycol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable lubricants include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreservatives, stabilizers, dyes and even flavoring agents may be provided in the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of preservatives include sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Antioxidants and suspending agents may be also used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition as described above, the process comprising bringing the active compound(s) into association with the carrier, for example by admixture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active agent with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. The invention extends to methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising bringing a compound of general formula (I) in conjunction or association with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier or vehicle.\n\n\n \nSalts/Esters\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can be present as salts or esters, in particular pharmaceutically and veterinarily acceptable salts or esters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention include suitable acid addition or base salts thereof. A review of suitable pharmaceutical salts may be found in Berge et al, J Pharm Sci, 66, 1-19 (1977). Salts are formed, for example with strong inorganic acids such as mineral acids, e.g. hydrohalic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide and hydroiodide, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid sulphate, bisulphate, hemisulphate, thiocyanate, persulphate and sulphonic acids; with strong organic carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 4 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with aminoacids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid. Salts which are not pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable may still be valuable as intermediates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred salts include, for example, acetate, trifluoroacetate, lactate, gluconate, citrate, tartrate, maleate, malate, pantothenate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, butyrate, digluconate, cyclopentanate, glucoheptanate, glycerophosphate, oxalate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, nicotinate, palmoate, pectinate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, proprionate, tartrate, lactobionate, pivolate, camphorate, undecanoate and succinate, organic sulphonic acids such as methanesulphonate, ethanesulphonate, 2-hydroxyethane sulphonate, camphorsulphonate, 2-naphthalenesulphonate, benzenesulphonate, p-chlorobenzenesulphonate and p-toluenesulphonate; and inorganic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, bisulphate, hemisulphate, thiocyanate, persulphate, phosphoric and sulphonic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEsters are formed either using organic acids or alcohols/hydroxides, depending on the functional group being esterified. Organic acids include carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 12 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with aminoacids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid. Suitable hydroxides include inorganic hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide. Alcohols include alkanealcohols of 1-12 carbon atoms which may be unsubstituted or substituted, e.g. by a halogen).\n\n\n \nEnantiomers/Tautomers\n\n\n \n \n \nIn all aspects of the present invention previously discussed, the invention includes, where appropriate all enantiomers, diastereoisomers and tautomers of the compounds of the invention. The person skilled in the art will recognise compounds that possess optical properties (one or more chiral carbon atoms) or tautomeric characteristics. The corresponding enantiomers and/or tautomers may be isolated/prepared by methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnantiomers are characterised by the absolute configuration of their chiral centres and described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Calm, Ingold and Prelog. Such conventions are well known in the art (e.g. see ‘Advanced Organic Chemistry’, 3rd edition, ed. March, J., John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1985).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention containing a chiral centre may be used as a racemic mixture, an enantiomerically enriched mixture, or the racemic mixture may be separated using well-known techniques and an individual enantiomer may be used alone.\n\n\n \nStereo and Geometric Isomers\n\n\n \n \n \nSome of the compounds of the invention may exist as stereoisomers and/or geometric isomers—e.g. they may possess one or more asymmetric and/or geometric centres and so may exist in two or more stereoisomeric and/or geometric forms. The present invention contemplates the use of all the individual stereoisomers and geometric isomers of those inhibitor agents, and mixtures thereof. The terms used in the claims encompass these forms, provided said forms retain the appropriate functional activity (though not necessarily to the same degree).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of the agent or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. An isotopic variation of an agent of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine and chlorine such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n17\nO, \n18\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF and \n36\nCl, respectively. Certain isotopic variations of the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as \n3\nH or \n14\nC is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated, i.e., \n3\nH, and carbon-14, i.e., \n14\nC, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., \n2\nH, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. For example, the invention includes compounds of general formula (I) where any hydrogen atom has been replaced by a deuterium atom. Isotopic variations of the agent of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of this invention can generally be prepared by conventional procedures using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents.\n\n\n \nProdrugs\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention further includes the compounds of the present invention in prodrug form, i.e. covalently bonded compounds which release the active parent drug according to general formula (I) in vivo. Such prodrugs are generally compounds of the invention wherein one or more appropriate groups have been modified such that the modification may be reversed upon administration to a human or mammalian subject. Reversion is usually performed by an enzyme naturally present in such subject, though it is possible for a second agent to be administered together with such a prodrug in order to perform the reversion in vivo. Examples of such modifications include ester (for example, any of those described above), wherein the reversion may be carried out be an esterase etc. Other such systems will be well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA prodrug may for example constitute a ketal or hemiketal derivative of the exocyclic ketone functionality present in the 6-alkyltetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one scaffold.\n\n\n \nSolvates\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes solvate forms of the compounds of the present invention. The terms used in the claims encompass these forms.\n\n\n \nPolymorphs\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention further relates to the compounds of the present invention in their various crystalline forms, polymorphic forms and (an)hydrous forms. It is well established within the pharmaceutical industry that chemical compounds may be isolated in any of such forms by slightly varying the method of purification and or isolation form the solvents used in the synthetic preparation of such compounds.\n\n\n \nAssays\n\n\n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention relates to the use of a compound of the invention as defined hereinabove in an assay for identifying further candidate compounds that influence the activity of a cysteine proteinase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the assay is capable of identifying candidate compounds that are capable of inhibiting one or more CAC1 cysteine proteinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore preferably, the assay is a competitive binding assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the candidate compound is generated by conventional SAR modification of a compound of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “conventional SAR modification” refers to standard methods known in the art for varying a given compound by way of chemical derivatisation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one aspect, the identified compound may act as a model (for example, a template) for the development of other compounds. The compounds employed in such a test may be free in solution, affixed to a solid support, borne on a cell surface, or located intracellularly. The abolition of activity or the formation of binding complexes between the compound and the agent being tested may be measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay of the present invention may be a screen, whereby a number of agents are tested. In one aspect, the assay method of the present invention is a high through-put screen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralising antibodies capable of binding a compound specifically compete with a test compound for binding to a compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother technique for screening provides for high throughput screening (HTS) of agents having suitable binding affinity to the substances and is based upon the method described in detail in WO 84/03564.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is expected that the assay methods of the present invention will be suitable for both small and large-scale screening of test compounds as well as in quantitative assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the competitive binding assay comprises contacting a compound of the invention with a cysteine proteinase in the presence of a known substrate of said enzyme and detecting any change in the interaction between said cysteine proteinase and said known substrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the invention provides a method of detecting the binding of a ligand to a cysteine proteinase, said method comprising the steps of:\n\n \n \n \n(i) contacting a ligand with cysteine proteinase in the presence of a known substrate of said enzyme;\n \n(ii) detecting any change in the interaction between said enzyme and said known substrate;\n\n\nand wherein said ligand is a compound of the invention.\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \nOne aspect of the invention relates to a process comprising the steps of:\n\n \n \n \n(a) performing an assay method described hereinabove;\n \n(b) identifying one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain; and\n \n(c) preparing a quantity of said one or more ligands.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention provides a process comprising the steps of:\n\n \n \n \n(a) performing an assay method described hereinabove;\n \n(b) identifying one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain; and\n \n(c) preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising said one or more ligands.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention provides a process comprising the steps of:\n\n \n \n \n(a) performing an assay method described hereinabove;\n \n(b) identifying one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain;\n \n(c) modifying said one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain;\n \n(d) performing the assay method described hereinabove;\n \n(e) optionally preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising said one or more ligands.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to a ligand identified by the method described hereinabove.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another aspect of the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a ligand identified by the method described hereinabove.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention relates to the use of a ligand identified by the method described hereinabove in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of one or more disorders selected from osteoporosis, Paget's disease, Chagas's disease, malaria, gingival disease such as gingivitis or periodontitis, hypercalaemia, metabolic bone disease and diseases involving matrix or cartilage degradation, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and neoplastic diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above methods may be used to screen for a ligand useful as an inhibitor of one or more cysteine proteinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of general formula (I) are useful both as laboratory tools and as therapeutic agents. In the laboratory certain compounds of the invention are useful in establishing whether a known or newly discovered cysteine proteinase contributes a critical or at least significant biochemical function during the establishment or progression of a disease state, a process commonly referred to as ‘target validation’.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of validating a known or putative cysteine proteinase as a therapeutic target, the method comprising:\n\n\n \n \n(a) assessing the in vitro binding of a compound as described above to an isolated known or putative cysteine proteinase, providing a measure of potency; and optionally, one or more of the steps of:\n\n\n(b) assessing the binding of the compound to closely related homologous proteinases of the target and general house-keeping proteinases (e.g. trypsin) to provide a measure of selectivity;\n\n \n \n \n(c) monitoring a cell-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity, in the presence of the compound; and\n \n(d) monitoring an animal model-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity in the presence of the compound.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention therefore provides a method of validating a known or putative cysteine proteinase as a therapeutic target. Differing approaches and levels of complexity are appropriate to the effective inhibition and ‘validation’ of a particular target. In the first instance, the method comprises assessing the in vitro binding of a compound of general formula (I) to an isolated known or putative cysteine proteinase, providing a measure of ‘potency’. An additional assessment of the binding of a compound of general formula (I) to closely related homologous proteinases of the target and general house-keeping proteinases (e.g. trypsin) provides a measure of ‘selectivity’. A second level of complexity may be assessed by monitoring a cell-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity, in the presence of a compound of general formula (I). For example, an ‘osteoclast resorption assay’ has been utilised as a cell-based secondary in vitro testing system for monitoring the activity of cathepsin K and the biochemical effect of proteinase inhibitors (e.g. see WO-A-9850533). An ‘MHC-II processing—T-cell activation assay’ has been utilised as a cell-based secondary in vitro testing system for monitoring the activity of cathepsin S and the biochemical effect of proteinase inhibitors (Shi, G-P., et al, \nImmunity, \n10, 197-206, 1999). When investigating viral or bacterial infections such a marker could simply be a functional assessment of viral (e.g. count of mRNA copies) or bacterial loading and assessing the biochemical effect of proteinase inhibitors. A third level of complexity may be assessed by monitoring an animal model-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity, in the presence of a compound of general formula (I). For example, murine models of \nLeishmania \ninfection, \nP. vinckei \ninfection, malaria (inhibition of falcipain) and \nT. cruzi \ninfection (cruzipain), indicate that inhibition of cysteine proteinases that play a key role in pathogen propagation is effective in arresting disease symptoms, ‘validating’ said targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention therefore extends to the use of a compound of general formula (I) in the validation of a known or putative cysteine proteinase as a therapeutic target.\n\n\n \nBiological Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are structurally distinct from the prior art (e.g. WO-A-02057270; Quibell, M. et. al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 13, 609-625, 2005; Quibell M, et al Bioorg. Med. Chem., 12, 5689-5710, 2004) in that a 6-alkyl substituent is an integral part of the present invention and this provides surprisingly high efficacies for human cathepsin K. Indeed, all of the compounds of the present invention prepared to date exhibit potent in vitro inhibition versus human cathepsin K with Ki<10 nM. In contrast, the majority of the eighty-two prior art compounds detailed in WO-A-02057270 are significantly less potent against human cathepsin K than the compounds of the present invention and in the majority of examples greater than 1000-fold less potent (for example see table 2). The closest prior art, compound (42) (Quibell, M. et. al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 13, 609-625, 2005), exhibits a 3.5-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin K upon addition of a 6-(R)-Me substituent (EXAMPLE 1); an 11.6-fold improvement upon addition of a 6-(S)-Me substituent (EXAMPLE 5); a 5.7-fold improvement upon addition of a 6-(R)—CHF\n2 \nsubstituent (EXAMPLE 8) and a 10.9-fold improvement upon addition of a 6-(S)—CHF\n2 \nsubstituent (EXAMPLE 12). Introduction of other structural changes, that are integral to the present invention, when compared to closest prior art compound (42) (Quibell, M. et. al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 13, 609-625, 2005), e.g. changing the P2 aminoacid from L-leucine to L-cyclopentylglycine and addition of a 6-(R)-Me substituent gives a 8.7-fold improvement (EXAMPLE 4); whilst addition of a 6-(S)-Me substituent gives a 24.9-fold improvement upon (EXAMPLE 7); whilst addition of a 6-(S)-Et substituent gives a 22.9-fold improvement upon (EXAMPLE 29); whilst addition of a 6-(R)-Et substituent gives a 7.3-fold improvement upon (EXAMPLE 27); whilst addition of a 6-(S)-iPr substituent gives a 18.9-fold improvement upon (EXAMPLE 30); whilst addition of a 6-(R)-iPr substituent gives a 5.8-fold improvement upon (EXAMPLE 28). Preferably, the compounds exhibit in vitro inhibition versus human cathepsin K with Ki<10 nM, more preferably <5 nM, even more preferably <2 nM and more preferably still <1 nM. The compounds of the invention exhibit high selectivity against other mammalian cathepsins displaying little or no inhibitory activity for cathepsins S, L, B and V at 1 μM compound.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Use\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of general formula (I) are useful for the in vivo treatment or prevention of diseases in which participation of a cysteine proteinase is implicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the compound of general formula I is selective for cathepsin K. As used herein, the term “selective for cathepsin K” means that the inhibitor is selective for cathepsin K over one or more other mammalian CAC1 cysteinyl proteinases for example cathepsin S, cathepsin L, cathepsin F, cathepsin B and cathepsin V. Preferably, the inhibitor exhibits a selectivity ratio for cathepsin K over other mammalian CAC1 cysteinyl proteinases of greater than 2-fold, more preferably greater than 5-fold, more preferably greater than 10-fold, even more preferably greater than 25-fold, more preferably still, greater than 50-fold or 100-fold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of general formula (I) for use in medicine, especially for preventing or treating diseases in which the disease pathology may be modified by inhibiting a cysteine proteinase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of a compound of general formula (I) in the preparation of a medicament for preventing or treating diseases in which the disease pathology may be modified by inhibiting a cysteine proteinase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain cysteine proteinases function in the normal physiological process of protein degradation in animals, including humans, e.g. in the degradation of connective tissue. However, elevated levels of these enzymes in the body can result in pathological conditions leading to disease. Thus, cysteine proteinases have been implicated in various disease states, including but not limited to, infections by \nPneumocystis carinii, Trypsanoma cruzi, Trypsanoma brucei brucei \nand \nCrithidia fusiculata\n; as well as in osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, autoimmunity, schistosomiasis, malaria, tumour metastasis, metachromatic leukodystrophy, muscular dystrophy, amytrophy, and the like (see WO-A-9404172 and EP-A-0603873 and references cited therein). Additionally, a secreted bacterial cysteine proteinase from \nS. Aureus \ncalled staphylopain has been implicated as a bacterial virulence factor (Potempa, J., et al. J. Biol. Chem., 262(6), 2664-2667, 1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is useful in the prevention and/or treatment of each of the disease states mentioned or implied above. The present invention also is useful in a method of treatment or prevention of diseases caused by pathological levels of cysteine proteinases, particularly cysteine proteinases of the papain superfamily, which methods comprise administering to an animal, particularly a mammal, most particularly a human, in need thereof a compound of the present invention. The present invention particularly provides methods for treating diseases in which cysteine proteinases are implicated, including infections by \nPneumocystis carinii, Trypsanoma cruzi, Trypsanoma brucei, Leishmania niexicana, Clostridium histolyticum, Staphylococcus aureus\n, foot-and-mouth disease virus and \nCrithidia fusiculata\n; as well as in osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, autoimmunity, schistosomiasis, malaria, tumour metastasis, metachromatic leukodystrophy, muscular dystrophy, amytrophy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibitors of cathepsin K, particularly cathepsin K-specific compounds, are useful for the treatment of osteoporosis, Paget's disease, gingival diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis, hypercalaemia of malignancy, metabolic bone disease, diseases involving matrix or cartilage degradation, in particular osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and neoplastic diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred features for each aspect of the invention are as for each other aspect mutatis mutandis.\n\n\n \nAdministration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be adapted for rectal, nasal, intrabronchial, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial and intradermal), intraperitoneal or intrathecal administration. Preferably the formulation is an orally administered formulation. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, i.e., in the form of discrete portions containing a unit dose, or a multiple or sub-unit of a unit dose. By way of example, the formulations may be in the form of tablets and sustained release capsules, and may be prepared by any method well known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for oral administration in the present invention may be presented as: discrete units such as capsules, gentiles, drops, cachets, pills or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent; as a powder or granules; as a solution, emulsion or a suspension of the active agent in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion; or as a bolus etc. Preferably, these compositions contain from 1 to 250 mg and more preferably from 10-100 mg, of active ingredient per dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor compositions for oral administration (e.g. tablets and capsules), the term “acceptable carrier” includes vehicles such as common excipients e.g. binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, polyvinylpyrrolidone (Povidone), methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sucrose and starch; fillers and carriers, for example corn starch, gelatin, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium phosphate, sodium chloride and alginic acid; and lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium stearate and other metallic stearates, glycerol stearate stearic acid, silicone fluid, talc waxes, oils and colloidal silica. Flavouring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, cherry flavouring and the like can also be used. It may be desirable to add a colouring agent to make the dosage form readily identifiable. Tablets may also be coated by methods well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active agent in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may be optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther formulations suitable for oral administration include lozenges comprising the active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active agent in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active agent in a suitable liquid carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther forms of administration comprise solutions or emulsions which may be injected intravenously, intraarterially, intrathecally, subcutaneously, intradermally, intraperitoneally or intramuscularly, and which are prepared from sterile or sterilisable solutions. Injectable forms typically contain between 10-1000 mg, preferably between 10-250 mg, of active ingredient per dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be in form of suppositories, pessaries, suspensions, emulsions, lotions, ointments, creams, gels, sprays, solutions or dusting powders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alternative means of transdermal administration is by use of a skin patch. For example, the active ingredient can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin. The active ingredient can also be incorporated, at a concentration of between 1 and 10% by weight, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilisers and preservatives as may be required.\n\n\n \nDosage\n\n\n \n \n \nA person of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine an appropriate dose of one of the instant compositions to administer to a subject without undue experimentation. Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the individual undergoing therapy. The dosages disclosed herein are exemplary of the average case. There can of course be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with this invention, an effective amount of a compound of general formula (I) may be administered to inhibit the proteinase implicated with a particular condition or disease. Of course, this dosage amount will further be modified according to the type of administration of the compound. For example, to achieve an “effective amount” for acute therapy, parenteral administration of a compound of general formula (I) is preferred. An intravenous infusion of the compound in 5% dextrose in water or normal saline, or a similar formulation with suitable excipients, is most effective, although an intramuscular bolus injection is also useful. Typically, the parenteral dose will be about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg; preferably between 0.1 and 20 mg/kg, in a manner to maintain the concentration of drug in the plasma at a concentration effective to inhibit a cysteine proteinase. The compounds may be administered one to four times daily at a level to achieve a total daily dose of about 0.4 to about 400 mg/kg/day. The precise amount of an inventive compound which is therapeutically effective, and the route by which such compound is best administered, is readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by comparing the blood level of the agent to the concentration required to have a therapeutic effect. Prodrugs of compounds of the present invention may be prepared by any suitable method. For those compounds in which the prodrug moiety is a ketone functionality, specifically ketals and/or hemiketals, the conversion may be effected in accordance with conventional methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention may also be administered orally to the patient, in a manner such that the concentration of drug is sufficient to inhibit bone resorption or to achieve any other therapeutic indication as disclosed herein. Typically, a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound is administered at an oral dose of between about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg in a manner consistent with the condition of the patient. Preferably the oral dose would be about 0.5 to about 20 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNo unacceptable toxicological effects are expected when compounds of the present invention are administered in accordance with the present invention. The compounds of this invention, which may have good bioavailability, may be tested in one of several biological assays to determine the concentration of a compound which is required to have a given pharmacological effect.\n\n\n \nCombinations\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a particularly preferred embodiment, the one or more compounds of the invention are administered in combination with one or more other active agents, for example, existing drugs available on the market. In such cases, the compounds of the invention may be administered consecutively, simultaneously or sequentially with the one or more other active agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrugs in general are more effective when used in combination. In particular, combination therapy is desirable in order to avoid an overlap of major toxicities, mechanism of action and resistance mechanism(s). Furthermore, it is also desirable to administer most drugs at their maximum tolerated doses with minimum time intervals between such doses. The major advantages of combining chemotherapeutic drugs are that it may promote additive or possible synergistic effects through biochemical interactions and also may decrease the emergence of resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBeneficial combinations may be suggested by studying the inhibitory activity of the test compounds with agents known or suspected of being valuable in the treatment of a particular disorder. This procedure can also be used to determine the order of administration of the agents, i.e. before, simultaneously, or after delivery. Such scheduling may be a feature of all the active agents identified herein.\n\n\n \nSynthesis\n\n\nSynthesis of 5,5-Bicyclic Core\n\n\n \n \n \nOne aspect of the invention relates to a process of preparing a compound of formula (I) as defined above, said process comprising oxidation of a compound of formula (II).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable oxidising agent may be used to convert the secondary alcohol group of (II) into the corresponding ketone (I).

Treatment of monobromotosylates 46 or 47 with zinc dust at room temperature in organic/aqueous mixtures (most preferably an isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, water, ammonium chloride mixture) provides alcohols 13 and 14 respectively in high yield. Additionally, completion of the one-pot conversion gives alcohols VIIa and VIIb with defined stereochemistry and in high yield.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCommencing from the commercially available sugars isomannide and isosorbide, the present invention also provides facile preparation of monobromotosylates 46 and 47 One highly preferred preparation is shown below in Scheme 15\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsosorbide (43) is converted to the di-tosylate (42) which is obtained following recrystallisation from methanol in 97% yield. Mono-bromination is effected by 2.5 eq lithium bromide in DMSO (or DMF) with temperature control 110° C.→120° C. The product bromide is isolated following extractive work-up and purification either by column chromatography (74%) or attractive for large scale by recrystallisation from methanol giving a first crop of 55% plus mother liquors containing good quality material that may be pooled from batch runs and purified later. Thus, preparation of monobromotosylate (47) with defined stereochemistry by methods in Scheme 15 is attractive for large scale applications. Treatment of monobromotosylate (47) with zinc dust at room temperature in organic/aqueous mixtures (most preferably an isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, water, ammonium chloride mixture) provides alcohol (14) which is derivatised as the Cbz compound (18) through one pot conversion.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment of isomannide (40) (Scheme 16) with tosylchloride (2.2 eq) in a bi-phasic potassium hydroxide/dichloromethane/carbon tetrachloride mixture at 0° C. gives ditosylate (39) in 48% yield following simple filtration and trituration with methanol. Alternatively, treatment of isomannide (40) with tosylchloride (0.5 eq) in a biphasic potassium hydroxide/dichloromethane/carbon tetrachloride mixture at 0° C. gives monotosylate in 38% yield following simple extraction and re-crystallisation from carbon tetrachloride (conditions as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,858,632). Although the monotosylate can be obtained in higher yield by treatment of isomannide (40) with tosylchloride in pyridine, purification currently requires column chromatography which may becomes undesirable at large scale. Monobromotosylate (46) may then be prepared by treatment of ditosylate (39) with lithium bromide in DIME (29% yield following chromatography) or by treatment of monotosylate under Mitsunobu conditions with carbon tetrabromide (63% yield following chromatography). Treatment of monobromotosylate (46) with zinc dust at room temperature in organic/aqueous mixtures (most preferably an isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, water, ammonium chloride mixture) provides alcohol (13) which is derivatised as the Cbz compound (17) through one pot conversion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one highly preferred embodiment of the invention, the 6-alkyl-5,5-bicylic core is prepared in accordance with the steps set forth in Scheme 1 below:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alcohol functionality of (18) may be derivatised as the para-toluene sulphonate (Ts) giving (R)-2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-1-((S)-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-yl)ethyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate (32b) which proceeds through the anti-epoxide (R)-2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-1-((1S,2S,5S)-3,6-dioxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-yl)ethyl 4-methylbenzenesulphonate (33b). Hydrogenation of tosylate (33b) provides free amine that undergoes intramolecular cyclisation to provide intermediate (74). Intermediate (74), either as the free base or hydrochloride salt, undergoes displacement with an excess of a variety of suitable alkylmetal reagents e.g. a mixture of 2 eq. MeLi to 1 eq. Cu(I) Br that generates Li—Cu(Me)\n2 \nas the active species, to give the 6-alkyl analogues with retention of configuration. By analogy a similar displacement with alternative alkylmetal reagents may be performed to give for example R\n1 \nor R\n2 \nas ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, tert-butyl and cyclopropyl. Urethane protection of the secondary amine of the bicyclic intermediate (107) followed by oxidation to ketone provides intermediate (2d) that is particularly useful for solid phase synthesis of compounds of general formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdvantageously, the epoxidation to give the desired anti-epoxide is directed by the presence of the tosylate group.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn analogous reaction scheme can be applied to the enantiomer of (18), namely, benzyl (S)-2-((S)-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-yl)-2-hydroxyethyl carbamate (17), proceeding through the analogous anti-epoxide (S)-2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-1-((1S,2S,5S)-3,6-dioxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-yl)ethyl 4-methylbenzenesulphonate (32) (Scheme 2).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tosyl group of bicyclic intermediates (74) and (85) can act as a leaving group that undergoes displacement with an excess of a variety of suitable alkylmetal reagents e.g. a mixture of 2 eq. MeLi to 1 eq. Cu(I) Br that generates Li—Cu(Me)\n2 \nas the active species, to give the 6-alkyl analogues with retention of configuration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, intermediate tosylate (74) may be Boc protected to give protected analogue (35b) that may undergo inversion to bromide (111) through treatment with LiBr in DMF at typically 130° C. (Scheme 4). Acidolytic removal of Boc provides intermediate bromide (112) that undergoes displacement with an excess of a variety of suitable alkylmetal reagents e.g. a mixture of 2 eq. MeLi to 1 eq. Cu(I) Br that generates Li—Cu(Me)\n2 \nas the active species, to give the 6-alkyl analogues with retention of configuration. e.g. (109; R\n1\n=Me).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAlternative Preparation of 6-alkyltetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one cores\n\n\n \n \n \nAn alternative synthesis of 6-alkyl substituted bicyclic building blocks may be achieved through the chemistries described in Schemes 6, 7, 8 and 9.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsomannide (40) is mono tert-butyldixnethylsilyl (TBDMS) protected by treatment with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride and imidazole in DMF to give intermediate (86). Oxidation of alcohol (86) with Dess-Martin periodinane in DCM provides (3aS,6R,6aS)-6-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)tetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]furan-3 (2H)-one (87), an intermediate suitable for reaction with a variety of Wittig reagents. For example, reaction of ketone (87) with potassium tert-butoxide and methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide in THF provides exocyclic alkene (88) in 91% yield following chromatography. Hydrogenation of alkene (88) over Pd—C provides an ˜9:1 mixture of methyl analogues (89a) and (89b) respectively that are not readily separated by silica column chromatography. Subsequent transformations/purifications provide further enrichment of the major isomer derived from (89a). Removal of TBDMS protection from intermediate (89a) may be performed with TBAF in THF and subsequent treatment of alcohol (90a) with p-toluenesulphonyl chloride and pyridine in DCM gives tosyl intermediate (91a) in high yield.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThen following the general theme detailed previously in Scheme 16, tosylate (91a) may be converted to the monobromide (92) by treatment with lithium bromide in DMF. Treatment of bromide (92) with zinc dust in ammonium chloride and THF followed by extraction then treatment with triethylamine and methanesulphonyl chloride provides mesylate (93). Preparation of amine (94) may be achieved by direct treatment of mesylate (93) with ammonia in propan-2-ol or via the 2-step procedure of azide displacement of mesylate with sodium azide in DMF followed by reduction of azide to amine (94) through treatment with triphenylphosphine and water in DMF. Amine (94) may then be Cbz protected by treatment with Cbz-Cl and sodium carbonate in aqueous dioxan. Epoxidation of alkene (95) through use of 1,1,1-trifluoroacetone provides an 3.5:1 mixture of the desired anti-(96) and side-product syn-(96) respectively. Treatment of epoxide mixture (96) with sodium hydride in anhydrous THF provides a new slower eluting product on TLC that is the desired bicycle (3R,3aR,6R,6aR)-benzyl 3-hydroxy-6-methyltetrahydro-2H-furo[3,2-b]pyrrole-4(5H)-carboxylate (2a). Hydrogenation, Fmoc protection and oxidation provides intermediate ketone (2d; R\n2\n=Me) that is particularly suited to solid phase synthesis of analogues of general formula I (R\n2\n=Me).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, ketone (87) may be treated with triphenylphosphine and dibromodifluoromethane in N,N-dimethylacetamide to give tert-butyl((3R,3aS,6aR)-6-(difluoromethylene)hexahydrofuro[3,2-b]furan-3-yloxy)dimethylsilane (97) as detailed in Scheme 8.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubsequent hydrogenation of alkene (97) over Pd—C provides an ˜9:2 mixture of the difluoromethyl analogues (98a) and (98b) respectively, that are readily separated by silica column chromatography. Removal of TBDMS protection from intermediate (98a) may be performed with TBAF in THF and subsequent treatment of alcohol (99a) with p-toluenesulphonyl chloride and pyridine in DCM gives tosyl intermediate (100a) in high yield. Analogous reactions may be performed on (98b) to give the opposite 6-difluoromethyl isomer (100b).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThen in an analogous manner to that described in Scheme 7, intermediate (100a) may be converted into (3aS,6R,6aR)-(9H-Fluoren-9-yl)methyl 6-(difluoromethyl)-3-oxotetrahydro-2H-furo[3,2-b]pyrrole-4(5H)-carboxylate (2d; R\n2\n═CHF\n2\n) (Scheme 9).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an analogous manner, intermediate (100b) may be converted into (3aS,6S,6aR)-(9H-Fluoren-9-yl)methyl 6-(difluoromethyl)-3-oxotetrahydro-2H-furo[3,2-b]pyrrole-4(5H)-carboxylate (2d′; R\n1\n═CHF\n2\n).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of Novel Aminoacids\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe novel aminoacid (S)-2-amino-2-(1-methylcyclopentyl)acetic acid that forms an intrinsic feature of a selection of compounds of formula I may be prepared following adaptation of a variety of known general literature syntheses of aminoacids.

Ester (131) is readily hydrolysed to 2-(1-methylcyclopentyl)acetic acid (132) using LiOH in methanol. Preparation of (S)-4-benzyl-3-(2-(1-methylcyclopentyl)acetyl)oxazolidin-2-one (133) is then completed using commercially available (S)-4-benzyl-2-oxazolidinone (CAS 90719-32-7) following the general methods detailed in WO98017626 (pg 49).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAsymmetric addition of azide is then conducted by deprotonation of the chiral auxiliary (133) and reaction with trisyl azide.

In ‘\nSolid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach\n’, Oxford University Press, Oxford, U.K. 1989, for a general review of solid phase synthesis principles), or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of general formula (I) may be conveniently considered as a combination of three building blocks (P1, P2 and P3) that respectively occupy the S1, S2 and S3 binding sites of the protease (see Berger, A. and Schechter, I., \nPhilos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. [Biol.], \n257, 249-264, 1970 for a description of the designation of enzyme S-subsites and substrate P-subsites within enzyme-substrate or enzyme-inhibitor complexes). The notional concepts of P1, P2 and P3 are used herein for convenience only and the above-mentioned compounds are intended to be within the scope of the invention regardless of binding mode.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitably protected and/or activated building block may then be prepared and subsequently chemically bonded (coupled) together with other building blocks to provide compounds of general formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (I) may be prepared: (1) by the stepwise addition of P3 and P2 to the bicyclic 6-alkyltetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one core; or (2) by reaction of the bicyclic 6-alkyltetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one core with a P3-P2 precursor molecule; or (3) by introducing the P3-P2 group prior to formation of the bicyclic 6-alkyltetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one core, i.e. prior to the oxidation step or prior to the intramolecular cyclisation step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, alternative orders of coupling of the building blocks are possible, for example P2+P1→P2−P1 then addition of P3→P3−P2−P1 or P3+P2→P3−P2 then addition to P1→P3−P2−P1. Within each of these combinations each of the P1, P2 or P3 building blocks may contain additional alternative functionalities that are further transformed following coupling to give the final compound. For example the ketone functionality of the P1 building block may be protected as a ketal during coupling of building blocks and transformed to the final ketone by hydrolysis following completion of the coupling reactions. Alternatively, the ketone functionality of the P1 building block may be initially introduced via a lower oxidation state such as the corresponding alcohol and following completion of the coupling reactions be re-introduced by oxidation of the alcohol. Alternatively, the ketone functionality of the P1 building block may be protected through a semi-carbazone suitable for solid phase synthesis (e.g. see WO 02/057270 and references cited therein) and following completion of the coupling reactions released from the solid phase by acidolytic reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chemical bond formed by coupling of the building blocks is a secondary amide (P3−P2) or a tertiary amide (P2−P1) that are formed through reaction of an activated carboxylic acid with a primary and secondary amine respectively. Many methods are available for activation of a carboxylic acid prior to coupling to an amine and in principle, any of these methods may be used herein. Typical carboxylic acid activation methods are exemplified but not restricted to the azide method, mixed anhydride method (e.g. via isobutylchloroformate), carbodiimide methods (e.g. via dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3-(3′-dimethylamino propyl)carbodiimide), active ester method (e.g. via p-nitrophenyl ester, N-hydroxysuccinic imido ester, pentafluorophenyl ester), uronium method (e.g. via addition of HBTU, PyBop, BOP), carbonyldiimidazole method or via pre-formation of acyl fluorides or acyl chlorides. In some instances the coupling reaction may be enhanced by the addition of a further activation catalyst such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, or 4-dimethylaminopyridine. A general description of carboxylic acid activation techniques and the use of activation additives may be found in Bodanszky, M. ‘Principles of Peptide Synthesis’, 2\nnd \nrev. ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1993 and references cited therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe α-amino group of the P2 aminoacid building block is usually protected during coupling reactions to the P1 building block to avoid the formation of undesired self-condensation products. The art of α-amino protection is well known in peptide chemistry (e.g. see Bodanszky, M. ‘Principles of Peptide Synthesis’, 2\nnd \nrev. ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1993 and references cited therein) and example protection groups include, but are not limited to, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) and trichloroethoxycarbonyl (Treoc). The Fmoc group is particularly well suited for solid phase syntheses (e.g. see Atherton, E.; Sheppard, R. C. in ‘Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis A Practical Approach’, IRL Press, Oxford, U.K., 1989) typically being removed by treatment with 20% v/v piperidine in dimethylformamide or 1% v/v 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene in dimethylformamide. The Boc group is particularly well suited to solution phase syntheses typically being removed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid based mixtures or HCl in dioxan or ethyl acetate. The Cbz group is also particularly well suited for solution phase syntheses typically being removed by catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen and palladium catalysis or by treatment with HBr in acetic acid. Once the coupling sequence is complete, any protecting groups are removed in whatever manner is dictated by the choice of protecting groups (for a general description of protecting groups and their respective stabilities and methods of removal see Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M. ‘Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis’ John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1991 and references therein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the simplest example, the entire left hand portion of a compound of general formula (I) (i.e. P3−P2) as the carboxylic acid can be prepared in solution by traditional organic chemistry methods and coupled to ketone, alcohol or ketal intermediates such as compounds (IIb), (IIc) and (IId). Then oxidation of the alcohol intermediate (e.g. Dess-Martin periodinane in DCM) or acidolytic cleavage of the ketal intermediate provides compounds of general formula (I). The alcohol oxidation route is particularly useful when the compound of general formula (I) contains a substituent that is labile to trifluoroacetic acid, this being the final reagent used in each of the solid phase syntheses.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of these different coupling tactics have been detailed previously (see (1) Quibell, M. et. al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. \n13, 609-625, 2005. (ii) Wang, Y. et. al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. \n15, 1327-1331, 2005) and the optimum synthetic route is dependant upon the specific substituent combinations of the target compound of general formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn more detail, one preferred strategy for the synthesis of compounds of general formula (I) comprises:—\n\n \n \n \n(a) Preparation of an appropriately functionalised and protected bicyclic ketone or bicyclic alcohol building block in solution;\n \n(b) Attachment of the building block (a) to the solid phase through a linker that is stable to the conditions of synthesis, but readily labile to cleavage at the end of a synthesis (see James, I. W., \nTetrahedron, \n55 (Report N\no \n489), 4855-4946, 1999, for examples of the ‘linker’ function as applied to solid phase synthesis);\n \n(c) Solid phase organic chemistry (see Brown, R. D. \nJ. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. \n1, 19, 3293-3320, 1998), to construct the remainder of the molecule;\n \n(d) Compound cleavage from the solid phase into solution; and\n \n(e) Cleavage work-up and compound analysis.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nA second strategy for the synthesis of compounds of general formula (I) comprises:—\n\n \n \n \n(a) Preparation of an appropriately functionalised and protected bicyclic intermediate building block in solution. Preferred protecting groups for solution phase chemistry are the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), Nα-tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), Nα-benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and Nα-allyloxycarbonyl group (Alloc).\n \n(b) Standard organic chemistry methods for the conversion of building block obtained in step (a) towards compounds of general formula (I).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, in one preferred embodiment of the invention, compounds of formula (I) may be prepared using conventional solution phase chemistry, for example, as described in Quibell, M et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 13, 609-625, 2005 (see in particular, Schemes 3 and 4). The solution phase strategy is attractive in being able to generate larger quantities of preferred analogues, typically on a multi-gram to multi-kilogram scale.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative preferred embodiment of the invention, compounds of formula (I) may be prepared using conventional solid phase chemistry, for example, as described in Quibell M, et al Bioorg. Med. Chem, 12, 5689-5710, 2004, see in particular, Scheme 3 and Section 3.2, and references cited therein; and Bioorg. Med. Chem, 13, 609-625, 2005, see Scheme 5 and Section 2.2, and references cited therein). The solid phase strategy is attractive in being able to generate many thousands of analogues, typically on a 5-100 mg scale, through established parallel synthesis methodologies (e.g. see (a) Bastos, M.; Maeji, N. J.; Abeles, R. H. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n92, 6738-6742, 1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthetic strategy is based on reversible anchorage of the ketone functionality via a hydrazide linker bond using general multipin techniques previously described in the art (Watts J. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 12(11), 2903, 2004; Quibell M., et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 5689-5710, 2004; Grabowksa U. et al, J. Comb. Chem. 2000, 2(5), 475).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (III; R\n5\n=Fmoc) may be oxidised to the corresponding ketone (e.g. XVI, Scheme 3) and utilised in a solid phase synthesis of inhibitor molecules (I). The solid phase linkage of an aldehyde or ketone, has previously been described by a variety of methods (e.g. see (a) James, I. W., 1999, (b) Lee, A., Huang, L., Ellman, J. A., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc, \n121(43), 9907-9914, 1999, (c) Murphy, A. M., et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 114, 3156-3157, 1992). A suitable method amenable to the reversible linkage of an alkyl ketone functionality is through a combination of the previously described chemistries. The semicarbazide, 4-[[(hydrazinocarbonyl)amino]methyl]cyclohexane carboxylic acid. trifluoroacetate (Murphy, A. M., et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 114, 3156-3157, 1992), may be utilised as illustrated in Scheme 3, exemplified by linkage of the Fmoc protected 6-alkyltetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one (XVI).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConstruct (XVII) is prepared through reaction of the linker molecule and the 6-alkyltetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one (XVI) by refluxing in aqueous ethanol/sodium acetate. Standard solid phase techniques (e.g. see Atherton, E. and Sheppard, R. C., 1989) are used to anchor the construct to an amino-functionalised solid phase through the free carboxylic acid functionality of (XVII), providing the loaded construct (XVIII). Loaded construct (XVIII) be reacted with a wide range of carboxylic acids available commercially or in the literature, to introduce the left-hand portion ‘P3−P2’.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred carboxylic acids for the introduction of the [R\n9\n—CO] synthon are known in the literature with the following representative examples; 4-(5-(piperidin-1-ylmethyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860343-90-4), 4-(5-(morpholinomethyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-74-7), 4-(2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 294622-47-2), 4-(2-(4-(2-methoxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860343-99-3), 4-(5-(1-morpholinoethyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-01-0), 4-(5-(1-morpholinoethyl)furan-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-04-3), (S)-4-(2-(1-(dimethylamino)ethyl)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-10-1), (S)-4-(5-methyl-2-(1-(methylamino)ethyl)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-76-9), (S)-4-(2-(1-(dimethylamino)ethyl)-5-methylthiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-19-0), (S)-4-(2-(1-(methylamino)ethyl)thiazol-5-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-78-1), (S)-4-(2-(1-(methylamino)ethyl)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-79-2), 4-(2-(4-fluoro-1-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-38-3), 4-(3-methyl-5-(morpholinomethyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-81-6), 3-methyl-4-(5-(morpholinomethyl)furan-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-82-7), 4-(5-methyl-2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-50-9), 4-(2-morpholinothiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-51-0), 4-(2-(piperidin-1-yl)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-52-1), 4-(2-(dimethylamino)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 849682-29-7), 4-(2-(isopropyl(methyl)amino)-5-methylthiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-56-5), 4-(2-(methylamino)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-57-6), 4-(2-(4,4-difluoropiperidin-1-yl)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-58-7), 4-(2-(isopropylamino)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-59-8), 4-(2-(piperidin-4-yl)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-62-3), 4-(2-(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-63-4), 4-(2-(pyridin-3-ylamino)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 294622-46-1), 4-(2-(pyridin-2-ylamino)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-64-5), 4-(2-(cyclopentylamino)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-65-6), 4-(2-(cyclopropylamino)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-66-7), 4-(2-(cyclopropyl(methyl)amino)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-67-8), 4-(2-(1-methylpyrrolidin-3-yl)thiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-80-5), 4-(6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)pyridin-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-69-0), 4-(6-morpholinopyridin-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 860344-70-3).

All liver microsome incubations were carried out in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, with a final microsomal protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Compounds were taken from 5 mM DMSO stock solutions and diluted in incubation buffer to give a final concentration of 25 μM, with a final DMSO concentration of 0.5% v/v. In brief, compounds were added to the incubation buffer along with the liver microsomes and incubated at 37° C. for 10 minutes. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of NADPH, previously dissolved in incubation buffer, to give a final concentration of 1 mM and re-incubated at 37° C. Aliquots were removed at 2 and 60 minutes and quenched with an equal volume of cold acetonitrile.

The plates were then capped and mixed vigorously for 1 hour on a microtitre plate shaker, after which they were left to stand, allowing the PBS and octanol phases to separate.

After the culture period, bone collagen degradation products were quantified from the culture medium as an index of bone resorption Inhibitor compounds were added into the cell cultures after the differentiation period and their effects on the resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts were determined. The studies included a baseline group without added compounds and a positive control group where a potent cathepsin K inhibitor E-64 was added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman peripheral blood monocytes were suspended to culture medium and allowed to attach to bovine bone slices. The bone slices were transferred into 96-well tissue culture plates containing culture medium with appropriate amounts of important growth factors favouring osteoclast differentiation, including M-CSF, RANK-ligand and TGF-β. The cells were incubated in a CO\n2 \nincubator in humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide at 37° C. At day 7 when osteoclast differentiation was complete, the culture medium was replaced with culture medium containing conditions favouring osteoclast activity. The cell culture was continued for an additional 2 days, during which the formed mature osteoclasts were allowed to resorb bone in the presence of vehicle, control inhibitor (E64) or test compounds. At the end of the culture, bone collagen degradation products released into the culture medium were determined using a commercially available ELISA method (CrossLaps® for culture, Nordic Bioscience, Herlev, Denmark) as an index of bone resorption (see Bagger, Y.

More specifically, tibia, femori and humeri were removed from 1 day old rat pups. The endosteal surfaces of the bones were scraped with a scapelto release osteoclasts into the culture medium and the osteoclasts were allowed to attach to bovine bone slices.
