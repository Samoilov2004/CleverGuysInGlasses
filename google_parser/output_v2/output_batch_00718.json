The government has certain rights in the invention.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel compounds having anti-cancer activity, methods of making these compounds, and their use for treating cancer, treating drug-resistant tumors, drug-resistant cancer, metastatic cancer, metastatic melanoma, drug resistant melanoma, prostate cancer and drug resistant prostate cancer.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nCancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease. In the United States, cancer accounts for 1 of every 4 deaths. The 5-year relative survival rate for all cancer patients diagnosed in 1996-2003 is 66%, up from 50% in 1975-1977 (\nCancer Facts \n& \nFigures \nAmerican Cancer Society: Atlanta, Ga. (2008)). This improvement in survival reflects progress in diagnosing at an earlier stage and improvements in treatment. Discovering highly effective anticancer agents with low toxicity is a primary goal of cancer research.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicrotubules are cytoskeletal filaments consisting of αβ-tubulin heterodimers and are involved in a wide range of cellular functions, including shape maintenance, vesicle transport, cell motility, and division. Tubulin is the major structural component of the microtubules and a well verified target for a variety of highly successful anti-cancer drugs. Compounds that are able to interfere with microtubule-tubulin equilibrium in cells are effective in the treatment of cancers. Anticancer drugs like taxol and vinblastine that are able to interfere with microtubule-tubulin equilibrium in cells are extensively used in cancer chemotherapy. There are three major classes of antimitotic agents. Microtubule-stabilizing agents, which bind to fully formed microtubules and prevent the depolymerization of tubulin subunits, are represented by taxanes and epothilones. The other two classes of agents are microtubule-destabilizing agents, which bind to tubulin dimers and inhibit their polymerization into microtubules. Vina alkaloids such as vinblastine bind to the vinca site and represent one of these classes. Colchicine and colchicine-site binders interact at a distinct site on tubulin and define the third class of antimitotic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth the taxanes and vinca alkaloids are widely used to treat human cancers, while no colchicine-site binders are currently approved for cancer chemotherapy yet. However, colchicine binding agents like combretastatin A-4 (CA-4) and ABT-751 (\nFIG. 19\n), are now under clinical investigation as potential new chemotherapeutic agents (Luo, Y.; Hradil, V. P.; Frost, D. J.; Rosenberg, S. H.; Gordon, G. B.; Morgan, S. J.; Gagne, G. D.; Cox, B. F.; Tahir, S. K.; Fox, G. B., ABT-751\n, “a novel tubulin\n-\nbinding agent, decreases tumor perfusion and disrupts tumor vasculature”. Anticancer Drugs \n2009, 20, (6), 483-92.; Mauer, A. M.; Cohen, E. E.; Ma, P. C.; Kozloff, M. F.; Schwartzberg, L.; Coates, A. I.; Qian, J.; Hagey, A. E.; Gordon, G. B., “\nA phase II study of ABT\n-751 \nin patients with advanced non\n-\nsmall cell lung cancer”.

Br J Cancer \n2010, 102, (9), 1355-60.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnfortunately, microtubule-interacting anticancer drugs in clinical use share two major problems, resistance and neurotoxicity. A common mechanism of multidrug resistance (MDR), namely ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein-mediated drug efflux, limits their efficacy (Green, H.; Rosenberg, P.; Soderkvist, P.; Horvath, G.; Peterson, C., “\nbeta\n-\nTubulin mutations in ovarian cancer using single strand conformation analysis\n-\nrisk of false positive results from paraffin embedded tissues”. Cancer letters \n2006, 236, (1), 148-54.; Wang, Y.; Cabral, F., “\nPaclitaxel resistance in cells with reduced beta\n-\ntubulin”. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, Molecular Cell Research \n2005, 1744, (2), 245-255.; Leslie, E. M.; Deeley, R. G.; Cole, S. P. C., “\nMultidrug resistance proteins: role of P\n-\nglycoprotein, MRP\n1\n, MRP\n2\n, and BCRP \n(\nABCG\n2) \nin tissue defense”. Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology \n2005, 204, (3), 216-237.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nP-glycoproteins (P-gp, encoded by the MDR1 gene) are important members of the ABC superfamily. P-gp prevents the intracellular accumulation of many cancer drugs by increasing their efflux out of cancer cells, as well as contributing to hepatic, renal, or intestinal clearance pathways. Attempts to co-administer P-gp modulators or inhibitors to increase cellular availability by blocking the actions of P-gp have met with limited success (Gottesman, M. M.; Pastan, I., “\nThe multidrug transporter, a double\n-\nedged sword”. J Biol Chem \n1988, 263, (25), 12163-6.; Fisher, G. A.; Sikic, B. I., “\nClinical studies with modulators of multidrug resistance”. Hematology/oncology clinics of North America \n1995, 9, (2), 363-82).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe other major problem with taxanes, as with many biologically active natural products, is its lipophilicity and lack of solubility in aqueous systems. This leads to the use of emulsifiers like Cremophor EL and Tween 80 in clinical preparations. A number of biologic effects related to these drug formulation vehicles have been described, including acute hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral neuropathies (Hennenfent, K. L.; Govindan, R., “\nNovel formulations of taxanes: a review. Old wine in a new bottle?” Ann Oncol \n2006, 17, (5), 735-49.; ten Tije, A. J.; Verweij, J.; Loos, W. J.; Sparreboom, A., “\nPharmacological effects of formulation vehicles: implications for cancer chemotherapy”. Clin Pharmacokinet \n2003, 42, (7), 665-85.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompared to compounds binding the paclitaxel- or vinca alkaloid binding site, colchicine-binding agents usually exhibit relatively simple structures. Thus providing a better opportunity for oral bioavailability via structural optimization to improve solubility and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. In addition, many of these drugs appear to circumvent P-gp-mediated MDR. Therefore, these novel colchicine binding site targeted compounds hold great promise as therapeutic agents, particularly since they have improved aqueous solubility and overcome P-gp mediated MDR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProstate cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed noncutaneous cancers among men in the US and is the second most common cause of cancer deaths with over 180,000 new cases and almost 29,000 deaths expected this year. Patients with advanced prostate cancer undergo androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), typically either by luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or by bilateral orchidectomy. Androgen deprivation therapy not only reduces testosterone, but estrogen levels are also lower since estrogen is derived from the aromatization of testosterone, which levels are depleted by ADT. Androgen deprivation therapy-induced estrogen deficiency causes significant side effects which include hot flushes, gynecomastia and mastalgia, bone loss, decreases in bone quality and strength, osteoporosis and life-threatening fractures, adverse lipid changes and higher cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction, and depression and other mood changes. It is believed that many of the estrogen deficiency side effects of ADT are mediated by ERα.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLeuprolide acetate (Lupron®) is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-RH). Leuprolide acetate is an LH-RH superagonist that eventually suppresses LH secretion by the pituitary. Leuprolide acetate acts as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion, resulting in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. In humans, administration of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in premenopausal females). However, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to castrate levels (below 50 ng/dL). In premenopausal females, estrogens are reduced to postmenopausal levels. Testosterone is a known stimulus for cancerous cells of the prostate. Suppressing testosterone secretion or inhibiting the actions of testosterone is thus a necessary component of prostate cancer therapy. Leuprolide acetate can be used for LH suppression, which is the reduction and lowering of serum testosterone to castrate levels to treat prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMalignant melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer, accounting for about 75% of skin cancer deaths. The incidence of melanoma is rising steadily in Western populations. The number of cases has doubled in the past 20 years. Around 160,000 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed worldwide each year, and it is more frequent in males and Caucasians. According to a WHO Report, about 48,000 melanoma-related deaths occur worldwide per year.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCurrently there is no effective way to treat metastatic melanoma. It is highly resistant to current chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. Metastatic melanoma has a very poor prognosis, with a median survival rate of 6 months and a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. In the past 30 years, dacarbazine (DTIC) is the only FDA-approved drug for metastatic melanoma. However, it provides only less than 5% of complete remission in patients. In recent years, great efforts have been attempted in fighting metastatic melanoma. Neither combinations of DTIC with other chemotherapy drugs (e.g., cisplatin, vinblastine, and carmustine) nor adding interferon-a2b to DTIC have shown a survival advantage over DTIC treatment alone. Most recently, clinical trials with antibodies and vaccines to treat metastatic melanoma also failed to demonstrate satisfactory efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMelanoma cells have low levels of spontaneous apoptosis in vivo compared with other tumor cell types, and they are relatively resistant to drug-induced apoptosis in vitro. The natural role of melanocytes is to protect inner organs from UV light, a potent DNA damaging agent. Therefore, it is not surprising that melanoma cells may have special DNA damage repair systems and enhanced survival properties. Moreover, recent studies showed that, during melanoma progression, it acquired complex genetic alterations that led to hyperactivation of efflux pumps, detoxification enzymes, and a multifactoral alteration of survival and apoptotic pathways. All these have been proposed to mediate the multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype of melanoma. With the rapidly rising incidence of this disease and the high resistance to current therapeutic agents, developing more effective drugs for advanced melanoma and other cancer types that can effectively circumvent MDR will provide significant benefits to cancer patients.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, this invention is directed to a compound represented by the structure of formula (Ia):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\nA is substituted or unsubstituted single-, fused- or multiple-ring, aryl or (hetero)cyclic ring systems;

The pharmaceutical composition can contain one or more of the above-identified compounds of the present invention. Typically, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention will include a compound of the present invention or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, as well as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to any suitable adjuvants, carriers, excipients, or stabilizers, and can be in solid or liquid form such as, tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, or emulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, the composition will contain from about 0.01 to 99 percent, preferably from about 20 to 75 percent of active compound(s), together with the adjuvants, carriers and/or excipients. While individual needs may vary, determination of optimal ranges of effective amounts of each component is within the skill of the art. Typical dosages comprise about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg body wt. The preferred dosages comprise about 0.1 to about 100 mg/kg body wt. The most preferred dosages comprise about 1 to about 100 mg/kg body wt. Treatment regimen for the administration of the compounds of the present invention can also be determined readily by those with ordinary skill in art. That is, the frequency of administration and size of the dose can be established by routine optimization, preferably while minimizing any side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solid unit dosage forms can be of the conventional type. The solid form can be a capsule and the like, such as an ordinary gelatin type containing the compounds of the present invention and a carrier, for example, lubricants and inert fillers such as, lactose, sucrose, or cornstarch. In another embodiment, these compounds are tabulated with conventional tablet bases such as lactose, sucrose, or cornstarch in combination with binders like acacia, cornstarch, or gelatin, disintegrating agents, such as cornstarch, potato starch, or alginic acid, and a lubricant, like stearic acid or magnesium stearate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablets, capsules, and the like can also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch, or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose, or saccharin.

Solutions or suspensions of these active compounds can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof in oils. Illustrative oils are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, or mineral oil. In general, water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solution, and glycols such as, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, are preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor use as aerosols, the compounds of the present invention in solution or suspension may be packaged in a pressurized aerosol container together with suitable propellants, for example, hydrocarbon propellants like propane, butane, or isobutane with conventional adjuvants. The materials of the present invention also may be administered in a non-pressurized form such as in a nebulizer or atomizer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the compounds of this invention are administered in combination with an anti-cancer agent.

One major contributor to multidrug resistance is overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). This protein is a clinically important transporter protein belonging to the ATP-binding cassette family of cell membrane transporters. It can pump substrates including anticancer drugs out of tumor cells through an ATP-dependent mechanism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, this invention provides methods for: a) treating, suppressing, reducing the severity, reducing the risk, or inhibiting drug resistant tumors; b) treating, suppressing, reducing the severity, reducing the risk, or inhibiting metastatic cancer; c) treating, suppressing, reducing the severity, reducing the risk, or inhibiting drug resistant cancer; d) treating, suppressing, reducing the severity, reducing the risk, or inhibiting a drug resistant cancer wherein the cancer is melanoma; e) a method of treating, suppressing, reducing the severity, reducing the risk, or inhibiting a drug resistant cancer wherein the cancer is prostate cancer; f) a method of treating, suppressing, reducing the severity, reducing the risk, or inhibiting metastatic melanoma; g) a method of treating, suppressing, reducing the severity, reducing the risk, or inhibiting prostate cancer; h) treating, suppressing, reducing the severity, reducing the risk, or inhibiting cancer in a subject, wherein the subject has been previously treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biological therapy; comprising the step of administering to said subject a compound of this invention and/or an isomer, metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, tautomer, hydrate, N-oxide, polymorph, or crystal of said compound, or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment, reducing the severity, reducing the risk, or inhibition of cancer, metastatic cancer, drug resistant tumors, drug resistant cancer and various forms of cancer.

Virtually all cancers have the potential to spread. Whether metastases develop depends on the complex interaction of many tumor cell factors, including the type of cancer, the degree of maturity (differentiation) of the tumor cells, the location and how long the cancer has been present, as well as other incompletely understood factors. Metastases spread in three ways—by local extension from the tumor to the surrounding tissues, through the bloodstream to distant sites or through the lymphatic system to neighboring or distant lymph nodes. Each kind of cancer may have a typical route of spread. The tumor is called by the primary site (ex. breast cancer that has spread to the brain is called metastatic breast cancer to the brain).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment “drug-resistant cancer” refers to cancer cells that acquire resistance to chemotherapy. Cancer cells can acquire resistance to chemotherapy by a range of mechanisms, including the mutation or overexpression of the drug target, inactivation of the drug, or elimination of the drug from the cell. Tumors that recur after an initial response to chemotherapy may be resistant to multiple drugs (they are multidrug resistant). In the conventional view of drug resistance, one or several cells in the tumor population acquire genetic changes that confer drug resistance. Accordingly, the reasons for drug resistance, inter alia, are: a) some of the cells that are not killed by the chemotherapy mutate (change) and become resistant to the drug. Once they multiply, there may be more resistant cells than cells that are sensitive to the chemotherapy; b) Gene amplification. A cancer cell may produce hundreds of copies of a particular gene. This gene triggers an overproduction of protein that renders the anticancer drug ineffective; c) cancer cells may pump the drug out of the cell as fast as it is going in using a molecule called p-glycoprotein; d) cancer cells may stop taking in the drugs because the protein that transports the drug across the cell wall stops working; e) the cancer cells may learn how to repair the DNA breaks caused by some anti-cancer drugs; f) cancer cells may develop a mechanism that inactivates the drug. One major contributor to multidrug resistance is overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). This protein is a clinically important transporter protein belonging to the ATP-binding cassette family of cell membrane transporters. It can pump substrates including anticancer drugs out of tumor cells through an ATP-dependent mechanism. Thus, the resistance to anticancer agents used in chemotherapy is the main cause of treatment failure in malignant disorders, provoking tumors to become resistant. Drug resistance is the major cause of cancer chemotherapy failure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment “resistant cancer” refers to drug-resistant cancer as described herein above. In another embodiment “resistant cancer” refers to cancer cells that acquire resistance to any treatment such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or biological therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, this invention is directed to treating, suppressing, reducing the severity, reducing the risk, or inhibiting cancer in a subject, wherein the subject has been previously treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or biological therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment “Chemotherapy” refers to chemical treatment for cancer such as drugs that kill cancer cells directly. Such drugs are referred as “anti-cancer” drugs or “antineoplastics.” Today's therapy uses more than 100 drugs to treat cancer. To cure a specific cancer. Chemotherapy is used to control tumor growth when cure is not possible; to shrink tumors before surgery or radiation therapy; to relieve symptoms (such as pain); and to destroy microscopic cancer cells that may be present after the known tumor is removed by surgery (called adjuvant therapy). Adjuvant therapy is given to prevent a possible cancer reoccurrence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, “Radiotherapy” refers to high energy x-rays and similar rays (such as electrons) to treat disease. Many people with cancer will have radiotherapy as part of their treatment. This can be given either as external radiotherapy from outside the body using x-rays or from within the body as internal radiotherapy. Radiotherapy works by destroying the cancer cells in the treated area. Although normal cells can also be damaged by the radiotherapy, they can usually repair themselves. Radiotherapy treatment can cure some cancers and can also reduce the chance of a cancer coming back after surgery. It may be used to reduce cancer symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment “Biological therapy” refers to substances that occur naturally in the body to destroy cancer cells. There are several types of treatment including: monoclonal antibodies, cancer growth inhibitors, vaccines and gene therapy. Biological therapy is also known as immunotherapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, this invention provides a method of treating a subject suffering from prostate cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, resistant prostate cancer or drug-resistant prostate cancer comprising the step of administering to said subject a compound of this invention, or its isomer, metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, tautomer, hydrate, N-oxide, polymorph, crystal or any combination thereof, or a composition comprising the same in an amount effective to treat prostate cancer in the subject.

All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, Pa.), AK Scientific (Mountain View, Calif.), Oakwood Products (West Columbia, S.C.), etc. and were used without further purification. Moisture-sensitive reactions were carried under an argon atmosphere. ABT-751 was prepared according methods reported by Yoshino et al.\n26 \nRoutine thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on aluminum backed Uniplates (Analtech, Newark, Del.). Melting points were measured with Fisher-Johns melting point apparatus (uncorrected). \n1\nH NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker AX 300 (Billerica, Mass.) spectrometer or Varian Inova-500 (Vernon Hills, Ill.) spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported as parts per million (ppm) relative to TMS in CDCl\n3\n. Mass spectral data was collected on a Bruker ESQUIRE electrospray/ion trap instrument in positive and negative ion modes. Elemental analyses were performed by Atlantic Microlab Inc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell Culture and Cytotoxicity Assay of Prostate Cancer and Melanoma. All cell lines were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va., USA), while cell culture supplies were purchased from Cellgro Mediatech (Herndon, Va., USA). We examined the antiproliferative activity of our anti-tubulin compounds in four human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, \nDU\n 145, PC-3, and PPC-1) and two human melanoma cell lines (A375 and WM-164). Human ovarian cell line OVCAR-8 and its resistant cell line that over-expresses P-gp (NCl/ADR-RES) were used as MDR models. Both ovarian cell lines were obtained from National Cancer Institutes (NCl). All cell lines were tested and authenticated by either ATCC or NCI. All prostate cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Melanoma cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, Mo., USA) and bovine insulin (5 μ/mL; Sigma-Aldrich). The cytotoxic potential of the anti-tubulin compounds was evaluated using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay after 96 h of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous Solubility. The solubility of drugs was determined by Multiscreen Solubility Filter Plate (Millipore Corporate, Billerica, Mass.) coupled with LC-MS/MS. Briefly, 198 μL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4) was loaded into 96-well plate, and 2 μL of 10 mM test compounds (in DMSO) was dispensed and mixed with gentle shaking (200-300 rpm) for 1.5 h at RT (N=3). The plate was centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min, and the filtrate was used to determine its concentration and solubility of test compound by LC-MS/MS as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic Study. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=3 or 4; 254±4 g) were purchased from Harlan Inc. (Indianapolis, Ind.). Rat thoracic jugular vein catheters were purchased from Braintree Scientific Inc. (Braintree, Mass.). On arrival at the animal facility, the animals were acclimated for 3 days in a temperature-controlled room (20-22° C.) with a 12-h light/dark cycle before any treatment. \nCompound\n 1h was administered intravenously (i.v.) into the jugular vein catheters at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg (in DMSO/PEG300, 2/8), whereas 5Ha and 5Hc were dosed at 5 mg/kg (in DMSO/PEG300, 1/9). An equal volume of heparinized saline was injected to replace the removed blood, and blood samples (250 μL) were collected via the jugular vein catheters at 10, 20, 30 min, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 hr. \nCompounds\n 1h, 5Ha and 5Hc were given (p.o.) by oral gavage at 10 mg/kg (in Tween80/DMSO/H\n2\nO, 2/1/7). All blood samples (250 μL) after oral administration were collected via the jugular vein catheters at 30, 60, 90 min, 120 min, 150 min, 180 min, 210 min, 240 min, and 8, 12, 24 h. Heparinized syringes and vials were prepared prior to blood collection. Plasma samples were prepared by centrifuging the blood samples at 8,000 g for 5 min. All plasma samples were stored immediately at −80° C. until analyzed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalytes were extracted from 100 μL of plasma with 200 μL of acetonitrile containing 200 nM the internal standard ((3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)(2-phenyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methanone). The samples were thoroughly mixed, centrifuged, and the organic extract was transferred to autosampler for LC-MS/MS analysis. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, scanning m/z 356→188 (\ncompound\n 1h), m/z 371→203 (compound 5Ha), m/z 389→221 (compound 5Hc), and m/z 309→171 (the internal standard), was used to obtain the most sensitive signals. The pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using non-compartmental analysis (WinNonlin, Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, Calif.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalytical Method. Sample solution (10 μL) was injected into an Agilent series HPLC system (Agilent 1100 Series Agilent 1100 Chemstation, Agilent Technology Co, Ltd). All analytes were separated on a narrow-bore C18 column (Alltech Alltima HP, 2.1×100 mm, 3 μm, Fisher, Fair Lawn, N.J.). Two gradient modes were used. Gradient mode was used to achieve the separation of analytes using mixtures of mobile phase A [ACN/H\n2\nO (5%/95%, v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid] and mobile phase B [ACN/H\n2\nO (95%/5%, v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid] at a flow rate of 300 μL/min. Mobile phase A was used at 15% from 0 to 1 min followed by a linearly programmed gradient to 100% of mobile phase B within 6 min, 100% of mobile phase B was maintained for 0.5 min before a quick ramp to 15% mobile phase A. Mobile phase A was continued for another 12 min towards the end of analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Vitro Tubulin Polymerization Assay. Bovine brain tubulin (0.4 mg, >97% pure) (Cytoskeleton, Denver, Colo.) was mixed with 10 μM of the test compounds and incubated in 100 μl of general tubulin buffer (80 mM PIPES, 2.0 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 1 mM GTP) at pH 6.9. The absorbance of wavelength at 340 nm was monitored every 1 min for 20 min by the \nSYNERGY\n 4 Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, Vt.). The spectrophotometer was set at 37° C. for tubulin polymerization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA triple-quadruple mass spectrometer, \nAPI Qtrap\n 4000™ (Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX, Concord, Ontario, Canada), operating with a TurboIonSpray source was used. The spraying needle voltage was set at 5 kV for positive mode. Curtain gas was set at 10; \nGas\n 1 and \ngas\n 2 were set 50. Collision-Assisted-Dissociation (CAD) gas at medium and the source heater probe temperature at 500° C. Data acquisition and quantitative processing were accomplished using Analyst™ software, Ver. 1.4.1 (Applied Biosystems).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe purity of the final compounds was tested via RP-HPLC on a Waters 2695 HPLC system installed with a Photodiode Array Detector. Two RP-HPLC methods were conducted using a \nSupelco Ascentis™\n 5 μM C-18 column (250×4.6 mm) at ambient temperature, and a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. HPLC1: Gradient: Solvent A (water) and Solvent B (methanol): 0-20 min 40-100% B (linear gradient), 20-27 \nmin\n 100% B.

Assignments were made on the basis of chemical and spectral data as described infra. An improved Beckmann rearrangement readily produced the rearranged \n \namides\n \n 2g and 2h from the two \ngeometric stereoisomers\n 2e-cis and 2e-trans via their reaction with tosyl chloride and subsequent basic aluminum oxide column. \nHydrazide derivatives\n 2d-cis and 2d-trans were prepared by mixing 1h with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol and refluxing for 24 h. \nAcrylonitriles\n 2c-trans,cis were obtained from Wittig reaction of 1h with diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate. \nCyanoimine\n 2j was prepared using the procedure as by described by Cuccia (Cuccia, S.

This route was originally designed for the synthesis of 12xa, but the nonselectivity of the benzoylation at the indole-2 and imidazole-4 positions resulted in the formation of 15xaa, which is a closely related but bulkier analog of llxaa. The indole-5-\ncarboxaldehyde\n 8x was protected by a phenylsulfonyl group on the indole NH to afford intermediate 8xa. 8xa was reacted with glyoxal and ammonium hydroxide to generate the 2-aryl-imidazole 9xa. Protection of the imidazole NH with phenylsulfonyl gave the intermediate 10xaa which was coupled with 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl chloride to produce 16xaa. Removal of the protecting group from 16xaa provided 15xaa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis of 1-(Phenylsulfonyl)-1H-indole-5-carbaldehyde (8xa). To a solution of indole-3-carboxaldehyde (100 mmol) in ethanol (500 mL) at room temperature was added potassium hydroxide (110 equiv), the mixture was stirred until total solubilization. The ethanol was completely removed in vacuum and acetone (250 mL) added followed by benzenesulfonyl chloride (110 equiv).

To make the standard curve (\nFIG. 17\n) from which the equation was derived, 50, 100 μL of each 100 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL of ABI compound 12ga, and its corresponding thiazole analog, as well as CA-4 (see \nFIG. 19\n for structure) in acetonitrile, were injected into HPLC and monitored by mass spectroscopy. The amount (ng) in each injection was plotted again its relative mass peak area to generate the standard curve in \nFIG. 17\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HPLC retention times of ABI compound 12ga (1.5 min) was compared to its corresponding thiazole analog (2.2 min) using 80/20 methanol/water mobile phase at 1 mL/min flow rate and a reversed phase column, indicating that the imidazole derivative was more hydrophilic than its corresponding thiazole analog. The calculated logP values for ABI compound 12ga and the corresponding thiazole analog were approximately 2.9 and 4.4, respectively. The water solubility of compound 12ga was 13 μg/mL, or about 200 times greater than its thiazole counterpart (72 ng/mL).\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nBiological Evaluation of Compounds of this Invention\n\n\nExample 11A\n\n\nIn Vitro Cell Growth Inhibitions\n\n\n \n \n \nCell Culture and Cytotoxicity Assay of Prostate Cancer and Melanoma. All cell lines were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va., USA), while cell culture supplies were purchased from Cellgro Mediatech (Herndon, Va., USA). We examined the antiproliferative activity of our anti-tubulin compounds in four human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, \nDU\n 145, PC-3, and PPC-1) and two human melanoma cell lines (A375 and WM-164). Human ovarian cell line OVCAR-8 and its resistant cell line that over-expresses P-gp (NCI/ADR-RES) were used as MDR models. Both ovarian cell lines were obtained from National Cancer Institutes (NCI). All cell lines were tested and authenticated by either ATCC or NCI. All prostate cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMelanoma cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, Mo., USA) and bovine insulin (5 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich). The cytotoxic potential of the anti-tubulin compounds was evaluated using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay after 96 h of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll of the reported compounds were first evaluated for cytotoxicity in the mouse melanoma cell line B16-F1, human melanoma cell lines (A375 and WM-164) and prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, PC-3, LNCaP, PPC-1). \nCompound\n 1h and ABT-751 (E7010; Abbott Laboratories/Eisai Co Ltd), which has entered phase II clinical studies in treating patients with different cancers, were included in the assays as examples of colchicine-site binding agents.

The first series was targeted to alternatives to the thiazole “B” ring. Accordingly, a series of heterocyclic “B” rings were examined. As shown in Table 1, the successful replacements of the thiazole were \npyridine\n 1c, furan 1d and \nthiophene\n 1f. The IC\n50\ns (12 nM˜35 nM against prostate cancer cells) are close to the \nthiazole compound\n 1h. Introducing phenyl (1a), oxazoline (35a), and oxazole (36a) maintained activity in the hundreds of nanomolar range. But introducing of pyrimidine (1b, IC\n50\n: 3.7˜8.3 μM), a reversed 2,5-thiazole and 3,5-isoxazole (1e and 1i, IC\n50\n: >10 μM) caused obvious losses of potency. Modification of “B” ring to the saturated ring of piperidine (1 g) also totally abolished activity (IC\n50\n>20 μM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSAR of Alternative Linkers. In vitro hepatic metabolic stability studies revealed that the carbonyl linker between “B” and “C” rings in SMART compounds caused short half lives (5-17 min) primarily due to carbonyl reduction. For the sake of blocking this ketone reduction to the inactive \nhydroxyl linker compound\n 2b, the carbonyl linker in the second series of compounds was modified (Table 2). The carbonyl linker was replaced with double bonds (2a, 3a and 3b), amides (2g, 2h), oximes (2e-cis,trans and 2f-cis,trans), hydrazide (2d-cis, 2d-trans), acrylonitriles (2c-trans, 2c-cis), cyanoimine (2j), sulfonyl amide (4d), sulfur ether (4a), sulfonyl and sulfinyl compounds (4b, 4c). A \ndirect link compound\n 21 without any linker between “B” and “C” rings was also prepared. Among these linker modifications, only cyanoimine linkage (2j) showed promising potential (20˜60 nM) compared with \ncarbonyl compound\n 1h, but an in vitro metabolism study showed that the half life of 2j in human liver microsome was less than 5 min. It is suggested that although the ketone reduction is blocked, it might introduce a new metabolic liability in \ncompound\n 2j. The isomer pairs of compounds containing double bonds, oximes and hydrazides were separated. \nCompound\n 3a was designed to mimic the structure of CA-4, (\nFIG. 19\n) which contain a cis-C═C between two aryl rings, unfortunately 3a and other isomer pairs lost activity after replacing the C═O linker. One interesting phenomenon is syn-isomer of 2e-cis (0.1˜0.3 μM) showed 10 fold more activity than its anti-isomer 2e-trans (>10 μM). The half life of 2e-cis in human liver microsome is extended to 35 min, while half lives of \ncompounds\n 2d can be prolonged to 55 min. But decreased activity (˜1 μM) of 2d also reduced their potency.\n\n\n \nExample 11B\n\n\nAqueous Solubility of Compounds of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe solubility of drugs was determined by Multiscreen Solubility Filter Plate (Millipore Corporate, Billerica, Mass.) coupled with LC-MS/MS. Briefly, 198 μL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4) was loaded into 96-well plate, and 2 μL of 10 mM test compounds (in DMSO) was dispensed and mixed with gentle shaking (200-300 rpm) for 1.5 h at RT (N=3). The plate was centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min, and the filtrate was used to determine its concentration and solubility of test compound by LC-MS/MS as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntroducing polar and ionizable groups into the anti-tubulin agents. One major limitation of the SMART agents is low aqueous solubility. Surfactants such as \nTween\n 80, were used to study in vivo SMART behavior, accordingly favorable results were obtained. But these surfactants are biologically active and are responsible for many side effects. In addition, it was thought that low aqueous solubility of 1 h resulted in low oral bioavailability (3.3%, Table 4). In the third series of compounds, the aqueous solubility was successfully increased without impacting the potency by introducing polar groups like hydroxyl and indolyls. In addition, ionizable groups like amino and alkylamino groups were also introduced into “A” ring para-position. As shown in FIG. 5 and Table 3, introducing indolyl groups to the “A” ring especially 5-indolyl (66a, 7˜25 nM) increased the potency compared with the 4-OH compound 21 (76-116 nM). Aminomethyl —CH\n2\nNH\n2 \nat the “A” ring para position also maintained potency (2r, 13-80 nM), but p-NHMe (2s) or p-NMe\n2 \n(2u) abrogated activity. As shown in \nFIG. 18\n, analytical measurement to estimate aqueous solubility showed that \nindolyl compound\n 66a increased solubility in PBS from 1.1 μg/mL (\ncompound\n 1h) to 3.8 μg/mL. \nAminomethyl compound\n 2r was converted to the HCl salt, which increased solubility over 35-fold (>35 μg/mL). Although \ncompound\n 2r showed satisfactory aqueous solubility, the pharmacokinetic studies showed this compound still had very poor bioavailability (F %=0.2%). It was thought that \ncompound\n 2r was ionized in the stomach, and therefore not absorbed into the circulation system.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nC: Pharmacokinetic Studies\n\n\n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic Study. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=3 or 4; 254±4g) were purchased from Harlan Inc. (Indianapolis, Ind.). Rat thoracic jugular vein catheters were purchased from Braintree Scientific Inc. (Braintree, Mass.). On arrival at the animal facility, the animals were acclimated for 3 days in a temperature-controlled room (20-22° C.) with a 12-h light/dark cycle before any treatment. \nCompound\n 1h was administered intravenously (i.v.) into the jugular vein catheters at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg (in DMSO/PEG300, 2/8), whereas 5Ha and 5Hc were dosed at 5 mg/kg (in DMSO/PEG300, 1/9). An equal volume of heparinized saline was injected to replace the removed blood, and blood samples (250 μL) were collected via the jugular vein catheters at 10, 20, 30 min, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 hr. \nCompounds\n 1h, 5Ha and 5Hc were given (p.o.) by oral gavage at 10 mg/kg (in Tween80/DMSO/H\n2\nO, 2/1/7). All blood samples (250 μL) after oral administration were collected via the jugular vein catheters at 30, 60, 90 min, 120 min, 150 min, 180 min, 210 min, 240 min, and 8, 12, 24 h. Heparinized syringes and vials were prepared prior to blood collection. Plasma samples were prepared by centrifuging the blood samples at 8,000 g for 5 min. All plasma samples were stored immediately at −80° C. until analyzed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalytes were extracted from 100 μL of plasma with 200 μL of acetonitrile containing 200 nM the internal standard ((3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)(2-phenyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methanone). The samples were thoroughly mixed, centrifuged, and the organic extract was transferred to autosampler for LC-MS/MS analysis. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, scanning m/z 356→188 (\ncompound\n 1h), m/z 371→203 (compound 5Ha), m/z 389→221 (compound 5Hc), and m/z 309→171 (the internal standard), was used to obtain the most sensitive signals.

Many established tubulin targeting anticancer drugs like taxanes and vinblastine require intravenous administration because of low oral bioavailability. Oral bioavailability is a complex parameter involving many chemical and physiological processes, such as solubility, permeability, and metabolic stability. The solubility of these tubulin inhibitors was improved by inserting an amino linker between the “A” and “B” rings as in 5a-c (\nFIG. 6\n), Table 3 demonstrates that the NH bridged compounds (5a-c) had similar potency (35˜65 nM) as 1h with increased solubility (15 and 19 μg/mL for 5a and 5c, respectively (\nFIG. 18\n), but they are over 20 fold more active than ABT-751 (Table 3 and \nFIG. 19\n for the structure of ABT-751).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRat pharmacokinetic studies were performed to study whether these new compounds exhibited improved bioavailability compared to \ncompound\n 1h (Table 4). The data clearly showed that 5Hc (HCl salt of 5c) exhibited more than 4.3-fold increased exposure (AUC) by the oral route as compared to 1h, suggesting that improved aqueous solubility by the amino linker successfully improved oral bioavailability. In addition, the maximal concentration (Cmax) of 5Ha and 5Hc by oral administration was 814 and 1262 ng/mL, respectively. While Cmax of 1h was only 212 ng/mL. Overall, the bioavailability of 5Ha and 5Hc was increased from 3.3% of 1h to 11% and 21%, respectively (Table 4). Compound 5Hc exhibited moderate clearance, moderate volume of distribution, and acceptable oral bioavailability. This data suggested that these new synthesized amino linked compounds have the potency and PK profile to be developed as a new class of orally bioavailable antitubulin agents.\n\n\n \nExample 11D\n\n\nIn vitro Tubulin Polymerization Inhibition by Compounds of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nIn Vitro Tubulin Polymerization Assay. Bovine brain tubulin (0.4 mg, >97% pure) (Cytoskeleton, Denver, Colo.) was mixed with 10 μM of the test compounds and incubated in 100 μl of general tubulin buffer (80 mM PIPES, 2.0 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 1 mM GTP) at pH 6.9. The absorbance of wavelength at 340 nm was monitored every 1 min for 20 min by the \nSYNERGY\n 4 Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, Vt.). The spectrophotometer was set at 37° C. for tubulin polymerization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibition of tubulin polymerization by selected \n \n \n \npotent compounds\n \n \n \n 1c, 2j, 66a, and 5a was investigated by all three design strategies (alternative B-rings, novel linkers, and solubilizing moieties) and compared with 1h. Bovine brain tubulin (>97% pure) was incubated with the individual compounds (10 μM) to test their effect on tubulin polymerization (\nFIG. 20\n). After 20 min incubation, tubulin polymerization was inhibited 47% by 1h, as compared to vehicle. Both 1c and 2j inhibited 64% of polymerization at 20 min with different inhibition patterns. \n \nCompounds\n \n 5a and 66a provided greater inhibitions as 78% and 81%, respectively. These data suggest that these compounds exhibit strong antitubulin polymerization activity that corresponds well with their cytotoxicity.\n\n\n \nExample 11E\n\n\nSubstituted Methoxy benzoyl Aryl Thiazole (SMART) Compounds Overcome P-Glycoprotein Mediated Multidrug Resistance\n\n\n \n \n \nThe P-glycoprotein (P-gp) system appears to be a primary physiological mechanism of multidrug resistance (MDR) which acts as an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump, actively removing a variety of structurally diverse cytotoxic compounds. Enhanced efflux of these compounds reduces their intracellular accumulation and so reduces their cytotoxicity. Therefore, novel compounds which are not susceptible to drug resistance could be of high therapeutic and economic value. In addition to P-gp, clinically used antitubulin agents have other resistance mechanisms such as changes in microtubule dynamics and mutations in β-tubulin which are known to limit sensitivity to the taxanes. The anti-tubulin compounds of the invention were tested against an ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-8 (parent) and P-gp over-expressing NCI/ADR-RES cell line (Table 5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntiproliferative Activity of Selected Compounds against\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP-gp over-expressed MDR cell lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\nResistance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nOVCAR-8\n\n\nNCI/ADR-\nRES\n \n \nfactor\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 1c\n\n\n33 ± 3\n\n\n  13 ± 0.8\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 2j\n\n\n34 ± 2\n\n\n14 ± 1\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n66a\n \n\n\n10 ± 3\n\n\n 4 ± 2\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 2r\n\n\n26 ± 2\n\n\n11 ± 2\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 5a\n\n\n46 ± 6\n\n\n27\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n5b\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n21\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 5c\n\n\n44 ± 3\n\n\n25 ± 6\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 1h\n\n\n35 ± 2\n\n\n13 ± 1\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npaclitaxel*\n\n\n 4.7 ± 0.1\n\n\n6263 ± 634\n\n\n1333\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nvinblastine\n\n\n 3.9 ± 0.1\n\n\n582 ± 57\n\n\n149\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncolchicine\n\n\n17 ± 1\n\n\n1113 ± 79 \n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNotably, the anti-tubulin compounds of the invention demonstrated equipotent anti-proliferative effects against OVCAR-8 and NCI/ADR-RES cell lines, suggesting that they are not P-gp substrates and that they function in a P-gp-independent manner. This feature is distinct from that of paclitaxel, vinblastine, and colchicine in NCI/ADR-RES cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA new series of tubulin polymerization inhibitors with acceptable oral bioavailability and equi-potent activity in multidrug resistant tumor cell lines has been discovered. Medicinal chemistry efforts starting from optimizing \nSMART compound\n 1h. Chemical modifications of different substituted aryl in “B” ring and linkages between “B” and “C” rings were investigated based on biological evaluation against cancer cells in vitro. SAR studies revealed that optimal “B” rings include pyridine (1c), thiophene (1f), and furan (1d) which maintain excellent in vitro potency. Replacing carbonyl linker with cyanoimine (2j) between “B” and “C” ring will increase the activity. Structure modifications to increase aqueous solubility and bioavailability were performed. Introducing an amino between “A” and “B” rings gave us compounds 5a-c, which showed similar in vitro antiproliferative potency against tested cancer cells as well as MDR(+) and MDR(−) cell lines, furthermore, the solubility and in vivo bioavailability were improved greatly over those of the 1h. Therefore, these new anti-tubulin compounds represent a new family of compounds that may be very useful in the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nAntiproliferative Activity of Compounds of

Derivatives of this Invention\n\n\nCell Culture.\n\n\n \n \n \nLNCaP, PC-3, DU-145, PPC-1, MES-SA, and MES-SA/DX5 were originally obtained from ATCC (Rockville, Md.). All cells obtained from ATCC were immediately expanded and frozen down such that all cell lines could be restarted every 2-3 months from a frozen vial of the same batch of cells. For the in vivo xenograft studies, PC-3 was authenticated at Research Animal Diagnostic Laboratory (Columbia, Mo.) within four months before studies. Inter-species contamination was tested by PCR and the identity of the cell lines was verified by generating a genetic profile. MES-SA and MES-SA/DX5 were maintained in McCoy's 5A Medium containing 2 mM L-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All other cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium with 2 mM L-glutamine and 10% FBS.\n\n\n \nGrowth Inhibition Assay.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cytotoxic or anti-proliferative activity of test compounds was investigated in several cell lines using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Cultured cells were plated into 96-well plates and incubated with medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds for 96 h. Cells were stained with SRB solution. The optical density was determined at 540 nm on a microplate reader (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, Va.). Plots of percent inhibition of cell growth versus drug concentration were constructed, and the concentration that inhibited cell growth by 50% relative to the untreated control (IC\n50\n) was determined by nonlinear least squares regression using WinNonlin software (Pharsight Corporation, Cary, N.C.).\n\n\n \nCell Cycle Analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \nCell cycle distribution was determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining. Treated cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol overnight. Fixed cells were then stained with 20 μg/mL of PI in the presence of RNase A (300 μg/mL) at 37° C. for 30 min. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis core services at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Tenn.\n\n\n \nIn Vitro Metabolism Studies.\n\n\n \n \n \nFor both phase I, the incubation mixture, in 65 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), consisted of 1 mg/mL liver microsomal proteins, 3 mM NADPH, and 0.5 μM test compound. The concentration of methanol (used for dissolving the substrate) was 1% (v/v). Total volume of the incubation was 200 μL and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37° C. To generate the stability curves for test compounds different incubations were stopped at 10, 20, 30, 60, and 90 minutes for analysis of compounds remaining. All reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 μL ice-cold acetonitrile. Subsequently, the samples were then centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min and supernatant was analyzed by LC-MS/MS.\n\n\n \nPharmacokinetic Studies in Mice.\n\n\n \n \n \nMale ICR mice (5-6 weeks, 20-25 g) were used. For 6a, 6b, and 6c, a dose, 5 mg/kg, was administered via the i.v., i.p., and p.o. route. I.v. doses were administered via the tail vein. Oral doses were administered by gavage. At each time point, three to four mice were euthanized by isoflurane (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Ill.) and blood samples (up to 600 μL each) were taken from the posterior vena cava. Plasma samples were stored at −20° C. prior to analysis. Plasma proteins were precipitated by the addition of acetonitrile (150 μL, containing the internal standard) to 100 μL of mouse plasma. Samples were vortexed and then centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a clean vial for injection into the mass spectrometer for analysis.\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Antitumor Efficacy Study.\n\n\n \n \n \nPC-3 cells (2.5×10\n6 \ncells/site) plus Matrigel (BD biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) were injected subcutaneously into flanks of male nu/nu mice. Tumor size was measured using calipers every 2-4 days and calculated as V=π/6×(length)×(width)\n2 [\n13]. When tumors reached a volume of approximately 100˜150 mm\n3\n, drug treatment was initiated. The control group was treated with vehicle (20% Captex200 in Tween80). During the treatment, tumor size and body weights were measured every 2-4 days.\n\n\n \nWhite Blood Cell Counting.\n\n\n \n \n \nWhole blood was obtained from nude mice at the end of efficacy study. To count white blood cells (WBC) using a hemacytometer, 10 μL of whole blood sample was diluted with the 190 μL of 2% acetic acid.

PC-3 xenografts were treated with vehicle (qd), 6b (40 mg/kg, qd), or 6c (40 mg/kg, qd) for 3 weeks. Dosing vehicles were composed of 20% Captex200 in Tween80. The tumor volumes (mm\n3\n) were plotted against time and are the means±SD from eight animals. The tumor volumes and survival rates or body weights are shown in \nFIG. 34A\n. The liver size (g) of each nude mouse was measured after 3 weeks treatment and is shown in \nFIG. 34B\n.

All these cell lines were purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va.) except the PPC-1 cell line. MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-435/LCCMDR1 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Clarke at Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, D.C. Melanoma cells were cultured in DMEM (Cellgro Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, Va.) and prostate cancer cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Cellgro Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, Va.) supplemented with 10% FBS (Cellgro Mediatech). Cultures were maintained at 37° C. in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO\n2\n. 1000 to 5000 cells were plated into each well of 96-well plates depending on growth rate and exposed to different concentrations of a test compound for 48 h (fast growing melanoma cells) or 96 h (slow growing prostate cancer cells) in three to five replicates. Cell numbers at the end of the drug treatment were measured by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Briefly, the cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid and stained with 0.4% SRB, and the absorbances at 540 nm were measured using a plate reader (DYNEX Technologies, Chantilly, Va.). Percentages of cell survival versus drug concentrations were plotted, and the IC\n50 \n(concentration that inhibited cell growth by 50% of untreated control) values were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.).\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThe results of the in vitro antiproliferative activities of the compounds of this invention using three melanoma cell lines (one murine melanoma cell line, B 16-F1, and two human metastatic melanoma cell lines, A375 and WM-164) and four human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, \nDu\n 145, and PPC-1) are summarized in Tables 11-13.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn vitro growth inhibitory effects of compounds without A ring substitutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure\n\n\nID\n\n\nR\n\n\nA375\n\n\nB16-F1\n\n\nWM164\n\n\nLNCaP\n\n\nPC-3\n\n\n \nDu\n 145\n\n\nPPC-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12aa 12ab 12ac 12ad 12ae 12af 12ag 12ah 12ai\n\n\n3,4,5-(OME)\n3\n 4-OMe 3-\nOMe\n 3,5-(OMe)\n2\n 3,4-(OMe)\n2\n 4-F 3-F 4-Me 3-Me\n\n\n160 >10000 >10000 2800 >10000 580 >10000 >10000 >10000\n\n\n120 >10000 >10000 5400 >10000 930 >10000 >10000 >10000\n\n\n10 >10000 >10000 2100 >10000 630 >10000 >10000 >10000\n\n\n152 >10000 >10000 3611 >10000 613 >10000 >10000 >10000\n\n\n288 >10000 >10000 3274 >10000 2197 >10000 >10000 >10000\n\n\n196 >10000 >10000 2590 >10000 846 >10000 >10000 >10000\n\n\n133 >10000 >10000 2129 >10000 575 >10000 >10000 >10000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12aba 12aaa\n\n\n4-\n \nOMe\n \n 3,4,5-(OMe)\n3\n \n\n\n>10000 >10000\n\n\n>10000 >10000\n\n\n>10000 >10000\n\n\n>10000 >10000\n\n\n>10000 >10000\n\n\n>10000 >10000\n\n\n>10000 >10000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10a 10x 10j\n\n\nH 4-NO\n2\n 4-OBn\n\n\n>10000 >10000 >10000\n\n\n>10000 >10000 >10000\n\n\n>10000 >10000 >10000\n\n\n>10000 >10000 >10000\n\n\n>10000 >10000 >10000\n\n\n>10000 >10000 >10000\n\n\n>10000 >10000 >10000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom Table 11, compounds 12aa-12ai showed moderate activity with IC\n50 \nvalues in the μM range (average of all seven cell lines). The most potent compound of this series was 12aa with an average IC\n50 \nvalue of 160 nM. The removal of one of the methoxy groups from the 3,4,5-trimethoxy on the C ring (12ad, 12ae) led to a significant loss of activity (IC\n50\n>10 μM for 12ae and an average IC\n50 \nof 3.1 μM for 12ad). Compound with 4-fluoro on the C ring (12af) also showed relatively good activity (IC\n50\n=0.91 μM), a finding that has an important implication, because replacing the trimethoxy moiety with a 4-fluoro group may provide good activity and improved metabolic stability. The position of the fluorine on the C ring was critical for activity because a shift from 4-fluoro to 3-fluoro resulted in a total loss of activity (IC\n50\n>10 μM for 12ag compared with 0.91 μM for 12af). This result suggested that a potential hydrogen bond donor is present close to the 4-position of this ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs clearly indicated in Table 11, the positions of the A and C rings were critical. A simple shift of the C-ring moiety from \nposition\n 4 to \nposition\n 1 in the imidazole ring (B ring) resulted in total loss of activity (IC\n50\n>10 μM for 12aba, 12aaa, 10a, 10x, 10j).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn vitro growth inhibitory effects of compounds with substitutions on A ring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50 \n± SEM (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nID\n\n\nR\n1\n \n\n\nR\n2\n \n\n\nA375\n\n\nB16-F1\n\n\nWM164\n\n\nLNCaP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12ba 12ca 12cb 12da 12db 12db-HCl 12dc 12ea 12eb 12fa 12fb 13fa 12ga 12gb 12ha 12hb 12ia 12ib 13ea 12ja 12jb 12ka 12kb 12kc 12la 12pa 13ha Colchicine\n\n\n4-F 4-OMe 4-OMe 4-Me 4-Me   4-Me 3,4,5-(OMe)\n3\n 3,4,5-(OMe)\n3\n 4-Cl 4-Cl 4-Cl 4-N(Me)\n2\n 4-N(Me)\n2\n 3,4-(OMe)\n2\n 3,4-(OMe) 2-CF\n3\n 2-CF\n3\n 3,4,5-(OH)\n3\n 4-OBn 4-OBn 4-OH 4-OH 4-OH 4-Br 4-CF3 3,4-(OH)\n2\n  \n\n\n3,4,5-(OMe)\n3\n 3,4,5-(OMe)\n3\n 4-F 3,4,5-(OMe)\n3\n 4-F   3,5-(OMe)\n2\n-4-OH 3,4,5-(OMe)\n3\n 4-F 3,4,5-(OMe)\n3\n 4-F 3,4,5-(OH)\n3\n 3,4,5-(OMe)\n3\n 4-F 3,4,5-(OMe)\n3\n 4-F 3,4,5-(OMe)\n3\n 4-F 3,4,5-(OH)\n3\n 3,4,5-(OMe)\n3\n 4-F 3,4,5-(OMe)\n3\n 4-F 3-OH,4,5-(OMe)\n2\n 3,4,5-(OMe)\n3\n 3,4,5-(OMe)\n3\n 3,4,5-(OH)\n3\n  \n\n\n205 ± 119 30 ± 5  31 ± 5  9 ± 2 143 ± 13  108 ± 11   105  4800 >10000 43 ± 5  52 ± 4   3900 82 ± 9  56 ± 7  113 ± 14  10000 >10000 >10000 >10000  5200 93 ± 8  1600 10000 10000   32   163.1 >10000 20 ± 3 \n\n\n320 ± 41  108 ± 12  63 ± 7  46 ± 5  222 ± 10  297 ± 23   387 >10000 >10000 168 ± 14  73 ± 6   1810 361 ± 29  129 ± 11  1400 ± 200   4210 >10000 >10000 >10000 10000 117 ± 16   2400 >10000  5600   74   468.7 >10000 29 ± 5 \n\n\n73 ± 18 31 ± 4  28 ± 3  8 ± 2 156 ± 9  112 ± 9   123 >10000 >10000 26 ± 3  74 ± 9  2100 80 ± 11 62 ± 8  191 ± 18  1400 >10000 >10000 >10000 5500 90 ± 12 1800 >10000 6400  36  175 >10000 ND\n\n\n98 ± 2  31 ± 1  28 ± 2  12 ± 1  45 ± 2  ND  134 >10000 >10000 24 ± 1  19 ± 2  10000 58 ± 2  57 ± 6  121 ± 10   2533 >10000 >10000 >10000  2786 44 ± 7  ND 10000     34  134 ND 16 ± 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50 \n± SEM (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNCl/ADR-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nID\n\n\nPC-3\n\n\nDU 145\n\n\nPPC-1\n\n\nOVCAR-8\n\n\nRES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12ba 12ca 12cb 12da 12db 12db-HCl 12dc 12ea 12eb 12fa 12fb 13fa 12ga 12gb 12ha 12hb 12ia 12ib 13ea 12ja 12jb 12ka 12kb 12kc 12la 12pa 13ha Colchicine\n\n\n169 ± 12  45 ± 1  31 ± 2    9 ± 0.4 56 ± 3  ND  127 >10000 >10000 35 ± 1  31 ± 2  10000 92 ± 4  81 ± 3 203 ± 7 10000 >10000 >10000 >10000 10000  79 ± 0.4 ND >10000     36  127 \nND\n 11 ± 1 \n\n\n132 ± 24   48 ± 0.5 41 ± 38  15 ± 0.5 78 ± 5  ND  174 >10000 >10000  36 ± 0.4 65 ± 1  10000 95 ± 1   72 ± 0.4 168 ± 15   10000 >10000 >10000 >10000 10000 60 ± 3  ND >10000     49  174 \nND\n 10 ± 2 \n\n\n81 ± 1   34 ± 0.3 29 ± 1   11 ± 0.1 54 ± 1  \nND\n  110 >10000 >10000  26 ± 0.2 52 ± 1  >10000  67 ± 0.7  4± 0.3 117 ± 1  2172 ± 48  >10000 >10000 >10000 2844  43 ± 0.2 ND >10000    33  110 \nND\n 20 ± 1\n\n\n                  47\n\n\n                  19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nND—not determined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom Table 12 compounds with 3,4,5-trimethoxy and 4-fluoro substitutions on the C ring showed good activity with different substitutions on the A ring. These compounds demonstrated excellent antiproliferative activity with IC\n50 \nvalues as low as 8.0 nM on WM164 cell line (12da). In general, compounds incorporating a single substituent on the para-position of the A ring were more potent as can be seen from the activities of 12ca, 12cb, 12da, 12 db, 12fa, 12fb, 12ga, and 12gb (IC\n50\n=7.9-110 nM). 12 db-HCl salt (IC\n50\n=172 nM) showed slightly diminished activity compared with the corresponding \nfree base\n 12 db (IC\n50\n=109 nM). Compound 12fb (IC\n50\n=63.7 nM), with a single halogen substituent in the para-position of the A and C rings, demonstrated potent and was devoid of a methoxy moiety. Compounds with 3,4,5-trimethoxy substituents on the A ring lost activity completely (IC\n50\n>10 μM for 12ea, 12eb), suggesting very different binding environments near the A ring and C ring. Removal of the 5-methoxy substituent from the A-ring improved activity significantly (IC\n50\n=330 nM and >10 μM for 12ha, 12ea respectively). Demethylation of the 3,4,5-trimethoxy decreased activity sharply from 43 nM (12fa) to 3.89 μM (13fa). Similar results were observed for 13ea, 12ka, 12 kb, and 13ha due to the demethylation of substituents on either the A or C ring. Electron-donating groups (4-methoxy, 4-dimethylamino, 4-methyl) and electron-withdrawing groups (4-chloro, 2-trifluoromethyl) on the A ring did not show substantial differences in activity. The introduction of a trifluoromethyl group at the ortho position of the A ring caused complete loss of activity (IC\n50\n>10 μM for 12ia, 12ib). The presence of a benzoyloxy group at the para position of A ring (IC\n50\n=75 nM for 12jb) resulted in a 440-fold increase in activity when compared with the \npara-hydroxy compound\n 12 kb (IC\n50\n=33 μM). It is worthwhile to note that compound 12jb, with the 4-fluoro in the C ring, has better activity than does its counterpart 12ja, which has a 3,4,5-trimethoxy group in the C ring (IC\n50 \nis 75 nM for 12jb, and 7.3 μM for 12ja).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn vitro growth inhibitory effects of compounds with protection on B ring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n± SEM (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure\n\n\nID\n\n\nR\n1\n \n\n\nR\n2\n \n\n\nR\n3\n \n\n\nA375\n\n\nB16-F1\n\n\nWM164\n\n\nLNCaP\n\n\nPC-3\n\n\n \nDu\n 145\n\n\nPPC-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11ab 11ac 11ah 11af 11ag 11cb 11db 11ea   11eb   11fb 11ga   11gb 11ha   11hb   11ia   11ib 11jb 12dab   12cba 12daa   12gba\n\n\nH H H H H 4-OMe 4-Me 3,4,5- (OMe)\n3\n 3,4,5- (OMe)\n3\n 4-Cl 4-N(Me)\n2\n   4-N(Me)\n2\n 3,4- (OMe)\n2\n 3,4- (OMe)\n2\n 2-CF\n3\n   2-CF\n3\n 4-OBn 4-Me   4-OMe 4-Me   4-N(Me)\n2\n \n\n\n4-OMe 3-OMe 4-Me 4-F 3-F 4-F 4-F 3,4,5- (OMe)\n3\n 4-F   4-F 3,4,5- (OMe)\n3\n 4-F 3,4,5- (OMe)\n3\n 4-F   3,4,5- (OMe)\n3\n 4-F 4-F 3,4,5- (OMe)\n3\n 4-F 3,4,5- (OMe)\n3\n 4-F\n\n\nSO\n2\nPh SO\n2\nPh SO\n2\nPh SO\n2\nPh SO\n2\nPh SO\n2\nPh SO\n2\nPh SO\n2\nPh   SO\n2\nPh   SO\n2\nPh SO\n2\nPh   SO\n2\nPh SO\n2\nPh   SO\n2\nPh   SO\n2\nPh   SO\n2\nPh SO\n2\nPh Me   Me CH\n2\nPh   SO\n2\nPhOMe\n\n\n>10000 >10000 >10000 630 ± 72  >10000 36 ± 5  113 ± 14  >10000   3840   88 ± 9  162 ± 13    55 ± 7  192 ± 15    960 ± 59    >10000   >10000 64 ± 7   32   >10000     ~100\n\n\n>10000 >10000 >10000 946 ± 86  >10000 71 ± 8  287 ± 31  >10000   >10000   107 ± 12  1200 ± 90    242 ± 26  970 ± 68    2000 ± 400    >10000   >10000 110 ± 15  134   >10000     ~100\n\n\n>10000 >10000 >10000 596 ± 61  >10000 43 ± 6  107 ± 14  >10000   >10000   70 ± 6  308 ± 32    56 ± 4  139 ± 15    1400 ± 30    >10000   >10000 48 ± 5  40   >10000     ~100\n\n\n>10000 >10000 >10000   573 >10000 31 ± 2  55 ± 3  >10000   >10000   48 ± 1  62 ± 2    56 ± 6  114 ± 6    1915 ± 77    >10000   >10000 35 ± 1   32   >10000 683.2    73.2\n\n\n>10000 >10000 >10000  2233 >10000 33 ± 2  80 ± 1  >10000   >10000   76 ± 2  93 ± 6    83 ± 3  197 ± 9    10000   >10000   >10000  75 ± 0.5   46   >10000 465.8   44.14\n\n\n>10000 >10000 >10000   846 >10000 52 ± 3  80 ± 1  >10000   >10000   64 ± 1  99 ± 2     74 ± 0.5 144 ± 29     3312   >10000   >10000 58 ± 1    36   >10000  1501   129.4\n\n\n>10000 >10000 >10000   575 >10000  32 ± 0.7 57 ± 1  >10000   >10000   54 ± 1   72 ± 0.4    48 ± 0.3 117 ± 2    1441 ± 49    >10000   >10000  38 ± 0.2   28   >10000 777.9    63.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom Table 13, compounds with a phenylsulfonyl protection group attached to the nitrogen of the imidazole ring (11cb, 11 db, 11fb, 11ga, 11gb, 11ha, 11jb) were also very active with IC\n50 \nin the nM range (Table 13). Generally the activities of these compounds are comparable to their corresponding unprotected counterparts as exemplified by comparing the activities of 11cb (43 nM), 11 db (111 nM), 11fb (72 nM), 11ga (285 nM), 11gb (87 nM), 11ha (268 nM), and 11jb (61 nM) with their corresponding unprotected counterparts 12cb (36 nM), 12 db (109 nM), 12fb (64 nM), 12ga (131 nM), 12gb (72 nM), 12ha (330 nM), and 12jb (75 nM). Other compounds (11ab-11ag, 11ea, 11eb, 11hb, 11ia, and 111b, 1-50 μM) were generally much less active, also in line with their counterparts (12ab-12ag, 12ea, 12eb, 12hb, 12ia, and 12ib, 1-50 μM).\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\nActivity of Aryl-Benzoyl-Imidazole (ABI) Compounds in Drug-Resistant Melanoma Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nP-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated drug efflux represents a major mechanism for cancer cells to prevent the build up of effective anticancer intracellular drug concentrations. The activity of the ABI compounds were compared against multidrug-resistant (MDR) melanoma cells (MDA-MB-435/LCCMDR1) and their parental nonresistant cancer cells (MDA-MB-435). Although MDA-MB-435 was originally designated as a breast cancer cell line, it has been shown definitively to originate from the M14 melanoma cell line. Compounds 12da, 12fb, 12cb, 11cb, and 11fb together with other tubulin-targeting agents including colchicine, paclitaxel, and vinblastine were tested on both the MDR melanoma cell line and its parental melanoma cell line (Table 14). Paclitaxel and vinblastine are clinically used anticancer drugs known to target cell tubulin. Although colchicine is not an FDA-approved drug for cancer treatment, its prodrug, ZD6126, is in clinical trial for solid tumors. Bortezomib is the first therapeutic proteasome inhibitor and was approved in 2003 by the FDA for use in multiple myeloma. ABT-751 is known to target the tubulin colchicine binding site. It is a promising drug candidate in clinical trial for children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. Compounds 12da, 12fb, 12cb, 11cb, 11fb had much better resistance indices (3.0 for 12da, 0.9 for 12fb, 1.3 for 12cb, 0.8 for 11cb, 0.7 for 11fb) than colchicine (65.8), paclitaxel (69.3), and vinblastine (27.5). Although colchicine, paclitaxel, and vinblastine showed excellent activity in nonresistant melanoma cell lines (0.5-10 nM), these compounds were significantly less potent in the MDR melanoma cell line (277-658 nM). In contrast, 12cb, 11cb, 11M had essentially equivalent potency on both MDR (15 nM, 38 nM, 30 nM, 30 nM, 35 nM for 12da, 12fb, 12cb, 11cb and 11M respectively) and nonresistant melanoma cell lines (5 nM, 41 nM, 24 nM, 38 nM, 50 nM for 12da, 12M, 12cb, 11cb and 11M respectively).

Thus, they overcame the multidrug resistance found in MDA-MB-435/LCCMDR1 cells. The dose response curves are shown in \nFIG. 21\n for 12M, 12da, and 12cb.\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nIn Vitro Microtubule Polymerization Assay\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nBovine brain tubulin (0.4 mg) (Cytoskeleton, Denver, Colo.) was mixed with 10 μM of the test compound and incubated in 110 μl of general tubulin buffer (80 mM PIPES, 2.0 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 1 mM GTP) at pH 6.9. The absorbance at 340 nm was monitored every 1 min for 15 min by the \nSYNERGY\n 4 Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, Vt.). The spectrophotometer was set at 37° C. for tubulin polymerization.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThe inhibition of tublin polymerization by Aryl-Benzoyl-Imidazole (ABI) compounds was examined. Bovine brain tubulin (>97% pure) was incubated with three potent ABI compounds, 12cb, 12da, and 12 db at a concentration of 10 μM, to determine the effect of these ABI compounds on tubulin polymerization (\nFIG. 22\n). Tubulin polymerization was completely inhibited by compound 12da, while ˜80% inhibition was observed during incubation with compounds 12cb and 12 db.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis microtubule destabilization effect was similar to that of colchicine and vinblastine but was opposite to that of paclitaxel. The results not only confirmed that ABIs can directly interact with tubulin but also suggested that they may share the same binding site with colchicine (or vinblastine).\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\nMelanoma Inhibition In Vitro\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nB16-F1 melanoma cells were plated at a colony-forming density (2000 cells per well on six-well plates) on top of 0.8% base agar. Cells were grown in 0.4% agar together with DMEM medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and an antibiotic-antimycotic solution at 37° C. in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO\n2\n. Cells were treated with compounds 12da, 12cb and 12fb at different concentrations (20, 100, and 500 nM). Compounds were added to the media from 1-mM DMSO stock solutions, and a corresponding dilution of DMSO was used as control. Cells were grown for 14 days. Plates were photographed, and the number of colonies was measured by \nArtek\n 880 Automated Colony Counter (Artek Systems Corporation, Farmingdale, N.Y.).\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nFour representative photos are shown in \nFIG. 23\n. After 14 days of incubation, about 130 detectable colonies (diameter larger than 100 μm) were formed in controls (no treatment).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds 12cb and 12da effectively inhibited B16-F1 melanoma colony formation even at the lowest tested concentration, 20 nM (p<0.05 compared with control). 12fb showed effective inhibition at 100 nM. All three tested compounds showed complete inhibition of colony formation at 0.5 μM, further proving ABIs' antimelanoma efficacy.\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\nIn Vivo Anti-Tumor Activity\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nAnimals: Female C57/BL mice, age 4-6 weeks, were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Harlan Laboratories Inc., Indianapolis, Ind.). The animal housing met the Association for Assessment and Accreditation and Laboratory Animal Care specifications. All of the procedures were conducted in accordance with guidelines of our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo evaluation of efficacy. Mouse melanoma B16-F1 cells were prepared in FBS-free DMEM medium (Cellgro Mediatech) at a concentration of 5×10\n6 \nviable cells/mL. The cell suspension (100 μL) was injected subcutaneously in the right dorsal flank of each mouse. When tumor size reached about 100-150 mm\n3\n, about 7 days after cell inoculation, all mice bearing tumors were divided into control and treatment groups based on tumor size (n=5 per group). Each group had similar average tumor size. Mice in control groups (negative control) were injected intraperitoneally with 50 μL vehicle solution only or DTIC at 60 mg/kg (positive control) once daily. Tumor volume was measured every 2 days with a traceable electronic digital caliper (Fisher Scientific, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa.) and calculated using the formula a×b\n2\n×0.5, where a and b represented the larger and smaller diameters, respectively. Tumor volume was expressed in cubic millimeters. Data were expressed as mean±SE for each group and plotted as a function of time. Percentage tumor reduction at the conclusion of the experiment (14 days after starting treatment) was calculated with the \nformula\n 100−100×[(T−T\n0\n)/(C−C\n0\n)], where T represents mean tumor volume of a treated group on a specific day, T\n0 \nrepresents mean tumor volume of the same group on the first day of treatment, C represents mean tumor volume of a control on a specific day, and C\n0 \nrepresents mean tumor volume of the same group on the first day of treatment. Animal activity and average body weight of each group were monitored during the entire experiment period to assess compound toxicity. At the end of treatment, all mice were euthanized by CO\n2 \nfollowed by cervical dislocation, and tumors were harvested for further studies.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nTo evaluate efficacy of ABI analogs in vivo, we tested the antitumor activity of compound 12cb on mice melanoma B16-F1 xenograph. against DTIC, the gold standard in malignant melanoma treatment, was used as a positive control (\nFIG. 24A\n). Twenty female C57/BL mice were divided into four groups: a vehicle control group, a DTIC (60 mg/kg) treatment group, a 12cb (10 mg/kg) treatment group, and a 12cb (30 mg/kg) treatment group. Each mouse was injected with 0.5 million B16-F1 melanoma cells subcutaneously. Seven days after tumor inoculation, treatment started with each compound injected intraperitoneally daily (\nFIG. 24\n). Tumor volume was significantly (p<0.05) reduced 47%, 51%, and 73% for 12cb (10 mg/kg), DTIC (60 mg/kg), and 12cb (30 mg/kg), respectively, after 14 days of treatment. No significant weight loss was observed in any of the treatment groups during the experiment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo dose levels, 15 and 45 mg/kg, were chosen. DTIC at 60 mg/kg was used as a positive control. B16-F1 melanoma allograft model on C57BL/6 mice was first chosen for study. After 13 days of treatment. (\nFIG. 24B\n), compound 12fb inhibited melanoma tumor growth (TGI value) by 32% at 15 mg/kg and 82% at 45 mg/kg. Student's t test p value of 12fb at 45 mg/kg compared with control was less than 0.001, indicating a significant difference. The t test p value of 12fb at 15 mg/kg compared with control was 0.08, suggesting that this dose was not effective. Comparing 12fb at 45 mg/kg with DTIC at 60 mg/kg, which had a TGI of 51%, the t test p value was about 0.001, suggesting that 12fb had substantially better activity than did DTIC. For the control and 12fb 15 mg/kg treatment groups, average body weight increased slightly throughout the experiment period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo further confirm ABIs' in vivo activity, A375 human melanoma xenograft model on SHO mice was used, and 12fb at 25 mg/kg was tested. DTIC at 60 mg/kg was used as a positive control again. After 31 days of treatment (\nFIG. 24C\n), 12fb inhibited melanoma tumor growth (TGI value) by 69%, whereas DTIC inhibited growth by 52%. The t test p value of 12fb treatment versus control was less than 0.001, suggesting that 12fb significantly inhibited melanoma tumor growth at 25 mg/kg. The t test p value of 12fb treatment versus DTIC was less than 0.05, suggesting again that 12fb had better activity than did DTIC. Average body weight of all groups increased slightly throughout the experiment period. Physical activities for the mice also looked normal, suggesting that 25 mg/kg was a well tolerated dose for SHO mice.\n\n\n \nExample 19\n\n\nBinding to Colchicine\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nEach test compound was prepared at 20× concentration in G-PEM buffer (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, Colo.) followed by pipetting 10 μL of test compound into the 96-well plates. Ten microliters of tritiated labeled colchicine (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, Mass.) was added to each testing well. Subsequently, 180 μL bead/tubulin (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, N.J.) suspension was added into each well. The plate was incubated for 45 min at 37° C. before it was read by a Topcount NXT plate reader (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, Mass.). Nonradiolabeled “cold” colchicine was included as a positive control and paclitaxel as a negative control because paclitaxel binds to a different site in tubulin and does not compete for the colchicine site binding. Data were processed using GraphPad Prism software.\n\n\n \nCell Cycle Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nFlow cytometry analysis was performed to study cell cycle phase distribution. A375 cells were cultured in 10-cm tissue culture dishes until the confluence was about 80%, and then cells were treated with 0, 10, 50, 200, and 1000 nM of colchicine, 12da, 12fb and 12cb, for 24 h in growth media. Cellular DNA was stained with PBS containing 50 μg/mL propidium iodide and 100 μg/mL RNase A. The cell cycle was determined using a BD LSR-II cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) with 10,000 cells scored. Data were analyzed and graphs were prepared using the Modfit 2.0 program (Verity Software House, Topsham, Me.).\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThree ligand binding sites in tubulin α/β-heterodimer have been reported: paclitaxel binding site, vinblastine binding site, and colchicine binding site. The binding affinity of compound 12cb using \n3\nH-labeled colchicine and a competitive binding scintillation proximity assay (SPA) was measured. The results confirmed the strong binding of 12cb with a binding affinity of 3.4±1.5 μM (\nFIG. 25A\n). Colchicine bound tubulin with an IC\n50 \nvalue of 1.8±0.5 μM under these conditions. These results clearly indicated that ABI compounds effectively inhibit tubulin polymerization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding graph (\nFIG. 25A\n) clearly shows that ABIs can competitively bind to the tubulin colchicine binding site. As the concentration of the three tested compounds increased from 0.03 M to 100 μM, increased tritiated colchicine was competitively stripped away from tubulin, and emitted lower SPA counts. The negative control, paclitaxel, gave only a flat line, because theoretically it should not bind to the colchicine binding site on tubulin. Second, ABIs have relatively high binding affinity to the tubulin colchicine binding site. GraphPad Prism calculated IC\n50 \nvalues for binding showed that 12da has the highest binding affinity. The binding affinity was positively correlated to in vitro antimelanoma activity; the higher the binding affinity, the higher the antimelanoma activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nABIs demonstrated that they arrest cells by cell cycle analysis in the G2/M phase as indication that they target tubulin. Compounds 12da, 12fb and 12cb were tested together with colchicine as a positive control on A375 cells (\nFIG. 25B\n). Four different concentrations—10, 50, 200, and 1000 nM—of each compound were chosen to show the dose effect (\nFIGS. 25C and 25D\n). For controls (no treatment) without interference, about 16% of A375 cells were distributed in the G2/M phase. For the colchicine treatment group, as concentration increased from 10 nM to 50 nM, the percentage of cells distributed in the G2/M phase increased from 14% to 85%. ABIs had similar results for A375 cells, in arresting them in the G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner. The potency of the different concentrations in arresting cells in the G2/M phase positively correlated with in vitro activity.\n\n\n \nExample 20\n\n\nIn Vitro and In Vivo Pharmacology of Compounds 17ya, 12Fa, and 55\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nCell culture and cytotoxicity assay of prostate cancer. All prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145, PPC-1) were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va., USA). Human PC-3_T×R, was resistant to paclitaxel and used a MDR model compared with PC-3. Cell culture supplies were purchased from Cellgro Mediatech (Herndon, Va., USA). All cell lines were used to test the antiproliferative activity of compounds 17ya, 12fa, and 55 by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. All cancer cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 media with 2 mM glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vitro microtubule polymerization assay. Porcine brain tubulin (0.4 mg) (Cytoskeleton, Denver, Colo.) was mixed with 1 and 5 μM of the test compound or vehicle (DMSO) and incubated in 100 μl of buffer (80 mM PIPES, 2.0 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM EGTA, pH 6.9 and 1 mM GTP). The absorbance at 340 nm wavelength was monitored every min for 15 min (\nSYNERGY\n 4 Microplate Reader, Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, Vt.). The spectrophotometer was maintained at 37° C. for tubulin polymerization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolic incubations. Metabolic stability studies were conducted by incubating 0.5 μM of test compounds in a total reaction volume of 1 mL containing 1 mg/mL microsomal protein in reaction buffer [0.2 M of phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4), 1.3 mM NADP\n+\n, 3.3 mM glucose-6-phosphate, and 0.4 U/mL glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase] at 37° C. in a shaking water bath. The NADPH regenerating system (solution A and B) was obtained from BD Biosciences (Bedford, Mass.). For glucuronidation studies, 2 mM UDP-glucuronic acid (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) cofactor in deionized water was incubated with 8 mM MgCl\n2\n, 25 μg of alamethicin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) in deionized water, and NADPH regenerating solutions (BD Biosciences, Bedford, Mass.) as described previously. The total DMSO concentration in the reaction solution was approximately 0.5% (v/v). Aliquots (100 μL) from the reaction mixtures used to determine metabolic stability were sampled at 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 90 min. Acetonitrile (150 μL) containing 200 nM of the internal standard was added to quench the reaction and to precipitate the proteins. Samples were then centrifuged at 4,000 g for 30 min at RT, and the supernatant was analyzed directly by LC-MS/MS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalytical method. Sample solution (10 μL) was injected into an Agilent series HPLC system (Agilent 1100 Series Agilent 1100 Chemstation, Agilent Technology Co, Ltd). All analytes were separated on a narrow-bore C18 column (Alltech Alltima HP, 2.1×100 mm, 3 μm, Fisher, Fair Lawn, N.J.). Two gradient modes were used. For metabolic stability studies, gradient mode was used to achieve the separation of analytes using mixtures of mobile phase A [ACN/H\n2\nO (5%/95%, v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid] and mobile phase B [ACN/H\n2\nO (95%/5%, v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid] at a flow rate of 300 μL/min. Mobile phase A was used at 10% from 0 to 1 min followed by a linearly programmed gradient to 100% of mobile phase B within 4 min, 100% of mobile phase B was maintained for 0.5 min before a quick ramp to 10% mobile phase A. Mobile phase A was continued for another 10 min towards the end of analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA triple-quadruple mass spectrometer, \nAPI Qtrap\n 4000™ (Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX, Concord, Ontario, Canada), operating with a TurboIonSpray source was used. The spraying needle voltage was set at 5 kV for positive mode. Curtain gas was set at 10; \nGas\n 1 and \ngas\n 2 were set 50. Collision-Assisted-Dissociation (CAD) gas at medium and the source heater probe temperature at 500° C. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, scanning m/z 378→210 (17ya), m/z 373→205 (12fa), m/z 410→242 (55) and m/z 309→171 (internal standard), was used to obtain the most sensitive signals. Data acquisition and quantitative processing were accomplished using Analyst™ software, Ver. 1.4.1 (Applied Biosystems).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous solubility. The solubility of drugs was determined by Multiscreen Solubility Filter Plate (Millipore Corporate, Billerica, Mass.) coupled with LC-MS/MS. Briefly, 198 μL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4) was loaded into 96-well plate, and 2 μL of 10 mM test compounds (in DMSO) was dispensed and mixed with gentle shaking (200-300 rpm) for 1.5 hours at RT (N=3). The plate was centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min, and the filtrate was used to determine its concentration and solubility of test compound by LC-MS/MS as described previously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic study. Male ICR mice (n=3 per group) 6 to 8 weeks of age were purchased from Harlan Inc., and used to examine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 17ya, 12fa, and 55. All compounds (10 mg/kg) were dissolved in DMSO/PEG300 (1/9) and administered by a single intravenously (i.v.) injection (50 μL) into the tail vein. Blood samples were collected at 5, 15, and 30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hr after i.v. administration. Mice were given (p.o.) by oral gavage at 20 mg/kg (in Tween80/DMSO/H\n2\nO, 2/2/6) of each test compound to evaluate their oral bioavailability. Blood samples were collected at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hr after p.o. administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFemale Sprague-Dawley rats (n=3; 254±4 g) were purchased from Harlan Inc. (Indianapolis, Ind.). Rat thoracic jugular vein catheters were purchased from Braintree Scientific Inc. (Braintree, Mass.). On arrival at the animal facility, the animals were acclimated for 3 days in a temperature-controlled room (20-22° C.) with a 12-h light/dark cycle before any treatment. Compounds 17ya, 12fa, and 55 were administered i.v. into the thoracic jugular vein at a dose of 5 mg/kg (in DMSO/PEG300, 1/9). An equal volume of heparinized saline was injected to replace the removed blood, and blood samples (250 μl.) were collected via the jugular vein catheter at 10, 20, 30 min, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 hr. Rats were given (p.o.) by oral gavage at 10 mg/kg (in Tween80/DMSO/H\n2\nO, 2/2/6) of each test compound to evaluate their oral bioavailability. All blood samples (250 μL) after oral administration were collected via the jugular vein catheter at 30, 60, 90 min, 120 min, 150 min, 180 min, 210 min, 240 min, and 8, 12, 24 hr. Heparinized syringes and vials were prepared prior to blood collection. Plasma samples were prepared by centrifuging the blood samples at 8,000 g for 5 min. All plasma samples were stored immediately at −80° C. until analyzed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalytes were extracted from 100 μL of plasma with 200 μL of acetonitrile containing 200 nM the internal standard. The samples were thoroughly mixed, centrifuged, and the organic extract was transferred to autosampler for LC-MS/MS analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPC-3_T×R xenograft studies. PC-3_T×R cells (10×10\n7 \nper mL) were prepared in RPMI1640 growth media containing 10% FBS, and mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) at 1:1 ratio. Tumors were established by injecting 100 μL of the mixture (5×10\n6 \ncells per animal) subcutaneously (s.c.) into the flank of 6-8-week-old male athymic nude mice. Length and width of tumors were measured and the tumor volume (mm\n3\n) was calculated by the formula, π/6×L×W\n2\n, where length (L) and width (W) were determined in mm. When the tumor volumes reached 300 mm\n3\n, the animals bearing PC-3_T×R tumors were treated with vehicle [Tween80/DMSO/H\n2\nO (2/2/6)], or 17ya (10 mg/kg) orally.

The ability of 17ya and 55 to inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines was evaluated using the SRB assay. As shown in Table 15, both 17ya and 55 inhibited the growth of four prostate cancer cell lines, with IC\n50 \nvalues in the low nanomolar range. These data suggested that both compounds exhibited comparable cytotoxicity with paclitaxel. In addition, the effect of 17ya and 55 in the PC-3 and PC-3_T×R cell lines was also evaluated (Table 15). Both 17ya and 55 were equally potent against MDR cell (PC-3_T×R) and the parent cell line (PC-3). Paclitaxel exhibited relative resistance values of 20 times. These data indicate that the 17ya and 55 circumvent P-gp-mediated drug resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n17ya and 55 Inhibit Microtubule Polymerization.\n\n\n \n \nPorcine brain tubulin (>97% pure) was incubated with the individual compounds 17ya and 55 (1 and 5 μM) to test their effect on tubulin polymerization (\nFIG. 26\n).

The half-life (90 min) in the presence of UDP-glucuronic acid was similar to that observed in its absence. These data suggested that 17ya is stable in human liver microsomes, and it was hoped that low clearance and long half-life will be obtained in human. On the other hand, 55 exhibited 30 and 43 min as half lives when it was in the presence and absence of UDP-glucuronic acid, respectively. Compound 12fa shows the half-life with 44 in phase I. These data suggested that all three compounds showed acceptable stability in human liver microsomes, and 17ya is more stable than 12fa and 55. When investigating their metabolism, it was found that 12fa and 55 exhibited higher levels of ketone-reduction (data not shown), suggesting that 12fa and 55 are more labile than 17ya.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound 17ya Exhibited Great Aqueous Solubility, 12fa and 55 Showed Acceptable Solubility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound 17ya contained an imidazole ring, and this ring improved aqueous solubility, resulting in >75 μg/mL aqueous solubility (Table 16). Compounds 12fa and 55 exhibited less aqueous solubility, and exhibited 12 and 19 μg/mL, respectively. Overall, 17ya demonstrated a great aqueous solubility, and 12fa and 55 showed acceptable aqueous solubility, and much improved over 1h.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll compounds 17ya, 12fa and 55 Showed Great Pharmacokinetic Properties and Bioavailability in Mice and Rats.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA single dose IV bolus of 17ya, 12fa, and 55 was administered to ICR mice, and Sprague-Dawley rats. Their PK parameters are summarized in Table 16. In vivo total clearances were 19, 61 and 40 mL/min/kg for 17ya, 12fa, and 55 in mice, respectively. In rats, their in vivo total clearances were 9.5, 16 and 10 mL/min/kg for 17ya, 12fa, and 55 respectively. Compound 17ya exhibited low clearance in both mice and rats. Compounds 12fa and 55 also had a low clearance in rats, but a moderate clearance in mice. These clearance values suggested that all compounds may overcome first-pass metabolism and exhibit a great chance to be orally bioavailable agents. Intermediate volumes of distribution of 2.9 and 1.8 L/kg were obtained from 17ya; 4 and 1.9 L/kg were obtained from 12fa, 1.3 and 1.0 L/kg were obtained from 55 in mouse and rat, respectively. The oral bioavailability was 36% and 21% from 17ya in mice and rats. On the other hand, 12fa had 62% and 35% oral bioavailability, 55 exhibited 34% and 33% oral bioavailability in mice and rats, respectively. These data suggested that all compounds 17ya, 12fa, and 55 may be potentially used orally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound 17ya Inhibits Paclitaxel Resistant Prostate Xenografts Growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPaclitaxel resistant prostate cancer PC-3_T×R tumors in mice were allowed to reach a volume of 300 mm\n3 \nand then tumor-bearing mice were treated with 10 mg/kg of 17ya orally. As shown in \nFIG. 27\n, tumor volumes in the control group increased to 1521±35 mm\n3 \n(mean±SE) over 13 days. Mice in vehicle group lost>20% body weight and were sacrificed on day-13. Tumor volumes in the 17ya-treated group slightly increased before \nday\n 6. However, their tumor sizes were reduced below their original tumor sizes, suggesting that partial regression was obtained by the treatment group. In addition, their body weights increased over time, suggesting the treatment did not show apparent toxicity.\n\n\n \nExample 21\n\n\nPharmacokinetics of Compounds of this Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHalf life in\n\n\nHalf life in\n\n\nHalf life in\n\n\nHalf life in\n\n\nHalf life in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman liver\n\n\nMouse liver\n\n\nRat liver\n\n\nDog liver\n\n\nMonkey liver\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nmicrosome\n\n\nmicrosome\n\n\nmicrosome\n\n\nmicrosome\n\n\nmicrosome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\n\n\n(min)\n\n\n(min)\n\n\n(min)\n\n\n(min)\n\n\n(min)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1h\n\n\n17\n\n\n<5\n\n\n31\n\n\n19\n\n\n<5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2e-cis\n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2i\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2k\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n9\n\n\n32\n\n\n16\n\n\n<5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2l\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n11\n\n\n49\n\n\n30\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n6a\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n3.43\n\n\n12\n\n\n13\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n6b\n \n\n\n40\n\n\n10\n\n\n9\n\n\n30\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6c\n\n\n47\n\n\n13\n\n\n14\n\n\n29\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n7d\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n37\n\n\n42\n\n\n29\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12da\n\n\n23\n\n\n8\n\n\n28\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12fa\n\n\n56\n\n\n23\n\n\n46\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12fb\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n12dab\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n<5\n\n\n12\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 22\n\n\nBiological Activity of 4-Substituted Methoxybenzoyl-Aryl Thiazole (Smart): an Active Microtubule Inhibitor\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nIn vitro microtubule polymerization assay. Bovine brain tubulin (0.4 mg) (Cytoskeleton, Denver, Colo.) was mixed with 10 μM of the test compound or vehicle (DMSO) and incubated in 100 μl of buffer (80 mM PIPES, 2.0 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, pH 6.9 and 1 mM GTP). The absorbance at 340 nm wavelength was monitored every min for 15 min (\nSYNERGY\n 4 Microplate Reader, Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, Vt.). The spectrophotometer was maintained at 37° C. for tubulin polymerization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMS competition binding assay. Colchicine, vinblastine, and paclitaxel (1.2 μM for each) were incubated with tubulin (1.2 mg/mL) in the incubation buffer (80 mM PIPES, 2.0 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.5 mM EGTA, pH 6.9) at 37° C. for 1 hr. 1h (0.5-125 μM) was examined to individually compete with colchicine-, vinblastine-, and paclitaxel-tubulin binding. The free-form ligands were separated from tubulin or microtubule using an ultrafiltration method (microconcentrator) (Microcon, Bedford, Mass.) with a molecular cutoff size of 30k Da. Colchicine, vinblastine and paclitaxel were determined by LCMS/MS method. The ability of 1h to inhibit the binding of ligands was expressed as a percentage of control binding in the absence of any competitor. Each reaction was run in triplicate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell culture and cytotoxicity assay of prostate and melanoma cancer. All prostate and melanoma cell lines were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va., USA), while cell culture supplies were purchased from Cellgro Mediatech(Herndon, Va., USA). The antiproliferative activity of the compounds was examined in four human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, \nDU\n 145, PC-3, and PPC-1) and two human melanoma cell lines (A375 and WM-164). Human ovarian cell line OVCAR-8 and its resistant cell line that over-expresses P-gp, NCI/ADR-RES, were used as MDR models. Both ovarian cell lines were obtained from National Cancer Institutes (NCI). All prostate cancer cell lines were cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum (PBS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell cycle analysis. Flow cytometry was performed to study the effects of the compounds on cell cycle distribution. PC-3 and A375 cells were treated in growth media with the indicated concentrations of \n \n \ncompounds\n \n \n 1h, 2k, 21 for 24 h. Cellular DNA was stained with 100 μg/mL propidium iodide and 100 μg/mL RNase A in PBS and flow cytometry was performed to determine the cell cycle distribution of the cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApoptosis detection by ELISA. Quantification of the enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes in the cytoplasm was used to determine the ability of the compounds to induce apoptosis (cell death detection ELISA PLUS, Roche, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic study. Male ICR mice (n=3 or 4 per group) 6 to 8 weeks of age were purchased from Harlan Inc., and used to examine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the compounds. 1h, 2k, 2l (15 mg/kg) were dissolved in PEG300/DMSO (1/4) and administered by a single i.v. injection into the tail vein. Blood samples were collected at 2, 5, 15, and 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hr after administration. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=4; 254±4 g) were purchased from Harlan Inc. (Indianapolis, Ind.). 1h, 2k, were administered intravenously into the jugular venous catheters at 2.5 mg/kg (in DMSO/PEG300, 1/4). Blood samples (250 μL) were collected at 10, 20, 30 min, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 h. A protein precipitation method was used for sample preparation. An aliquot (200 μL) of acetonitrile (ACN) was added to 100 μL of plasma and then was thoroughly vortexed for 15 s. After centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The PK parameters were determined using Non compartment analysis (WinNonlin, Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPC-3 and A375 tumor xenograft studies. PC-3 and A375 cells (5×10\n7 \nper mL) were prepared in phenol red-free growth media containing 10% FBS, and mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) at 1:1 ratio. Tumors were established by injecting 100 μL of the mixture (2.5×10\n6 \ncells per animal) subcutaneously (s.c.) into the flank of 6-8-week-old male athymic nude mice. Length and width of tumors were measured and the tumor volume (mm\n3\n) was calculated by the formula, π/6×L×W\n2\n, where length (L) and width (W) were determined in mm. When the tumor volumes reached 150 mm\n3\n, the animals bearing PC-3 tumors were treated with vehicle [Captex200/Tween80 (1/4)], 1h (5 and 15 mg/kg), 2k (5 and 15 mg/kg) and 21 (50 mg/kg) intraperitorally for 21 days. Vinblastine (0.5 mg/kg) was used as the positive control and dosed q2d with vehicle [DMSO/PEG300 (1/9)]. On the other hand, A375 tumor bearing mice were treated for 34 days with vehicle [Captex200/Tween80 (1/4)], 1h (20 mg/kg) or 2k (15 mg/kg). Doses were selected based on acute toxicity studies of 1h and 2k in ICR mice (n=2/group) showing that doses up to 30 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, respectively, did not cause greater than 10% loss of body weight after 4 consecutive days of intraperitoneal dosing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo antitumor activity [tumor growth inhibition (% T/C), tumor growth delay (T-C value), and tumor cell kill (total log cell kill)]. Evidence of drug effect is described by the following parameters: % T/C=[Δ tumor volume of treated group]/[Δ tumor volume of control group]×100%. The T-C values (tumor growth delay) were based on the median time (in days), required for the treatment (T) and the control group (C) tumors, to reach a predetermined size (600 mm\n3 \nin this study). These values were then used for the quantitation of the tumor cell kill following the equation: log cell kill=(T-C)/(3.32×Td). Td is the tumor volume-doubling time in days. In this study, we defined the doubling time required for the tumor to increase from 300 to 600 mm\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRotarod test. ICR mice received training three times a day for two days to enable them to stay on the rotating rod for >120 seconds at 12 rpm. Mice were then randomized by the length of time that they could stay on the rotating rod and divided into 7-8 mice per group. 1h at a dose of 5 or 15 mg/kg in Captex200/Tween80 (1/4) was administered by intraperitoneal injection. Vinblastine at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day was used as a positive control under the same conditions. The rotarod test was performed twice a week. Treatment was stopped on day 31, and post observation was examined on \n \n \nweeks\n \n \n 1, 2, and 4 after termination of the treatment. The rod speed was increased from 59 rpm to 40 rpm over a period of 5 min. Performance was measured as the length of time that a mouse could stay on the rotating rod.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo drug resistance studies. At the end of the PC-3 xenograft studies, solid tumors from control and 1h treated (15 mg/kg) groups were removed and digested with 0.1% collagenase (Type I) and 50 mg/mL DNAse (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, N.J.). Dispersed cells were plated in RPMI medium+10% FBS and incubated at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nfor 24 hr to allow attachment. The anti-proliferative effects of 1h were compared to determine whether tumor cells remaining in PC-3 xenografts retained sensitivity to drug. The PC-3 cells obtained from ATCC were used as in vitro control.

While 1h and 2k inhibited tubulin polymerization by 90%, 2l inhibited the polymerization by only 55%. Previous studies demonstrated a concentration-dependent inhibition of tubulin polymerization by 1h. In addition, under the same experimental conditions, the IC\n50 \nfor 1h (4.23 μM) is similar to that of colchicine (4.91 μM). These data suggest that the compounds exhibit strong antitubulin polymerization activity that corresponds well with their cytotoxicity (Table 18). The ability of the compounds to compete for known binding sites on tubulin was determined using a novel MS competitive binding assay, which was developed in our laboratory. Three tubulin ligands, corresponding to the three binding sites on tubulin, colchicine, vinblastine, and paclitaxel were used for these competitive binding studies. It was found that, over a concentration range of 0.1-125 μM, 1h specifically competed with colchicine binding to tubulin, but it did not compete with either vinblastine or paclitaxel binding to tubulin (\nFIG. 28C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSMART Compounds Inhibit the Growth of Multidrug-Resistant Cancer Cell Lines\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of the compounds to inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines was evaluated using the SRB assay. As shown in Table 18, the compounds inhibited the growth of several human cancer cell lines, including four prostate cancer cell lines, and two melanoma cell lines, with IC\n50 \nvalues in the low nanomolar range. Out of the three compounds, 2l was the least potent (IC\n50 \n76˜116 nM). 2k exhibited the best anti-proliferative effect with IC\n50 \nvalues between 6 and 43 nM in prostate cancer and melanoma cell lines. In addition, the effect of the compounds in the OVCAR-8 and NCI/ADR-RES cell lines was also evaluated (Table 18). The compounds were equally potent against MDR cell (NCI-ADR-RES) and the parent cell line (OVCAR-8). Paclitaxel, vinblastine, and colchicine exhibited relative resistance values of 1333, 149, and 65 times, respectively (Table 18). These data indicate that the compounds circumvent P-gp-mediated drug resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSMART compounds arrest PC-3 (Prostate) and A375 (Melanoma) cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle and induce cell apoptosis. PC-3 and A375 cells were exposed to 10, 50, 200, and 1000 nM of the compounds for 24 h. Treatment with the SMART compounds resulted in concentration-dependent accumulation of both PC-3 and A375 cells in the G2/M phase with concomitant decreases in the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase (\nFIGS. 29A and 29B\n). The proportion of cells in G2/M phase significantly increased when treated with 50 to 200 nM of 1h, 2k, 2l. Apoptosis was then examined by measuring the level of cytoplasmic DNA-histone complexes in PC-3 and A375 cells after 24 h treatment. Increasing concentration of the SMART compounds increased the level of cytoplasmic DNA-histone complexes in PC-3 and A375 cells (\nFIG. 29C\n). The effect was more pronounced in A375 cells than PC-3 cells, but apoptosis was evident in both cell types. 1h and 2k induced moderate apoptosis at a concentration of 50 nM, while 2l induced apoptosis only at concentrations greater than or equal to 200 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo PK profile of SMART compounds. A single dose bolus of each compound (15 mg/kg) was administered by tail vein injection to ICR mice to characterize their pharmacokinetics (\nFIG. 30A\n). 1h and 2k exhibited similar PK properties, but 21 exhibited slightly greater AUC than 1h and 2k indicative of a lower clearance for 21 (Table 19). 2l also had 2-3 times higher V\nss \nthan that of 1h and 2k. The clearance values for all three compounds were equal to or higher than 90 mL/min/kg, the hepatic blood flow rate in mice, suggesting that in addition to hepatic removal, other degradation routes may be involved in the elimination of the compounds. The pharmacokinetics of 1h and 2k (2.5 mg/kg) were also examined in rats (\nFIG. 30B\n). Interestingly, low clearance values and hepatic extraction rates were obtained by both compounds, suggesting that these compounds exhibit species differences in clearance. In rats, 1h exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic properties, which are low clearance (6 mL/min/kg), moderate volume of distribution (7.6 L/kg), long half-life (24 hr), and high exposure (AUC, 5.8 hr*μg/mL) (Table 19) when administered iv.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters of SMART compounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMARTs were administrated 15 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni.v. in mice and rats, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn vivo, pharmacokinetic parameters of SMART compounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSMART-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nUnit\n\n\nH\n\n\nSMART-F\n\n\nSMART-OH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMice\n\n\nAUC\n\n\nhr * μg/mL\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nt\n1/2\n \n\n\nmin\n\n\n140\n\n\n141\n\n\n740\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nss\n \n\n\nL/kg\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n16.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCL\n\n\nmL/min/\nkg\n \n\n\n130\n\n\n112\n\n\n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRats\n\n\nAUC\n\n\nhr * μg/mL\n\n\n5.8\n\n\n1.6\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nt\n1/2\n \n\n\nmin\n\n\n1431\n\n\n2410\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nss\n \n\n\nL/kg\n\n\n7.6\n\n\n34\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCL\n\n\nmL/min/\nkg\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n11\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNA, not available\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMART-H in Table 19 is 1h;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMART-F in Table 19 is 2k; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMART-OH in Table 19 is 2l.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSMART compounds inhibit prostate and melanoma xenografts growth without neurotoxicity. Prostate cancer PC-3 and melanoma A375 tumors in mice were allowed to reach a volume of 150 mm\n3 \nand then tumor-bearing mice were treated with the SMART compounds.

The high dose of 2l (50 mg/kg) exhibited the % T/C of 34%. Vinblastine, the positive control, showed % T/C of 29% at \nday\n 22 in PC-3 xenografts (\nFIG. 31B\n). Body weight measurements, to monitor toxicity, indicated that only 1 of 8 mice treated with 1h (15 mg/kg), and 2 out of 7 mice treated with 2k (15 mg/kg) lost more than 15% body weight. In addition to the antitumor effects of the compounds on PC-3 prostate tumors, 1h (20 mg/kg) and 2k (15 mg/kg) demonstrated a significant reduction of A375 tumors. As shown in \nFIG. 31C\n, the tumor volumes of control group increased to 2183 mm\n3\n, whereas the 14 volumes in 1h and 2k treatment groups increased to 775 mm\n3 \nand 722 mm\n3\n, respectively. 1h and 2k treatment evoked % T/C of 28% and 29%, respectively. Rotarod tests were performed to examine the in vivo neurotoxic effects of 1h. Based on the result of in vivo efficacy experiments, 5 or 15 mg/kg [i.p. administration, Captex200/Tween80 (1/4)] of 1h was chosen to study the effect on motor coordination. A 0.5 mg/kg treatment with vinblastine was used as the positive control under the same conditions. As shown in \nFIG. 31D\n, vinblastine gradually reduced the time (in seconds) that the mice could stay on the rotating rod, and attained significance by days 27 and 31 (p<0.05) compared to the vehicle group. However, no significant difference was observed in the 1h treatment groups, suggesting that 1h did not cause neurotoxicity in ICR mice at doses that are associated with antitumor effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1h did not develop drug-resistance in PC-3 tumor bearing mice. We excised the PC-3 tumors from nude mice after 21 days of treatment with vehicle (n=3) or 15 mg/\nkg\n 1h (n=3). Solid tumors were digested and dispersed into cells as described in the methods section. PC-3 cell line from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va., USA) was used as a control. IC\n50 \nvalues were 29.1±1.1, 29.1±0.8, and 30.4±0.5 nM in PC-3 cells from ATCC, and dissociated cells from vehicle and 1h treated tumors, respectively. These data demonstrate that 1h did not induce drug-resistance in PC-3 tumors after 21 days of continuous 1h treatment.\n\n\n \nExample 23\n\n\nMolecular Modeling\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n \n \n \nAll molecular modeling studies were performed with Schrodinger Molecular Modeling Suite 2008 (Schrodinger LLC, New York, N.Y.), running on a Dell Linux workstation. Because the size of ABI compounds are much closer to that of ABT-751, rather than DAMA-colchichine, we selected tubulin complex with ABT-751 (PDB code: 3 KHC) as our modeling system. ABIs were built and prepared using the Ligprep module, and they were docked into the ABT-751 site using the Glide module in Schrodinger Suite. The best docking complexes were subject to restricted molecular dynamics to release any strains using Macromodel module with OPLS-2005 forcefield. The ligand and its surrounding residues within 15 Å were allowed to move freely, while residues outside the 15 Å radius were kept rigid.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nMolecular modeling for binding ABI compounds in tubulin was studied. Several crystal structures of the ligand-tubulin complex are available in the PDB databank, with the most recent one from Dorleans et al. In general, the colchicine binding pocket tolerates a variety of molecular structures, which may indicate substantial conformation changes upon ligand binding. In fact, Dorleans et al. solved the crystal structures of both the empty tubulin dimer and the ligand-tubulin complex. They found that, without the presence of ligand, loop 7 (T7, residues 244-251, \nFIG. 32\n) in the beta-monomer folds in to occupy the binding pocket, while it flips out upon ligand binding. The associated helix 7 (H7, residues 224-243) and helix 8 (H8, residues 252-260) were displaced upon ligand binding. It is conceivable that the extent to which 17 is displaced depends on the size of individual ligand. This flexibility presents a significant challenge to understand the precise binding modes for individual ligands without solving actual crystal structures. Nevertheless, careful analysis of the possible binding modes could provide some insights into the binding of different ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding modes of 12cb and 11cb (stick model) are shown in \nFIGS. 32A and 32B\n. For comparison, the crystal structure complexes of ABT-751 and DAMA-colchicine (wire models) along with ABI-12cb/tubulin complex in \nFIG. 32A\n is displayed. For clarity, only the related secondary structures forming the binding pocket in 13-tubulin are shown in \nFIG. 32A\n. The overall structures of 12cb, ABT-751 and DAMA-colchicine overlapped very well in the binding pocket. Several potential hydrogen bonding interactions between compound 12cb and tubulin were identified. The carbonyl group in 12cb was in sufficient proximity to form two hydrogen bond interactions with the backbone NH of Leu-252 in H8 and the sidechain of Asp-251 in 17 of the tubulin β-monomer. The para-fluorine substituent in the C-ring was close to the sidechain of Cys241 in T7 and Tyr202 in S6, possibly forming one or two hydrogen bonds. The imidazole proton is very close and likely to form a hydrogen bond to Thr179 in T5 loop (residues 173-182) of the tubulin α-monomer (\nFIG. 32A\n). Together with the hydrophobic interactions provided by the aromatic rings, the likely formation of these hydrogen bonds would contribute to the high binding affinity to the tubulin dimer, resulting in high antiproliferative potency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding mode of 11cb will be conceivably less defined since two of the three aromatic rings may occupy the binding pocket in the β-monomer while the third ring may extend toward the interface of the α/β-monomers, similar to how the sidechain of DAMA-chochicine binds. Our modeling indicates that the protecting group likely extends to the tubulin dimer interface, while the A, C rings of 11cb occupy similar binding pocket and orientation as 12cb (\nFIG. 32B\n). This may explain the similar activity between the two compounds, even though 11cb has an extra ring system. From the molecular modeling studies presented in \nFIGS. 32A and 32B\n, the hydrogen bond donor is likely to be the thiol group in Cys-241 in \nloop\n 7 of the β-subunit in α/β-tubulin dimer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding mode of ABI 12fb was modeled (not shown) and compared to DAMA-colchicine (see \nFIG. 19\n for structure of colchicine) in the α/β-tubulin heterodimer. The overall structure of 12fb and DAMA-cochicine overlapped very well. The p-fluoro phenyl moiety overlaps with the trimethoxylpheny moiety which is interacting with the T7 loop in the β-subunit. Similarly, the p-chloro phenyl moiety occupies the other side of the pocket where the seven-member ring of the DAMA-cochicine is, with the chlorine atom occupying the pocket where the methoxy moiety interacts.\n\n\n \nExample 24\n\n\nMicrotobule Imaging\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nCellomics Cytoskeleton rearrangement kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.) was used to get a visually appreciable proof of ABIs interacting with tubulin inside the cells. WM-164 melanoma cells were treated with each compound for 18 h in duplicate using a collagen-coated 96-well plate (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, Mass.). Then cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.) and permeabilized using permeabilization buffer supply from the kit. Primary antibody for tubulin and fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody were subsequently added to the cells. Cell nuclei were stained by DAPI. Whole Cell Stain Green was also applied to all cells. All images were acquired with an Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with overlays from separate\n\n\n \n \nimages of tubulin (red), nuclei (blue), and whole cells (green). For comparison, paclitacel, colchicine and ABT-751, along with ABIs are included.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nVisual proof of ABIs interacting with tubulin inside the cells was examined. The microtubule arrangement in human melanoma WM-164 cells upon treatment with different compounds is presented in \nFIG. 33\n. The microtubule images clearly showed that all five tested compounds resulted in cytoskeleton rearrangement. There was a significant difference between paclitaxel and the other four compounds (colchicine, ABT-751, 12cb, and 12da). Treatment with paclitaxel resulted in a condensation of microtubules orderly lying around the nuclei compared with controls, consistent with its mechanisms of action for stabilizing microtubules. On the contrary, treatment with colchicine, ABT-751, 12cb, and 12da had similar effects on microtubules and resulted in some degree of microtubule fragmentation, consistent with their common mechanism of action for destabilizing microtubules. These results also confirmed that ABIs shared the same cellular target with colchicine and induced the same cellular effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll of the features described herein (including any accompanying claims, abstract and drawings), and/or all of the steps of any method or process so disclosed, may be combined with any of the above aspects in any combination, except combinations where at least some of such features and/or steps are mutually exclusive.

Description\n\n\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application is based on, and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §120 to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/324,945, filed on Apr. 19, 2010, and which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel biphenyl oxadiazole derivatives, processes for preparing them, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as pharmaceuticals as modulators of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. The invention relates specifically to the use of these compounds and their pharmaceutical compositions to treat disorders associated with sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulation.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nSphingosine-1 phosphate is stored in relatively high concentrations in human platelets, which lack the enzymes responsible for its catabolism, and it is released into the blood stream upon activation of physiological stimuli, such as growth factors, cytokines, and receptor agonists and antigens. It may also have a critical role in platelet aggregation and thrombosis and could aggravate cardiovascular diseases. On the other hand the relatively high concentration of the metabolite in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) may have beneficial implications for atherogenesis. For example, there are recent suggestions that sphingosine-1-phosphate, together with other lysolipids such as sphingosylphosphorylcholine and lysosulfatide, are responsible for the beneficial clinical effects of HDL by stimulating the production of the potent antiatherogenic signaling molecule nitric oxide by the vascular endothelium. In addition, like lysophosphatidic acid, it is a marker for certain types of cancer, and there is evidence that its role in cell division or proliferation may have an influence on the development of cancers. These are currently topics that are attracting great interest amongst medical researchers, and the potential for therapeutic intervention in sphingosine-1-phosphate metabolism is under active investigation.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nWe have now discovered a group of novel compounds which are potent and selective sphingosine-1-phosphate modulators.

For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides, fatty acids (including oleic acid), naturally occurring vegetable oils like sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, etc., or synthetic fatty vehicles like ethyl oleate or the like. Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants, and the like can be incorporated as required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInvention compounds may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions may be prepared by mixing the invention compounds with a suitable non-irritating excipient, such as cocoa butter, synthetic glyceride esters of polyethylene glycols, which are solid at ordinary temperatures, but liquify and/or dissolve in the rectal cavity to release the drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince individual subjects may present a wide variation in severity of symptoms and each drug has its unique therapeutic characteristics, the precise mode of administration and dosage employed for each subject is left to the discretion of the practitioner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds and pharmaceutical compositions described herein are useful as medicaments in mammals, including humans, for treatment of diseases and or alleviations of conditions which are responsive to treatment by agonists or functional antagonists of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. Thus, in further embodiments of the invention, there are provided methods for treating a disorder associated with modulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors.

(canceled) Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a novel cyclohexylamine derivative containing a phenyl group which is useful as a novel sigma receptor ligand, and a therapeutic agent for a disease accompanied by a central nervous system disorder containing the compound as an active ingredient. More particularly, it relates to a novel cyclohexylamine derivative containing a phenyl group; a pharmaceutical composition for treatment or prevention of symptoms of the disease, containing the compound as an active ingredient; and a method for treatment or prevention of a disease accompanied by a central nervous system disorder comprising administering the active ingredient.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nSigma receptor ligands are known to play a variety of physiological functions by acting on sigma receptors present in central neural cells, etc. Two subtypes of the sigma receptors are currently known, and, among them, a sigma-1 receptor is known to be mainly accompanied by the central nervous system from studies such as pharmacological studies, ethological studies. Recently, it is known that the sigma-1 receptor is involved in various central nervous system disorders including schizophrenia, dementia, depression, etc. It is expected that a compound having a strong affinity to sigma receptors is useful as a therapeutic agent for treatment of a disease accompanied by a central nervous system disorder (for example, schizophrenia, dementia, depression, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the recent studies, a finding has been, obtained that pharmacological effects related to sigma receptors are based on the promotion of regeneration/maturation of the nerve tissue in association with the sigma receptors. In other words, for example, Patent Document 1 suggests that, in cerebral infarction model rats artificially created by ligating the middle cerebral artery to stop the blood flow, sigma receptors are involved in motor function recovery from cranial neuropathy, as well as suggests that compounds showing a strong affinity to sigma receptors may be useful as a therapeutic agent for the central nervous system disorder accompanied by cerebral infarction, cerebral contusion, spinal cord injury, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is known that an N-(methyl, ethyl, or propyl)-N-substituted-cyclohexylamine derivative acts as a sigma receptor ligand. As such a compound, for example, N-ethyl-N-(2-phenylethyl)cyclohexylamine derivatives (e.g., N-ethyl-N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenylethyl)]-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexylamine, etc.) are described in \nPatent Document\n 2. These compounds each have a structure such that a 1-pyrrolidinyl group is bound to an N-substituted cyclohexylamine ring. However, \nPatent Document\n 2 discloses neither a cyclohexylamine derivative having a phenylthio group nor a cyclohexylamine derivative containing a phenyl group that has one amine structure bound to a cyclohexyl ring. Moreover, there are not many known compounds that have a high affinity to sigma receptors and promote the regeneration/maturation of the central neural cells as well.\n\n\n \nPRIOR ART DOCUMENTS\n\n\nPatent Documents\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nPatent Document 1: US patent application publication No. 2005/0020483\n\n\nPatent document 2: U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,158\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nProblems to be Solved by the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nIn view of the current situation described above, the problem of the present invention is to provide a novel cyclohexylamine derivative containing a phenyl group which is useful as a novel sigma receptor ligand, and a therapeutic agent for a disease accompanied by a central nervous system disorder containing the compound as an active ingredient.

The reaction of step R2 is carried out under stirring in a reaction-inert solvent (e.g., anhydrous diethyl ether, anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, anhydrous 1,2-dimethoxyethane, and anhydrous diglyme) at −70° C. to 60° C., preferably at 0 to 50° C., for 2 to 36 hours, preferably 12 to 24 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds [3] to [7] also can be obtained in the same way, and the compound [4] may be obtained by reacting (3-trifluoromethylphenylthio)acetic acid in place of the compound [I] in the above method; the compound [6] may be obtained by reacting (3,4-dimethoxyphenylthio)acetic acid in place of the compound [I]; and the compound [7] may be obtained by reacting (4-fluorophenylthio)acetic acid in place of the compound [I]. Moreover, in order to obtain the compound [3], decahydroquinoline and the compound of the formula [I] may be reacted in place of the N-ethylcyclohexylamine in the above method. Further, the compound [5] can be obtained by using (3-difluoromethylphenylthio)acetic acid in step R2 for obtaining the compound [4]. However, the compound [5] can also be obtained by separating and purifying the compound [4] and the compound [5] respectively by a silica gel column chromatography after the step of obtaining the compound [4].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the compound wherein n is 2 and Z is a sulfur atom can be produced by using (phenylthio) propionic acid or its derivative in place of (phenylthio)acetic acid or its derivative. Similarly, the compound wherein n is 3 to 5 can also be produced by using a butanoic acid derivative, a pentanoic acid derivative, a hexanoic acid derivative, etc. Using N-propylcyclohexylamine and the like in place of N-ethylcyclohexylamine, a corresponding compound of the present invention can be produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong the compounds of the present invention, the compound wherein Z is a carbon atom can be produced by using 3-phenylpropionic acid or its derivative in place of (phenylthio)acetic acid or its derivative. For example, as an example of the above compounds [8] to [10] (collectively referred to as compound [A] in the following scheme 2), they can be synthesized by the reaction between N-cyclohexyl-N-ethylamine and a 3-phenylpropionic acid derivative [III] (in the formula, R1 represents H, OH or F), followed by reduction. \nScheme\n 2 is shown below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other words, a compound [A] can be obtained by condensing a 3-phenylpropionic acid derivative (formula [III]) with N-cyclohexyl-N-ethylamine to give an amide compound (formula [IV]), which is then reduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, a corresponding compound of the present invention (n is 2) can be produced with use of phenylbutanoic acid or its derivative in place of a 3-phenylpropionic acid derivative. Similarly, the compound wherein n is 3, 4, or 5 can also be produced. Using N-propylcyclohexylamine and the like in place of N-ethylcyclohexylamine, a corresponding compound of the present invention can be produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong the compounds of the present invention, the compound wherein Z is an oxygen atom can be produced by using, for example, 1-(2-haloethoxy)benzene or its derivative in place of (phenylthio)acetic acid or its derivative. For example, as examples of the compounds [11] to [12], they can be synthesized by reacting a 1-(2-bromoethoxy)benzene derivative with N-cyclohexyl-N-ethylamine or cyclohexylamine and optionally reducing the product while referring to the above-mentioned method. Specifically, such synthesis can be performed with reference to the method described in Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, a corresponding compound of the present invention (n is 2) can be produced with use of 1-(2-halopropoxy)benzene or its derivative in place of 1-(2-haloethoxy)benzene or its derivative. Similarly, the compound wherein n is 3, 4, or 5 can also be produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds obtained by the above method can be converted into various salts by the usual method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, there may be optical isomers in the compounds represented by the general formula [1], but all of them should be included in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \nFormulation method of pharmaceutical composition of the present invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition of the present invention contains as an active ingredient at least one of the compound represented by the general formula [1′] and a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, for example, at least one of the compounds [2] to [12] and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, especially at least one of the compounds [2], [3], [5], and [8] and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, and the dosage form to be used for administration includes, for example, tablets, granules, powders, capsules, syrups, suspensions, and injections. These dosage forms can be prepared using a technique frequently used as a usual formulation method, and, the above active ingredients can be formulated into, for example, oral preparations such as tablets, capsules, and granules, using, where necessary, fillers (e.g., lactose, starch, crystalline cellulose, and vegetable oil), lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate and talc), binders (e.g., hydroxypropyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone), disintegrators (e.g., carboxymethyl cellulose calcium), coating agents (e.g., hydroxypropyl cellulose, macrogol, and a silicone resin), gelatin film-forming agents, syrups, suspensions, and injectable purified water solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in the case of capsules, the active ingredient is contained in the dosage unit amount of, for example, 10 mg, 20 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg in the form of, for example, a powder, and if necessary, the filler may be incorporated in an amount of, for example, 10 mg, 20 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg. In the case of tablets, the active ingredient in the dosage unit amount of, for example, 0.1 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg, and the filler in an amount of, for example, 20 to 150 mg may be incorporated. In the case of injections, the active ingredient in an amount of, for example, 10 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg may be incorporated with distilled water.\n\n\n \nAdministration Method of Pharmaceutical Composition of the Present Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe administration of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be performed orally (for example, administration in the dosage form of tablets, granules, powders, capsules, syrups, or suspensions) or parenterally (for example, administration with injections). These administration methods and dosage forms can be appropriately selected depending on the symptom, age, therapeutic purpose, etc. of a subject to be administered in need of treatment or prevention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutically or preventively effective amount of the active ingredient in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is appropriately selected depending on the symptom, age, dosage form, administration route, therapeutic purpose, etc., but, in the case of human adults, it is 0.01 to 100 mg/individual per day and can be increased or decreased depending on the symptom, age, body weight, race, therapeutic purpose, etc. of a patient. The therapeutically or preventively effective amount of the active ingredient is administered once to several times per day. A single unit dose for human adults is administered, for example, preferably in 0.01 to 40 mg/individual, more preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/individual. The therapeutically or preventively effective amount of the active ingredient is an amount effective for nerve regeneration or neuronal protection. Here, it should be understood that the neuronal protection means the treatment or prevention of nerve injury by regeneration/maturation, and preferably promotion thereof, of nerve cells. Thus, optimal concentration should be investigated, for example, in the case of compounds where an effect of promoting regeneration/maturation of neural cells is rather decreased at a high concentration. The amount effective for nerve regeneration or neuronal protection can be known by examining the concentration dependency of the pharmacological effects such as neurite outgrowth-promoting activity. This amount varies depending on the compounds, and the effective amount of the active ingredient can be easily set by those skilled in the art because the concentration dependency of the pharmacological action is proved by an evaluation mentioned below. Further, it is to be mentioned that even compounds with a high affinity to sigma receptors do not always have a neurite outgrowth-promoting activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be applied to the treatment or prevention of a disease accompanied by a central nervous system disorder. The disease accompanied by a central nervous system disorder is not particularly limited, but includes typically Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, sequelae of cranial neuropathy due to cerebrovascular disorder, dementia, disease accompanied by cranial neuropathy due to head injury, and disease accompanied by motor dysfunction due to spinal cord injury. A subject that needs the treatment or prevention is usually a human subject, but application to non-human animals that need the treatment or prevention (mammals, for example, non-human primates such as monkey, gorilla, and chimpanzee; small animals (e.g., dog, cat, and mouse); livestock (e.g., cow, horse, and sheep)) is also possible.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nHereinafter, the present invention will be further described by way of Examples, but it is not intended to be limited thereto.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nSynthesis of N-(2-phenylthio)ethyl-N-ethylcyclohexylamine hydrochloride\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnder an argon atmosphere, (phenylthio) acetic acid (5.05 g (29.7 mmol)), N-ethylcyclohexylamine (1.40 g (11.0 mmol)), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (4.87 g (36.0 mol)) and 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (6.89 g (35.9 mmol)) were dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (100 mL), and stirred overnight at room temperature.

Evaluation of Affinity to Sigma Receptors\n\n\n \n \n \nA membrane preparation as a sigma receptor obtained from the whole brain of guinea pigs was used as an assay system; [\n3\nH](+)-pentazocine was used as a radioactive ligand; (+)-pentazocine was used as a positive substance; and a 50 mM Tris-hydrochloride buffer (pH 7.4) was used as a buffer. In addition, compounds [2] to [12] were used as the test substances. A sample was prepared by weighing each of the test substances, a reference compound or a positive substance and adjusting the final concentrations of the test substances, reference compound (SA4503), and positive substance (haloperidol) as shown below with a buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConcentrations (mol/L): 1×10\n−6\n, 1×10\n−7\n, 1×10\n−8\n, 1×10\n−9\n, 1×10\n−10\n, and 1×10\n−11 \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this regard, the reference compound for comparative study was also measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibition rate and IC\n50 \nof the test substance, reference compound, and positive substance were determined from a receptor binding experiment by the following method. The following measurement of radioactivity was performed according to a usual method after the binding reaction had been carried out at 25° C. for 60 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibition rate was determined by the equation of “100−binding rate”. The binding rate is represented by the following equation:\n\n\n \n \n \n[(\nB−N\n)/(\nB\n \n0\n \n−N\n)]×100(%)\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein B is a binding radioactivity to a membrane preparation in the presence of a test substance, a reference compound or a positive substance and a radioactive ligand; B\n0 \nis a binding radioactivity (average value) to a membrane preparation in the absence of a test substance, a reference compound, and a positive substance and only in the presence of a radioactive ligand added; and N is a non-specific binding radioactivity (average value).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IC\n50 \nof the test substance was calculated from a regression equation to the dose-response curve. That is to say, the ratio y=(B−N)/(B\n0\n−N) wherein a value of (B−N) is a specific binding radioactivity in the presence of a test substance, and a value of (B\n0\n−N) is a specific binding radioactivity in the absence of a test substance was first subjected to logit conversion and applied to a logit-log model plotted against the common logarithm of the test substance concentration to create a dose-response curve. In the same way, the IC\n50 \nvalues of the reference compound and the positive substance were determined. The regression equation to the dose-response curve used is as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nY=aX+b \n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein Y=logity=ln(y/(1−y), X=log x, and a and b are each a constant, provided that x is a solute concentration of a test substance.

The results were shown in Table 4.\n\n\n \n2. Evaluation of Neurite Outgrowth-Promoting Activity in Central Neural Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nThe neurite outgrowth-promoting effects of the rat cerebral cortex neural cells on test substances were evaluated by the following method. The cerebral cortex neural cells were isolated from Wistar rats on the 18th day of pregnancy according to the method of Springer Neuroscience Lab Manual. That is to say, under ether anesthesia, a fetal rat was removed from the uterus of a pregnant rat on day 18, and transferred into a petri dish containing HBSS (manufactured by Gibco, Inc.) on ice. The cerebral cortex was cut out under a stereoscopic microscope. The cerebral cortex that had been cut out was dispersed with a neural cells dispersion solution (manufactured by Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd.) to prepare rat cerebral cortex cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting cerebral cortex cells were subjected to cell culture. Neurobasal medium (manufactured by Gibco, Inc.) supplemented with B27 Supplement (manufactured by Gibco, Inc.; Fin. 2% v/v), L-glutamine (manufactured by IBCO company; Fin. 0.5 mM) and GlutaMax I (manufactured by Gibco, Inc.; Fin. 0.5 mM) was used as the culture medium. The culture conditions were as follows: 5% CO\n2\n, 95% air, 100% humidity, and 37° C. The cells were inoculated to polylysine-coated 8-well slides (manufactured by IWAKI company) so as to have about 2×10\n4 \ncells/well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound [2], compound [3], compound [4], compound [5], compound [6], compound [7], compound [8], compound [9], compound [10], compound [11], and compound [12] (final•concentrations: 0.3 μM and 1.0 μM) were added as respective test substances to the culture solution at about 3 hours after the cell inoculation, and the culture solution with no additives was used as a control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt 48 hours after the addition of the compounds, the cells were fixed by treatment with 4% paraformaldehyde (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries) at room temperature for about 30 minutes, and incubated with an anti-α-Tublin antibody (Anti-α-Tubulin Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate) recognizing a microtubule protein, at room temperature for one hour. After washing, the nucleus of the whole cell was stained with a nucleic acid-staining agent DAPI. The cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope at a magnification of 20 times. The stained cell image and the nuclear staining image in the same field of vision were imported into a computer as the image. Using an image analysis software (MethaMorph (registered trademark), Molecular Devises), the image imported into the computer was used to measure the “longest neurite length” that was the length of the longest neurite of individual cell in each field of vision. A cell having a length of the “longest neurite length” of 60 μm or more was defined as a “neurite forming cell” and the neurite forming activity was evaluated by the ratio of the “neurite forming cell” occupied in the number of the cells in the same field of vision. In other words, evaluation was performed by determining the rate of the neurite forming cells using the following equation:\n\n\n \n \n \nRate of neurite forming cells=[Number of neurite forming cells/Number of total cells in the same field of vision]×100\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results were shown in Table 4. Each numerical value represents mean±standard error. Further, the results of compound [2] were shown in \nFIGS. 1 and 2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was observed from the results of \nFIG. 1\n that the ratio of cells extending dendrites in the rat cerebral cortex neural cells cultured for 48 hours after addition of the compound [2] (final concentration: 1 μM) of the present invention was obviously higher than that of the case of no additives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was found from the results of \nFIG. 2\n that the rat cerebral cortex neural cells cultured for 48 hours after respective addition of the compound [2] (final concentrations:0.1 μM, 1 μM, 10 μM) of the present invention significantly increased the ratio of cells having neurites having the length two or more times the cell body diameter, and thus it became clear that the compound showed a neurite outgrowth-promoting activity.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSigma receptor\n\n\nNeurite outgrowth-promoting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nbinding activity\n\n\nactivity (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n0.3 μM\n\n\n1.0 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\n\n7.4\n\n\n44.6 ± 2.2\n\n\n58.4 ± 1.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompound\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound [2]\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n37.4 ± 3.5\n\n\n50.6 ± 1.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound [3]\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n32.8 ± 5.3\n\n\n52.6 ± 1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound [4]\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n21.4 ± 2.2\n\n\n39.4 ± 2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound [5]\n\n\n—*\n\n\n41.6 ± 3.3\n\n\n50.8 ± 2.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound [6]\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n—*\n\n\n40.3 ± 3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound [7]\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n30.2 ± 2.5\n\n\n53.3 ± 1.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound [8]\n\n\n8.7\n\n\n59.9 ± 1.8\n\n\n61.7 ± 2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound [9]\n\n\n10.5\n\n\n31.4 ± 5.8\n\n\n59.6 ± 1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound [10]\n\n\n8.5\n\n\n26.8 ± 1.1\n\n\n57.0 ± 3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound [11]\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n43.5 ± 2.4\n\n\n50.7 ± 2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound [12]\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n44.2 ± 1.4\n\n\n32.2 ± 1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\n\n— \n\n\n18.0 ± 1.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Data loss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the results of Table 4, it was clear that all these compounds of the present invention inhibited the specific binding of the radioactive ligand to a sigma receptor at a very low concentration compared to the reference compound which is a sigma receptor ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, as for the rat cerebral cortex neural cells cultured for 48 hours after addition of each of these compounds of the present invention, it became clear that the ratio of cells each having a neurite length of 60 μm or more was significantly increased, and such compounds were found to have a neurite outgrowth-promoting activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of general preparations such as oral preparations and injections of the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention are shown below.\n\n\n \nPreparation Example 1\n\n\nTablet\n\n\n \n \n \nCompound [2] of the present 1 mg\n\n\n \nInvention\n\n\nLactose 55 mg\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCorn starch\n 30 mg\n\n\n\nCarboxymethyl cellulose\n 10 mg\n\n\n\n \nCalcium\n\n\n \n \n \nHydroxypropyl cellulose 3 mg\n\n\nMagnesium stearate 1 mg\n\n\n\n \nTotal 100 mg\n\n\n \n \n \nA coating was applied to a tablet having the above formulation using a coating agent (2 mg) (for example, a common coating agent such as hydroxymethyl cellulose, macrogol, and a silicone resin), thereby making it possible to obtain the target tablet with coating (the same as in the tablet with the following formulation).
