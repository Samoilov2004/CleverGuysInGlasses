Specifically, the compounds of this invention are also useful in the treatment of various CNS disorders, hematological disorders, eating disorders, obesity, anxiety, depression, diseases associated with pain, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular diseases and cancer.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nVarious central nervous system disorders such as anxiety, depression, motor disorders etc., are believed to involve a disturbance of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin. Serotonin is localized in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is known to affect many types of conditions including psychiatric disorders, motor activity, feeding behavior, sexual activity and neuroendocrine regulation among others. 5-HT receptor subtypes regulate the various effects of serotonin. Known 5-HT receptor family includes the 5-HT\n1\n family (e.g. 5-HT\n1A\n), the 5-HT\n2\n family (e.g.5- HT\n2A\n & 5-HT\n2C\n), 5-HT\n3\n, 5-HT\n4\n, 5-HT\n5\n, 5-HT\n6\n and 5-HT\n7\n subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 5-HT\n6\n receptor subtype was first cloned from rat tissue in 1993 (\nMonsma, F. J.; Shen, Y.; Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W., Sibley, D.R., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327\n) and subsequently from human tissue (\nKohen, R.; Metcalf, M. A.; Khan, N.; Druck, T.; Huebner, K.; Sibley, D. R., Journal of Neurochemistry, 1996, 66, 47-56\n). The receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) positively coupled to adenylate cyclase (\nRuat, M.; Traiffort, E.; Arrang, J-M.; Tardivel-Lacombe, L.; Diaz, L.; Leurs, R.; Schwartz, J-C., Biochemical Biophysical Research Communications, 1993, 193, 268-276\n). The receptor is found almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS) areas both in rats as well as in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn situ hybridization studies of 5-HT\n6\n receptor in rat brain using mRNA indicate principal localization in the areas of 5-HT projection including striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and hippocampal formation (\nWard, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W.; Lachowicz, J. E.; Hoffman, B. J.; Sibley, D. R.; Dorsa, D. M., Neuroscience, 1995, 64, 1105-1111\n). Highest levels of 5-HT\n6\n receptor mRNA has been observed in the olfactory tubercle, the striatum, nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus as well as CA\n1\n, CA\n2\n and CA\n3\n regions of the hippocampus. Lower levels of 5-HT\n6\n receptor mRNA were seen in the granular layer of the cerebellum, several diencephalic nuclei, amygdala and in the cortex. Northern blots have revealed that 5-HT\n6\n receptor mRNA appears to be exclusively present in the brain, with little evidence for its presence in peripheral tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe high affinity of number of antipsychotic agents towards 5-HT\n6\n receptor, the localization of its mRNA in striatum, olfactory tubercle and nucleus accumbens suggests that some of the clinical actions of these compounds may be mediated through this receptor. Its ability to bind a wide range of therapeutic compounds used in psychiatry, coupled with its intriguing distribution in the brain has stimulated significant interest in new compounds which are capable of interacting with the said receptor (Ref: \nSleight, A.J. et al. (1997) 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors: molecular biology, functional correlates and possible therapeutic indications, Drug News Perspect. 10, 214-224\n). Significant efforts are being made to understand the possible role of the 5-HT\n6\n receptor in psychiatry, cognitive dysfunction, motor function and control, memory, mood and the like. The compounds which demonstrate a binding affinity for the 5-HT\n6\n receptor are earnestly sought both as an aid in the study of the 5-HT\n6\n receptor and as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of central nervous system disorders, for example see \nReavill C. and Rogers D. C., Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2001, 2(1): 104-109, Pharma Press Ltd.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonsma F.J. et al. (1993) and Kohen, R. et al. (2001) have shown that several tricyclic antidepressant compounds, such as amitriptyline and atypical antidepressant compounds, such as mianserin have high affinity for the 5-HT\n6\n receptor. These findings have led to the hypothesis that the 5-HT\n6\n receptor is involved in the pathogenesis and/or treatment of affective disorders. Rodent models of anxiety-related behavior yield conflicting results about the role of the 5-HT\n6\n receptor in anxiety. Treatment with 5-HT\n6\n receptor antagonists increases seizure threshold in a rat maximal electroconvulsive-shock test [\nStean, T. et al. (1999) Anticonvulsant properties of the selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist SB-271046 in the rat maximal electroshock seizure threshold test. Br. J. Pharmacol. 127, 131P\n; \nRoutledge, C. et al. (2000) Characterization of SB-271046: a potent, selective and orally active 5-HT6) receptor antagonist. Br. J. Pharmacol. 130, 1606-1612\n]. Although this indicates that 5-HT\n6\n receptors might regulate seizure threshold, the effect is not as pronounced as that of known anticonvulsant drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOur understanding of the roles of 5-HT\n6\n receptor ligands is most advanced in two therapeutic indications in which this receptor is likely to have a major role: learning and memory deficits and abnormal feeding behaviour. The exact role of the 5-HT\n6\n receptor is yet to be established in other CNS indications such as anxiety; although one 5-HT\n6\n agonist has reached Phase I clinical trials recently, the exact role of the receptor is still to be established and is the focus of significant investigation. There are many potential therapeutic uses for 5-HT\n6\n receptor ligands in humans based on direct effects and on indications from available scientific studies. These studies include the localization of the receptor, the affinity of ligands with known in-vivo activity and various animal studies conducted so far. Preferably, antagonist compounds of 5-HT\n6\n receptors are sought after as therapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne potential therapeutic use of modulators of 5-HT\n6\n receptor functions is in the enhancement of cognition and memory in human diseases such as Alzheimer's. The high levels of receptor found in structures such as the forebrain, including the caudate/putamen, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and cortex suggests a role for the receptor in memory and cognition since these areas are known to play a vital role in memory (\nGerard, C.; Martres, M.P.; Lefevre, K.; Miquel, M. C.; Verge, D.; Lanfumey, R.; Doucet, E.; Hamon, M.; EI Mestikawy, S., Brain Research, 1997, 746, 207-219\n). The ability of known 5-HT\n6\n receptor ligands to enhance cholinergic transmission also supports the potential cognition use (\nBentley, J. C.; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies have found that a known 5-HT\n6\n selective antagonist significantly increased glutamate and aspartate levels in the frontal cortex without elevating levels of noradrenaline, dopamine or 5-HT. This selective elevation of certain neurochemicals is noted during memory and cognition, strongly suggests a role for 5-HT\n6\n ligands in cognition (\nDawson, L. A.; Nguyen, H. Q.; Li, P. British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 130 (1), 23-26\n). Animal studies of memory and learning with a known selective 5-HT\n6\n antagonist has some positive effects (\nRogers, D. C.; Hatcher, P. D.; Hagan, J. J. Society of Neuroscience, Abstracts, 2000, 26, 680\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA related potential therapeutic use for 5-HT\n6\n ligands is in the treatment of attention deficit disorders (ADD, also known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD) in children as well as adults. As 5-HT\n6\n antagonists appear to enhance the activity of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and ADHD has been linked to abnormalities in the caudate (\nErnst, M; Zametkin, A. J.; Matochik, J. H.; Jons, P. A.; Cohen, R. M., Journal of Neuroscience, 1998, 18(15), 5901-5907\n), 5-HT\n6\n antagonists may attenuate attention deficit disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt present, a few fully selective agonists are available. The Wyeth agonist WAY-181187 is currently in Phase I trials to target anxiety [\nCole, D.C. et al. (2005) Discovery of a potent, selective and orally active 5-HT6 receptor agonist, WAY-181187. 230th ACS Natl. Meet. (Aug 28-Sept 1, Washington DC\n), Abstract MEDI 17.]\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternational Patent Publication \n \nWO 03/066056 A1\n \n reports that antagonism of 5-HT\n6\n receptor could promote neuronal growth within the central nervous system of a mammal. Another International Patent Publication \n \nWO 03/065046 A2\n \n discloses new variant of human 5-HT\n6\n receptor and proposes that 5-HT\n6\n receptor is associated with numerous other disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEarly studies examining the affinity of various CNS ligands with known therapeutic utility or a strong structural resemblance to known drugs suggests a role for 5-HT\n6\n ligands in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. For example, clozapine (an effective clinical antipsychotic) has high affinity for the 5-HT\n6\n receptor subtype. Also, several clinical antidepressants have high affinity for the receptor as well and act as antagonists at this site (\nBranchek, T. A.; Blackburn, T. P., Annual Reviews in Pharmacology and Toxicology, 2000, 40, 319-334\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, recent \nin-vivo\n studies in rats indicate that 5-HT\n6\n modulators may be useful in the treatment of movement disorders including epilepsy (\nStean, T.; Routledge, C.; Upton, N., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 127 Proc. Supplement-131P\n; and \nRoutledge, C.; Bromidge, S. M.; Moss, S. F.; Price, G. W.; Hirst, W.; Newman, H.; Riley, G.; Gager, T.; Stean, T.; Upton, N.; Clarke, S. E.; Brown, A. M., British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 30 (7), 1606-1612\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together, the above studies strongly suggest that compounds which are 5-HT\n6\n receptor modulators, i.e. ligands, may be useful for therapeutic indications including, the treatment of diseases associated with a deficit in memory, cognition and learning such as Alzheimer's and attention deficit disorder; the treatment of personality disorders such as schizophrenia; the treatment of behavioral disorders, e.g. anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorders; the treatment of motion or motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy; the treatment of diseases associated with neurodegeneration such as stroke or head trauma or withdrawal from drug addiction including addiction to nicotine, alcohol and other substances of abuse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder. See for example, \nRoth, B. L.; et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 1994,268, pages 1403-1412\n; \nSibley, D. R.; et al., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327\n, \nSleight, A. J.; et al., Neurotransmission, 1995, 11, 1-5\n; and \nSleight, A. J.; et al., Serotonin ID Research Alert, 1997, 2(3),115-118\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the effect of 5-HT\n6\n antagonist and 5-HT\n6\n antisense oligonucleotides to reduce food intake in rats has been reported, thus potentially in treatment of obesity. See for example, \nBentey, J. C.; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542\n); \nWooley et al., Neuropharmacology, 2001, 41: 210-129\n; and \n \nWO 02/098878\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently a review by \nHolenz, Jo\"rg et.al., Drug Discovery Today, 11, 7/8, April 2006\n, Medicinal chemistry strategies to 5-HT\n6\n receptor ligands as potential cognitive enhancers and antiobesity agents, gives elaborate discussion on evolution of 5-HT\n6\n ligands. It had summarized pharmacological tools and preclinical candidates used in evaluation of 5-HT\n6\n receptor in illnesses such as schizophrenia, other dopamine-related disorders and depression and to profile the neurochemical and electrophysiological effects of either blockade or activation of 5-HT\n6\n receptors. Furthermore, they have been used to characterize the 5-HT\n6\n receptor and to investigate its distribution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSo far several clinical candidates form the part of indole-type structures and are closely related structurally to the endogenous ligand 5-HT, for example compounds by \nGlennon, R.A. et.al., 2-Substituted tryptamines: agents with selectivity for 5-HT6 serotonin receptors, J.

\n\"Halogen\" means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine;\n \n\"(C\n1\n-C\n3\n) alkyl\" means straight or branched chain alkyl radicals containing one to three carbon atoms and includes methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and iso-propyl;\n \n\"(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkoxy\" means straight or branched chain alkyl radicals containing one to three carbon atoms and includes methoxy, ethoxy, propyloxy and iso-propyloxy;\n \n\"Halo(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl\" means straight or branched chain alkyl radicals containing one to three carbon atoms and includes fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, trifluoroethyl, fluoroethyl, difluoroethyl and the like;\n \n\"Halo(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkoxy\" means straight or branched chain alkyl radicals containing one to three carbon atoms and includes ftuoromethoxy, difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, trifluoroethoxy, fluoroethoxy, difluoroethoxy and the like;\n \n\"Cyclo(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)alkyl\" means cyclic or branched cyclic alkyl radicals containing three to six carbon atoms and includes cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopropylmethyl, cyclo(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)alkyl methyl or cyclohexyl, which may be substituted or unsubstituted and optionally the substituents may be selected from halogen, (C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl or (C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkoxy;\n \n\"Cyclo(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy\" means cyclic or branched cyclic alkyl radicals containing three to six carbon atoms and includes cyclopropyloxy, cyclobutyloxy, cyclopentyloxy, cyclopropylmethoxy or cyclohexyloxy.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe term \"schizophrenia\" means schizophrenia, schizophreniform, disorder, schizoaffective disorder and psychotic disorder wherein the term \"psychotic\" refers to delusions, prominent hallucinations, disorganized speech or disorganized or catatonic behavior. See\n Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, fourth edition, American Psychiatric Association, Washington, D.C\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and/or toxicologically, with the other ingredients comprising a formulation, the mammal being treated therewith.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Therapeutically effective amount\" is defined as 'an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition or disorder (ii) attenuates, ameliorates or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition or disorder (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder described herein'.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"treating\", \"treat\" or \"treatment\" embrace all the meanings such as preventative, prophylactic and palliative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"stereoisomers\" is a general term for all isomers of the individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. It includes mirror image isomers (enantiomers), geometric (cis-trans) isomers and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral centre that are not mirror images of one another (diastereomers).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of formula (I) are capable of existing in stereoisomeric forms (e. g. diastereomers and enantiomers) and the invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated from one another by the usual methods or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. The invention also extends to tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stereoisomers as a rule are generally obtained as racemates that can be separated into the optically active isomers in a manner known per se. In the case of the compounds of general formula (I) having an asymmetric carbon atom the present invention relates to the D-form, the L-form and D,L- mixtures and in the case of a number of asymmetric carbon atoms, the diastereomeric forms and the invention extends to each of these stereo isomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. Those compounds of general formula (I) which have an asymmetric carbon and as a rule are obtained as racemates can be separated one from the other by the usual methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereo specific or asymmetric synthesis. However, it is also possible to employ an optically active compound from the start, a correspondingly optically active enantiomeric or diastereomeric compound then being obtained as the final compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stereoisomers of compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by one or more ways presented below:\n\n \n \n \ni) One or more of the reagents may be used in their optically active form.\n \nii) Optically pure catalyst or chiral ligands along with metal catalyst may be employed in the reduction process. The metal catalyst may be Rhodium, Ruthenium, Indium and the like. The chiral ligands may preferably be chiral phosphines (\nPrinciples of Asymmetric synthesis, J. E. Baldwin Ed., Tetrahedron series, 14, 311-316\n).\n \niii) The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as forming diastereomeric salts with chiral acids or chiral amines, or chiral amino alcohols, chiral amino acids. The resulting mixture of diastereomers may then be separated by methods such as fractional crystallization, chromatography and the like, which is followed by an additional step of isolating the optically active product by hydrolyzing the derivative (\nJacques et. al., \"\nEnantiomers, Racemates and Resolution\n\", Wiley Interscience, 1981\n).\n \niv) The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as microbial resolution, resolving the diastereomeric salts formed with chiral acids or chiral bases.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nChiral acids that can be employed may be tartaric acid, mandelic acid, lactic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, amino acids and the like. Chiral bases that can be employed may be cinchona alkaloids, brucine or a basic amino acid such as lysine, arginine and the like. In the case of the compounds of general formula (I) containing geometric isomerism the present invention relates to all of these geometric isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include those described in \nJ. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19\n, such as acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids e. g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric or phosphoric acid; and organic acids e. g. succinic, maleic, acetic, fumaric, citric, tartaric, benzoic, p-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic or naphthalenesulfonic acid. The present invention includes, within its scope, all possible stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutically acceptable salts forming a part of this invention may be prepared by treating the compound of formula (I) with 1-6 equivalents of a base such as sodium hydride, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium t-butoxide, calcium hydroxide, calcium acetate, calcium chloride, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium chloride and the like.

(43): 320-327 (1993\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 50: 5-HT\n6\n functional assay cyclic AMP\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antagonist property of the compounds at the human 5-HT\n6\n receptors was determined by testing their effect on cAMP accumulation in stably transfected HEK293 cells. Binding of an agonist to the human 5-HT\n6\n receptor will lead to an increase in adenyl cyclase activity. A compound that is an agonist will show an increase in cAMP production and a compound that is an antagonist will block the agonist effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman 5-HT\n6\n receptors were cloned and stably expressed in HEK293 cells. These cells were plated in 6 well plates in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 500 µg/mL G418 and incubated at 37 °C in a CO\n2\n incubator. The cells were allowed to grow to about 70 % confluence before initiation of the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the culture media was removed and the cells were washed once with serum free medium (SFM). Two mL of SFM+IBMX media was added and incubated at 37 °C for 10 minutes. The media were removed and fresh SFM+IBMX media containing various compounds and I µM serotonin (as antagonist) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes. Following incubation, the media were removed and the cells were washed once with 1 mL of PBS (phosphate buffered saline). Each well was treated with I mL cold 95% ethanol and 5 µM EDTA (2:1) at 4 °C for 1 hour. The cells were then scraped and transferred into Eppendorf tubes. The tubes were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4 °C and the supernatants were stored at 4 °C until assayed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncAMP content was determined by EIA (enzyme-immunoassay) using the Amersham Biotrak cAMP EIA kit (Amersham RPN 225). The procedure used is as described for the kit. Briefly, cAMP is determined by the competition between unlabeled cAMP and a fixed quantity of peroxidase-labelled cAMP for the binding sites on anti-cAMP antibody. The antibody is immobilized onto polystyrene microtitre wells precoated with a second antibody. The reaction is started by adding 50 µL, peroxidase-labeled cAMP to the sample (100 µL) pre-incubated with the antiserum (100 mL) for 2 hours at 4 °C. Following 1 hour incubation at 4 °C, the unbound ligand is separated by a simple washing procedure. Then an enzyme substrate, trimethylbenzidine (1), is added and incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. The reaction is stopped by the addition of 100 mL 1.0 M sulphuric acid and the resultant color read by a microtitre plate spectrophotometer at 450 nm within 30 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the functional adenylyl cyclase assay, some of the compound of this invention was found to be a competitive antagonist with good selectivity over a number of other receptors including other serotonin receptors such as 5-HT\n1A\n and 5-HT\n7\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 51: Rodent Pharmacokinetic Study\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMale wistar rats (230 - 280 grams) obtained from NIN (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as an experimental animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree to five animals were housed in each cage.

I. N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as experimental animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup allocation Group 1: Vehicle (Water; 5 mL/kg; p.o.), Group 2: NCE (3 mg/kg; p.o.), Group 3: NCE (10 mg/kg; p.o.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurgical Procedure: Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and placed in Stereotaxic frame. Guide cannula (CMA/12) was placed at AP: -5.2 mm, ML: +5.0 mm relative from bregma and DV: -3.8 mm from the brain surface according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (1986). While the animal was still anesthetized, a micro dialysis probe (CMA/12, 4 mm, PC) was inserted through the guide cannula and secured in place. After surgery recovery period of 48 - 72 hours was maintained before subjecting the animal for study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA day prior to study animals were transferred to home cages for acclimatization and implanted probe was perfused overnight with a modified Ringer's solution comprised of: 1.3 µM CaCl2 (Sigma), 1.0 µM MgCl\n2\n (Sigma), 3.0 µM KCl (Sigma), 147.0 µM NaCl (Sigma), 1.0 µM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO and 0.2 µM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n.2 H\n2\nO and and 0.3 µM neostigmine bromide (Sigma) (pH to 7.2) at a rate of 0.2 µL/minute set by a microinfusion pump (PicoPlus, Harward). On the day of experiment perfusion rate was changed to 1.2 µL/minutes and allowed for 3 hours stabilization. After stabilization period, four basals, were collected at 20 minutes intervals before dosing. Dialysate samples were collected in glass vials using CMA/170 refrigerated fraction collector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVehicle or NCE (3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) was administered by gavage after four fractions had been collected. The perfusate was collected until 6 hours after administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcetylcholine concentrations in dialysate samples were measured by LC-MS/MS (API 4000, MDS SCIEX) method. Acetylcholine is quantified in the calibration range of 0.250 to 8.004 ng/mL in dialysates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn completion of the microdialysis experiments, the animals were sacrificed and their brains were removed and stored in a 10% formalin solution. Each brain was sliced at 50 µ on a cryostat (Leica) stained and examined microscopically to confirm probe placement. Data from animals with incorrect probe placement were discarded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicrodialysis data were expressed as percent changes (Mean ± S.E.M.) of baseline that was defined as the average absolute value (in fM/10 µL) of the four samples before drug administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffects of NCE (3 & 10 mg/kg) and Vehicle treatments were statistically evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests. In all statistical measures, a p < 0.05 was considered significant. The Graph Pad Prism program statistically evaluated the data.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 54: Food Intake Measurement\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMale Wister rats (120-140 grams) obtained from N. I. N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used. The chronic effect of the compounds of general formula (I) on food intake in well-fed rats was then determined as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rats were housed in single home cages for 28 days. During this period, the rats were either dosed orally or ip, with a composition comprising a compound of formula (1) or a corresponding composition (vehicle) without the said compound (control group), once a day. The rat is provided with ad libitum food and water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn 0, 1\nst\n, 7\nth\n, 14\nth\n, 21\nst\n and 28\nth\n day the rats were left with the pre-weighed amounts of food. Food intake and weight gain were measured on a routine basis. Also a food ingestion method is disclosed in the literature (\nKask et al., European Journal of Pharmacology, 414, 2001, 215-224\n and \nTurnball et. al., Diabetes, vol 51, August, 2002\n, and some in-house modifications.). The respective parts of the descriptions are herein incorporated as a reference and they form part of the disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome representative compounds have shown the statistically significant decrease in food intake, when conducted in the above manner at the doses of either 10 mg/Kg or 30 mg/Kg or both\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 55: Object Recognition Task Model\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cognition-enhancing properties of compounds of this invention were estimated using a model of animal cognition: the object recognition task model.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMale Wister rats (230 - 280 grams) obtained from N. I. N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as experimental animals. Four animals were housed in each cage. Animals were kept on 20 % food deprivation before one day and given water ad libitum throughout the experiment and maintained on a 12 hours light/dark cycle. Also the rats were habituated to individual arenas for 1 hour in the absence of any objects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne group of 12 rats received vehicle (1 mL/Kg) orally and another set of animals received compound of the formula (I) either orally or i.p., before one hour of the familiar (T1) and choice trial (T2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experiment was carried out in a 50 x 50 x 50 cm open field made up of acrylic. In the familiarization phase, (T1), the rats were placed individually in the open field for 3 minutes, in which two identical objects (plastic bottles, 12.5 cm height x 5.5 cm diameter) covered in yellow masking tape alone (a1 and a2) were positioned in two adjacent corners, 10 cm. from the walls. After 24 hours of the (T1) trial for long-term memory test, the same rats were placed in the same arena as they were placed in T1 trial. Choice phase (T2) rats were allowed to explore the open field for 3 minutes in presence of one familiar object (a3) and one novel object (b) (Amber color glass bottle, 12 cm high and 5 cm in diameter). Familiar objects presented similar textures, colors and sizes. During the T1 and T2 trial, explorations of each object (defined as sniffing, licking, chewing or having moving vibrissae whilst directing the nose towards the object at a distance of less than 1 cm) were recorded separately by stopwatch. Sitting on an object was not regarded as exploratory activity, however, it was rarely observed. T1 is the total time spent exploring the familiar objects (a1 + a2).\n\nT2 is the total time spent exploring the familiar object and novel object (a3 +b).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe object recognition test was performed as described by \nEnnaceur, A., Delacour, J., 1988, A new one-trial test for neurobiological studies of memory in rats - Behavioral data, Behav. Brain Res., 31, 47-59\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome representative compounds have shown positive effects indicating the increased novel object recognition viz; increased exploration time with novel object and higher discrimination index.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nExample Number\n \n \n \nNORT Discriminative Index (DI) = Treatment (Vehicle)\n \n \n \nInference\n \n \n \n \n \n10 mg/kg, p.o.\n \n \n \n30 mg/kg, p.o.\n \n \n \n \n \n5.\n \n0.46 (0.52)\n \n0.58 (0.56)\n \nActive\n \n \n \n31.\n \n0.54 (0.48)\n \n0.52 (0.52)\n \nActive\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nExample 56: Water Maze\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe water maze apparatus consisted of a circular pool (1.8 m diameter, 0.6 m high) constructed in black Perspex (TSE systems, Germany) filled with water (24 ± 2°C) and positioned underneath a wide-angled video camera to track animal. The 10 cm\n2\n perspex platform, lying 1 cm below the water surface, was placed in the centre of one of the four imaginary quadrants, which remained constant for all rats. The black Perspex used in the construction of the maze and platform offered no intramaze cues to guide escape behavior. By contrast, the training room offered several strong extramaze visual cues to aid the formation of the spatial map necessary for escape learning. An automated tracking system, [Videomot 2 (5.51), TSE systems, Germany] was employed. This program analyzes video images acquired via a digital camera and an image acquisition board that determined path length, swim speed and the number of entries and duration of swim time spent in each quadrant of the water maze.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nExample Number\n \n \n \nScopolamine Induced Reversal\n \n \n \n \n \n5.\n \n≥ 3 mg/kg, p.o.\n \n \n \n31.\n \n≥ 30 mg/kg, p.o.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nExample 57: Chewing/Yawning/Stretching induction by 5-HT\n6\n R antagonists\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMale Wister rats weighing 200-250 grams were used. Rats were given vehicle injections and placed in individual, transparent chambers for 1 hour each day for 2 days before the test day, to habituate them to the observation chambers and testing procedure. On the test day, rats were placed in the observation chambers immediately after drug administration and observed continuously for yawning, stretching, and chewing behaviors from 60 to 90 minutes after drug or vehicle injections. 60 minutes prior to the drug administration Physostigmine, 0.1 mg/kg i.p, was administered to all the animals. Average number of yawns, stretches and vacuous chewing movements during the 30 minutes observation period were recorded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference: (A) \nKing M. V., Sleight A., J., Woolley M.

The training apparatus consisted of a chamber 300 mm in length, 260 mm wide, and 270 mm in height, constructed to established designs. The front and top were transparent, allowing the experimenter to observe the behavior of the animal inside the apparatus. The chamber was divided into two compartments, separated by a central shutter that contained a small opening 50 mm wide and 75 mm high set close to the front of the chamber. The smaller of the compartments measured 9 mm in width and contained a low-power (6V) illumination source. The larger compartment measured 210 mm in width and was not illuminated. The floor of this dark compartment consisted of a grid of 16 horizontal stainless-steel bars that were 5 mm in diameter and spaced 12.5 mm apart. A current generator supplied 0.75 mA to the grid floor, which was scrambled once every 0.5 seconds across the 16 bars. A resistance range of 40-60 micro ohms was calculated for a control group of rats and the apparatus was calibrated accordingly. An electronic circuit detecting the resistance of the animal ensured an accurate current delivery by automatic variation of the voltage with change in resistance.\n\n\n \n\n\nExperimental procedure:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis was carried out as described previously. Adult male Wister rats weighing 200-230 grams were used. Animals were brought to the laboratory 1 hour before the experiment. On the day of training, animals were placed facing the rear of the light compartment of the apparatus. The timer was started once the animal has completely turned to face the front of the chamber. Latency to enter the dark chamber was recorded (usually < 20 seconds) and having completely entered the dark compartment an inescapable foot shock of 0.75 mA for 3 seconds was administered to the animal. Animals were then returned to their home cages. Between each training session, both compartments of the chamber were cleaned to remove any confounding olfactory cues. Recall of this inhibitory stimulus was evaluated 24 hours, 72 hours and on 7 day post-training by returning the animal into the light chamber and recording their latency to enter the dark chamber, a criterion time of 300 seconds was employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference: (A) \nCallahan P.M., Rowe N.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to hydroxamic or carboxylic acid functional compounds that can inhibit the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds.\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) has been shown to play a pivotal role in immune and inflammatory responses. Inappropriate or over-expression of TNF-α is a hallmark of a number of diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease and sepsis. Inhibition of TNF-α production has been shown to be beneficial in many preclinical models of inflammatory disease, making inhibition of TNF-α production or signaling an appealing target for the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor necrosis factor alpha is a cell-associated cytokine that is processed from a 26 kd precursor form to a 17 kd active form. \n \nSee\n \n \nBlack R.A. \"\nTumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme\n\" Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2002 Jan;34(1):1-5\n and \nMoss ML, White JM, Lambert MH, Andrews RC.\"\nTACE and other ADAM proteases as targets for drug discovery\n\" Drug Discov Today. 2001 Apr 1;6(8):417-426\n, each of which is incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTNF-α has been shown to be a primary mediator in humans and animals of inflammation, fever and acute phase responses, similar to those observed during acute infection and shock. Excess TNF-α has been shown to be lethal. Blocking the effects of TNF-α with specific antibodies can be beneficial in a variety of conditions, including autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (\nFeldman et al, Lancet, (1994) 344, 1105\n), non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (\nLohmander L. S. et al., Arthritis Rheum. 36 (1993) 1214-22\n) and Crohn's disease (\nMacdonald T. et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 81 (1990) 301\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetalloproteinases (MP) are important in the uncontrolled breakdown of connective tissue, including proteoglycan and collagen, leading to resorption of the extracellular matrix. This is a feature of many pathological conditions, such as rheumatoid and osteo- arthritis, corneal, epidermal or gastric ulceration; tumor metastasis or invasion; periodontal disease and bone disease. Normally these catabolic enzymes are tightly regulated at the level of their synthesis as well as at their level of extracellular activity through the action of specific inhibitors, such as alpha-2-macroglobulins and TIMP (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase), which form inactive complexes with the MP's.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOsteo- and rheumatoid arthritis (OA and RA, respectively) are destructive diseases of articular cartilage characterized by localized erosion of the cartilage surface. Findings have shown that articular cartilage from the femoral heads of patients with OA, for example, had a reduced incorporation of radiolabeled sulfate over controls, suggesting that there must be an enhanced rate of cartilage degradation in OA (\nMankin et al. J. Bone Joint Surg. 52A (1970) 424-434\n). There are four classes of protein degradative enzymes in mammalian cells: serine, cysteine, aspartic and metalloproteinases. The available evidence supports that it is the metalloproteinases that are responsible for the degradation of the extracellular matrix of articullar cartilage in OA and RA. Increased activities of collagenases and stromelysin have been found in OA cartilage and the activity correlates with severity of the lesion (\nMankin et al. Arthritis Rheum. 21, 1978, 761-766\n, \nWoessner et al. Arthritis Rheum. 26, 1983, 63-68\n and \nIbid. 27, 1984, 308-312\n). In addition, aggrecanase (a newly identified metalloproteinase enzymatic activity) has been identified that provides the specific cleavage product of proteoglycan, found in RA and OA patients (\nLohmander L. S. et al. Arthritis Rheum. 36, 1993, 1214-22\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, metalloproteinases (MP) have been implicated as the key enzymes in the destruction of mammalian cartilage and bone. It can be expected that the pathogenesis of such diseases can be modified in a beneficial manner by the administration of MP inhibitors, and many compounds have been suggested for this purpose (see\n Wahl et al. Ann. Rep. Med.

Recently it has been shown that a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) or family of metalloproteinases, hereafter known as TNF-α convertases (TACE), as well as other MP's are capable of converting TNF-α from its inactive to active form (\nGearing et al Nature, 1994, 370, 555\n). Since excessive TNF-α production has been noted in several disease conditions also characterized by MMP-mediated tissue degradation, compounds which inhibit both MMPs and TNF-α production may also have a particular advantage in diseases where both mechanisms are involved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. Patent 6,838,466\n \n refers to hydroxamic or carboxylic acid functional compounds that can inhbit the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO03/053940\n \n refers to barbituric acid derivatives useful as TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nW095/09841\n \n describes compounds that are hydroxamic acid derivatives and are inhibitors of cytokine production.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEuropean Patent Application Publication No. \n \n574,758 A1\n \n, discloses hydroxamic acid derivatives as collagenase inhibitors. \n \nGB 2 268 934 A\n \n and \n \nWO 94/24140\n \n claim hydroxamate inhibitors of MMPs as inhibitors of TNF-α production.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is a need in the art for inhibitors of MMPs, in particular TNF-α convertase, which can be useful as anti-inflammatory compounds and cartilage protecting therapeutics.

Thus, the term \"purified\", \"in purified form\" or \"in isolated and purified form\" for a compound refers to the physical state of said compound after being obtained from a purification process or processes described herein or well known to the skilled artisan, in sufficient purity to be characterizable by standard analytical techniques described herein or well known to the skilled artisan.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIt should also be noted that any carbon as well as heteroatom with unsatisfied valences in the text, schemes, examples and Tables herein is assumed to have the sufficient number of hydrogen atom(s) to satisfy the valences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a functional group in a compound is termed \"protected\", this means that the group is in modified form to preclude undesired side reactions at the protected site when the compound is subjected to a reaction. Suitable protecting groups will be recognized by those with ordinary skill in the art as well as by reference to standard textbooks such as, for example, \nT. W. Greene et al, Protective Groups in organic Synthesis (1991), Wiley, New York\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"composition\" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, if a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group, a prodrug can comprise an ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as, for example, (C\n1\n-C\n8\n)alkyl, (C\n2\n-C\n12\n)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-(alkanoyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkanoyloxy)-ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, 1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, N-(alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-(N-(alkoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, 3-phthalidyl, 4-crotonolactonyl, gamma-butyrolacton-4-yl, di-N,N-(C\n1\n-C\n2\n)alkylaminO(C\n2\n-C\n3\n)alkyl (such as β-dimethylaminoethyl), carbamoyl-(C\n1\n-C\n2\n)alkyl, N,N-di (C\n1\n-C\n2\n)alkylcarbamoyl-(C\n1\n-C\n2\n)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidino- or morpholino(C\n2\n-C\n3\n)alkyl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, if a compound of the invention contains an alcohol functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as, for example, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-((C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-1-((C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N-(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyl, α-amino(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkanyl, arylacyl and α-aminoacyl, or α-aminoacyl-α-aminoacyl, where each α-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH)\n2\n, -P(O)(O(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl)\n2\n or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate), and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a compound of the invention incorporates an amine functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as, for example, R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR'-carbonyl where R and R' are each independently (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkyl, (C\n3\n-C\n7\n) cycloalkyl, benzyl, or R-carbonyl is a natural α-aminoacyl or natural α-aminoacyl, -C(OH)C(O)OY\n1\n wherein Y\n1\n is H, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl or benzyl, -C(OY\n2\n)Y\n3\n wherein Y\n2\n is (C\n1\n-C\n4\n) alkyl and Y\n3\n is (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, carboxy (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, amino(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl or mono-N-or di-N,N-(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkylaminoalkyl, -C(Y\n4\n)Y\n5\n wherein Y\n4\n is H or methyl and Y\n5\n is mono-N- or di-N,N-(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkylamino morpholino, piperidin-1-yl or pyrrolidin-1-yl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more compounds of the invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms. \"Solvate\" means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. \"Solvate\" encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. Non-limiting examples of suitable solvates include ethanolates, methanolates, and the like. \"Hydrate\" is a solvate wherein the solvent molecule is H\n2\nO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more compounds of the invention may optionally be converted to a solvate. Preparation of solvates is generally known. Thus, for example, \nM. Caira et al, J. Pharmaceutical Sci., 93(3), 601-611 (2004\n) describe the preparation of the solvates of the antifungal fluconazole in ethyl acetate as well as from water. Similar preparations of solvates, hemisolvate, hydrates and the like are described by \nE. C. van Tonder et al, AAPS PharmSciTech., 5(1), article 12 (2004\n); and \nA. L. Bingham et al, Chem. Commun., 603-604 (2001\n). A typical, non-limiting, process involves dissolving the inventive compound in desired amounts of the desired solvent (organic or water or mixtures thereof) at a higher than ambient temperature, and cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals which are then isolated by standard methods. Analytical techniques such as, for example I. R. spectroscopy, show the presence of the solvent (or water) in the crystals as a solvate (or hydrate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Effective amount\" or \"therapeutically effective amount\" is meant to describe an amount of compound or a composition of the present invention effective in inhibiting the above-noted diseases and thus producing the desired therapeutic, ameliorative, inhibitory or preventative effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can form salts which are also within the scope of this invention. Reference to a compound of the invention herein is understood to include reference to salts thereof, unless otherwise indicated. The term \"salt(s)\", as employed herein, denotes acidic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids, as well as basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic bases. In addition, when a compound of the invention contains both a basic moiety, such as, but not limited to a pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety, such as, but not limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions (\"inner salts\") may be formed and are included within the term \"salt(s)\" as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful. Salts of the compounds of the Formula (I), (II), or (III) may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of Formula (I), (II) or (III) with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary acid addition salts include acetates, ascorbates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates, fumarates, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, hydroiodides, lactates, maleates, methanesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates, nitrates, oxalates, phosphates, propionates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates, tartarates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates (also known as tosylates,) and the like. Additionally, acids which are generally considered suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically useful salts from basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, for example, by \nP. Stahl et al, Camille G. (eds.) Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts. Properties, Selection and Use. (2002) Zurich: Wiley-VCH\n; \nS. Berge et al, Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences (1977) 66(1) 1-19\n; \nP. Gould, International J. of Pharmaceutics (1986) 33 201-217\n; \nAnderson et al, The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry (1996), Academic Press, New York\n; and in \nThe Orange Book\n (Food & Drug Administration, Washington, D.C. on their website).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases (for example, organic amines) such as dicyclohexylamines, t-butyl amines, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quartemized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g. methyl, ethyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g. dimethyl, diethyl, and dibutyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g. decyl, lauryl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g. benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll such acid salts and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable esters of the present compounds include the following groups: (1) carboxylic acid esters obtained by esterification of the hydroxy groups, in which the non-carbonyl moiety of the carboxylic acid portion of the ester grouping is selected from straight or branched chain alkyl (for example, acetyl, n-propyl, t-butyl, or n-butyl), alkoxyalkyl (for example, methoxymethyl), aralkyl (for example, benzyl), aryloxyalkyl (for example, phenoxymethyl), aryl (for example, phenyl optionally substituted with, for example, halogen, C\n1-4\nalkyl, or C\n1-4\nalkoxy or amino); (2) sulfonate esters, such as alkyl- or aralkylsulfonyl (for example, methanesulfonyl); (3) amino acid esters (for example, L-valyl or L-isoleucyl); (4) phosphonate esters and (5) mono-, di- or triphosphate esters. The phosphate esters may be further esterified by, for example, a C\n1-20\n alcohol or reactive derivative thereof, or by a 2,3-di (C\n6-24\n)acyl glycerol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention and salts, solvates and esters ( may exist in their tautomeric form (for example, as an amide or imino ether). All such tautomeric forms are contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and, therefore, exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention as well as mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. In addition, the present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example, if a compound of the invention incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the invention may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of chiral HPLC column.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible that the compounds of the invention may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll stereoisomers (for example, geometric isomers, optical isomers and the like) of the present compounds (including those of the salts, solvates and esters, ), such as those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on various substituents, including enantiomeric forms (which may exist even in the absence of asymmetric carbons), rotameric forms, atropisomers, and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated, as are positional isomers (such as, for example, 4-pyridyl and 3-pyridyl). (For example, if a compound of the invention incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are included in the invention.) Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may, for example, be substantially free of other isomers, or may be admixed, for example, as racemates or with all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the compounds of the present invention can have the S or R configuration as defined by the \nIUPAC\n 1974 Recommendations. The use of the terms \"salt\", \"solvates, \"ester\", \"prodrug\" and the like, is intended to equally apply to the salt, solvate, ester and prodrug of enantiomers, stereoisomers, rotamers, tautomers, positional isomers, racemates or prodrugs of the compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also embraces isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, and \n36\nCl, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain isotopically-labelled compounds of the invention (e.g., those labeled with \n3\nH and \n14\nC) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., \n3\nH) and carbon-14 (i.e., \n14\nC) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples hereinbelow, by substituting an appropriate isotopically labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymorphic forms of the compounds of the invention and of the salts, solvates and esters of the compounds of the invention are intended to be included in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a variable appears more than once in the structural formula, for example R\n3\n or R\n5\n, the identity of each variable appearing more than once may be independently selected from the definition for that variable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can have pharmacological properties, for example the compounds can be inhibitors of TACE (TNF-α) and/or MMP activity. The compounds of the invention can have anti-inflammatory activity and/or immunomodulatory activity and can be useful in the treatment of diseases including but not limited to septic shock, haemodynamic shock, sepsis syndrome, post ischaemic reperfusion injury, malaria, mycobacterial infection, meningitis, psoriasis, congestive heart failure, fibrotic diseases, cachexia, graft rejection, cancers such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, diseases involving angiogenesis, autoimmune diseases, skin inflammatory diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and colitis, osteo and rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, adult Still's disease, ureitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, Behcehe disease, Sjogren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, multiple sclerosis, radiation damage, hyperoxic alveolar injury, periodontal disease, HIV, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, glaucoma, sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinal disease, scleroderma, osteoporosis, renal ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebral stroke, cerebral ischemia, nephritis, hepatitis, glomerulonephritis, cryptogenic fibrosing aveolitis, psoriasis, transplant rejection, atopic dermatitis, vasculitis, allergy, seasonal allergic rhinitis, reversible airway obstruction, adult respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or bronchitis. It is contemplated that a compound of this invention may be useful in treating one or more of the diseases listed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, a compound of the present invention may be co-administered or used in combination with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS) such as methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, pencillinamine, gold salts, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide and other similar drugs.

Suitable H1 antagonists may be, for example, Claritin®, Clarinex®, Allegra®, or Zyrtec®.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, there is provided a compound of the invention for use in treating rheumatoid arthritis wherein the treatment comprises administering a compound of the invention in combination with compound selected from the class consisting of a COX-2 inhibitor e.g. Celebrex® or Vioxx®; a COX-1 inhibitor e.g. Feldene®; an immunosuppressive e.g. methotrexate or cyclosporin; a steroid e.g. β-methasone; and anti-TNF-α compound, e.g. Enbrel® or Remicade®; a PDE IV inhibitor, or other classes of compounds indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, there is provide a compound of the invention for treating multiple sclerosis wherein the treatment comprises administering a compound of the formula of the invention in combination with a compound selected from the group consisting of Avonex®, Betaseron, Copaxone or other compounds indicated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTACE activity is determined by a kinetic assay measuring the rate of increase in fluorescent intensity generated by TACE catalyzed cleavage of an internally quenched peptide substrate (SPDL-3). The purified catalytic domain of recombinant human TACE (rhTACEc, Residue 215 to 477 with two mutation (S266A and N452Q) and a 6xHis tail) is used in the assay. It is purified from the baculovirus/Hi5 cells expression system using affinity chromatography.

The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the \n \nU.S. Pat.

The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, e.g., as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. The compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compound of the invention are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouthwashes and gargles.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds for the present invention can be administered in the intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered as a suppository employing bases such as cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage regimen utilizing the compounds of the present invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular compound thereof employed. A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter, arrest or reverse the progress of the condition. Optimal precision in achieving concentration of drug within the range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the drug's availability to target sites. This involves a consideration of the distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of a drug. Preferably, doses of the compound of Formula I, II or III useful in the method of the present invention range from 0.01 to 1000 mg per day. Most preferably, dosages range from 0.1 to 500 mg/day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 0.01 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, particularly 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.0002 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg of body weight per day. The range is more particularly from about 0.001 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg of body weight per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdvantageously, the active agent of the present invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in dividend doses of two, three or four time daily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route or administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be produced by processes known to those skilled in the art and as shown in the following reaction schemes and in the preparations and examples described below.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following abbreviations are used in the procedures and schemes: dichloromethane (DCM); tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB); Benzyl (Bn); acetonitrile (MeCN); ethyl acetate(EtOAc); Tetrahydrofuran (THF); Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); 1-hydroxy-7-aza-benzotriazole (HOAt); 1-hydroxylbenzotriazole(HOAt); N-methylmorpholine (NMM); 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI); diisopropylethyl amine (DIEA); 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt); Dimethoxyethane (DME).

No. 61/082,456, filed Jul. 21, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe majority of chemotherapeutic agents used to treat cancer exhibit serious toxicity, resulting in undesired side effects for patients and reducing efficacy by limiting the doses that can be safely administered. Similarly, many of the therapeutics used to treat infectious diseases, including parasitic diseases, confer undesirable side effects. It would be preferable if such agents could be administered in a prodrug form that masked the inherent toxicity of the agent from irrelevant, non-diseased tissues, and yet released the fully active drug species at the desired site of action. Such a technology would have the potential to increase the therapeutic window of a variety of drugs, possibly allowing them to be used safely at a more efficacious dose, and with reduced incidence of undesired side-effects for the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn normal cells and tissues, iron remains sequestered in forms that are non-toxic to the cell, bound to the iron carrying protein transferrin for example, or bound as heme within hemoglobin. Diseased tissues and cells, on the other hand, can contain higher than normal concentrations of iron. Many neoplastic cells for example over-express the transferrin receptor to increase their uptake of iron. Increased iron uptake has been proposed to explain the increased toxicity that iron-dependent endoperoxides like artemisinin exhibit towards cancer cell lines as compared to normal cells (Efferth, T. \nDrug Resistance Updates, \n2005, 8:85-97). In one study, the expression level of the transferrin receptor was shown to correlate with the cytotoxicity of an artemisinin derivative towards HeLa cells (see for example Disbrow, G. L., et al Cancer Research, 2005, 65, 10854-10861). Artemisinin and its derivatives are believed to exert their cytotoxic effect via reaction with Fe\nII \nand the resulting generation of reactive oxygen and carbon centered radical species. The cytotoxicity of artemisinin derivatives towards leukemia, astrocytoma, and breast cancer cell lines can be potentiated by the addition of exogenous Fe\nII \nsalts or transferrin (Efferth, T. et al Free Radical Biology & Medicine, 2004, 37, 998-1009; Singh, N. P. et al Life Sciences, 2001, 70, 49-56). U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,637 describes the use of an endoperoxide moiety (i.e., an artemisinin) to kill cancer cells under conditions that enhance intracellular iron concentrations. None of these prior works teach or suggest how higher than normal concentrations of iron in such cells could be exploited for selective delivery of a drug species via an iron-sensitive prodrug moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe blood-scavenging parasites responsible for diseases such as malaria and schistosomiasis also possess biological compartments rich in ferrous iron. In malaria parasites, unbound heme is generated in the parasite digestive vacuole where hemoglobin is degraded by a number of proteases (See Rosenthal, P. J. in \nProtease and hemoglobin degradation\n. Molecular Approaches to Malaria, 2005: p. 311-326). Hence, while the concentration of unbound, ferrous iron is vanishingly small in human plasma (˜10\n−16\nM), significant quantities of ferrous iron are present within malaria parasites (see Robert, A. et al Coordination Chemistry Reviews, 2005, 249, p. 1927-1936). The antimalarial drug artemisinin and its related synthetic derivatives are thought to confer their antiparasitic effect via reaction with ferrous iron and the resulting generation of reactive oxygen and carbon centered radical species. An excess of iron, and ferrous iron in particular, is therefore a distinguishing characteristic of many neoplastic cells and pathogenic parasites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong synthetic endoperoxide ring systems, the iron reactivity of 1,2,4-trioxolanes has been extensively studied in vitro using model systems (see Creek, D. J. et al, J. Pharm. Sci. 2007, 96, 2945-2956). As shown in \nFIG. 1\n, exposure of trioxolane A to iron(II) acetate, leads primarily to the formation of cyclohexanone (E) and the adamantane-derived lactone D, presumably via intermediates B and C (Tang, Y. et al J. Org. Chem. 2005, 70, 5103-5110). O'Neill and co-workers have devised endoperoxide systems in which the carbonyl compound formed upon reaction with iron is itself a chalcone species with antimalarial activity (O'Neill et al, Angewandte Chemie, International Edition, 2004, 43, 4193-4197 and Org. Lett. 2004, 6, 3035-3038). Although these systems can be viewed as prodrugs of chalcones, this work in no way teaches or suggests how the approach might be applied to a wide variety of drug species (i.e., drugs other than chalcones). Further, attachment of a blocking moiety (“pro” moiety) at a carbonyl function as reported in this work is much less desirable and is of less utility than attachment at an amine or alcohol function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of prodrugs to confer improved properties such as increased bioavailability or aqueous solubility is a well established concept in the art of pharmaceutical research. These standard approaches rely on the action of serum esterases or phosphatases to remove the blocking pro moiety and thereby liberate the drug species. The attachment of a cytotoxic agent to a targeting moiety such as a protein or antibody via an acid-labile linker moiety is another known prodrug approach, intended to deliver a drug moiety to a specific cell or tissue. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,306,809. Acid labile linker moieties have also been used to attach drug species to biopolymers or antibodies where the intention is that the lower pH of the diseased tissue serves to trigger release of the drug moiety. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,631,190; 4,997,913; 5,140,013. The use of a masked retro-Michael linker has been employed in a targeted prodrug system involving biochemical oxidation as the trigger for drug release (Huttunen, et al, 2007\n, Pharm. Res., \n24:679-687). In this system, oxidation of a cyclic phosphate prodrug by CYP-450 enzymes exposes a retro-Michael substrate that undergoes spontaneous β-elimination to release phosphorylated drug species. None of these prior studies teach or suggest how one might mask the carbonyl function of a retro-Michael substrate as a trioxane or trioxolane ring, and attach such moiety to a drug species, thereby producing a prodrug that effectively releases active drug only in cells or tissues having ferrous iron concentrations above the physiological norm.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides prodrug compounds and methods for the treatment of diseases that are associated with a cell or organism having increased Fe\nII \nlevels, as well as compounds and methods for the detection of fluoregenic compounds in a cell of an organism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides a prodrug having the formula:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn Formula (I), X is —CH\n2\nO—, —OCH\n2\n—, or —O—.

Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, cyclohexyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, cyclopropylmethyl, homologs and isomers of, for example, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkylene” by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from an alkyl, as exemplified, but not limited, by —CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n—. Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, with those groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being preferred in the present invention. A “lower alkyl” or “lower alkylene” is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroalkyl,” by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combinations thereof, consisting of at least one carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, P, Si and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) O, N, P and S and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—N(CH\n3\n)—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—S—CH\n2\n—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n, —S(O)—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—S(O)\n2\n—CH\n3\n, —CH═CH—O—CH\n3\n, —Si(CH\n3\n)\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH═N—OCH\n3\n, —CH═CH—N(CH\n3\n)—CH\n3\n, O—CH\n3\n, —O—CH\n2\n—CH\n3\n, and —CN. Up to two heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, —CH\n2\n—NH—OCH\n3 \nand —CH\n2\n—O—Si(CH\n3\n)\n3\n. Similarly, the term “heteroalkylene” by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—S—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— and —CH\n2\n—S—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—CH\n2\n—. For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula —C(O)\n2\nR′— represents both —C(O)\n2\nR′— and —R′C(O)\n2\n—. As described above, heteroalkyl groups, as used herein, include those groups that are attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom, such as —C(O)R′, —C(O)NR′, —NR′R″, —OR′, —SR′, and/or —SO\n2\nR′. Where “heteroalkyl” is recited, followed by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups, such as —NR′R″ or the like, it will be understood that the terms heteroalkyl and —NR′R″ are not redundant or mutually exclusive. Rather, the specific heteroalkyl groups are recited to add clarity. Thus, the term “heteroalkyl” should not be interpreted herein as excluding specific heteroalkyl groups, such as —NR′R″ or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “cycloalkyl” and “heterocycloalkyl”, by themselves or in combination with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of “alkyl” and “heteroalkyl”, respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, 1-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl, tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1-piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like. A “cycloalkylene” and “heterocycloalkylene” refer to a divalent radical derived from cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “halo” or “halogen,” by themselves or as part of another substituent, mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally, terms such as “haloalkyl,” are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For example, the term “halo(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl” is mean to include, but not be limited to, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “aryl” means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, aromatic, hydrocarbon substituent which can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from 1 to 3 rings) which are fused together or linked covalently. The term “heteroaryl” refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain from one to four heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a carbon or heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1-isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl, and 6-quinolyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below. “Arylene” and “heteroarylene” refers to a divalent radical derived from a aryl and heteroaryl, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor brevity, the term “aryl” when used in combination with other terms (e.g., aryloxy, arylthioxy, arylalkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above. Thus, the term “arylalkyl” is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (e.g., a methylene group) has been replaced by, for example, an oxygen atom (e.g., phenoxymethyl, 2-pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(1-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere a heteroalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, or heteroaryl includes a specific number of members (e.g. “3 to 7 membered”), the term “member” refers to a carbon or heteroatom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “oxo” as used herein means an oxygen that is double bonded to a carbon atom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the above terms (e.g., “alkyl,” “heteroalkyl,” “aryl” and “heteroaryl”) are meant to include both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred substituents for each type of radical are provided below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals (including those groups often referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) can be one or more of a variety of groups selected from, but not limited to: —OR′, ═O, ═NR′, ═N—OR′, —NR′R″, —SR′, -halogen, —SiR′R″R″′, —OC(O)R′, —C(O)R′, —CO\n2\nR′, —CONR′R″, —OC(O)NR′R″, —NR″C(O)R′, —NR′—C(O)NR″R″′, —NR″C(O)\n2\nR′, —NR—C(NR′R″R″′)═NR″″, —NR—C(NR′R″)═NR″′, —S(O)R′, —S(O)\n2\nR′, —S(O)\n2\nNR′R″, —NRSO\n2\nR′, —CN and —NO\n2 \nin a number ranging from zero to (2 m′+1), where m′ is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical. R′, R″, R″′ and R″″ each preferably independently refer to hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl (e.g., aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens), substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R′, R″, R′″ and R″″ groups when more than one of these groups is present. When R′ and R″ are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, —NR′R″ is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term “alkyl” is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., —CF\n3 \nand —CH\n2\nCF\n3\n) and acyl (e.g., —C(O)CH\n3\n, —C(O)CF\n3\n, —C(O)CH\n2\nOCH\n3\n, and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for the aryl and heteroaryl groups are varied and are selected from, for example: halogen, —OR′, —NR′R″, —SR′, -halogen, —SiR′R″R″′, —OC(O)R′, —C(O)R′, —CO\n2\nR′, —CONR′R″, —OC(O)NR′R″, —NR″C(O)R′, —NR′—C(O)NR″R″′, —NR″C(O)\n2\nR′, —NR—C(NR′R″R′″)═NR″″, —NR—C(NR′R″)═NR′″, —S(O)R′, —S(O)\n2\nR′, —S(O)\n2\nNR′R″, —NRSO\n2\nR′, —CN and —NO\n2\n, —R′, —N\n3\n, —CH(Ph)\n2\n, fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkoxy, and fluoro(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and where R′, R″, R″′ and R″″ are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R′, R″, R′″ and R″″ groups when more than one of these groups is present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally form a ring of the formula -T-C(O)—(CRR′)\nq\n—U—, wherein T and U are independently —NR—, —O—, —CRR′— or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 3. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -A-(CH\n2\n)\nr\n—B—, wherein A and B are independently —CRR′—, —O—, —NR—, —S—, —S(O)—, —S(O)\n2\n—, —S(O)\n2\nNR′— or a single bond, and r is an integer of from 1 to 4. One of the single bonds of the new ring so formed may optionally be replaced with a double bond. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula —(CRR′)\ns\n—X′—(C″R″′)\nd\n—, where s and d are independently integers of from 0 to 3, and X′ is —O—, —NR′—, —S—, —S(O)—, —S(O)\n2\n—, or —S(O)\n2\nNR′—. The substituents R, R′, R″ and R′″ are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “heteroatom” or “ring heteroatom” is meant to include oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), and silicon (Si).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “substituent group,” as used herein, means a group selected from the following moieties:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(A) —OH, —NH\n2\n, —SH, —CN, —CF\n3\n, —NO\n2\n, oxo, halogen, unsubstituted alkyl, unsubstituted heteroalkyl, unsubstituted cycloalkyl, unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, unsubstituted aryl, unsubstituted heteroaryl, and\n \n(B) alkyl, heteroalkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl, substituted with at least one substituent selected from:\n        \n \n(i) oxo, —OH, —NH\n2\n, —SH, —CN, —CF\n3\n, —NO\n2\n, halogen, unsubstituted alkyl, unsubstituted heteroalkyl, unsubstituted cycloalkyl, unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, unsubstituted aryl, unsubstituted heteroaryl, and\n \n(ii) alkyl, heteroalkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl, substituted with at least one substituent selected from:\n \n\n\n \n(a) oxo, —OH, —NH\n2\n, —SH, —CN, —CF\n3\n, —NO\n2\n, halogen, unsubstituted alkyl, unsubstituted heteroalkyl, unsubstituted cycloalkyl, unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, unsubstituted aryl, unsubstituted heteroaryl, and\n \n(b) alkyl, heteroalkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl, substituted with at least one substituent selected from oxo, —OH, —NH\n2\n, —SH, —CN, —CF\n3\n, —NO\n2\n, halogen, unsubstituted alkyl, unsubstituted heteroalkyl, unsubstituted cycloalkyl, unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, unsubstituted aryl, and unsubstituted heteroaryl.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nA “size-limited substituent” or “size-limited substituent group,” as used herein means a group selected from all of the substituents described above for a “substituent group,” wherein each substituted or unsubstituted alkyl is a substituted or unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n20 \nalkyl, each substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl is a substituted or unsubstituted 2 to 20 membered heteroalkyl, each substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl is a substituted or unsubstituted C\n4\n-C\n8 \ncycloalkyl, and each substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl is a substituted or unsubstituted 4 to 8 membered heterocycloalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “lower substituent” or “lower substituent group,” as used herein means a group selected from all of the substituents described above for a “substituent group,” wherein each substituted or unsubstituted alkyl is a substituted or unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n8 \nalkyl, each substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl is a substituted or unsubstituted 2 to 8 membered heteroalkyl, each substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl is a substituted or unsubstituted C\n5\n-C\n7 \ncycloalkyl, and each substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl is a substituted or unsubstituted 5 to 7 membered heterocycloalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may exist as salts. The present invention includes such salts. Examples of applicable salt forms include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, methanesulfonates, nitrates, maleates, acetates, citrates, fumarates, tartrates (eg (+)-tartrates, (−)-tartrates or mixtures thereof including racemic mixtures, succinates, benzoates and salts with amino acids such as glutamic acid. These salts may be prepared by methods known to those skilled in art. Also included are base addition salts such as sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like. Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe neutral forms of the compounds are preferably regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present invention and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of the present invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical or chiral centers) or double bonds; the enantiomers, racemates, diastereomers, tautomers, geometric isomers, stereoisometric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)- or, as (D)- or (L)- for amino acids, and individual isomers are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention do not include those which are known in art to be too unstable to synthesize and/or isolate. The present invention is meant to include compounds in racemic and optically pure forms. Optically active (R)- and (S)-, or (D)- and (L)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “tautomer,” as used herein, refers to one of two or more structural isomers which exist in equilibrium and which are readily converted from one isomeric form to another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be apparent to one skilled in the art that certain compounds of this invention may exist in tautomeric forms, all such tautomeric forms of the compounds being within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include all stereochemical forms of the structure; i.e., the R and S configurations for each asymmetric center. Therefore, single stereochemical isomers as well as enantiomeric and diastereomeric mixtures of the present compounds are within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of a hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by \n13\nC- or \n14\nC-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (\n3\nH), iodine-125 (\n125\nI) or carbon-14 (\n14\nC). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” is meant to include salts of the active compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. The term “relatively nontoxic” refers to a level of toxicity insufficient to militate against use by a health care practitioner (for example, medical or veterinary) in the treatment of a subject. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts”, \nJournal of Pharmaceutical Science, \n1977, 66, 1-19). Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the compounds of the present invention may exist as salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids. The present invention includes such salts. Examples of such salts include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, methanesulfonates, nitrates, maleates, acetates, citrates, fumarates, tartrates (eg (+)-tartrates, (−)-tartrates or mixtures thereof including racemic mixtures, succinates, benzoates and salts with amino acids such as glutamic acid. These salts may be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe neutral forms of the compounds are preferably regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrugs described herein are compounds that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide drugs to a biological system from the drug moieties attached to the prodrug (e.g. -L\n1\n-Z\n1\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present invention and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of the present invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, tautomers, geometric isomers and individual isomers are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention do not include those which are known in the art to be too unstable to synthesize and/or isolate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (\n3\nH), iodine-125 (\n125\nI) or carbon-14 (\n14\nC). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “a” or “an,” as used in herein means one or more. In addition, the phrase “substituted with a[n],” as used herein, means the specified group may be substituted with one or more of any or all of the named substituents. Moreover, where a moiety is substituted with an R substituent, the group may be referred to as “R-substituted.” Where a moiety is R-substituted, the moiety is substituted with at least one R substituent and each R substituent is optionally different.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDescription of compounds of the present invention are limited by principles of chemical bonding known to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, where a group may be substituted by one or more of a number of substituents, such substitutions are selected so as to comply with principles of chemical bonding and to give compounds which are not inherently unstable and/or would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art as likely to be unstable under ambient conditions, such as aqueous, neutral, and several known physiological conditions. For example, a heterocycloalkyl or heteroaryl is attached to the remainder of the molecule via a ring heteroatom in compliance with principles of chemical bonding known to those skilled in the art thereby avoiding inherently unstable compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “treating” or “treatment” refers to any indicia of success in the treatment or amelioration of an injury, pathology or condition, including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement; remission; diminishing of symptoms or making the injury, pathology or condition more tolerable to the patient; slowing in the rate of degeneration or decline; making the final point of degeneration less debilitating; improving a patient's physical or mental well-being. The treatment or amelioration of symptoms can be based on objective or subjective parameters; including the results of a physical examination, neuropsychiatric exams, and/or a psychiatric evaluation. For example, certain methods provided herein successfully treat cancer by decreasing the incidence of cancer and or causing remission of cancer.\n\n\n \nCompositions\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides a prodrug having the formula:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn Formula (I) X is —CH\n2\nO—, —OCH\n2\n—, or —O—.

In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation further includes an Fe\nII \ncontaining agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention can be prepared and administered in a wide variety of oral, parenteral and topical dosage forms. Thus, the compounds of the present invention can be administered by injection (e.g. intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously, subcutaneously, intraduodenally, or intraperitoneally). Also, the compounds described herein can be administered by inhalation, for example, intranasally. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention can be administered transdermally. It is also envisioned that multiple routes of administration (e.g., intramuscular, oral, transdermal) can be used to administer the compounds of the invention. Accordingly, the present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and one or more compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substance, which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid, which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe powders and tablets preferably contain from 5% to 70% of the active compound. Suitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term “preparation” is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component with or without other carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example, water or water/propylene glycol solutions. For parenteral injection, liquid preparations can be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen parenteral application is needed or desired, particularly suitable admixtures for the compounds of the invention are injectable, sterile solutions, preferably oily or aqueous solutions, as well as suspensions, emulsions, or implants, including suppositories. In particular, carriers for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of dextrose, saline, pure water, ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, peanut oil, sesame oil, polyoxyethylene-block polymers, and the like. Ampules are convenient unit dosages. The compounds of the invention can also be incorporated into liposomes or administered via transdermal pumps or patches. Pharmaceutical admixtures suitable for use in the present invention are well-known to those of skill in the art and are described, for example, in Pharmaceutical Sciences (17th Ed., Mack Pub. Co., Easton, Pa.) and WO 96/05309, the teachings of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizers, and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other well-known suspending agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included are solid form preparations, which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical preparation is preferably in unit dosage form. In such form the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe quantity of active component in a unit dose preparation may be varied or adjusted from 0.1 mg to 10000 mg, more typically 1.0 mg to 1000 mg, most typically 10 mg to 500 mg, according to the particular application and the potency of the active component. The composition can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome compounds may have limited solubility in water and therefore may require a surfactant or other appropriate co-solvent in the composition. Such co-solvents include: Polysorbate 20, 60 and 80; Pluronic F-68, F-84 and P-103; cyclodextrin; polyoxyl 35 castor oil; or other agents known to those skilled in the art. Such co-solvents are typically employed at a level between about 0.01% and about 2% by weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nViscosity greater than that of simple aqueous solutions may be desirable to decrease variability in dispensing the formulations, to decrease physical separation of components of a suspension or emulsion of formulation and/or otherwise to improve the formulation. Such viscosity building agents include, for example, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose, chondroitin sulfate and salts thereof, hyaluronic acid and salts thereof, combinations of the foregoing, and other agents known to those skilled in the art. Such agents are typically employed at a level between about 0.01% and about 2% by weight. Determination of acceptable amounts of any of the above adjuvants is readily ascertained by one skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention may additionally include components to provide sustained release and/or comfort. Such components include high molecular weight, anionic mucomimetic polymers, gelling polysaccharides and finely-divided drug carrier substrates. These components are discussed in greater detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,911,920; 5,403,841; 5,212,162; and 4,861,760. The entire contents of these patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.\n\n\n \nEffective Dosages\n\n\n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions provided by the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredient is contained in a therapeutically effective amount, i.e., in an amount effective to achieve its intended purpose. The actual amount effective for a particular application will depend, inter alia, on the condition being treated. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is well known in the art, therapeutically effective amounts for use in humans can also be determined from animal models. For example, a dose for humans can be formulated to achieve a concentration that has been found to be effective in animals. Adjusting the dose to achieve maximal efficacy in humans based on the methods described above and other methods as are well-known in the art is well within the capabilities of the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosages may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the compound being employed. The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage amounts and intervals can be adjusted individually to provide levels of the administered compound effective for the particular clinical indication being treated. This will provide a therapeutic regimen that is commensurate with the severity of the individual's disease state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUtilizing the teachings provided herein, an effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatment regimen can be planned which does not cause substantial toxicity and yet is entirely effective to treat the clinical symptoms demonstrated by the particular patient. This planning should involve the careful choice of active compound by considering factors such as compound potency, relative bioavailability, patient body weight, presence and severity of adverse side effects, preferred mode of administration and the toxicity profile of the selected agent.\n\n\n \nToxicity\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ratio between toxicity and therapeutic effect for a particular compound is its therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio between LD\n50 \n(the amount of compound lethal in 50% of the population) and ED\n50 \n(the amount of compound effective in 50% of the population). Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. Therapeutic index data obtained from cell culture assays and/or animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosages for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds preferably lies within a range of plasma concentrations that include the ED\n50 \nwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. See, e.g. Fingl et al., In: \nThe Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Ch.\n1, p. 1, 1975. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition and the particular method in which the compound is used.\n\n\n \nMethods\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another aspect of the present invention, the prodrug compounds can be employed in methods to treat a disease that is associated with a cell or organism that has increased Fe\nII \nlevels compared to Fe\nII \nlevels in mammalian plasma. The method includes administering an effective amount of the prodrug compound (or pharmaceutical formulation thereof) to a patient in need of such treatment. Increased Fe\nII \nlevels are cellular levels of Fe\nII \nthat are sufficiently high to cause disease in a patient and are higher than in the plasma of a patient. In some embodiments, the method includes administering an effective amount of a prodrug compound and an Fe\nII \ncontaining agent to a patient in need of such treatment. In another embodiment, the Fe\nII \ncontaining agent is ferroglycine sulfate or transferrin. The Fe\nII \ncontaining agent may be co-administered with the prodrug. In another embodiment the Fe\nII \ncontaining agent may be administered before or after prodrug administration. A disease that is associated with a cell or organism that has increased Fe\nII \nlevels compared to Fe\nII \nlevels in mammalian plasma refers to a disease in which Fe\nII \nlevels are elevated relative to Fe\nII \nlevels in mammalian plasma in the absence of the disease. The disease associated with increased Fe\nII \nlevels is not bound by any particular mechanistic theory, and include those diseases resulting in increase Fe\nII \nlevels and/or caused by Fe\nII \nlevels. Thus, in some embodiments, the increased Fe\nII \nlevels are the result of the disease. In some embodiments, the increased Fe\nII \nlevels are the result of the disease, and additionally the increased Fe\nII \nlevels cause symptoms related to increased Fe\nII \nlevels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the disease is malaria schistosomiasis, trypanosomiasis, leukemia, cervical cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, melanoma, or any cancer where transferrin receptors (CD71) are over-expressed as compared to normal cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a method of detecting a fluoregenic compound in a cell of an organism, by administering this fluoregenic compound to an organism, allowing the organism to metabolize the fluoregenic compound thereby producing a fluorescent compound, and detecting this fluorescent compound in a cell of a sample from this organism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of skill will recognize that the properties described above for the fluoregenic compound and prodrug compound are applicable to the appropriate methods and pharmaceutical compositions described herein.\n\n\n \nGeneral Synthetic Schemes\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of this invention can be prepared in accordance with one or more of the Schemes discussed below. These procedures will be understandable to and can be carried out by someone of ordinary skill in organic chemistry. Starting materials may be prepared according to procedures provided in references below or are commercially available. Unless otherwise defined below, variables used in the Schemes are as defined in the specification or in the claims.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthetic route shown in Scheme I is a convenient method for preparing the key trioxolane lactone intermediate 4, which in turn may be elaborated as shown in later schemes to introduce various side chains and substituents L\n2 \nand R\n3\n. The first step of Scheme involves the Griesbaum coozonolysis of an O-alkyl oxime (1) with a ketone (e.g. 2) to afford a 1,2,4-trioxolane product 3. This reaction has been used previously for the preparation of related trioxolanes (see Griesbaum et. al. Tetrahedron, 1997, 53, 5463-5470; Vennerstrom et. al. J. Org. Chem., 1998, 63, 8582-8585; Tang et. al. J. Org. Chem., 2004, 69, 6470-6473) and typically involve bubbling ozone gas into a solution of the \nreactants\n 1 and 2 in solvents such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane, hexane, pentane, or mixtures thereof at temperatures in the range of −30° C. to 50° C., but favorably between 0-25° C. Optionally, the ketone and oxime partners can be reversed (i.e. 1 is a ketone and 2 is oxime), and in certain cases such modification may lead to improved yields of the product. Provided that R\n4 \nand R\n3 \ntogether comprise a cycle or are otherwise bulky substituents, the trioxolane products are stable and can be purified by standard methods of synthetic organic chemistry, including silica gel flash chromatography and re-crystallization. In the second step of Scheme 1, the trioxolane ketone 3 is subjected to a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, leading to the ring-expanded lactone product 4, which is readily elaborated into various side chains comprising variables L\n2 \nand R\n3 \nas illustrated in Scheme II. The Baeyer-Villiger oxidation is a classic reaction in organic chemistry (see Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, 1991, 7, 671-688) and will be well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Typically the reaction is carried out by reacting the ketone substrate with a peracid such as m-chloroperbenzoic acid or peracetic acid in solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, or similar, at reaction temperatures of about 0° C. and 50° C.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIllustrated in Scheme II are reactions that can be used to introduce various side chain substituents L\n2 \nand R\n3 \nin the compounds of this invention. The reactions presented in Scheme II are not intended to be comprehensive but rather represent certain possibilities that will be understandable to those of ordinary skill in the field. The modification of L\n2 \nand/or R\n3 \nsubstituents in compounds of the invention can be used to modify the physiochemical or other pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of a prodrug. Each of the intermediates 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 in Scheme II possess a free hydroxyl residue that can be used to introduce a drug moiety via various linker chemistries (as described in Scheme IV and V).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction of lactone 4 with an amine provides amide derivatives such as 5. These reactions can be carried out in a single step by heating a solution of lactone 4 with an equivalent or favorably an excess quantity of an amine (e.g. R\n3\n—NH\n2\n), in a solvent such as tolulene, xylene, dioxane, or acetonitrile, or using the amine itself as solvent, at temperatures ranging from 0° C. to 140° C., optionally using a sealed tube or pressure vessel, to afford the amide 5. Optionally, amides 5 can be prepared in two steps by 1) lactone hydrolysis under standard conditions (e.g. using LiOH, NaOH, KOH or similar reagent in solvents such as methanol, tetrahyrofuran, water, or mixtures thereof) and 2) reaction of the resulting carboxylic acid with an amine (e.g. R\n3\n—NH\n2\n) using standard carbodiimide or related bond forming reagents (EDC, DCC, HATU, HBTU, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction of lactone 4 with a mild reducing reagent such as diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL) in solvents such as toluene, heptane, hexane, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, or mixtures thereof, and at temperatures between −100° C. and 0° C., favorably below −50° C., affords partial reduction to the aldehyde which is in equilibrium with the lactol form (6) shown in Scheme II. It will be well known by those of ordinary skill in the art that aldehydes (including lactols) can be reacted directly with phosphonium ylides (Wittig reaction) or stabilized phosphonate anions (Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction) to afford olefinic products 8. Alternatively, subjecting 6 to reductive amination with an amine affords amine-containing side chains as shown for 7. Reductive amination reactions are favorably conducted in solvents such as methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, dichloroethane or mixtures thereof, using reducing agents such as sodium cyanoborohydride, or sodium triacetoxyborohydride, at temperatures generally in a range of 0° C. to 100° C. Reductive amination of carbonyl species in trioxolane-containing substrates is precedented (Vennerstrom et. al. J. Org. Chem., 2004, 69, 6470-6473).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEther containing side chains as in compounds 10 and 12 of Scheme II can be prepared by at least two different synthetic routes. Hence, reaction of lactone 4 with an alkoxide (e.g. NaOMe or similar) to afford the ring-opened hydroxyl ester can be followed by protection of the hydroxyl function to afford 9 (P=a suitable protecting group for hydroxyl, such as trialkylsilyl, benzyl, etc.). The ester function in 9 can then be reduced to alcohol using standard reducing reagents (e.g. lithium aluminum hydride or sodium borohydride, or lithium borohydride in solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether or dioxane) and the protecting group (P) removed under appropriate conditions (e.g., fluoride ion for silyl ethers, hydrogenolysis for benzyl ethers) to afford alcohol 10. Reaction of lactone 4 with an alkyl lithium or Grignard reagent affords a keto alcohol and subsequent protection of the alcohol as before to afford 11. Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of the ketone function affords an acetate, alkaline hydrolysis of which serves to introduce a second alcohol function that can be converted into an ether function under standard conditions (e.g., formation of the alkoxide with a base such as sodium hydride or alkyl lithium, and reaction of the alkoxide with an alkyl, allyl, or benzylic halide). Finally, removal of the protecting group P using the relevant conditions affords the desired alcohol 12.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention bearing a trioxane ring (i.e., where X=CH\n2\n—O—, or —O—CH\n2\n—) can be prepared using established procedures as illustrated in Schemes III and IV. As shown in Scheme III, an epoxide 13 is reacted with hydrogen peroxide, with or without an acid catalyst, to afford a beta-hydroperoxy alcohol 14. Reactions of this type have been carried out with anhydrous hydrogen peroxide (see Kerr, B. et al, J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. 1985, 590-593; Subramanyam, V. et.al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. 1976, 508-509; Adam, W. et al, J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 3183-3189) or using a 50% aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide pretreated with magnesium sulfate and employing molybdenyl acetylacetonate (MoO\n2\n(acac)\n2\n) as catalyst (see Tang et al, J. Org. Chem., 2005, 70, 5103-5110). Reaction of hydroperoxy alcohol 14 with a carbonyl species (e.g. cyclohexane-1,4,-dione) using standard conditions for forming acetals (e.g. catalytic para-toluenesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, or the like in a solvent such as dichloromethane, toluene, or the like) affords the desired trioxane intermediate 15. Ketone 15 can then be converted in two steps (via the lactone 16) to the alcohol intermediate 17, using conditions analogous to those described in the earlier Schemes for the preparation of alcohols such as 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 from ketone 3.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis of regioisomeric trioxane compounds of the invention (i.e., where X=—O—CH\n2\n—) is illustrated in Scheme IV. These compounds are prepared by a version of the thiol-olefin co-oxygenation reaction of substituted allylic alcohols as described in the organic chemistry literature (see O'Neill et al Org. Lett. 2004, 6, 3035-3038). In this reaction, a oxygen-saturated solution of allylic alcohol 18, an aryl thiol, and a radical initiator such as AIBN (2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile)) is irradiated with ultraviolet light. The mechanism of the reaction is thought to involve Markovnikov type addition of an arylthiyl radical to the alkene in 18, followed by trapping of the resulting tertiary carbon-centered radical by oxygen to form a peroxy radical that subsequently abstracts a hydrogen atom from the aryl thiol to generate beta-hydroperoxy alcohol 19. Reaction of 19 with a ketone under acetal-forming conditions (as described above for the preparation of 15) then affords the trioxane intermediate 20. Next, the sulfide 20 is oxidized to the sulfoxide, for example using a peracid such as m-chloroperbenzoic acid, peracetic acid, or the like in a solvent such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, or the like. The sulfoxide is then subjected to a Pummerer rearrangement (for a review see, Grierson, D. S, and Husson, H.-P. Comp. Org. Syn. 1991, 6, 924-937) to afford the aldehyde 21. The Pummerer rearrangement leading to 21 is favorably carried out according to the method of O'Neill an co-workers (referenced above), employing an activating reagent such as trifluoroacetic anhydride in the presence of a base such as lutidine, N-methylmorpholine, or the like. Aldehyde 21 can be homologated by one carbon atom to aldehyde 22 using a variety of procedures that will be familiar to those of ordinary skill in organic chemistry. Favorably, such homologations are carried out with the phosphorus ylide generated by treating (methoxymethyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide, (methoxymethyl)diphenylphosphine oxide or similar reagent with a base such as sodium hydride, lithium diisopropylamide, sodium amide or the like (see for example, Farmer et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003, 13, 261-264; Kuroda et al, Organic and Bioorganic Chemistry, 1994, 5, 521-526). The resulting enol ethers are then hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to afford the homologated aldehyde. Finally, homologated 22 can be reduced to alcohol 23 using a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride, lithium borohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, or similar reagent in solvents such as methanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, or mixtures thereof. Both aldehyde 22 and alcohol 23 are useful intermediates for preparing compounds of the invention, as described below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe generic structure 24 shown above in Scheme V encompasses the various alcohols 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17, and 23 described in Schemes II-IV above. Here we describe synthetic methods for the introduction of one or two substituents R\n1 \nin compounds of the invention. Oxidation of alcohol 24 to the aldehyde 25 can be accomplished using a variety of well known methods. Hence, the group of Vennerstrom has used the Swern oxidation (for a review see Tidwell, \nSynthesis, \n1990:857-870) to oxidize trioxolane containing substrates to the aldehyde (see for example, Vennerstrom et. al. \nJ. Org. Chem., \n2004, 69:6470-6473). The Dess-Martin periodinane (see Boeckman, R. J. In “\nEncyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis\n”; Paquette, L. A., Ed.; Wiley: Chichester, UK, 1995, 7:4982-4987) is another convenient reagent for affecting the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. The reaction is usually conducted in dichloromethane or similar solvent at temperatures between 0° C. and 50° C., often at room temperature. Introduction of the R\n1 \nsubstituent can be accomplished by reacting aldehyde 25 with an alkyllithium or Grignard reagent in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, hexane, or mixtures thereof, to afford the addition product 26, an alcohol bearing an R\n1 \nsubstituent. Suitable organomettalic reagents may include phenylmagnesium bromide or chloride, methylmagnesium bromide or chloride, vinylmagnesium bromide or chloride, methyllithium, phenyllithium, vinyllithium, or the like. Reactions of these reagents with carbonyl functions in trioxolane containing substrates has been described previously (see, J. Org. Chem., 2004, 69, 6470-6473 and PCT publication WO/2003/000676). If a second R\n1 \nsubstituent is desirably, the oxidation and addition chemistry described above can simply be repeated to introduce a second R\n1 \nsubstituent, affording compounds such as 28.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention wherein R\n2 \nis an electron-withdrawing group can be synthesized as shown in Scheme VI above. The generic structure 29 is intended to represent any of the various aldehyde and ketone intermediates described above in Schemes II-V. The first step involves introduction of a bromine at the position alpha to the carbonyl function. This transformation can be accomplished using reagents such as bromine or N-bromosuccinimide (see, Boswell, G. Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry 1996, 33(1), 33-9; De Kimpe, Norbert; Tetrahedron Letters 1980, 21, 2257-60) in solvents such as diethyl ether, DMSO, dioxane or in the like, and optionally with exposure to ultraviolet irradiation (see Arbuj, Sudhir S. Tetrahedron Letters 2007, 48, 1411-1415). Next, the bromine atom is displaced by cyanide anion (see, Carabateas, Philip M. et al Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry 1984, 21, 1849-56) using sodium cyanide, potassium cyanide, or equivalent reagent, in a solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, ethanol, or the like at temperatures of around 0° C. to 120° C. to afford 31. Finally, the ketone 31 can be reduced to the alcohol 32 using a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride, lithium borohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, or the like in solvents such as methanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, or mixtures thereof. Both carbonyl species 31 and alcohol 32 are useful intermediates for preparing compounds of the invention, as described below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll of the various alcohol intermediates described in the above Schemes, with or without R\n1 \nor R\n2 \nsubstituents, are represent in Scheme VII generically as alcohol 33. Illustrated in Scheme VII is the attachment of a drug species to 33 via acid, carbonate, or carbamate functionality. First, the attachment of a carboxylic acid bearing drug species to 33 can be accomplished directly via the formation of an ester bond as in 34. This process will be well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be accomplished with carbodiimide or related coupling reagents (e.g., DCC, EDC, HATU, and the like). Alternatively, the carboxylic acid function can be activated in an initial step, for example by forming the acid chloride or pentafluorophenyl ester, followed by reaction with 33 or with the corresponding alkoxide form of 33 generated by reaction with a base such as sodium hydride, butyllithium or the like. Acid chlorides are conveniently prepared by reaction of the acid with reagents such as thionyl chloride, oxallyl chloride, or the like. Pentafluorophenyl esters are conveniently prepared by reaction of the acid with pentafluorophenyl trifluoroacetate in a solvent such as acetonitrile, dichloroethane, DMF, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor drug species bearing a hydroxyl or amine function, the conjugation to 33 can be made in the form of a carbonate or carbamate function, respectively. First, the alcohol 33 is activated with a reagent such as 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate, phosgene, triphogene, carbonyl imidazole or the like. Reactions of this type are favorably carried out in solvent such as dichloromethane, acetonitrile, or the like, in the presence of an acid-scavenging base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, or the like, and optionally with the addition of a nucleophilic promoter such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine. Reaction of 33 with 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate as described above affords the carbonate 35, which usually can be isolated and purified by standard methods such as silica gel flash chromatography. Intermediate 35 is then reacted with an amine or alcohol containing drug to form 36. These reactions are favorably carried out in solvents such as dichloromethane, acetonitrile, DMF, or the like, at temperatures between around 0° C. to 100° C. until reaction is complete. In some cases, reactions of this type may be promoted with additives such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine. An alternative approach applicable to amine-bearing drugs is to convert the amine function into an isocyanate, using methods that will be familiar to those skilled in the art (e.g. reaction with phosgene, triphosgene, or the like). The isocyanate is then reacted with alcohol 33, for example by heating in a solvent such as toluene, acetonitrile, dichloroethane, or the like, at a temperature of around 0° C. to 120° C. until carbamate formation is complete. Final products 36 can be purified using standard methods of synthetic organic chemistry, including silica gel flash chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, recrystallization, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention bearing an ether linkage to Z\n1 \ncan be prepared as shown in Scheme VIII by reacting alcohol 33, or alternatively the alkoxide form of 33 (prepared as described above) with an electrophilic moiety such as Z\n1\n-LG, wherein LG is a leaving group such as bromo, iodo, methanesulfonyl, toluenesulfonyl, or the like. These nucleophilic displacement reactions will be well known to those of ordinary skill in organic chemistry and are favorably carried out in solvents such as acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, or the like at reaction temperatures of about −25° C. to 120° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmine containing drugs can also be conjugated directly to the trioxolane moiety as shown in Scheme VIII. Oxidation of alcohol 33 to the corresponding aldehyde 38 is favorably carried out using the Dess-Martin periodinane, in a solvent such as dichloromethane, or the like, at temperatures between 0° C. and 50° C. Other methods to oxidize alcohols to aldehydes are also available and will be familiar to those of ordinary skill in organic chemistry. Next, a reductive amination reaction is carried out with aldehyde 38, an amine containing drug, and a suitable reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, or the like to afford 39. Reductive amination is a well established reaction in organic chemistry (for a discussion of favorable reaction conditions see Abdel-Magid et al, J. Org. Chem., 1996, 61, 3849-3862) and has been successfully applied previously in reactions of trioxolane-containing carbonyl substrates (Vennerstrom et. al. J. Org. Chem., 2004, 69, 6470-6473).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nPreparation of 2-(5,5-spiroadamantyl-3-(3-(2-morpholinoethylamino)-3-oxopropyl)-1,2,4-trioxolan-3-yl)ethyl-2,5-dichlorophenylcarbamate\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nStep 1: Preparation of O-methyl 2-adamantanone oxime\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2-Adamantanone (1.3 g, 10 mmol) and methoxylamine hydrochloride (1.3 g, 15.56 mmol) were dissolved in methanol (30 ml).

Inhibition of these proteases in cultured \nP. falciparum \nparasites is known to produce a distinctive phenotype—a swollen, dark-staining food vacuole (Rosenthal, et al: \nJ Clin Invest, \n1988, 82:1560). Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the prodrug form of the protease inhibitor (e.g., Cmpd 72) does not itself inhibit falcipain-2 or falcipain-3 due to the substantial pro-moiety present in the prodrug form. Thus, observation of the food vacuole phenotype upon treatment of cultured \nP. falciparum \nparasites with the protease inhibitor prodrug would constitute positive evidence for release of the free drug inside the parasite.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynchronized W2 strain \nP. falciparum \nparasites (ring stage) were grown as described herein and incubated in the presence of test and control compounds for 24 hrs. Next, a blood smear was made, fixed with methanol, and stained with Giemsa, as known in the art. Parasites were then imaged at 100× magnification to identify the presence or absence of the food vacuole phenotype. As shown in \nFIG. 3A\n, untreated control parasites (DMSO) show a normal, light-staining food vacuole. In contrast, parasites treated with the protease inhibitor control E64 (\nFIG. 3B\n) show a swollen, dark-staining food vacuole, consistent with falcipain inhibition. Similarly, parasites treated with the protease inhibitor (drug moiety) present in Cmpd 72 also show a swollen, dark-staining food vacuole. See \nFIG. 3C\n. Treatment of parasites with the pro-moiety alone (Cmpd 58, Example 10) does not produce the protease-inhibited phenotype, as expected. See \nFIG. 3D\n. Finally, treatment of parasites with the prodrug Cmpd 72 does produce the falcipain-inhibited phenotype, consistent with successful release of the active protease inhibitor from the prodrug form.\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\nDemonstration of Fe\nII \nActivation and Drug Release In Vitro\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a series of experiments, the compound of Example 1 (0.03 mM) was incubated with various amounts (0-100 equivalents) of a ferrous iron salt (ferrous bromide) in a 1:1 solution of acetonitrile and an aqueous buffer at ambient temperature. Either of two buffers were used in these studies: pH 5.5 sodium acetate buffer intended to mimic a lysosomal environment or pH 7.4 phosphate buffered saline. At various time points, a 10 μl sample of the incubation mixture was removed and analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) to identify the expected products of iron-promoted degradation and drug release. A Waters Alliance/ZQ micromass LC/MS system and a 15 min method employing gradient elution with acetonitrile-water mobile phase (containing 0.1% formic acid) was employed. In the absence of ferrous iron salts, the compound of example 1 was stable for 48 hrs, showing no detectable chemical degradation by LC/MS spectroscopy. In the presence of ferrous bromide however, the compound of example 1 was rapidly (less than 1 hour) converted into the expected ketone (analogous to G, \nFIG. 2\n) resulting from iron-promoted degradation of the trioxolane ring. Also observed was a signal attributable to the released drug species, 2,5-dichloroaniline. During the course of the experiment, the quantity of 2,5-dichloroaniline increased, which is consistent with the desired retro-Michael reaction (beta-elimination) releasing drug species.\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nEvaluation of Antimalarial Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nCultures of 3D7 and W2 strains of \nP. falciparum \nparasites were grown in purified human erythrocytes and synchronous cultures were placed into 96-well plates containing test compounds. After a 72 hr growth period, cultures were fixed for 1 hr at room temperature in 1% paraformaldehyde and stained with 50 nM YOYO-1 for about 24 hr in the dark. Samples were analyzed on a Becton-Dickinson LSR2 fitted with a microplate reader. Uninfected erythrocytes were used to determine background autofluorescence. Parasite growth in each sample was determined relative to infected erythrocytes without test compound. Eight-point dose-response curves were generated and EC\n50 \nvalues determined using Graphpad Prism® software. The EC\n50 \nvalues (nM) for the compounds of examples 1, 2, 4, and 5 are provided in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntimalarial activity (EC\n50 \nin nM) of selected compounds described\n\n\n\n\n\n\nherein against 3D7 and W2 strains of \nP.\n \nfalciparum\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure\n\n\n(Example)\n\n\n3D7 strain\n\n\nW2 strain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40 (1)\n\n\n16\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45 (2)\n\n\n9.0\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46 (3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n47 (4) \n\n\n16\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48 (5)\n\n\n38\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49 (6)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n51 (7)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n53 (8)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n57 (9) \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61 (11) \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n64 (12) \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n72 (13) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\nFluorescence Microscopy Studies\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to further study the fate of fragmenting compounds as described herein within cultured parasites, fluorescence microscopy studies can be conducted. For example, the 4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3,-diazole (NBD) fluorophore has been used previously in studies of artemisinin (Stocks et al., 2007\n, Angewandte Chemie International Edition, \n46(33):6278-6283.) and remains fluorescent over a wide pH range, including the acidic pH (˜5) of the \nP. falciparum \nfood vacuole. Microscopes, and techniques thereof, most relevant to the experiments to be conducted include an inverted epifluorescence microscope optimized for time lapse imaging, and a spinning disk confocal microscope. Both microscopes can be equipped with temperature-, humidity-, and CO\n2\n-controlled incubators, and both have been used successfully for imaging \nP. falciparum\n-infected erythrocytes. The epifluorescence microscope can have, for example, a hardware autofocus system (Nikon Perfect Focus) and be optimized for long-term time lapse imaging. The confocal microscope can be optimized, for example, for high detection sensitivity, with a back-thinned EMCCD camera (Photometrics Cascade II) which can be useful for observing the more subtle effects of biological action of compounds on cultured parasites. Additional studies can involve combinations of compounds as described herein and iron chelating reagents. The fluorescence, or lack thereof, of \nP. falciparum\n-infected cells pre-treated with iron chelating reagents prior to contact with fluorophoric compounds described herein can demonstrate the specific role of iron in the scission of the prodrug.\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\nEvaluations of Morphologies of Malaria Parasites\n\n\n \n \n \nFragmentation of compounds described herein within parasites can be detected by observation of characteristic morphological changes produced by the antimalarial component of the compound released within the parasite. The success of this approach would require that 1) the intact prodrug does not itself possess the secondary activity, and 2) the drug, once released and free of the prodrug, can produce an interpretable morphology even in the presence of trioxolane-derived activity. Exemplary morphological change include, but are not limited to, swollen food vacuoles, which are indicative of inhibition of falcipains, and multiple vesicles within the food vacuole. These class-specific morphological effects can be exploited to observe prodrug fragmentation in cultured parasites. The results can be confirmed by testing such prodrugs in a biochemical assay. In further investigations, synchronized parasite cultures can be incubated with test prodrugs as described herein for different intervals during different portions of the 48 hour \nP. falciparum \nlife cycle. At various time points thin smears can be prepared, fixed with methanol, and stained with Giemsa, as known in the art. Visualization of fixed smears can be accomplished with a bright field microscope with oil immersion lens (100×). Morphologies can be compared with those of control parasites incubated with equal concentrations of vehicle, for example DMSO (usually 0.1%, which has no obvious impact on cultured parasites) and with artemisinin, chloroquine, and other drugs known in the art. The observation of a falcipain-inhibited morphology in such experiments can provide evidence for prodrug fragmentation. Finally, the use of iron chelating reagents like deferipone (DFP) can be used to block trioxolane activation, thereby providing an additional control that can greatly aid in the interpretation of experimental results. Thus, successful fragmentation of prodrug is expected to produce a food vacuole morphology in cultured parasites. However, this morphology should not be observed in the case of prior treatment with an iron chelator, since trioxolane activation and subsequent fragmentation would be blocked.\n\n\n \nExample 19\n\n\nAvailability of Parasites with Varied Sensitivity to Aminoquinolines and Cystein Protease Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nFor proof-of-concept for treatment using compounds described herein, studies can be conducted to evaluate the relative sensitivity to compounds and components thereof of parasites with known sensitivities to antimalarial drugs. For example, parasites with varied sensitivity to trioxolanes can be evaluated as they become available. Furthermore, for aminoquinolines, the sensitivities of available isolates to chloroquine, amodiaquine, piperaquine, and others varies widely, and has been catalogued for many strains. A large number of characterized strains are available for example from the Malaria Reagent Repository (MR4) including culture-adapted strains from Uganda, an area with high-level aminoquinoline resistance, which have recently become available."
