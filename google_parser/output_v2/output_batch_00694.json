Description\n\n\n\n\n BICYCLiC HETEROCYCLIC DERIVATIVES AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to novel Sicyclic Heterocyclic Derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the Bicyclic Heterocyclic Derivatives and the use of these compounds for treating or preventing treating allergy, an allergy- induced airway response, congestion, a cardiovascular disease, an inflammatory disease, a gastrointestinal disorder, a neurological disorder, a cognitive disorder, a metabolic disorder, obesity or an obesity-related disorder, diabetes, a diabetic complication, impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTtON\n\n\nThe histamine receptors, Hi , H2 and H3 are well-identified forms. The Hi receptors are those that mediate the response antagonized by conventional antihistamines. Hi receptors are present, for example, in the ileum, the skin, and the bronchial smooth muscle of humans and other mammals. Through H2 receptor- mediated responses, histamine stimulates gastric acid secretion in mammals and the chronotropic effect in isolated mammalian atria.\n\n\nH3 receptor sites are found on sympathetic nerves, where they modulate sympathetic neurotransmission and attenuate a variety of end organ responses under control of the sympathetic nervous system. Specifically, H3 receptor activation by histamine attenuates norepinephrine outflow to resistance and capacitance vessels, causing vasodilation.\n\n\nImidazole H3 receptor antagonists are well known in the art. More recently, non-imidazoie H3 receptor antagonists have been disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,720,328 and 6,849,621 ,\n\n\nU.S. Patent No. 5,869,479 discloses compositions for the treatment of the symptoms of allergic rhinitis using a combination of at least one histamine H\n1\n receptor antagonist and at least one histamine H\n3\n receptor antagonist. \n\n Diabetes refers to a disease process derived from multiple causative factors and is characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose, or hyperglycemia in the fasting state or after administration of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test. Persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated with alterations of the lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein metabolism and other metabolic and hemodynamic disease. As such, the diabetic patient is at an especially increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications, Including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Accordingly, therapeutic control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.\n\n\nThere are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), patients produce little or no insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. In type 2 diabetes, or noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), patients often have plasma insulin levels that are the same or even elevated compared to nondiabetic subjects; however, these patients have developed a resistance to the insulin stimulating effect on glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissue (muscle, fiver and adipose tissue), and the plasma insulin levels, while elevated, are insufficient to overcome the pronounced insulin resistance.\n\n\nInsulin resistance is not associated with a diminished number of insulin receptors but rather to a post-insulin receptor binding defect that is not well understood. This resistance to insulin responsiveness results in insufficient insulin activation of glucose uptake, oxidation and storage in muscle, and inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in the liver.\n\n\nThe avaifable treatments for type 2 diabetes, which have not changed substantially in many years, have recognized limitations. While physical exercise and reductions in dietary intake of calories will dramatically improve the diabetic condition, compliance with this treatment is very poor because of well-entrenched \n\n sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption, especially of foods containing high amounts of saturated fat. increasing the plasma level of insulin by administration of sulfonylureas (e.g. tolbutamide and glipizide) or rneglitinide, which stimulate the pancreatic [betaj-cells to secrete more insulin, and/or by injection of insulin when sulfonylureas or meglitinide become ineffective, can result in insulin concentrations high enough to stimulate the very insulin-resistant tissues. However, dangerously low levels of plasma glucose can result from administration of insulin or insulin secretagogues {sulfonylureas or meglitinide), and an increased level of insulin resistance due to the even higher plasma insulin levels can occur. The biguanides are a class of agents that can increase insulin sensitivity and bring about some degree of correction of hyperglycemia. However, the biguanides can induce lactic acidosis and nausea/diarrhea.\n\n\nThe giitazones (Le. 5-benzyfthiazolidine-2,4-diones) are a separate class of compounds with potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These agents increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of type 2 diabetes, resulting in partial or complete correction of the elevated plasma levels of glucose without occurrence of hypoglycemia. The giitazones that are currently marketed are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), primarily the PPAR-gamma subtype. PPAR-gamma agonism is generally believed to be responsible for the improved insulin sensititization that is observed with the giitazones. Newer PPAR agonists that are being tested for treatment of type 2 diabetes are agonists of the alpha, gamma or delta subtype, or a combination of these, and in many cases are chemically different from the giitazones {i.e., they are not thiazolidinediones). Serious side effects {e.g. liver toxicity) have been noted in some patients treated with glttazone drugs, such as troglitazone.\n\n\nAdditional methods of treating the disease are currently under investigation, New biochemical approaches include treatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g. acarbose) and protein tyrosine phosphatase- 1 B (PTP-1B) inhibitors.\n\n\nCompounds that are inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme are also under investigation as drugs that may be useful in the treatment of diabetes, and particularly type 2 diabetes. \n\n Despite a widening body of knowledge concerning the treatment of diabetes, there remains a need in the art for small-molecule drugs with increased safety profiles and/or improved efficacy that are useful for the treatment of diabetes and related metabolic diseases. This invention addresses that need.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention provides Compounds of Formula (I) (also referred to herein as the \"Bicyclic Heterocyclic Derivatives\");\n\n\n \n\n and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs thereof, wherein: each occurrence of W is independently a bond, alkylene, -O-, -CH(OH)-, - C(O)-, -NHC(O)-, -C(O)NH-, -NHS(O)\n2\n-, -S(O)\n2\nNH- or -NH-; each occurrence of Q is independently is H, halo, aikyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, heterocycloaikenyl, heteroaryl, haloalkyl, -alkylene-aryl, - OH, -NO\n2\n or -CN, wherein a aryl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, heterocycioalkenyl or heteroaryl group can be optionally substituted with R\n2\n;\n\n\nX\n1\n, X\n2\n, X\n3\n and X\n4\n are each independently -N- or -C(-W-Q)-, such that at least one of X\n1\n , X\n2\n, X\n3\n and X\n4\n is -N-;\n\n\nX\n5\n and X\n6\n are each independently -N-, -N-oxide- or -CH-; Y is -O- , -S-, -S(O)-, -S(O)\n2\n- or -N-;\n\n\nR\n1\n is cycloalkyl, cycioalkenyl, heterocycloalkyl or heterocycioalkenyl, any of which can be unsubstituted or substituted with R\n2\n, such that when R\n1\n is heterocycloalkyl or heterocycioalkenyl and X\n6\n is N, then R\n1\n is joined to X\n6\n via a ring carbon atom; \n\n each occurrence of R\n2\n represents up to 3 substituents, which can be the same or different, and are selected from halo, alkyl, -OR\n3\n, ~N(R\n3\n)\n2\n-> -CN, -NO\n2\n, -NHC(O)- alkyl, -C(O)N(R\n3\n)\n2\n, heteroaryf, haioalkyl, aikenyt, -C(O)-R\n3\n or hydroxyaikyl; and each occurrence of R\n3\n is independently H, alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl or heteroaryl.\n\n\nThe Compounds of Formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, prodrugs and esters thereof can be useful for treating or preventing allergy, an allergy-induced airway response, congestion, a cardiovascular disease, an inflammatory disease, a gastrointestinal disorder, a neurological disorder, a cognitive disorder, a metabolic disorder, obesity or an obesity-related disorder, diabetes, a diabetic complication, impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose (each being a \"Condition\") in a patient.\n\n\nAlso provided by the invention are methods for treating or preventing Condition in a patient, comprising administering to the patient an effective amount of one or more compounds of Formula (I).\n\n\nIn addition, the present invention provides methods for treating or preventing Condition in a patient, comprising administering to the patient one or more Compounds of Formula (I) and an additional therapeutic agent that is not a Compound of Formula (I), wherein the amounts administered are together effective to treat or prevent the Condition.\n\n\nThe present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective amount of one or more compounds of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

In the methods of this invention wherein a combination of an H3 antagonist of this invention (compound of formula I) is administered with a H\n1\n antagonist, the antagonists can be administered simultaneously or sequentially (first one and then the other over a period of time). In general, when the antagonists are administered sequentially, the H\n3\n antagonist of this invention (compound of formula 1} is administered first. The doses and dosage regimen of the other agents used in the combination therapies of the present invention for the treatment or prevention of a Condition can be determined by the attending clinician, taking into consideration the the approved doses and dosage regimen in the package insert; the age, sex and general health of the patient; and the type and severity of the viral infection or related disease or disorder. When administered in combination, the Compound(s) of Formula (1) and the other agent(s) for treating diseases or conditions listed above can be administered simultaneously or sequentially. This is particularly useful when the components of the combination are given on different dosing schedules, e.g., one component is administered once daily and another every six hours, or when the preferred pharmaceutical compositions are different, \n\n e.g. one is a tablet and one is a capsule. A kit comprising the separate dosage forms is therefore advantageous.\n\n\nGenerally, a total daily dosage of the one or more Compounds of Formula (I) and the additional therapeutic agent(s)can when administered as combination therapy, range from about 0.1 to about 2000 mg per day, although variations will necessarily occur depending on the target of the therapy, the patient and the route of administration. In one embodiment, the dosage is from about 0.2 to about 100 mg/day, administered in a single dose or in 2-4 divided doses. In another embodiment, the dosage is from about 1 to about 500 mg/day, administered in a single dose or in 2-4 divided doses. In another embodiment, the dosage is from about 1 to about 200 mg/day, administered in a single dose or in 2-4 divided doses. In still another embodiment, the dosage is from about 1 to about 100 mg/day, administered in a single dose or in 2-4 divided doses. In yet another embodiment, the dosage is from about 1 to about 50 mg/day, administered in a single dose or in 2-4 divided doses. In a further embodiment, the dosage is from about 1 to about 20 mg/day, administered in a single dose or in 2-4 divided doses.\n\n\nCompositions and Administration\n\n\nFor preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid.
