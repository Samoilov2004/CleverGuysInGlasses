Field of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a pharmaceutical, more particularly to a multi-cyclic cinnamide derivative and an amyloid-β (hereinafter referred to as Aβ) production inhibitor comprising the derivative as an active ingredient, which are effective for treatment of a neurodegenerative disease caused by Aβ such as Alzheimer's disease or Down's syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Description of Related Art\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlzheimer's disease is a disease characterized by degeneration and loss of neurons as well as formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary degeneration. Currently, Alzheimer's disease is treated only with symptomatic treatment using a symptom improving agent typified by an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and a fundamental remedy to inhibit progression of the disease has not yet been developed. It is necessary to develop a method for controlling the cause of the onset of pathology in order to create a fundamental remedy for Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is assumed that Aβ-proteins as metabolites of amyloid precursor proteins (hereinafter referred to as APP) are highly involved in degeneration and loss of neurons and onset of symptoms of dementia (see Klein W L, and seven others, Alzheimer's disease-affected brain: Presence of oligomeric Aβ ligands (ADDLs) suggests a molecular basis for reversible memory loss, Proceeding National Academy of Science USA 2003, Sep. 2; 100(18), p. 10417-10422; and Nitsch R M, and sixteen others, Antibodies against β-amyloid slow cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, Neuron, 2003, May 22; 38, p. 547-554, for example). An Aβ-protein has, as main components, Aβ40 consisting of 40 amino acids and Aβ42 in which the number of amino acids is increased by two at the C-terminal. The Aβ40 and Aβ42 are known to have high aggregability (see Jarrett J T, and two others, The carboxy terminus of the β amyloid protein is critical for the seeding of amyloid formation: Implications for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Biochemistry, 1993, 32(18), p. 4693-4697, for example) and to be main components of senile plaques (see Jarrett J T, and two others, The carboxy terminus of the β amyloid protein is critical for the seeding of amyloid formation: Implications for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Biochemistry, 1993, 32(18), p. 4693-4697; Glenner G G, and one other, Alzheimer's disease: initial report of the purification and characterization of a novel cerebrovascular amyloid protein, Biochemical and biophysical research communications, 1984, May 16, 120(3), p. 885-890; and Masters C L, and five others, Amyloid plaque core protein in Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome, Proceeding National Academy of Science USA, 1985, June, 82(12), p. 4245-4249, for example). Further, it is known that the Aβ40 and Aβ42 are increased by mutation in APP and presenilin genes which is observed in familial Alzheimer's disease (see Gouras G K, and eleven others, Intraneuronal Aβ42 accumulation in human brain, American Journal of Pathology, 2000, January, 156(1), p. 15-20; Scheuner D, and twenty others, Secreted amyloid J-protein similar to that in the senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease is increased in vivo by the presenilin 1 and 2 and APP mutations linked to familial Alzheimer's disease, Nature Medicine, 1996, August, 2(8), p. 864-870; and Forman M S, and four others, Differential effects of the swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein on β-amyloid accumulation and secretion in neurons and nonneuronal cells, The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 1997, Dec. 19, 272(51), p. 32247-32253, for example). Accordingly, a compound that reduces production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 has been expected as a progression inhibitor or prophylactic agent for Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAβ is produced by cleaving APP by β-secretase and subsequently by γ-secretase. For this reason, attempts have been made to create γ-secretase and β-secretase inhibitors in order to reduce Aβ production. Many of these secretase inhibitors already known are, for example, peptides and peptide mimetics such as L-685,458 (see Shearman M S, and nine others, L-685,458, an Aspartyl Protease Transition State Mimic, Is a Potent Inhibitor of Amyloid β-Protein Precursor γ-Secretase Activity, Biochemistry, 2000, Aug. 1, 39(30), p. 8698-8704, for example) and LY-411575 (see Shearman M S, and six others, Catalytic Site-Directed γ-Secretase Complex Inhibitors Do Not Discriminate Pharmacologically between Notch S3 and β-APP Cleavages, Biochemistry, 2003, Jun. 24, 42(24), p. 7580-7586; Lanz T A, and three others, Studies of Aβ pharmacodynamics in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma in young (plaque-free) Tg2576 mice using the γ-secretase inhibitor N2-[(2S)-2-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethanoyl]-N1-[(7S)-5-methyl-6-oxo-6,7-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,d]azepin-7-yl]-L-alaninamide (LY-411575), The journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics, 2004, April, 309(1), p. 49-55; and Wong G T, and twelve others, Chronic treatment with the γ-secretase inhibitor LY-411,575 inhibits β-amyloid peptide production and alters lymphopoiesis and intestinal cell differentiation, The journal of biological chemistry, 2004, Mar. 26, 279(13), p. 12876-12882, for example). WO 2004/110350 describes, as nonpeptide compounds, a group of compounds having multiple aromatic rings, but the compounds of formula (VI) at page 17 of WO 2004/110350 are different from the compounds of the present invention in that they are limited only to a group of compounds having 2-aminothiazolyl group as the main structure.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAs described above, a compound that inhibits production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 from APP has been expected as a therapeutic or prophylactic agent for a disease caused by Aβ which is typified by Alzheimer's disease. However, a nonpeptidic compound having high efficacy which inhibits production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 has not yet been known. Accordingly, there is a need for a novel low-molecular-weight compound that inhibits production of Aβ40 and Aβ42.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result of extensive studies, the present inventors have found a nonpeptidic cinnamide compound that inhibits production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 from APP for the first time, and thus found a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for a disease caused by Aβ which is typified by Alzheimer's disease. This finding has led to the accomplishment of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, the present invention relates to the following 1) to 42):\n\n\n \n \n1) A compound represented by

Specifically, the embryos were aseptically removed from pregnant rats under ether anesthesia. The brain was isolated from the embryo and immersed in an ice-cold L-15 medium (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #11415-064, Carlsbad, Calif., USA, or SIGMA L1518, for example). The cerebral cortex was collected from the isolated brain under a stereoscopic microscope. The cerebral cortex fragments collected were enzymatically treated in an enzyme solution containing 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #15050-065, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) and 0.01% DNase (Sigma D5025, St. Louis, Mo., USA) at 37° C. for 30 minutes to disperse the cells. Here, the enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding inactivated horse serum to the solution. The enzymatically treated solution was centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for five minutes to remove the supernatant. 5 to 10 ml of a medium was added to the resulting cell mass. Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #21103-049, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) supplemented with 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #17504-044, Carlsbad, Calif., USA), 25 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME, WAKO Cat #139-06861, Osaka, Japan), 0.5 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #25030-081, Carlsbad, Calif., USA), and Antibiotics-Antimycotics (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #15240-062, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) was used as the medium (Neurobasal/B27/2-ME). However, the above Neurobasal medium not supplemented with 2-ME (Neurobasal/B27) was used for the assay. The cells were redispersed by mild pipetting of the cell mass to which the medium was added. The cell dispersion was filtered through a 40-μm nylon mesh (Cell Strainer, Cat #35-2340, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, N.J., USA) to remove the remaining cell mass, and thus a neuronal cell suspension was obtained. The neuronal cell suspension was diluted with the medium and then plated in a volume of 100 μl/well at an initial cell density of 5×10\n5 \ncells/cm\n2 \nin a 96-well polystyrene culture plate pre-coated with poly-L or D-lysine (Falcon Cat #35-3075, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, N.J., USA coated with poly-L-lysine using the method shown below, or BIOCOAT™ cell environments Poly-D-lysine cell ware 96-well plate, Cat #35-6461, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, N.J., USA). Poly-L-lysine coating was carried out as follows. 100 μg/ml of a poly-L-lysine (SIGMA P2636, St. Louis, Mo., USA) solution was aseptically prepared with a 0.15 M borate buffer (pH 8.5). 100 μl/well of the solution was added to the 96-well polystyrene culture plate and incubated at room temperature for one or more hours or at 4° C. overnight or longer. The coated 96-well polystyrene culture plate was washed with sterile water four or more times, and then dried or rinsed with, for example, sterile PBS or medium, and used for cell plating. The plated cells were cultured in the culture plate at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2\n-95% air for one day. Then, the total amount of the medium was replaced with a fresh Neurobasal™/B27/2-ME medium, and then the cells were cultured for further three days.\n\n\n \nAddition of Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nThe drug was added to the culture plate on Day 4 of culture as follows. The total amount of the medium was removed from the wells, and 180 μl/well of Neurobasal medium not containing 2-ME and containing 2% B-27 (Neurobasal/B27) was added thereto. A solution of the test compound in dimethyl sulfoxide (hereinafter abbreviated as DMSO) was diluted with Neurobasal/B27 at 10-fold of the final concentration. 20 μl/well of the dilution was added to and sufficiently mixed with the medium. The final DMSO concentration was 1% or less. Only DMSO was added to the control group.\n\n\n \nSampling\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cells were cultured for three days after addition of the compound, and the total amount of the medium was collected. The resulting medium was used as an ELISA sample. The sample was not diluted for ELISA measurement of Aβx-42 and diluted to 5-fold with a diluent supplied with an ELISA kit for ELISA measurement of Aβx-40.\n\n\n \nEvaluation of Cell Survival\n\n\n \n \n \nCell survival was evaluated by an MTT assay according to the following procedure. After collecting the medium, 1001/well of a pre-warmed medium was added to the wells. Further, 8 l/well of a solution of 8 mg/ml of MTT (SIGMA M2128, St. Louis, Mo., USA) in D-PBS(−) (Dulbecco's phosphate buffered Saline, SIGMA D8537, St. Louis, Mo., USA) was added to the wells. The 96-well polystyrene culture plate was incubated in an incubator at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2\n-95% air for 20 minutes. 1001/well of an MTT lysis buffer was added thereto, and MTT formazan crystals were sufficiently dissolved in the buffer in the incubator at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2\n-95% air. Then, the absorbance at 550 nm in each well was measured.

In early PCa, anti-androgen therapy (AAT) is almost universally effective. This consists of one or more combinations of GnRH agonists (to suppress pituitary signaling), aromatase inhibitors (to decrease androgen production), and competitive AR antagonists (to block AR directly) such as hydroxy-flutamide (OH—F) or bicalutamide (BiC). This strategy usually works for several years, but over time tumor cells evolve mechanisms for continued growth under these conditions of androgen depletion. Most recurrent, or hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) is nonetheless dependent on AR-mediated signaling. This can include upregulation of AR protein expression levels, acquisition of mutations within AR that increase its activity in response to alternative hormones (including antagonists), or upregulation of co-activator proteins that augment AR activity. Thus, it is likely that new approaches to block AR activity could significantly extend or increase the effectiveness of AAT. This could consist of better competitive antagonists, and considerable efforts from pharmaceutical companies are already being brought to bear on this approach. For example, pyrvinium has shown efficacy against tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in mouse models (see WO2006/078754 and \nCancer Cell \n2006, 10, 321). This implies that novel anti-androgens might have considerable utility in the treatment of both primary and recurrent PCa. Such anti-androgens might not be competitive antagonists that directly bind AR, and could conceivably function via inhibition of downstream events in AR signaling. Accordingly, there is a need for novel, potent anti-androgens. Surprisingly, this invention meets this, and other, needs.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the present invention provides a compound of Formula I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare each independently hydrogen or C\n1-6 \nalkyl.

Compound screening strategy. Novel inhibitors of AR conformation change were discovered by creating a HEK-293 (ATCC CRL-1573)-derived cell line stably expressing a CFP N-terminal and YFP C-terminal tagged AR vector that has been previously used to measure conformation change by FRET. C-AR-Y was stably expressed in either LAPC4 or HEK293 cell lines; in parallel, HEK293 cells were transfected with native AR along with MMTV-luciferase. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 10 nM DHT and one of 1040 FDA-approved drugs. The screen was performed in duplicate for each condition, and the top 50 compounds with activities in both trials were selected. Each of the top compounds was evaluated in detail with a dose-response study, and the “validated” compounds were compared across all assays. The validated hits accounted for approximately 40% of the hits initially identified for each screen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n. Analysis of hits. 1040 FDA-approved drugs were tested in three different assays, a transcription-based assay using HEK293 cells expressing MMTV-luciferase, conformation-based assays using HEK293/C-AR-Y stable cells, and LAPC4/C-AR-Y stable cells. Fewer compounds affected AR conformational change vs. transcriptional output. LAPC4 cells were the least sensitive to test compounds. High selectivity (<50 hits) was observed for the transcription assay when the cutoff was set between 5 and 6 standard deviations (SD) from the mean (as determined by multiple replicates of cells treated only with DHT). Similar selectivity was observed for the HEK293/C-AR-Y cells between 3 and 4 SD, whereas in the LAPC4/C-AR-Y cells such effects were observed between 2 and 3 SD from the mean. The transcriptional assay used in the screen had a Z-factor=0.6, vs. 0.6 for the LAPC4 FRET assay and 0.5 for the HEK293 FRET assay (Zhang, J. H., T. D. Chung, and K. R. Oldenburg, \nA Simple Statistical Parameter for Use in Evaluation and Validation of High Throughput Screening Assays\n. J Biomol Screen, 1999. 4(2): p. 67-73).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n. Characterization of hits in primary screen. (A) Hits that scored in the primary assays were ranked according to efficacy based on the average of duplicate readings, and the \ntop\n 50 from each assay was compared to the other two. In each case, a minority of compounds were shared between the assays, and most hits were unique to a particular system. (B) Validated hits were determined by detailed dose-response in the original assay used, and only compounds that exhibited pharmacologic effects were counted. These hits were then cross-compared to the other screening assays, using a dose-response. In this secondary analysis, the majority of hits from any one assay were also effective in another assay system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n. Pyrvinium pamoate (PP) exhibits identical responses vs. pyrvinium chloride (PCl). Anion exchange was used to replace the pamoate salt with a chloride ion. The resulting compound, PCl, had an identical dose-response vs. the parent compound in blocking PSA reporter activity in LAPC4 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n. PP and HH inhibit DHT-induced gene expression differently than a competitive antagonist. LNCaP cells transiently transfected with a PSA-luciferase reporter were exposed to OH—F, PP and HH. DHT was titrated. Whereas OH—F caused a modified DHT dose-response consistent with a competitive antagonist, PP and HH exhibited a pattern consistent with a non-competitive antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 6\n. PP and HH inhibit androgen-induced cell proliferation. PP, HH, and BiC were compared for their ability to inhibit androgen dependent and independent growth in several cultured cell lines: LNCaP, LAPC4, LN-AR (a line that exhibits androgen-independent growth), and HEK293 cells. PP and HH each exhibited growth-inhibitory properties in LNCaP cells, whereas HH was not effective in LAPC4 cells. Neither compound exhibited non-specific growth inhibition of HEK293 cells. Importantly, PP blocked growth of “hormone refractory” LN-AR cells. Asterisk (*)=p<0.005.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 7\n. PP synergistically reduces prostate size in mice. Cohorts of nine male mice were treated with PO gavage of BiC (100 mg/kg), IP injection of PP (1 mg/kg), or the combination for four weeks. As a positive control, nine mice were treated with castration for four weeks. Prostate glands were harvested and wet weights determined. PP alone did not significantly reduce prostate size. BiC treatment significantly reduced prostate weight by 35%, and the combination of PP:BiC reduced the weight by 63% (p<0.0005, t-test), implying a synergistic effect of PP. cntrl: untreated mice; BiC: bicalutamide; PP: pyrvinium pamoate; cast: castrated. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (S.E.M.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 8\n. PP suppresses androgen-dependent gene expression in the prostate, and augments BiC activity. Total RNA was extracted from prostate glands of cohorts of 9 mice used to test PP in vivo. qRT-PCR was performed to assess gene expression levels of five androgen-induced genes. Gene expression levels are expressed relative to RPL19, an androgen-unresponsive gene. PP significantly suppressed gene expression in all cases, and augmented the effects of BiC, with one exception (TMPRSS2), which may have been maximally suppressed by each treatment alone. cntrl: untreated; BiC: bicalutamide; PP: pyrvinium pamoate; cast: castrated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 9\n.

Administration to Inhibit an Androgen Receptor\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be administered as frequently as necessary, including hourly, daily, weekly or monthly. The compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of the invention are administered at the initial dosage of about 0.0001 mg/kg to about 1000 mg/kg daily. A daily dose range of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg, or about 0.1 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg, or about 1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, or about 10 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, can be used. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed. For example, dosages can be empirically determined considering the type and stage of disease diagnosed in a particular patient. The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration of a particular compound in a particular patient. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day, if desired. Doses can be given daily, or on alternate days, as determined by the treating physician. Doses can also be given on a regular or continuous basis over longer periods of time (weeks, months or years), such as through the use of a subdermal capsule, sachet or depot, or via a patch.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be administered to the patient in a variety of ways, including topically, parenterally, intravenously, intradermally, intramuscularly, colonically, rectally or intraperitoneally.

The additional anticancer drugs used in the combination protocols of the present invention can be administered separately or one or more of the anticancer drugs used in the combination protocols can be administered together, such as in an admixture. Where one or more anticancer drug is administered separately, the timing and schedule of administration of each drug can vary. The other therapeutic or diagnostic agents can be administered at the same time as the compounds of Formulas I or II, separately or at different times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula I can also be administered in combination with the compound of Formula II. Additional therapeutic agents or diagnostic agents can be administered in combination with the combination of Formulas I and II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be administered with a course of hormonal therapy. The compound for hormonal therapy includes, but is not limited to, an anti-androgen and a LnRH agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn clinical studies, number of lesions, tumor size, and tumor growth rate can be monitored by radiography, tomography, and, where possible, direct measurement of tumor mass. Anti-tumor effects can also be measured using molecular biology and biochemistry techniques, such as ELISA, PCR, western blotting, or immunocytochemistry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutically effective amount of a composition required as a dose will depend on the route of administration, the type of cancer being treated, and the physical characteristics of the patient. The dose can be tailored to achieve a desired effect, but will depend on such factors as body surface area, weight, diet, concurrent medication and other factors which those skilled in the medical arts will recognize.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing are general guidelines only that can be expanded or altered based on, for example, disease type and grade, patient age, health status, and sex, the particular drugs used in combination, the route and frequency of administration, and experimental and clinical findings using a multidrug combination.\n\n\n \nVII.

The library consisted of 1040 FDA-approved drugs and natural products. A basic strategy to select and compare compounds from each of the primary screens was established (\nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe transcription assay was conducted by transfecting 10 cm plates of HEK293 cells with plasmids encoding MMTV-luciferase, SV40-renilla luciferase, and native AR. These cells are useful because the limited transfection efficiency of prostate-derived cells increases the variability of the assay. The FRET assays were conducted using two independent cell lines, each stably expressing a CFP-AR-YFP fusion protein: HEK293/C-AR-Y and LAPC4/C-AR-Y. LAPC4 cells are a prostate derived line (Klein, K. A., et al., \nProgression of metastatic human prostate cancer to androgen independence in immunodeficient SCID mice\n. Nat Med, 1997. 3(4): p. 402-8). FRET is fluorescence resonance energy transfer between cyan and yellow fluorescent protein derivatives (CFP, YFP) that are fused to the amino and carboxyl termini of the human androgen receptor. When ligand activates the receptor, a conformational change takes place that brings the CFP and YFP into close proximity, thereby allowing FRET to occur. This spectroscopic change is detected using a fluorescence plate reader.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the transcription assay, transfected cells were pooled before being plated into 96-well dishes with the test compounds at 10 μM. On each plate was included “no DHT” and “no treatment” controls, as well as a positive control with 1 μM OH—F. For the FRET assays, cells were directly plated into the 96-well plates with the test compounds at 10 μM. Cell and compound transfers were accomplished with a liquid handling robot. Cells were cultured for 24 hours in the presence of 10 nM DHT and the test compounds. After 24 hours, cells were either lysed by freeze-thaw (transcription assay), or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for reading on the FPR (FRET assays). Each compound was tested in duplicate in the initial screen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds were sorted on the basis of anti-androgen effects. In order to be selected for further analysis, a test compound had to function in both of the replicates, and in each case had to reduce the signal by at least one standard deviation from the mean of samples treated with DHT alone. This eliminated situations in which one test gave a strong response, and the replicate had none. Lastly, there must have been no evidence of cell toxicity, for the transcription assays specifically tested for renilla luciferase (which is discriminated from firefly luciferase on the basis of substrate specificity), and compounds that reduced this signal below two standard deviations were eliminated. For the FRET assays, toxic compounds were easily detected because of their effect on raw CFP and YFP signal, and compounds that reduced this signal below two standard deviations were eliminated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis of hits from the primary screen. \nFIG. 2\n illustrates the results of the screen. The data clearly indicate that each assay system was capable of sorting compounds according to efficacy. Hits were sorted using different stringencies to determine the degree of variance from the mean that would be required to select a limited number of hits for each assay. The conformational assay, when used in either HEK293 or LAPC4 cells, achieved high selectivity using a lower stringency, whereas the transcription-based assay required higher degrees of stringency to achieve the same selectivity. Accordingly, conformational assays are less sensitive to non-specific cellular perturbation, whereas many compounds were capable of perturbing the transcriptional response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe top 50 compounds identified in each primary assay were then tested in the other two assays. Among the top hits in each assay that were not included for further analysis were all known anti-androgens from the library (hydroxy-flutamide, nilutamide, cyproterone, and cyproterone acetate), and certain steroid hormones that exhibit cross-reactivity with AR at micromolar concentrations. A Venn diagram illustrates that there was modest overlap between the primary assays: approximately 20-30% of hits that scored in one assay also scored in another assay (\nFIG. 3\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine “validated” hits, the top 50 compounds were re-tested with titration studies in the original assays in which they were detected, and selected only those that exhibited a classic dose-response pattern. When validated hits from each assay were compared for activity in the others, a much higher proportion of compounds (approximately 55-82%) scored positive in at least one other assay than in the primary screen. Few compounds (3) scored positive in all three assays. This is consistent with the idea that each screening approach has the potential to identify compounds with efficacy across assays, but that it also might add a new dimension to drug discovery. Importantly, among the small number of validated hits, it was discovered that one compound in the HEK293 FRET assay, and three compounds in the LAPC4 FRET assay that initially did not meet selection criteria in the HEK293 primary transcription assay, but which showed inhibition of AR-mediated transcription upon subsequent careful analysis. Accordingly, the FRET assays can augment drug discovery vs. transcription assays alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdentification of novel anti-androgens. Several lead compounds survived the stringent screening protocol, and three classes with previously unrecognized anti-androgen activity: the coumarins, including warfarin, scopoletin, and esculin; harmol hydrochloride, a natural product (HH); and an FDA-approved anti-helminthic, pyrvinium pamoate (PP).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo evaluate the efficacy of pyrvinium and harmol against endogenous AR activity, each compound was tested in a dose-response assay in two prostate cancer-derived cell lines, LAPC4 (Klein, K. A., et al., \nProgression of metastatic human prostate cancer to androgen independence in immunodeficient SCID mice\n. Nat Med, 1997. 3(4): p. 402-8), and LNCaP (Horoszewicz, J. S., et al., \nThe LNCaP cell line—a new model for studies on human prostatic carcinoma\n. Prog Clin Biol Res, 1980. 37: p. 115-32) that each express endogenous AR. LAPC4 cells express wild-type AR, whereas LNCaP cells, which are derived from hormone-refractory PCa, express AR with a mutation (T877A) that renders it responsive to a variety of ligands, including the antagonist hydroxy-flutamide (OH—F). Cells were transfected with two reporter plasmids, a PSA-luciferase construct (androgen responsive), and an SV40-renilla luciferase construct as an internal control. The following day, the cells were split and drugs added in the presence of 3 nM DHT. Luciferase production was measured the following day (Dual luciferase assay kit, Promega).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNo compounds had androgen activity in the absence of DHT in either the conformation or the transcription reporter assays, even at doses exceeding 10 μM. PP and HH were much more effective than the competitive antagonists OH—F and bicalutamide (BiC) at inhibiting reporter transcription (Table 1), so the anti-androgen characteristics of these compounds were studied further. Both PP and HH inhibited DHT-responsive gene expression with efficacies far superior to BiC (Table 1). To rule out the possibility that the pamoate salt of pyrvinium was mediating transcriptional inhibition, anion exchange (Dowex) was used to replace the pamoate with a chloride ion. Pyrvinium chloride was just as effective as pyrvinium pamoate (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 of various compounds identified in screens for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnovel anti-androgens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nActivity on\n\n\nActivity on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPSA-luciferase\n\n\nPSA-luciferase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n(nM)\n\n\nIC\n50\n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nLNCaP\n\n\nLAPC4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPP\n\n\n24\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHH\n\n\n127\n\n\n106\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOH-F\n\n\nagonist\n\n\n130\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCasodex\n\n\n585\n\n\n1,571\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEsculin\n\n\n62,159\n\n\n831\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nScopoletin\n\n\n603,586\n\n\n1,378\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWarfarin\n\n\n4,500\n\n\n1,954\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHarmine\n\n\n1,560\n\n\n80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHarmaline\n\n\n1,190\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHarman\n\n\n380\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNorharman\n\n\n2,500\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPP = pyrvinium pamoate;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHH = harmol hydrochloride;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOH-F = hydroxy-flutamide;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBiC = bicalutamide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nnd = no data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nAssay for Inhibition of an Androgen Receptor\n\n\n \n \n \nThe assay below demonstrates that the compounds identified in Example 2 inhibit endogenous androgen receptor gene expression and are not competitive antagonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo confirm that the effects of the lead compounds hold true for endogenous AR-regulated gene expression, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to monitor effects on a select number of androgen-responsive genes in LAPC4 and LNCaP cells.

RNA was harvested using an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed (MMLV-RT, Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was carried out on a 7300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR green as the detecting dye and Rox as the reference dye.

KLK3, Nk×3.1, TMPRSS2, and FKBP51 were all induced by treatment with DHT, and this induction was inhibited to varying degrees by BiC, PP, and HH. Likewise, MMP-16 and RDC-1 were repressed by treatment with DHT, and the repression was lifted to varying degrees by all of the AR inhibitors. Table 2 summarizes the results from 3 or 4 separate qRT-PCR experiments in each cell type. Two genes known to be induced by DHT in LNCaPs, Nk×3.1 and TMPRSS2, were not significantly induced in LAPC4 cells.

As a first step to determine whether PP and HH function as competitive or noncompetitive antagonists of AR, DHT was titrated in LNCaP cells transiently transfected with a PSA-luciferase reporter, and treated with a moderate dose of each inhibitor. DHT overcame the inhibitory effect of OH—F, producing maximal activation. By contrast, both PP and HH inhibited maximal DHT-induced activation, despite very high final DHT concentrations (\nFIG. 5\n). This was consistent with activity as non-competitive antagonists.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nSynergistic Behavior of PP, HH and BiC\n\n\n \n \n \nThe presence of synergy in the use of PP, HH and BiC as androgen receptor antagonists is confirmed using the procedure below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe existence of synergy between the lead compounds and BiC was tested for using LAPC4 and LNCaP cells. When added in various combinations to LNCaP and LAPC4 cells transfected with the PSA-luciferase, both PP and HH synergized with each other, and with BiC (Table 3). Synergism can be defined as a combination index of less than one, using the non-exclusive assumption described by Chou et al. (Chou, T. C. and P. Talalay, \nQuantitative analysis of dose\n-\neffect relationships: the combined effects of multiple drugs or enzyme inhibitors\n. Adv Enzyme Regul, 1984. 22: p. 27-55). The synergy between PP, HH, and BiC is indicates that they function by distinct mechanisms.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynergy between PP, HH and BiC.

D., et al., \nMolecular determinants of resistance to antiandrogen therapy\n. Nat Med, 2004. 10(1): p. 33-9). HEK293 cells were used as a control. Cells were transferred to charcoal-stripped media two days before they were split and plated in quadruplicate at a density of approximately 20,000 cells/well in 48-well plates. The following day, medium with or without 3 nM DHT was added to the cells with or without PP (100 nM), HH (100 nM), or BiC (1 μM). Media were changed every day, using a single preparation to ensure consistent compound concentrations. Proliferation was determined by measuring the DNA content of the cells in each well. Each day, the cells in four wells were fixed in 100% cold methanol, followed by staining for 5 min at RT with 0.2 ng/\nmL\n 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS. The cells were washed once in PBS, then read on a fluorescence plate reader using 365/439 excitation/emission wavelengths. LAPC4 and LNCaP cells proliferated to a much greater degree in the presence of DHT, while LN-AR cells proliferated in the presence and absence of DHT. PP was the only compound able to inhibit the growth of all four cell lines after seven days, while HH and BiC only inhibited significantly the growth of LNCaP cells. Control HEK293 cells were not significantly affected by any of the compounds, suggesting that none of them has non-specific growth-inhibitory effects. PP and HH worked at least as well as BiC to block androgen-induced proliferation (\nFIG. 6\n).\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nPharmacokinetics and Toxicity of Compounds in Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-androgen activity of PP and HH in mice were determined using the procedure set forth below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWild-type FVB mice were given a single intraperitoneal injection of either PP or HH. Serum samples were obtained at fixed time intervals, and the drug levels determined by mass spectrometry. These results indicated that HH was rapidly cleared. PP exhibited a prolonged half-life indicating that it could be a suitable therapy (Table 4). Toxicity of PP was tested using various doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. 10 mg/kg was toxic, while the mice tolerated 5 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetics of PP vs. HH.

As a positive control, one cohort was castrated four weeks prior to tissue recovery, one cohort was untreated, and the other cohorts were treated either with 1 mg/kg PP, 100 mg/kg BiC, or PP/BiC in combination. Animals were treated 5 times per week for four weeks. At the end of the study period, animals were sacrificed and prostate tissue weighed. After weighing, the tissue was divided in half for pathological and genetic studies. BiC treatment decreased prostate tissue size by 35% (p<0.003). Treatment with PP:BiC caused a further reduction by 63% that was highly significant vs. the effect of BiC alone (P<0.0005). PP alone did not produce a statistically significant effect. (\nFIG. 7\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPP synergizes with BiC in vivo to inhibit androgen-dependent prostate gene expression. To evaluate the effect of PP and PP:BiC on androgen-dependent gene expression in the prostate, total RNA was prepared from half of the prostate glands isolated in the in vivo trial. RT-PCR was carried out, and gene expression was determined relative to RPL19, an endogenous prostate gene that is completely androgen unresponsive (E. Bolton, K. R. Yamamoto: unpublished data). Five androgen-responsive genes that are expressed throughout all lobes of the mouse prostate were evaluated. In each case, it was observed that PP and BiC reduced gene expression significantly, but their combination was superior. In most cases, the combination approached that of castrated animals (\nFIG. 8\n). Taken together with the preceding experiment, PP exerts anti-androgen effects, and synergy with BiC as an anti-androgen in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, one of skill in the art will appreciate that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.
