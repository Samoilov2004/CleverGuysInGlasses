In most mammals, including humans and mice, antibodies are constructed from paired heavy and light polypeptide chains. Each chain is made up of individual immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, and thus the generic term immunoglobulin is used for such proteins. Each chain is made up of two distinct regions, referred to as the variable and constant regions. The light and heavy chain variable regions show significant sequence diversity between antibodies, and are responsible for binding the target antigen. The constant regions show less sequence diversity, and are responsible for binding a number of natural proteins to elicit important biochemical events. In humans there are five different classes of antibodies including IgA (which includes subclasses IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, IgE, IgG (which includes subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4), and IgM. The distinguishing features between these antibody classes are their constant regions, although subtler differences may exist in the V region. \nFigure 1\n shows an IgG1 antibody, used here as an example to describe the general structural features of immunoglobulins. IgG antibodies are tetrameric proteins composed of two heavy chains and two light chains. The IgG heavy chain is composed of four immunoglobulin domains linked from N- to C-terminus in the order V\nH\n-C\ny\n1-C\ny\n2-C\ny\n3, referring to the heavy chain variable domain, \nconstant gamma\n 1 domain, \nconstant gamma\n 2 domain, and \nconstant gamma\n 3 domain respectively. The IgG light chain is composed of two immunoglobulin domains linked from N- to C-terminus in the order V\nL\n-C\nL\n, referring to the light chain variable domain and the light chain constant domain respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe variable region of an antibody contains the antigen binding determinants of the molecule, and thus determines the specificity of an antibody for its target antigen. The variable region is so named because it is the most distinct in sequence from other antibodies within the same class. The majority of sequence variability occurs in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). There are 6 CDRs total, three each per heavy and light chain, designated V\nH\n GDR1, V\nH\n CDR2, V\nH\n CDR3, V\nL\n CDR1, V\nL\n CDR2, and V\nL\n CDR3. The variable region outside of the CDRs is referred to as the framework (FR) region. Although not as diverse as the CDRs, sequence variability does occur in the FR region between different antibodies. Overall, this characteristic architecture of antibodies provides a stable scaffold (the FR region) upon which substantial antigen binding diversity (the CDRs) can be explored by the immune system to obtain specificity for a broad array of antigens. A number of high-resolution structures are available for a variety of variable region fragments from different organisms, some unbound and some in complex with antigen. The sequence and structural features of antibody variable regions are well characterized (\nMorea et al., 1997, Biophys Chem 68:9-16\n; \nMorea et al., 2000, Methods 20:267-279\n), and the conserved features of antibodies have enabled the development of a wealth of antibody engineering techniques (\nMaynard et al., 2000, Annu Rev Biomed Eng 2:339-376\n). For example, it is possible to graft the CDRs from one antibody, for example a murine antibody, onto the framework region of another antibody, for example a human antibody. This process, referred to in the art as \"humanization\", enables generation of less immunogenic antibody therapeutics from nonhuman antibodies. Fragments comprising the variable region can exist in the absence of other regions of the antibody, including for example the antigen binding fragment (Fab) comprising V\nH\n-Cγ1 and V\nH\n-C\nL\n, the variable fragment (Fv) comprising V\nH\n and V\nL\n, the single chain variable fragment (scFv) comprising V\nH\n and V\nL\n linked together in the same chain, as well as a variety of other variable region fragments (\nLittle et al., 2000, Immunol Today 21:364-370\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fc region of an antibody interacts with a number of Fc receptors and ligands, imparting an array of important functional capabilities referred to as effector functions. For IgG the Fc region, as shown In \nFigure 1\n, comprises Ig domains Cγ2 and Cγ3 and the N-terminal hinge leading into Cγ2. An important family of Fc receptors for the IgG class are the Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs). These receptors mediate communication between antibodies and the cellular arm of the immune system (\nRaghavan et al., 1996, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12:181-220\n; \nRavetch et al., 2001, Annu Rev Immunol 19:275-290\n). In humans this protein family includes FcγRI (CD64), including isoforms FcγRIa, FcγRIb, and FcγRIc; FcγRII (CD32), including isoforms FcγRIIa (including allotypes H131 and R131), FcγRIIb (including FcγRIIb-1 and FcγRIIb-2), and FcγRIIc; and FcγRIII (CD16), including isoforms FcγRIIIa (including allotypes V158 and F158) and FcγRIIIb (including allotypes FcγRIIIb-NA1 and FcγRIIIb-NA2) (\nJefferis et al., 2002, Immunol Lett 82:57-65\n). These receptors typically have an extracellular domain that mediates binding to Fc, a membrane spanning region, and an intracellular domain that may mediate some signaling event within the cell. These receptors are expressed in a variety of immune cells including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, B cells, large granular lymphocytes, Langerhans' cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and γγ T cells. Formation of the Fc/FcγR complex recruits these effector cells to sites of bound antigen, typically resulting in signaling events within the cells and important subsequent immune responses such as release of inflammation mediators, B cell activation, endocytosis, phagocytosis, and cytotoxic attack. The ability to mediate cytotoxic and phagocytic effector functions is a potential mechanism by which antibodies destroy targeted cells. The cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (\nRaghavan et al., 1996, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12:181-220\n; \nGhetie et al., 2000, Annu Rev Immunol 18:739-766\n; \nRavetch et al., 2001, Annu Rev Immunol 19:275-290\n). The cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP). A number of structures have been solved of the extracellular domains of human FcγRs, including FcγRIIa (pdb accession code 1H9V)(\nSondermann et al., 2001, J Mol Biol 309:737-749\n) (\npdb accession code\n 1 FCG)(\nMaxwell et al., 1999, Nat Struct Biol 6:437-442\n), FcγRIIb (pdb accession code 2FCB)(\nSondermann et al., 1999, Embo J 18:1095-1103\n); and FcγRIIIb (\npdb accession code\n 1 E4J)(\nSondermann et al., 2000, Nature 406:267-273\n.). All FcγRs bind the same region on Fc, at the N-terminal end of the Cγ2 domain and the preceding hinge, shown in \nFigure 2\n. This interaction is well characterized structurally (\nSondermann et al., 2001, J Mol Biol 309:737-749\n), and several structures of the human Fc bound to the extracellular domain of human FcγRIIIb have been solved (\npdb accession code\n 1 E4K)(\nSondermann et al., 2000, Nature 406:267-273\n.) (pdb accession codes 1IIS and 1IIX)(\nRadaev et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:16469-16477\n), as well as has the structure of the human IgE Fc/Fc□RI□ complex (\npdb accession code\n 1 F6A)(\nGarman et al., 2000, Nature 406:259-266\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe different IgG subclasses have different affinities for the FcγRs, with IgG1 and IgG3 typically binding substantially better to the receptors than IgG2 and IgG4 (\nJefferis et al., 2002, Immunol Lett 82:57-65\n). All FcγRs bind the same region on IgG Fc, yet with different affinities: the high affinity binder FcγRI has a Kd for IgG1 of 10\n-8\n M\n-1\n, whereas the low affinity receptors FcγRII and FcγRIII generally bind at 10\n-6\n and 10\n-5\n respectively. The extracellular domains of FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIIb are 96% identical, however FcγRIIIb does not have a intracellular signaling domain. Furthermore, whereas FcγRI, FcγRIIa/c, and FcγRIIIa are positive regulators of immune complex-triggered activation, characterized by having an intracellular domain that has an Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), FcγRIIb has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and is therefore inhibitory. Thus the former are referred to as activation receptors, and FcγRIIb is referred to as an inhibitory receptor. The receptors also differ in expression pattern and levels on different immune cells. Yet another level of complexity is the existence of a number of FcγR polymorphisms in the human proteome. A particularly relevant polymorphism with clinical significance is V158/F158 FcγRIIIa. Human IgG1 binds with greater affinity to the V158 allotype than to the F158 allotype. This difference in affinity, and presumably its effect on ADCC and/or ADCP, has been shown to be a significant determinant of the efficacy of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (Rituxan®, a registered trademark of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation). Patients with the V158 allotype respond favorably to rituximab treatment; however, patients with the lower affinity F158 allotype respond poorly (\nCartron et al., 2002, Blood 99:754-758\n). Approximately 10-20% of humans are V158/V158 homozygous, 45% are V158/F158 heterozygous, and 35-45% of humans are F158/F158 homozygous (\nLehmbecher et al., 1999, Blood 94:4220-4232\n; \nCartron et al., 2002, Blood 99:754-758\n). Thus 80-90% of humans are poor responders, that is they have at least one allele of the F158 FcγRIIIa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn overlapping but separate site on Fc, shown in \nFigure 1\n, serves as the interface for the complement protein C1q. In the same way that Fc/FcγR binding mediates ADCC, Fc/C1q binding mediates complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). C1q forms a complex with the serine proteases C1r and C1s to form the C1 complex. C1q is capable of binding six antibodies, although binding to two IgGs is sufficient to activate the complement cascade. Similar to Fc interaction with FcγRs, different IgG subclasses have different affinity for C1 q, with IgG1 and IgG3 typically binding substantially better to the FcγRs than IgG2 and IgG4 (\nJefferis et al., 2002, Immunol Lett 82:57-65\n). There is currently no structure available for the Fc/C1q complex; however, mutagenesis studies have mapped the binding site on human IgG for C1q to a region involving residues D270, K322, K326, P329, and P331, and E333 (\nIdusogie et al., 2000, J Immunol 164:4178-4184\n;\n Idusogie et al., 2001, J Immunol 166:2571-2575\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA site on Fc between the Cγ2 and Cγ3 domains, shown in \nFigure 1\n, mediates interaction with the neonatal receptor FcRn, the binding of which recycles endocytosed antibody from the endosome back to the bloodstream (\nRaghavan et al., 1996, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12:181-220\n; \nGhetie et al., 2000, Annu Rev Immunol 18:739-766\n). This process, coupled with preclusion of kidney filtration due to the large size of the full length molecule, results in favorable antibody serum half-lives ranging from one to three weeks. Binding of Fc to FcRn also plays a key role in antibody transport. The binding site for FcRn on Fc is also the site at which the bacterial proteins A and G bind. The tight binding by these proteins is typically exploited as a means to purify antibodies by employing protein A or protein G affinity chromatography during protein purification. Thus the fidelity of this region on Fc is important for both the clinical properties of antibodies and their purification. Available structures of the rat Fc/FcRn complex (\nMartin et al., 2001, Mol Cell 7:867-877\n), and of the complexes of Fc with proteins A and G (\nDeisenhofer, 1981, Biochemistry 20:2361-2370\n; \nSauer-Eriksson et al., 1995, Structure 3:265-278\n;\n Tashiro et al., 1995, Curr Opin Struct Biol 5:471-481\n) provide insight into the interaction of Fc with these proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA key feature of the Fc region is the conserved N-linked glycosylation that occurs at N297, shown in \nFigure 1\n. This carbohydrate, or oligosaccharide as it is sometimes referred, plays a critical structural and functional role for the antibody, and is one of the principle reasons that antibodies must be produced using mammalian expression systems. While not wanting to be limited to one theory, it is believed that the structural purpose of this carbohydrate may be to stabilize or solubilize Fc, determine a specific angle or level of flexibility between the Cγ3 and Cγ2 domains, keep the two Cγ2 domains from aggregating with one another across the central axis, or a combination of these. Efficient Fc binding to FcγR and C1q requires this modification, and alterations in the composition of the N297 carbohydrate or its elimination affect binding to these proteins (\nUmaña et a/., 1999, Nat Biotechnol 17:176-180\n; \nDavies et a/., 2001, Biotechnol Bioeng 74:288-294\n; \nMimura et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:45539-45547\n.; \nRadaev et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:16478-16483\n; \nShields et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604\n; \nShields et al., 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740\n; \nSimmons et al., 2002, J Immunol Methods 263:133-147\n). Yet the carbohydrate makes little if any specific contact with FcγRs (\nRadaev et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:16469-16477\n), indicating that the functional role of the N297 carbohydrate in mediating Fc/FcγR binding may be via the structural role it plays in determining the Fc conformation. This is supported by a collection of crystal structures of four different Fc glycoforms, which show that the composition of the oligosaccharide impacts the conformation of Cγ2 and as a result the Fc/FcγR interface (\nKrapp et al., 2003, J Mol Biol 325:979-989\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe features of antibodies discussed above - specificity for target, ability to mediate immune effector mechanisms, and long half-life in serum - make antibodies powerful therapeutics. Monoclonal antibodies are used therapeutically for the treatment of a variety of conditions including cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. There are currently over ten antibody products on the market and hundreds in development. In addition to antibodies, an antibody-like protein that is finding an expanding role in research and therapy is the Fc fusion (\nChamow et al., 1996, Trends Biotechnol 14:52-60\n; \nAshkenazi et al., 1997, Curr Opin Immuno/ 9:195-200\n). An Fc fusion is a protein wherein one or more polypeptides is operably linked to Fc. An Fc fusion combines the Fc region of an antibody, and thus its favorable effector functions and pharmacokinetics, with the target-binding region of a receptor, ligand, or some other protein or protein domain. The role of the latter is to mediate target recognition, and thus it is functionally analogous to the antibody variable region. Because of the structural and functional overlap of Fc fusions with antibodies, the discussion on antibodies in the present invention extends directly to Fc fusions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite such widespread use, antibodies are not optimized for clinical use. Two significant deficiencies of antibodies are their suboptimal anticancer potency and their demanding production requirements. These deficiencies are addressed by the present invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are a number of possible mechanisms by which antibodies destroy tumor cells, including anti-proliferation via blockage of needed growth pathways, Intracellular signaling leading to apoptosis, enhanced down regulation and/or turnover of receptors, CDC, ADCC, ADCP, and promotion of an adaptive immune response (\nGragg et al., 1999, Curr Opin Immunol 11:541-547\n; \nGlennie et al., 2000, Immunol Today 21:403-410\n). Anti-tumor efficacy may be due to a combination of these mechanisms, and their relative importance in clinical therapy appears to be cancer dependent. Despite this arsenal of anti-tumor weapons, the potency of antibodies as anti-cancer agents is unsatisfactory, particularly given their high cost. Patient tumor response data show that monoclonal antibodies provide only a small improvement in therapeutic success over normal single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. For example, just half of all relapsed low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients respond to the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (\nMcLaughlin et al., 1998, J Clin Oncol 16:2825-2833\n). Of 166 clinical patients, 6% showed a complete response and 42% showed a partial response, with median response duration of approximately 12 months. Trastuzumab (Herceptin®, a registered trademark of Genentech), an anti-HER2/neu antibody for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, has less efficacy. The overall response rate using trastuzumab for the 222 patients tested was only 15%, with 8 complete and 26 partial responses and a median response duration and survival of 9 to 13 months (\nCobleigh et al., 1999, J Clin Oncol 17:2639-2648\n). Currently for anticancer therapy, any small improvement in mortality rate defines success. Thus there is a significant need to enhance the capacity of antibodies to destroy targeted cancer cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA promising means for enhancing the anti-tumor potency of antibodies is via enhancement of their ability to mediate cytotoxic effector functions such as ADCC, ADCP, and CDC. The importance of FcγR-mediated effector functions for the anti-cancer activity of antibodies has been demonstrated in mice (\nClynes et al., 1998, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 95:652-656\n; \nClynes et al., 2000, Nat Med 6:443-446\n), and the affinity of interaction between Fc and certain FcγRs correlates with targeted cytotoxicity in cell-based assays (\nShields et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604\n; \nPresta et al., 2002, Biochem Soc Trans 30:487-490\n; \nShields et al., 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740\n). Additionally, a correlation has been observed between clinical efficacy in humans and their allotype of - high (V158) or low (F158) affinity polymorphic forms of FcγRIIIa (\nCartron et al., 2002, Blood 99:754-758\n). Together these data suggest that an antibody with an Fc region optimized for binding to certain FcγRs may better mediate effector functions and thereby destroy cancer cells more effectively in patients. The balance between activating and inhibiting receptors is an important consideration, and optimal effector function may result from an Fc with enhanced affinity for activation receptors, for example FcγRI, FcγRIIa/c, and FcγRIIIa, yet reduced affinity for the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb. Furthermore, because FcγRs can mediate antigen uptake and processing by antigen presenting cells, enhanced Fc/FcγR affinity may also improve the capacity of antibody therapeutics to elicit an adaptive immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutagenesis studies have been carried out on Fc towards various goals, with substitutions typically made to alanine (referred to as alanine scanning) or guided by sequence homology substitutions (\nDuncan et al., 1988, Nature 332:563-564\n;\n Lund et al., 1991, J Immunol 147:2657-2662\n; \nLund et al., 1992, Mol Immunol 29:53-59\n; \nJefferis et al., 1995, Immunol Lett 44:111-117\n;\n Lund et al., 1995, Faseb J 9:115-119\n;\n Jefferis et al., 1996, Immunol Lett 54:101-104\n; \nLund et al., 1996, J Immunol 157:4963-4969\n; \nArmour et al., 1999, Eur J Immunol 29:2613-2624\n; \nShields et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604\n; \nJefferis et al., 2002, Immunol Lett 82:57-65\n) (\n \nUS 5,624,821\n \n; \n \nUS 5,885,573\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 00/42072\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 99/58572\n \n). The majority of substitutions reduce or ablate binding with FcγRs. However some success has been achieved at obtaining Fc variants with higher FcγR affinity. (See for example \n \nUS 5,624,821\n \n, and \n \nPCT WO 00/42072\n \n). For example, Winter and colleagues substituted the human amino acid at position 235 of mouse IgG2b antibody (a glutamic acid to leucine mutation) that increased binding of the mouse antibody to human FcγRI by100-fold (\nDuncan et al., 1988, Nature 332:563-564\n) (\n \nUS 5,624,821\n \n). Shields \net al.\n used alanine scanning mutagenesis to map Fc residues important to FcγR binding, followed by substitution of select residues with non-alanine mutations (\nShields et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604\n;\n Presta et al., 2002, Biochem Soc Trans 30:487-490\n) (\n \nPCT WO 00/42072\n \n). Several mutations disclosed in this study, including S298A, E333A, and K334A, show enhanced binding to the activating receptor FcγRIIIa and reduced binding to the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb. These mutations were combined to obtain double and triple mutation variants that show additive improvements in binding. The best variant disclosed in this study is a S298A/E333A/K334A triple mutant with approximately a 1.7-fold increase in binding to F158 FcγRIIIa, a 5-fold decrease in binding to FcγRIIb, and a 2.1-fold enhancement in ADCC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced affinity of Fc for FcγR has also been achieved using engineered glycoforms generated by expression of antibodies in engineered or variant cell lines (\nUmaña et al., 1999, Nat Biotechnol 17:176-180\n; \nDavies et al., 2001, Biotechnol Bioeng 74:288-294\n; \nShields et al., 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740\n; \nShinkawa et al., 2003, J Biol Chem 278:3466-3473\n). This approach has generated substantial enhancements of the capacity of antibodies to bind FcγRIIIa and to mediate ADCC. Although there are practical limitations such as the growth efficiency of the expression strains under large scale production conditions, this approach for enhancing Fc/FcγR affinity and effector function is promising. Indeed, coupling of these alternate glycoform technologies with the Fc variants of the present invention may provide additive or synergistic effects for optimal effector function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough there is a need for greater effector function, for some antibody therapeutics reduced or eliminated effector function may be desired. This is often the case for therapeutic antibodies whose mechanism of action involves blocking or antagonism but not killing of the cells bearing target antigen. In these cases depletion of target cells is undesirable and can be considered a side effect. For example, the ability of anti-CD4 antibodies to block CD4 receptors on T cells makes them effective anti-inflammatories, yet their ability to recruit FcγR receptors also directs immune attack against the target cells, resulting in T cell depletion (\nReddy et al., 2000, J Immunol 164:1925-1933\n). Effector function can also be a problem for radiolabeled antibodies, referred to as radioconjugates, and antibodies conjugated to toxins, referred to as immunotoxins. These drugs can be used to destroy cancer cells, but the recruitment of immune cells via Fc interaction with FcγRs brings healthy immune cells in proximity to the deadly payload (radiation or toxin), resulting in depletion of normal lymphoid tissue along with targeted cancer cells (\nHutchins et al., 1995, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 92:11980-11984\n; \nWhite et al., 2001, Annu Rev Med 52:125-145\n). This problem can potentially be circumvented by using IgG isotypes that poorly recruit complement or effector cells, for example IgG2 and IgG4. An alternate solution is to develop Fc variants that reduce or ablate binding (\nAlegre et al., 1994, Transplantation 57:1537-1543\n; \nHutchins et al., 1995, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 92:11980-11984\n; \nArmour et al., 1999, Eur J Immunol 29:2613-2624\n; \nReddy et al., 2000, J Immunol 164:1925-1933\n;\n Xu et al., 2000, Cell Immunol 200:16-26\n; \nShields et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604\n) (\n \nUS 6,194,551\n \n; \n \nUS 5,885,573\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 99/58572\n \n). A critical consideration for the reduction or elimination of effector function is that other important antibody properties not be perturbed. Fc variants should be engineered that not only ablate binding to FcγRs and/or C1q, but also maintain antibody stability, solubility, and structural integrity, as well as ability to interact with other important Fc ligands such as FcRn and proteins A and G.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention addresses another major shortcoming of antibodies, namely their demanding production requirements (\nGarber, 2001, Nat Biotechnol 19:184-185\n; \nDove, 2002, Nat Biotechnol 20:777-779\n). Antibodies must be expressed in mammalian cells, and the currently marketed antibodies together with other high-demand biotherapeutics consume essentially all of the available manufacturing capacity. With hundreds of biologics in development, the majority of which are antibodies, there is an urgent need for more efficient and cheaper methods of production. The downstream effects of Insufficient antibody manufacturing capacity are three-fold. First, it dramatically raises the cost of goods to the producer, a cost that is passed on to the patient. Second, it hinders industrial production of approved antibody products, limiting availability of high demand therapeutics to patients. Finally, because clinical trials require large amounts of a protein that is not yet profitable, the insufficient supply impedes progress of the growing antibody pipeline to market.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternative production methods have been explored in attempts at alleviating this problem. Transgenic plants and animals are being pursued as potentially cheaper and higher capacity production systems (\nChadd et al., 2001, Curr Opin Biotechnol 12:188-194\n)\n.\n Such expression systems, however, can generate glycosylation patterns significantly different from human glycoproteins. This may result in reduced or even lack of effector function because, as discussed above, the carbohydrate structure can significantly impact FcγR and complement binding. A potentially greater problem with nonhuman glycoforms may be immunogenicity; carbohydrates are a key source of antigenicity for the immune system, and the presence of nonhuman glycoforms has a significant chance of eliciting antibodies that neutralize the therapeutic, or worse cause adverse immune reactions. Thus the efficacy and safety of antibodies produced by transgenic plants and animals remains uncertain. Bacterial expression is another attractive solution to the antibody production problem. Expression in bacteria, for example \nE. coli,\n provides a cost-effective and high capacity method for producing proteins. For complex proteins such as antibodies there are a number of obstacles to bacterial expression, including folding and assembly of these complex molecules, proper disulfide formation, and solubility, stability, and functionality in the absence of glycosylation because proteins expressed in bacteria are not glycosylated. Full length unglycosylated antibodies that bind antigen have been successfully expressed in \nE. coli\n (\nSimmons et al., 2002, J Immunol Methods 263:133-147\n), and thus, folding, assembly, and proper disulfide formation of bacterially expressed antibodies are possible in the absence of the eukaryotic chaperone machinery. However the ultimate utility of bacterially expressed antibodies as therapeutics remains hindered by the lack of glycosylation, which results in lack effector function and may result in poor stability and solubility. This will likely be more problematic for formulation at the high concentrations for the prolonged periods demanded by clinical use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aglycosylated Fc with favorable solution properties and the capacity to mediate effector functions would be significantly enabling for the alternate production methods described above. By overcoming the structural and functional shortcomings of aglycosylated Fc, antibodies can be produced in bacteria and transgenic plants and animals with reduced risk of immunogenicity, and with effector function for clinical applications in which cytotoxicity is desired such as cancer. The present invention describes the utilization of protein engineering methods to develop stable, soluble Fc variants with effector function. Currently, such Fc variants do not exist in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, there is a need for antibodies with enhanced therapeutic properties. Engineering of optimized or enhanced Fc variants is a promising approach to meeting this need. Yet a substantial obstacle to engineering Fc variants with the desired properties is the difficulty in predicting what amino acid modifications, out of the enormous number of possibilities, will achieve the desired goals, coupled with the inefficient production and screening methods for antibodies. Indeed one of the principle reasons for the incomplete success of the prior art is that approaches to Fc engineering have thus far involved hit-or-miss methods such as alanine scans or production of glycoforms using different expression strains. In these studies, the Fc modifications that were made were fully or partly random in hopes of obtaining variants with favorable properties. The present invention provides a variety of engineering methods, many of which are based on more sophisticated and efficient techniques, which may be used to overcome these obstacles in order to develop Fc variants that are optimized for the desired properties. The described engineering methods provide design strategies to guide Fc modification, computational screening methods to design favorable Fc variants, library generation approaches for determining promising variants for experimental investigation, and an array of experimental production and screening methods for determining the Fc variants with favorable properties.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides Fc variants that are optimized for a number of therapeutically relevant properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is an object of the present invention to provide novel Fc positions at which amino acid modifications may be made to generate optimized Fc variants.

The present invention describes any amino acid modification at any of said novel Fc positions in order to generate an optimized Fc variant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide Fc variants that have been screened computationally.

In this way, computational screening serves as a prelude to or surrogate for experimental screening, and thus said computationally screened Fc variants are considered novel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide Fc variants that have been characterized using one or more of the experimental methods described herein.

Such definitions are meant to encompass grammatical equivalents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"ADCC\" or \n\"antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity\"\n as used herein is meant the cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"ADCP\" or \nantibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis\n as used herein is meant the cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"amino \nacid modification\"\n herein is meant an amino acid substitution, insertion, and/or deletion in a polypeptide sequence. The preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution. **TT\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"antibody\" herein is meant a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by all or part of the recognized immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes, for example in humans, include the kappa (κ), lambda (λ), and heavy chain genetic loci, which together comprise the myriad variable region genes, and the constant region genes mu (µ), delta (δ), gamma (γ), sigma (σ), and alpha (α) which encode the IgM. IgD, IgG, IgE, and IgA isotypes respectively. Antibody herein is meant to include full length antibodies and antibody fragments, and may refer to a natural antibody from any organism, an engineered antibody, or an antibody generated recombinantly for experimental, therapeutic, or other purposes as further defined below. Thus, \"antibody\" includes both polyclonal and monoclonal antibody (mAb). Methods of preparation and purification of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are known in the art and e.g., are described in \nHarlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988\n). As outlined herein, \"antibody\" specifically includes Fc variants described herein, \"full length\" antibodies including the Fc variant fragments described herein, and Fc variant fusions to other proteins as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nin some embodiments, antibodies can be neutralizing or inhibitory, or stimulatory, and in preferred embodiments, as described herein, the stimulatory activity is measured by an increase in affinitiy of a variant antibody to a receptor, as compared to either the parent antibody (e.g. when a non-naturally occurring variant is used as the starting point for the computation analysis herein), or to the original wild-type antibody. Accordingly, by \"neutralization,\" \"neutralize,\" \"neutralizing\" and grammatical equivalents herein is meant to inhibit or lessen the biological effect of the antibody, in some cases by binding (e.g. competitively) to a antigen and avoiding or decreasing the biological effect of binding, or by binding that results in decreasing the biological effect of binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"antibody\" include antibody fragments, as are known in the art, such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fcs or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies, such as, single chain antibodies (Fv for example), chimeric antibodies, etc., either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or those synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA technologies. Particularly preferred are Fc variants as described herein. The term \"antibody\" further comprises polyclonal antibodies and mAbs which can be agonist or antagonist antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the invention specifically bind to Fc receptors, as outlined herein. By \"specifically bind\" herein is meant that the LC antibodies have a binding constant in the range of at least 10\n-4\n - 10\n-6\n M\n-1\n, with a preferred range being 10\n-7\n - 10\n-9\n M\n-1\n.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are humanized. Using current monoclonal antibody technology one can produce a humanized antibody to virtually any target antigen that can be identified [\nStein, Trends Biotechnol. 15:88-90 (1997\n)]. Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric molecules of immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fc, Fab, Fab', F(ab')2 or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues form a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin [\nJones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986\n); \nRiechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988\n); and \nPresta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992\n)]. Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues, which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers [Jones et al., supra; Riechmann et al., supra; and \nVerhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988\n)], by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Additional examples of humanized murine monoclonal antibodies are also known in the art, e.g., antibodies binding human protein C [\nO'Connor et al., Protein Eng. 11:321-8 (1998\n)], \ninterleukin\n 2 receptor [\nQueen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 86:10029-33 (1989\n]), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [\nCarter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89:4285-9 (1992\n)]. Accordingly, such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are based on human sequences, and are thus human sequences are used as the \"base\" sequences, against which other sequences, such as rat, mouse and monkey sequences. In order to establish homology to primary sequence or structure, the amino acid sequence of a precursor or parent Fc is directly compared to the human Fc sequence outlined herein. After aligning the sequences, using one or more of the homology alignment programs described herein (for example using conserved residues as between species), allowing for necessary insertions and deletions in order to maintain alignment (i.e., avoiding the elimination of conserved residues through arbitrary deletion and insertion), the residues equivalent to particular amino acids in the primary sequence of human Fc are defined. Alignment of conserved residues preferably should conserve 100% of such residues. However, alignment of greater than 75% or as little as 50% of conserved residues is also adequate to define equivalent residues (sometimes referred to herein as \"corresponding residues\").\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEquivalent residues may also be defined by determining homology at the level of tertiary structure for an Fc fragment whose tertiary structure has been determined by x-ray crystallography. Equivalent residues are defined as those for which the atomic coordinates of two or more of the main chain atoms of a particular amino acid residue of the parent or precursor (N on N, CA on CA, C on C and O on O) are within 0.13 nm and preferably 0.1 nm after alignment. Alignment is achieved after the best model has been oriented and positioned to give the maximum overlap of atomic coordinates of non-hydrogen protein atoms of the Fc variant fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically included within the definition of \"antibody\" are aglycosylated antibodies. By \n\"aglycosylated antibody\n as used herein is meant an antibody that lacks carbohydrate attached at position 297 of the Fc region, wherein numbering is according to the EU system as in Kabat. The aglycosylated antibody may be a deglycosylated antibody, that is an antibody for which the Fc carbohydrate has been removed, for example chemically or enzymatically. Alternatively, the aglycosylated antibody may be a nonglycosylated or unglycosylated antibody, that is an antibody that was expressed without Fc carbohydrate, for example by mutation of one or residues that encode the glycosylation pattern or by expression in an organism that does not attach carbohydrates to proteins, for example bacteria.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically included within the definition of \"antibody\" are full-length antibodies that contain an Fc variant portion..By \n\"full length antibody\"\n herein is meant the structure that constitutes the natural biological form of an antibody, including variable and constant regions. For example, in most mammals, including humans and mice, the full length antibody of the IgG class is a tetramer and consists of two identical pairs of two immunoglobulin chains, each pair having one light and one heavy chain, each light chain comprising immunoglobulin domains V\nL\n and C\nL\n, and each heavy chain comprising immunoglobulin domains V\nH\n, Cγ1, Cγ2, and Cγ3. In some mammals, for example in camels and Ilamas, IgG antibodies may consist of only two heavy chains, each heavy chain comprising a variable domain attached to the Fc region. By \"IgG\" as used herein is meant a polypeptide belonging to the class of antibodies that are substantially encoded by a recognized immunoglobulin gamma gene. In humans this class comprises IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. In mice this class comprises IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \n\"amino acid\"\n and \"amino \nacid identity\"\n as used herein is meant one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids or any non-natural analogues that may be present at a specific, defined position. By \"protein\" herein is meant at least two covalently attached amino acids, which includes proteins, polypeptides, oligopeptides and peptides. The protein may be made up of naturally occurring amino acids and peptide bonds, or synthetic peptidomimetic structures, i.e. \"analogs\", such as peptoids (see \nSimon et al., PNAS USA 89(20):9367 (1992\n)) particularly when LC peptides are to be administered to a patient. Thus \"amino acid\", or \"peptide residue\", as used herein means both naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids. For example, homophenylalanine, citrulline and noreleucine are considered amino acids for the purposes of the invention. \"Amino acid\" also includes imino acid residues such as proline and hydroxyproline. The side chain may be in either the (R) or the (S) configuration. In the preferred embodiment, the amino acids are in the (S) or L-configuration. If non-naturally occurring side chains are used, non-amino acid substituents may be used, for example to prevent or retard in vivo degradation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"computational \nscreening method\"\n herein is meant any method for designing one or more mutations in a protein, wherein said method utilizes a computer to evaluate the energies of the interactions of potential amino acid side chain substitutions with each other and/or with the rest of the protein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, evaluation of energies, referred to as energy calculation, refers to some method of scoring one or more amino acid modifications. Said method may involve a physical or chemical energy term, or may involve knowledge-, statistical-, sequence-based energy terms, and the like. The calculations that compose a computational screening method are herein referred to as \"computational \nscreening calculations\".\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \n\"effector function\"\n as used herein is meant a biochemical event that results from the interaction of an antibody Fc region with an Fc receptor or ligand. Effector functions include but are not limited to ADCC, ADCP, and CDC. By \n\"effector cell\" as\n used herein is meant a cell of the immune system that expresses one or more Fc receptors and mediates one or more effector functions. Effector cells include but are not limited to monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, B cells, large granular lymphocytes, Langerhans' cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and γγ T cells, and may be from any organism including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. \nBy \"library\"\n herein is meant a set of Fc variants in any form, including but not limited to a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, a list of nucleic acid or amino acid substitutions at variable positions, a physical library comprising nucleic acids that encode the library sequences, or a physical library comprising the Fc variant proteins, either in purified or unpurified form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"Fc\", \n\"Fc region\", FC polypeptide\",\n etc. as used herein is meant an antibody as defined herein that includes the polypeptides comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA, IgD, and IgG, and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM, and the flexible hinge N-terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM Fc may include the J chain. For IgG, as Illustrated in \nFigure 1\n, Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains Cgamma2 and Cgamma3 (Cγ2 and Cγ3) and the hinge between Cgamma1 (Cy1) and Cgamma2 (Cγ2). Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to comprise residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl-terminus, wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. Fc may refer to this region in isolation, or this region in the context of an antibody, antibody fragment, or Fc fusion. An Fc may be an antibody, Fc fusion, or an protein or protein domain that comprises Fc. Particularly preferred are Fc variants, which are non-naturally occurring variants of an Fc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"Fc \nfusion\"\n as used herein is meant a protein wherein one or more polypeptides is operably linked to Fc. Fc fusion is herein meant to be synonymous with the terms \"immunoadhesin\", \"Ig fusion\", \"Ig chimera\", and \"receptor globulin\" (sometimes with dashes) as used in the prior art (\nChamow et al., 1996, Trends Biotechnol 14:52-60\n;\n Ashkenazi et al., 1997, Curr Opin Immunol 9:195-200\n). An Fc fusion combines the Fc region of an immunoglobulin with a fusion partner, which in general can be any protein, including, but not limited to, the target-binding region of a receptor, an adhesion molecule, a ligand, an enzyme, or some other protein or protein domain. The role of the non-Fc part of an Fc fusion is to mediate target binding, and thus it is functionally analogous to the variable regions of an antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"Fc \ngamma receptor\"\n or \"FcγR\" as used herein is meant any member of the family of proteins that bind the IgG antibody Fc region and are substantially encoded by the FcγR genes. In humans this family includes but is not limited to FcγRI (CD64), including isoforms FcγRIa, FcγRIb, and FcγRIc; FcγRII (CD32), including isoforms FcγRIIa (including allotypes H131 and R131), FcγRIIb (including FcγRIIb-1 and FcγRIIb-2), and FcγRIIc; and FcγRIII (CD16), including isoforms FcγRIIIa (including allotypes V158 and F158) and FcγRIIIb (including allotypes FcγRIIIb-NA1 and FcγRIIIb-NA2) (\nJefferis et al., 2002, Immunol Lett 82:57-65\n), as well as any undiscovered human FcγRs or FcγR isoforms or allotypes. An FcγR may be from any organism, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. Mouse FcγRs include but are not limited to FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32), FcγRIII (CD16), and FcγRIII-2 (CD16-2), as well as any undiscovered mouse FcγRs or FcγR isoforms or allotypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \n\"Fc ligand\"\n as used herein is meant a molecule, preferably a polypeptide, from any organism that binds to the Fc region of an antibody to form an Fc-ligand complex. Fc ligands include but are not limited to FcγRs, FcγRs, FcγRs, FcRn, C1q, C3, mannan binding lectin, mannose receptor, \nstaphylococcal\n protein A, \nstreptococcal\n protein G, and viral FcγR. Fc ligands may include undiscovered molecules that bind Fc\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"IgG\" as used herein is meant a polypeptide belonging to the class of antibodies that are substantially encoded by a recognized immunoglobulin gamma gene. In humans this class comprises IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. In mice this class comprises IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3. By \"\nimmunoglobulin (Ig)\n\" herein is meant a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes. Immunoglobulins include but are not limited to antibodies. Immunoglobulins may have a number of structural forms, including but not limited to full length antibodies, antibody fragments, and individual immunoglobulin domains. By \"\nimmunoglobulin (Ig) domain\"\n herein is meant a region of an immunoglobulin that exists as a distinct structural entity as ascertained by one skilled in the art of protein structure. Ig domains typically have a characteristic □-sandwich folding topology. The known Ig domains in the IgG class of antibodies are V\nH\n, Cγ1, Cγ2, Cγ3, V\nL\n, and C\nL\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"parent \npolypeptide\"\n or \n\"precursor polypeptide\"\n (including Fc parent or precursors) as used herein is meant a polypeptide that is subsequently modified to generate a variant. Said parent polypeptide may be a naturally occurring polypeptide, or a variant or engineered version of a naturally occurring polypeptide. Parent polypeptide may refer to the polypeptide itself, compositions that comprise the parent polypeptide, or the amino acid sequence that encodes it. Accordingly, by \"\n\"parent Fc polypeptide\"\n as used herein is meant an unmodified Fc polypeptide that is modified to generate a variant, and by \"parent \nantibody\"\n as used herein is meant an unmodified antibody that is modified to generate a variant antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs outlined above, certain positions of the Fc molecule can be altered. By \n\"position\"\n as used herein is meant a location in the sequence of a protein. Positions may be numbered sequentially, or according to an established format, for example the EU index as in Kabat. For example, position 297 is a position in the human antibody IgG1. Corresponding positions are determined as outlined above, generally through alignment with other parent sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"\nresidue\n\" as used herein is meant a position in a protein and its associated amino acid identity. For example, Daragine 297 (also referred to as N297, also referred to as N297) is a residue in the human antibody IgG1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \n\"target antigen\"\n as used herein is meant the molecule that is bound specifically by the variable region of a given antibody. A target antigen may be a protein, carbohydrate, lipid, or other chemical compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \n\"target cell\"\n as used herein is meant a cell that expresses a target antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nBy \"variable region\"\n as used herein is meant the region of an immunoglobulin that comprises one or more Ig domains substantially encoded by any of the V\nK\n \n,\n V\nλ\n, and/or V\nH\n genes that make up the kappa, lambda, and heavy chain immunoglobulin genetic loci respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"variant \npolypeptide\"\n as used herein is meant a polypeptide sequence that differs from that of a parent polypeptide sequence by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. Variant polypeptide may refer to the polypeptide itself, a composition comprising the polypeptide, or the amino sequence that encodes it. Preferably, the variant polypeptide has at least one amino acid modification compared to the parent polypeptide, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid modifications, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid modifications compared to the parent. The variant polypeptide sequence herein will preferably possess at least about 80% homology with a parent polypeptide sequence, and most preferably at least about 90% homology, more preferably at least about 95% homology. Accordingly, by \"Fc \nvariant\"\n as used herein is meant an Fc sequence that differs from that of a parent Fc sequence by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. An Fc variant may only encompass an Fc region, or may exist in the context of an antibody, Fc fusion, or other polypeptide that is substantially encoded by Fc. Fc variant may refer to the Fc polypeptide itself, compositions comprising the Fc variant polypeptide, or the amino acid sequence that encodes it.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor all positions discussed in the present invention, numbering of an immunoglobulin heavy chain is according to the EU index (\nKabat et al., 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., United States Public Health Svice, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda\n). The \"EU index as in Kabat\" refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be optimized for a variety of properties. Properties that may be optimized include but are not limited to enhanced or reduced affinity for an FcγR. In a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to possess enhanced affinity for a human activating FcγR, preferably FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIc, FcγRIIIa, and FcγRIIIb, most preferably FcγRIIIa. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are optimized to possess reduced affinity for the human inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb. These preferred embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans, for example enhanced effector function and greater anti-cancer potency. In an alternate embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to have reduced or ablated affinity for a human FcγR, including but not limited to FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIc, FcγRIIIa, and FcγRIIIb. These embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans, for example reduced effector function and reduced toxicity. Preferred embodiments comprise optimization of Fc binding to a human FcγR, however in alternate embodiments the Fc variants of the present invention possess enhanced or reduced affinity for FcγRs from nonhuman organisms, including but not limited to mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. Fc variants that are optimized for binding to a nonhuman FcγR may find use in experimentation. For example, mouse models are available for a variety of diseases that enable testing of properties such as efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics for a given drug candidate. As is known in the art, cancer cells can be grafted or injected into mice to mimic a human cancer, a process referred to as xenografting. Testing of antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise Fc variants that are optimized for one or more mouse FcγRs, may provide valuable information with regard to the efficacy of the antibody or Fc fusion, its mechanism of action, and the like. The Fc variants of the present invention may also be optimized for enhanced functionality and/or solution properties in aglycosylated form. In a preferred embodiment, the aglycosylated Fc variants of the present invention bind an Fc ligand with greater affinity than the aglycosylated form of the parent Fc polypeptide. Said Fc ligands include but are not limited to FcγRs, C1q, FcRn, and proteins A and G, and may be from any source including but not limited to human, mouse, rat, rabbit, or monkey, preferably human. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are optimized to be more stable and/or more soluble than the aglycosylated form of the parent Fc polypeptide. An Fc variant that is engineered or predicted to display any of the aforementioned optimized properties is herein referred to as an \n\"optimized Fc variant\".\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be derived from parent Fc polypeptides that are themselves from a wide range of sources. The parent Fc polypeptide may be substantially encoded by one or more Fc genes from any organism, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, camels, Ilamas, dromedaries, monkeys, preferably mammals and most preferably humans and mice. In a preferred embodiment, the parent Fc polypeptide composes an antibody, referred to as the parent antibody. The parent antibody may be fully human, obtained for example using transgenic mice (\nBruggemann et al., 1997, Curr Opin Biotechnol 8:455-458\n) or human antibody libraries coupled with selection methods (\nGriffiths et al., 1998, Curr Opin Biotechnol 9:102-108\n). The parent antibody need not be naturally occurring. For example, the parent antibody may be an engineered antibody, including but not limited to chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies (\nClark, 2000, Immunol Today 21:397-402\n). The parent antibody may be an engineered variant of an antibody that is substantially encoded by one or more natural antibody genes. In one embodiment, the parent antibody has been affinity matured, as is known in the art. Alternatively, the antibody has been modified in some other way, for example as described in \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/339788, filed on March 3, 2003\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes belonging to any of the antibody classes. In a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention find use in antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise sequences belonging to the IgG class of antibodies, including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4. In an alternate embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention find use in antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise sequences belonging to the IgA (including subclasses IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, IgE, IgG, or IgM classes of antibodies. The Fc variants of the present invention may comprise more than one protein chain.

In an alternate embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are incorporated into an antibody or Fc fusion that comprises one or more engineered glycoforms. By \"\nengineered glycoform\"\n as used herein is meant a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to an Fc polypeptide, wherein said carbohydrate composition differs chemically from that of a parent Fc polypeptide. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to enhancing or reducing effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by any method, for example by using engineered or variant expression strains, by co-expression with one or more enzymes, for example □1-4- N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), by expressing an Fc polypeptide in various organisms or cell lines from various organisms, or by modifying carbohydrate(s) after the Fc polypeptide has been expressed. Methods for generating engineered glycoforms are known in the art, and include but are not limited to (\nUmaña et al., 1999, Nat Biotechnol 17:176-180\n; \nDavies et al., 2001, Biotechnol Bioeng 74:288-294\n; \nShields et al., 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740\n; \nShinkawa et al., 2003, J Biol Chem 278:3466-3473\n) \n \nUS 6,602,684\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/277,370\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/113,929\n \n;\n \n PCT WO 00/61739A1\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/29246A1\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/31140A1\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/30954A1\n \n; Potelligent™ technology (Biowa, Inc., Princeton, N.J.); GlycomAb™ glycosylation engineering technology (GLYCART biotechnology AG, Zurich, Switzerland)). Engineered glycoform typically refers to the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide; thus an Fc polypeptide, for example an antibody or Fc fusion, may comprise an engineered glycoform. Alternatively, engineered glycoform may refer to the Fc polypeptide that comprises the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide. Thus combinations of the Fc variants of the present invention with other Fc modifications, as well as undiscovered Fc modifications, are contemplated with the goal of generating novel antibodies or Fc fusions with optimized properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody. By \n\"antibody of the present invention\"\n as used herein is meant an antibody that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention. The present invention may, In fact, find use in any protein that comprises Fc, and thus application of the Fc variants of the present invention is not limited to antibodies. The Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an Fc fusion. By \"Fc \nfusion of the present invention\"\n as used herein refers to an Fc fusion that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention.

For example, reference to CTLA-4 as a target antigen implies that the ligands and receptors that make up the T cell co-stimulatory pathway, including CTLA-4, B7-1, B7-2, CD28, and any other undiscovered ligands or receptors that bind these proteins, are also targets. Thus target as used herein refers not only to a specific biomolecule, but the set of proteins that interact with said target and the members of the biochemical pathway to which said target belongs. One skilled in the art will further appreciate that any of the aforementioned target antigens, the ligands or receptors that bind them, or other members of their corresponding biochemical pathway, may be operably linked to the Fc variants of the present invention in order to generate an Fc fusion. Thus for example, an Fc fusion that targets EGFR could be constructed by operably linking an Fc variant to EGF, TGF□, or any other ligand, discovered or undiscovered, that binds EGFR. Accordingly, an Fc variant of the present invention could be operably linked to EGFR in order to generate an Fc fusion that binds EGF, TGFD, or any other ligand, discovered or undiscovered, that binds EGFR. Thus virtually any polypeptide, whether a ligand, receptor, or some other protein or protein domain, including but not limited to the aforementioned targets and the proteins that compose their corresponding biochemical pathways, may be operably linked to the Fc variants of the present invention to develop an Fc fusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of antibodies and Fc fusions that are approved for use, in clinical trials, or in development may benefit from the Fc variants of the present invention. Said antibodies and Fc fusions are herein referred to as \"clinical \nproducts and candidates\".\n Thus in a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in a range of clinical products and candidates. For example, a number of antibodies that target CD20 may benefit from the Fc variants of the present invention. For example the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody that is substantially similar to rituximab (Rituxan®, IDEC/Genentech/Roche) (see for example \n \nUS 5,736,137\n \n), a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody approved to treat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; HuMax-CD20, an anti-CD20 currently being developed by Genmab, an anti-CD20 antibody described In \n \nUS 5,500,362\n \n, AME-133 (Applied Molecular Evolution), hA20 (Immunomedics, Inc.), and HumaLYM (Intracel).

Within the scope of the present invention this is meant to include diseases and disorders characterized by aberrant proteins, due for example to alterations in the amount of a protein present, the presence of a mutant protein, or both. An overabundance may be due to any cause, including but not limited to overexpression at the molecular level, prolonged or accumulated appearance at the site of action, or increased activity of a protein relative to normal. Included within this definition are diseases and disorders characterized by a reduction of a protein. This reduction may be due to any cause, including but not limited to reduced expression at the molecular level, shortened or reduced appearance at the site of action, mutant forms of a protein, or decreased activity of a protein relative to normal. Such an overabundance or reduction of a protein can be measured relative to normal expression, appearance, or activity of a protein, and said measurement may play an important role in the development and/or clinical testing of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is the only therapeutically active agent administered to a patient. Alternatively, the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is administered in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents, including but not limited to cytotoxic agents, chemotherapeutic agents, cytokines, growth inhibitory agents, anti-hormonal agents, kinase inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, cardioprotectants, or other therapeutic agents. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. The skilled medical practitioner can determine empirically the appropriate dose or doses of other therapeutic agents useful herein. The antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be administered concomitantly with one or more other therapeutic regimens. For example, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be administered to the patient along with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

See \n \nPCT WO 94/11026\n \n. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker, peptidase-sensitive linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (\nChari et al., 1992, Cancer Research 52: 127-131\n) may be used. Alternatively, the antibody or Fc fusion is operably linked to the therapeutic agent, e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemotherapeutic agents that may be useful for conjugation to the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention have been described above.

In one embodiment of the invention, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated to one or more maytansine molecules (e.g. about 1 to about 10 maytansine molecules per antibody molecule). Maytansine may, for example, be converted to May-SS-Me which may be reduced to May-SH3 and reacted with modified antibody or Fc fusion (\nChari et al., 1992, Cancer Research 52: 127-131\n) to generate a maytansinoid-antibody or maytansinoid-Fc fusion conjugate. Another conjugate of interest comprises an antibody or Fc fusion conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing doublestranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. Structural analogues of calicheamicin that may be used include but are not limited to γ\n1\n \n1\n, α\n2\n \n1\n, α\n3\n, N-acetyl-γ\n1\n \n1\n, PSAG, and θ\n1\n \n1\n, (\nHinman et al., 1993, Cancer Research 53:3336-3342\n; \nLode et al., 1998, Cancer Research 58:2925-2928\n) (\n \nUS 5,714,586\n \n; \n \nUS 5,712,374\n \n; \n \nUS 5,264,586\n \n; \n \nUS 5,773,001\n \n Dolastatin 10 analogs such as auristatin E (AE) and monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) may find use as conjugates for the Fc variants of the present invention (\nDoronina et al., 2003, Nat Biotechnol 21(7):778-84\n; \nFrancisco et al., 2003 Blood 102(4):1458-65\n).

In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated or operably linked to an enzyme in order to employ Antibody Dependent Enzyme Mediated Prodrug Therapy (ADEPT). ADEPT may be used by conjugating or operably linking the antibody or Fc fusion to a prodrug-activating enzyme that converts a prodrug (e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent, see \n \nPCT WO 81/01145\n \n) to an active anti-cancer drug. See, for example, \n \nPCT WO 88/07378\n \n and \n \nUS 4,975,278\n \n. The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active, cytotoxic form. Enzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; cytosine deaminase useful for converting non-toxic 5-fluorocytosine into the anti-cancer drug, 5-fluorouracil; proteases, such as serratia protease, thermolysin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidases and cathepsins (such as cathepsins B and L), that are useful for converting peptide-containing prodrugs into free drugs; D-alanylcarboxypeptidases, useful for converting prodrugs that contain D-amino acid substituents; carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes such as .beta.-galactosidase and neuramimidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs; beta-lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized.with .alpha.-lactams into free drugs; and penicillin amidases, such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase, useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups, respectively, into free drugs. Alternatively, antibodies with enzymatic activity, also known in the art as \"abzymes\", can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs (see, for example, \nMassey, 1987, Nature 328: 457-458\n). Antibody-abzyme and Fc fusion-abzyme conjugates can be prepared for delivery of the abzyme to a tumor cell population. Other modifications of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are contemplated herein. For example, the antibody or Fc fusion may be linked to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyoxyalkylenes, or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions are contemplated wherein an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention and and one or more therapeutically active agents are formulated. Formulations of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are prepared for storage by mixing said antibody or Fc fusion having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (\nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed.,1980\n), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, acetate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl orbenzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; sweeteners and other flavoring agents; fillers such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, corn and other starches; binding agents; additives; coloring agents; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG). In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition that comprises the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is in a water-soluble form, such as being present as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which is meant to include both acid and base addition salts. \"Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt\" refers to those salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free bases and that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. \"Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts\" include those derived from inorganic bases such as sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum salts and the like.

The formulations to be used for \nin vivo\n administration are preferrably sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes or other methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies and Fc fusions disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle comprising various types of lipids, phospholipids and/or surfactant that is useful for delivery of a therapeutic agent to a mammal. Liposomes containing the antibody or Fc fusion are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in \nEpstein et al., 1985, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 82:3688\n; \nHwang et al., 1980, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 77:4030\n; \n \nUS 4,485,045\n \n; \n \nUS 4,544,545\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 97/38731\n \n. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in \n \nUS 5,013,556\n \n. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged In a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. A chemotherapeutic agent or other therapeutically active agent is optionally contained within the liposome (\nGabizon et a/., 1989, J National Cancer Inst 81:1484\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies, Fc fusions, and other therapeutically active agents may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared by methods including but not limited to coacervation techniques, interfacial polymerization (for example using hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules, or poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules), colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules), and macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed., 1980\n. Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymer, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (\n \nUS 3,773,919\n \n), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate, nondegradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (which are injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid, and ProLease® (commercially available from Alkermes), which is a microsphere-based delivery system composed of the desired bioactive molecule incorporated into a matrix of poly-DL-lactide-co-glycolide (PLG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concentration of the therapeutically active antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention in the formulation may vary from about 0.1 to 100 weight %. In a preferred embodiment, the concentration of the antibody or Fc fusion is in the range of 0.003 to 1.0 molar. In order to treat a patient, a therapeutically effective dose of the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be administered. By \"therapeutically effective dose\" herein is meant a dose that produces the effects for which it is administered. The exact dose will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques. Dosages may range from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg of body weight or greater, for example 0.1, 1, 10, or 50 mg/kg of body weight, with 1 to 10mg/kg being preferred. As is known in the art, adjustments for antibody or Fc fusion degradation, systemic versus localized delivery, and rate of new protease synthesis, as well as the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, drug interaction and the severity of the condition may be necessary, and will be ascertainable with routine experimentation by those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention, preferably in the form of a sterile aqueous solution, may be done in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, orally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intranasally, intraotically, transdermally, topically (e.g., gels, salves, lotions, creams, etc.), intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intrapulmonary (e.g., AERx® inhalable technology commercially available from Aradigm, or Inhance™ pulmonary delivery system commercially available from Inhale Therapeutics), vaginally, parenterally, rectally, or intraocularly. In some instances, for example for the treatment of wounds, inflammation, etc., the antibody or Fc fusion may be directly applied as a solution or spray. As is known in the art, the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated accordingly depending upon the manner of introduction.\n\n\n \nEngineering Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides engineering methods that may be used to generate Fc variants. A principal obstacle that has hindered previous attempts at Fc engineering is that only random attempts at modification have been possible, due in part to the inefficiency of engineering strategies and methods, and to the low-throughput nature of antibody production and screening. The present Invention describes engineering methods that overcome these shortcomings. A variety of design strategies, computational screening methods, library generation methods, and experimental production and screening methods are contemplated. These strategies, approaches, techniques, and methods may be applied individually or in various combinations to engineer optimized Fc variants.\n\n\n \n\n\nDesign Strategies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe most efficient approach to generating Fc variants that are optimized for a desired property is to direct the engineering efforts toward that goal. Accordingly, the present invention teaches design strategies that may be used to engineer optimized Fc variants. The use of a design strategy is meant to guide Fc engineering, but is not meant to constrain an Fc variant to a particular optimized property based on the design strategy that was used to engineer it. At first thought this may seem counterintuitive; however its validity is derived from the enormous complexity of subtle interactions that determine the structure, stability, solubility, and function of proteins and protein-protein complexes. Although efforts can be made to predict which protein positions, residues, interactions, etc. are important for a design goal, often times critical ones are not predictable. Effects on protein structure, stability, solubility, and function, whether favorable or unfavorable, are often unforeseen. Yet there are innumerable amino acid modifications that are detrimental or deleterious to proteins. Thus often times the best approach to engineering comes from generation of protein variants that are focused generally towards a design goal but do not cause detrimental effects. In this way, a principal objective of a design strategy may be the generation of quality diversity. At a simplistic level this can be thought of as stacking the odds in one's favor. As an example, perturbation of the Fc carbohydrate or a particular domain-domain angle, as described below, are valid design strategies for generating optimized Fc variants, despite the fact that how carbohydrate and domain-domain angles determine the properties of Fc is not well understood. By reducing the number of detrimental amino acid modifications that are screened, i.e. by screening quality diversity, these design strategies become practical. Thus the true value of the design strategies taught in the present invention is their ability to direct engineering efforts towards the generation of valuable Fc variants. The specific value of any one resulting variant is determined after experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne design strategy for engineering Fc variants is provided in which interaction of Fc with some Fc ligand is altered by engineering amino acid modifications at the interface between Fc and said Fc ligand. Fc ligands herein may include but are not limited to FcγRs, C1q, FcRn, protein A or G, and the like. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at Fc positions that impact the binding interface, variants can be engineered that sample new interface conformations, some of which may improve binding to the Fc ligand, some of which may reduce Fc ligand binding, and some of which may have other favorable properties. Such new interface conformations could be the result of, for example, direct interaction with Fc ligand residues that form the interface, or indirect effects caused by the amino acid modifications such as perturbation of side chain or backbone conformations. Variable positions may be chosen as any positions that are believed to play an important role in determining the conformation of the interface. For example, variable positions may be chosen as the set of residues that are within a certain distance, for example 5 Angstroms (A), preferrably between 1 and 10 A, of any residue that makes direct contact with the Fc ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn additional design strategy for generating Fc variants is provided in which the conformation of the Fc carbohydrate at N297 is optimized. Optimization as used in this context is meant to includes conformational and compositional changes in the N297 carbohydrate that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an FcγR. Such a strategy is supported by the observation that the carbohydrate structure and conformation dramatically affect Fc/FcγR and Fc/C1 q binding (\nUmaña et al., 1999, Nat Biotechnol 17:176-180\n;\n Davies et al., 2001, Biotechnol Bioeng 74:288-294\n; \nMimura et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:45539-45547\n.; \nRadaev et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:16478-16483\n; \nShields et al., 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740\n; \nShinkawa et al., 2003, J Biol Chem 278:3466-3473\n). However the carbohydrate makes no specific contacts with FcγRs. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at positions that interact with carbohydrate, a quality diversity of variants can be engineered that sample new carbohydrate conformations, some of which may improve and some of which may reduce binding to one or more Fc ligands. While the majority of mutations near the Fc/carbohydrate interface appear to alter carbohydrate conformation, some mutations have been shown to alter the glycosylation composition (\nLund et al., 1996, J Immunol 157:4963-4969\n; \nJefferis er a/., 2002, Immunol Lett 82:57-65\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother design strategy for generating Fc variants is provided in which the angle between the Cγ2 and Cγ3 domains is optimized Optimization as used in this context is meant to describe conformational changes in the Cγ2-Cγ3 domain angle that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an FcγR. This angle is an important determinant of Fc/FcγR affinity (\nRadaev et a/., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:16478-16483\n), and a number of mutations distal to the Fc/FcγR interface affect binding potentially by modulating it (\nShields et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604\n). By exploring energetically favorable substitutions positions that appear to play a key role in determining the Cγ2-Cγ3 angle and the flexibility of the domains relative to one another, a quality diversity of variants can be designed that sample new angles and levels of flexibility, some of which may be optimized for a desired Fc property.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother design strategy for generating Fc variants is provided in which Fc is reengineered to eliminate the structural and functional dependence on glycosylation. This design strategy involves the optimization of Fc structure, stability, solubility, and/or Fc function (for example affinity of Fc for one or more Fc ligands) in the absence of the N297 carbohydrate. In one approach, positions that are exposed to solvent in the absence of glycosylation are engineered such that they are stable, structurally consistent with Fc structure, and have no tendency to aggregate. The Cγ2 is the only unpaired Ig domain in the antibody (see \nFigure 1\n). Thus the N297 carbohydrate covers up the exposed hydrophobic patch that would normally be the interface for a protein-protein interaction with another Ig domain, maintaining the stability and structural integrity of Fc and keeping the Cγ2 domains from aggregating across the central axis. Approaches for optimizing aglycosylated Fc may involve but are not limited to designing amino acid modifications that enhance aglycoslated Fc stability and/or solubility by incorporating polar and/or charged residues that face inward towards the Cγ2-Cγ2 dimer axis, and by designing amino acid modifications that directly enhance the aglycosylated Fc/FcγR interface or the interface of aglycosylated Fc with some other Fc ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn additional design strategy for engineering Fc variants is provided in which the conformation of the Cγ2 domain is optimized Optimization as used in this context is meant to describe conformational changes in the Cγ2 domain angle that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an FcγR. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at Cγ2 positions that impact the Cγ2 conformation, a quality diversity of variants can be engineered that sample new Cγ2 conformations, some of which may achieve the design goal. Such new Cγ2 conformations could be the result of, for example, alternate backbone conformations that are sampled by the variant. Variable positions may be chosen as any positions that are believed to play an important role in determining C□2 structure, stability, solubility, flexibility, function, and the like. For example, Cγ2 hydrophobic core residues, that is Cγ2 residues that are partially or fully sequestered from solvent, may be reengineered. Alternatively, noncore residues may be considered, or residues that are deemed important for determining backbone structure, stability, or flexibility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn additional design strategy for Fc optimization is provided in which binding to an FcγR, complement, or some other Fc ligand is altered by modifications that modulate the electrostatic interaction between Fc and said Fc ligand. Such modifications may be thought of as optimization of the global electrostatic character of Fc, and include replacement of neutral amino acids with a charged amino acid, replacement of a charged amino acid with a neutral amino acid, or replacement of a charged amino acid with an amino acid of opposite charge (i.e. charge reversal). Such modifications may be used to effect changes in binding affinity between an Fc and one or more Fc ligands, for example FcγRs. In a preferred embodiment, positions at which electrostatic substitutions might affect binding are selected using one of a variety of well known methods for calculation of electrostatic potentials. In the simplest embodiment, Coulomb's law is used to generate electrostatic potentials as a function of the position in the protein. Additional embodiments include the use of Debye-Huckel scaling to account for ionic strength effects, and more sophisticated embodiments such as Poisson-Boltzmann calculations. Such electrostatic calculations may highlight positions and suggest specific amino acid modifications to achieve the design goal. In some cases, these substitutions may be anticipated to variably affect binding to different Fc ligands, for example to enhance binding to activating FcγRs while decreasing binding affinity to inhibitory FcγRs.\n\n\n \n\n\nComputational Screening\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA principal obstacle to obtaining valuable Fc variants is the difficulty in predicting what amino acid modifications, out of the enormous number of possibilities, will achieve the desired goals. Indeed one of the principle reasons that previous attempts at Fc engineering have failed to produce Fc variants of significant clinical value is that approaches to Fc engineering have thus far involved hit-or-miss approaches. The present invention provides computational screening methods that enable quantitative and systematic engineering of Fc variants. These methods typically use atomic level scoring functions, side chain rotamer sampling, and advanced optimization methods to accurately capture the relationships between protein sequence, structure, and function. Computational screening enables exploration of the entire sequence space of possibilities at target positions by filtering the enormous diversity which results. Variant libraries that are screened computationally are effectively enriched for stable, properly folded, and functional sequences, allowing active optimization of Fc for a desired goal. Because of the overlapping sequence constraints on protein structure, stability, solubility, and function, a large number of the candidates in a library occupy \"wasted\" sequence space. For example, a large fraction of sequence space encodes unfolded, misfolded, incompletely folded, partially folded, or aggregated proteins. This is particularly relevant for Fc engineering because Ig domains are small beta sheet structures, the engineering of which has proven extremely demanding (\nQuinn et al., 1994, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 91:8747-8751\n; \nRichardson et al., 2002, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 99:2754-2759\n). Even seemingly harmless substitutions on the surface of a beta sheet can cause severe packing conflicts, dramatically disrupting folding equilibrium (\nSmith et al., 1995, Science 270:980-982\n); incidentally, alanine is one of the worst beta sheet formers (\nMinor et al., 1994, Nature 371:264-267\n). The determinants of beta sheet stability and specificity are a delicate balance between an extremely large number of subtle interactions. Computational screening enables the generation of libraries that are composed primarily of productive sequence space, and as a result increases the chances of identifying proteins that are optimized for the design goal. In effect, computational screening yields an increased hit-rate, thereby decreasing the number of variants that must be screened experimentally. An additional obstacle to Fc engineering is the need for active design of correlated or coupled mutations. For example, the greatest Fc/FcγR affinity enhancement observed thus far is S298A/E333A/K334A, obtained by combining three better binders obtained separately in an alanine scan (\nShields et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604\n). Computational screening is capable of generating such a three-fold variant in one experiment instead of three separate ones, and furthermore is able to test the functionality of all 20 amino acids at those positions instead of just alanine. Computational screening deals with such complexity by reducing the combinatorial problem to an experimentally tractable size.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComputational screening, viewed broadly, has four steps: 1) selection and preparation of the protein template structure or structures, 2) selection of variable positions, amino acids to be considered at those positions, and/or selection of rotamers to model considered amino acids, 3) energy calculation, and 4) combinatorial optimization. In more detail, the process of computational screening can be described as follows. A three-dimensional structure of a protein is used as the starting point. The positions to be optimized are identified, which may be the entire protein sequence or subset(s) thereof. Amino acids that will be considered at each position are selected. In a preferred embodiment, each considered amino acid may be represented by a discrete set of allowed conformations, called rotamers. Interaction energies are calculated between each considered amino acid and each other considered amino acid, and the rest of the protein, including the protein backbone and invariable residues. In a preferred embodiment, interaction energies are calculated between each considered amino acid side chain rotamer and each other considered amino acid side chain rotamer and the rest of the protein, including the protein backbone and invariable residues. One or more combinatorial search algorithms are then used to identify the lowest energy sequence and/or low energy sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the computational screening method used is substantially similar to Protein Design Automation® (PDA®) technology, as is described in \n \nUS 6,188,965\n \n; \n \nUS 6,269,312\n \n; \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 98/07254\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n. In another preferred embodiment, a computational screening method substantially similar to Sequence Prediction Algorithm™ (SPA™) technology is used, as is described in (\nRaha et al., 2000, Protein Sci 9:1106-1119\n), \n \nUSSN 09/877,695\n \n, and \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/071,859\n \n. In another preferred embodiment, the computational screening methods described in \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/339788, filed on March 3, 2003\n \n, entitled \"ANTIBODY OPTIMIZATION\", are used. In some embodiments, combinations of different computational screening methods are used, including combinations of PDA® technology and SPA™ technology, as well as combinations of these computational methods in combination with other design tools. Similarly, these computational methods can be used simultaneously or sequentially, in any order.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA template structure is used as input into the computational screening calculations. By \"\ntemplate structure\"\n herein is meant the structural coordinates of part or all of a protein to be optimized. The template structure may be any protein for which a three dimensional structure (that is, three dimensional coordinates for a set of the protein's atoms) is known or may be calculated, estimated, modeled, generated, or determined. The three dimensional structures of proteins may be determined using methods including but not limited to X-ray crystallographic techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, \nde novo\n modeling, and homology modeling. If optimization is desired for a protein for which the structure has not been solved experimentally, a suitable structural model may be generated that may serve as the template for computational screening calculations. Methods for generating homology models of proteins are known in the art, and these methods find use in the present invention. See for example,\n Luo, et al. 2002, Protein Sci 11: 1218-1226\n, \nLehmann & Wyss, 2001, Curr Opin Biotechnol 12(4):371-5\n.; \nLehmann et al., 2000, Biochim Biophys Acta 1543(2):408-415\n;\n Rath & Davidson, 2000, Protein Sci, 9(12):2457-69\n; \nLehmann et al., 2000, Protein Eng 13(1):49-57\n; \nDesjarlais & Berg, 1993, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90(6):2256-60\n; \nDesjarlais & Berg, 1992, Proteins 12(2):101-4\n; \nHenikoff & Henikoff, 2000, Adv Protein Chem 54:73-97\n;\n Henikoff & Henikoff, 1994, J Mol Biol 243(4):574-8\n; \nMorea et al., 2000, Methods 20:267-269\n. Protein/protein complexes may also be obtained using docking methods. Suitable protein structures that may serve as template structures include, but are not limited to, all of those found in the Protein Data Base compiled and serviced by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB, formerly the Brookhaven National Lab).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe template structure may be of a protein that occurs naturally or is engineered. The template structure may be of a protein that is substantially encoded by a protein from any organism, with human, mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey preferred. The template structure may comprise any of a number of protein structural forms. In a preferred embodiment the template structure comprises an Fc region or a domain or fragment of Fc. In an alternately preferred embodiment the template structure comprises Fc or a domain or fragment of Fc bound to one or more Fc ligands, with an Fc/FcγR complex being preferred. The Fc in the template structure may be glycosylated or unglycosylated. The template structure may comprise more than one protein chain. The template structure may additionally contain nonprotein components, including but not limited to small molecules, substrates, cofactors, metals, water molecules, prosthetic groups, polymers and carbohydrates. In a preferred embodiment, the template structure is a plurality or set of template proteins, for example an ensemble of structures such as those obtained from NMR. Alternatively, the set of template structures is generated from a set of related proteins or structures, or artificially created ensembles. The composition and source of the template structure depends on the engineering goal. For example, for enhancement of human Fc/FcγR affinity, a human Fc/FcγR complex structure or derivative thereof may be used as the template structure. Alternatively, the uncomplexed Fc structure may be used as the template structure. If the goal is to enhance affinity of a human Fc for a mouse FcγR, the template structure may be a structure or model of a human Fc bound to a mouse FcγR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe template structure may be modified or altered prior to design calculations. A variety of methods for template structure preparation are described in \n \nUS 6,188,965\n \n; \n \nUS 6,269,312\n \n; \n \nUS 6,403.312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/877,695\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/071,859\n \n, \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 98/07254\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n. For example, in a preferred embodiment, explicit hydrogens may be added if not included within the structure. In an alternate embodiment, energy minimization of the structure is run to relax strain, including strain due to van der Waals clashes, unfavorable bond angles, and unfavorable bond lengths. Alternatively, the template structure is altered using other methods, such as manually, including directed or random perturbations. It is also possible to modify the template structure during later steps of computational screening, including during the energy calculation and combinatorial optimization steps. In an alternate embodiment, the template structure is not modified before or during computational screening calculations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce a template structure has been obtained, variable positions are chosen. By \"\nvariable position\"\n herein is meant a position at which the amino acid identity is allowed to be altered in a computational screening calculation. As is known in the art, allowing amino acid modifications to be considered only at certain variable positions reduces the complexity of a calculation and enables computational screening to be more directly tailored for the design goal. One or more residues may be variable positions in computational screening calculations. Positions that are chosen as variable positions may be those that contribute to or are hypothesized to contribute to the protein property to be optimized, for example Fc affinity for an FcγR, Fc stability, Fc solubility, and so forth. Residues at variable positions may contribute favorably or unfavorably to a specific protein property. For example, a residue at an Fc/FcγR interface may be involved in mediating binding, and thus this position may be varied in design calculations aimed at improving Fc/FcγR affinity. As another example, a residue that has an exposed hydrophobic side chain may be responsible for causing unfavorable aggregation, and thus this position may be varied in design calculations aimed at improving solubility. Variable positions may be those positions that are directly involved in interactions that are determinants of a particular protein property. For example, the FcγR binding site of Fc may be defined to include all residues that contact that particular FγcR. By \"\ncontact\n\" herein is meant some chemical interaction between at least one atom of an Fc residue with at least one atom of the bound FcγR, with chemical interaction including, but not limited to van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bond interactions, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions. In an alternative embodiment, variable positions may include those positions that are indirectly involved in a protein property, i.e. such positions may be proximal to residues that are known to or hypothesized to contribute to an Fc property. For example, the FcγR binding site of an Fc may be defined to include all Fc residues within a certain distance, for example 4 - 10 A, of any Fc residue that is in van der Waals contact with the FcγR. Thus variable positions in this case may be chosen not only as residues that directly contact the FcγR, but also those that contact residues that contact the FcγR and thus influence binding indirectly. The specific positions chosen are dependent on the design strategy being employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more positions in the template structure that are not variable may be floated. By \"\nfloated position\n\" herein is meant a position at which the amino acid conformation but not the amino acid identity is allowed to vary in a computational screening calculation. In one embodiment, the floated position may have the parent amino acid identity. For example, floated positions may be positions that are within a small distance, for example 5 A, of a variable position residue. In an alternate embodiment, a floated position may have a non-parent amino acid identity. Such an embodiment may find use in the present invention, for example, when the goal is to evaluate the energetic or structural outcome of a specific mutation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPositions that are not variable or floated are fixed. By \"\nfixed position\"\n herein is meant a position at which the amino acid identity and the conformation are held constant in a computational screening calculation. Positions that may be fixed include residues that are not known to be or hypothesized to be involved in the property to be optimized. In this case the assumption is that there is little or nothing to be gained by varying these positions. Positions that are fixed may also include positions whose residues are known or hypothesized to be important for maintaining proper folding, structure, stability, solubility, and/or biological function. For example, positions may be fixed for residues that interact with a particular Fc ligand or residues that encode a glycosylation site in order to ensure that binding to the Fc ligand and proper glycosylation respectively are not perturbed. Likewise, if stability is being optimized, it may be beneficial to fix positions that directly or indirectly interact with an Fc ligand, for example an FcγR, so that binding is not perturbed. Fixed positions may also include structurally important residues such as cysteines participating in disulfide bridges, residues critical for determining backbone conformation such as proline or glycine, critical hydrogen bonding residues, and residues that form favorable packing interactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe next step in computational screening is to select a set of possible amino acid identities that will be considered at each particular variable position. This set of possible amino acids is herein referred to as \"\nconsidered amino acids\"\n at a variable position. \"\nAmino acids\"\n as used herein refers to the set of natural 20 amino acids and any nonnatural or synthetic analogues. In one embodiment, all 20 natural amino acids are considered. Alternatively, a subset of amino acids, or even only one amino acid is considered at a given variable position. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, there is a computational benefit to considering only certain amino acid identities at variable positions, as it decreases the combinatorial complexity of the search. Furthermore, considering only certain amino acids at variable positions may be used to tailor calculations toward specific design strategies. For example, for solubility optimization of aglycosylated Fc, it may be beneficial to allow only polar amino acids to be considered at nonpolar Fc residues that are exposed to solvent in the absence of carbohydrate. Nonnatural amino acids, including synthetic amino acids and analogues of natural amino acids, may also be considered amino acids. For example see \nChin et al., 2003, Science, 301(5635):964-7\n; and \nChin et al., 2003, Chem Biol. 10(6):511-9\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of methods may be used, alone or in combination, to select which amino acids will be considered at each position. For example, the set of considered amino acids at a given variable position may be chosen based on the degree of exposure to solvent. Hydrophobic or nonpolar amino acids typically reside in the interior or core of a protein, which are inaccessible or nearly inaccessible to solvent. Thus at variable core positions it may be beneficial to consider only or mostly nonpolar amino acids such as alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine. Hydrophilic or polar amino acids typically reside on the exterior or surface of proteins, which have a significant degree of solvent accessibility. Thus at variable surface positions it may be beneficial to consider only or mostly polar amino acids such as alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine and histidine. Some positions are partly exposed and partly buried, and are not clearly protein core or surface positions, in a sense serving as boundary residues between core and surface residues. Thus at such variable boundary positions it may be beneficial to consider both nonpolar and polar amino acids such as alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine histidine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine. Determination of the degree of solvent exposure at variable positions may be by subjective evaluation or visual inspection of the template structure by one skilled in the art of protein structural biology, or by using a variety of algorithms that are known in the art. Selection of amino acid types to be considered at variable positions may be aided or determined wholly by computational methods, such as calculation of solvent accessible surface area, or using algorithms that assess the orientation of the C□-C□ vectors relative to a solvent accessible surface, as outlined in \n \nUS 6,188,965\n \n; \n \n6,269,312\n \n; \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 98/07254\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n. In one embodiment, each variable position may be classified explicitly as a core, surface, or boundary position or a classification substantially similar to core, surface, or boundary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternate embodiment, selection of the set of amino acids allowed at variable positions may be hypothesis-driven. Hypotheses for which amino acid types should be considered at variable positions may be derived by a subjective evaluation or visual inspection of the template structure by one skilled in the art of protein structural biology. For example, if it is suspected that a hydrogen bonding interaction may be favorable at a variable position, polar residues that have the capacity to form hydrogen bonds may be considered, even if the position is in the core. Likewise, if it is suspected that a hydrophobic packing interaction may be favorable at a variable position, nonpolar residues that have the capacity to form favorable packing interactions may be considered, even if the position is on the surface. Other examples of hypothesis-driven approaches may involve issues of backbone flexibility or protein fold. As is known in the art, certain residues, for example proline, glycine, and cysteine, play important roles in protein structure and stability. Glycine enables greater backbone flexibility than all other amino acids, proline constrains the backbone more than all other amino acids, and cysteines may form disulfide bonds. It may therefore be beneficial to include one or more of these amino acid types to achieve a desired design goal. Alternatively, it may be beneficial to exclude one or more of these amino acid types from the list of considered amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternate embodiment, subsets of amino acids may be chosen to maximize coverage. In this case, additional amino acids with properties similar to that in the template structure may be considered at variable positions. For example, if the residue at a variable position in the template structure is a large hydrophobic residue, additional large hydrophobic amino acids may be considered at that position. Alternatively, subsets of amino acids may be chosen to maximize diversity. In this case, amino acids with properties dissimilar to those in the template structure may be considered at variable positions. For example, if the residue at a variable position in the template is a large hydrophobic residue, amino acids that are small, polar, etc. may be considered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is known in the art, some computational screening methods require only the identity of considered amino acids to be determined during design calculations. That is, no information is required concerning the conformations or possible conformations of the amino acid side chains. Other preferred methods utilize a set of discrete side chain conformations, called rotamers, which are considered for each amino acid. Thus, a set of rotamers may be considered at each variable and floated position. Rotamers may be obtained from published rotamer libraries (see for example,\n Lovel et al., 2000, Proteins: Structure Function and Genetics 40:389-408\n;\n Dunbrack & Cohen, 1997, Protein Science 6:1661-1681\n; \nDeMaeyer et al., 1997, Folding and Design 2:53-66\n; \nTuffery et al., 1991, J Biomol Struct Dyn 8:1267-1289\n, \nPonder & Richards, 1987, J Mol Biol 193:775-791\n). As is known in the art, rotamer libraries may be backbone-independent or backbone-dependent. Rotamers may also be obtained from molecular mechanics or \nab initio\n calculations, and using other methods. In a preferred embodiment, a flexible rotamer model is used (see \nMendes et al., 1999, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics 37:530-543\n). Similarly, artificially generated rotamers may be used, or augment the set chosen for each amino acid and/or variable position. In one embodiment, at least one conformation that is not low in energy is included in the list of rotamers. In an alternate embodiment, the rotamer of the variable position residue in the template structure is included in the list of rotamers allowed for that variable position. In an alternate embodiment, only the identity of each amino acid considered at variable positions is provided, and no specific conformational states of each amino acid are used during design calculations. That is, use of rotamers is not essential for computational screening.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExperimental information may be used to guide the choice of variable positions and/or the choice of considered amino acids at variable positions. As is known in the art, mutagenesis experiments are often carried out to determine the role of certain residues in protein structure and function, for example, which protein residues play a role in determining stability, or which residues make up the interface of a protein-protein interaction. Data obtained from such experiments are useful in the present invention. For example, variable positions for Fc/FcγR affinity enhancement could involve varying all positions at which mutation has been shown to affect binding. Similarly, the results from such an experiment may be used to guide the choice of allowed amino acid types at variable positions. For example, if certain types of amino acid substitutions are found to be favorable, similar types of those amino acids may be considered. In one embodiment, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that were found to be favorable experimentally may be considered at variable positions. For example, if experimental mutation of a variable position at an Fc/FcγR interface to a large hydrophobic residue was found to be favorable, the user may choose to Include additional large hydrophobic amino acids at that position in the computational screen. As is known in the art, display and other selection technologies may be coupled with random mutagenesis to generate a list or lists of amino acid substitutions that are favorable for the selected property. Such a list or lists obtained from such experimental work find use in the present invention. For example, positions that are found to be invariable in such an experiment may be excluded as variable positions in computational screening calculations, whereas positions that are found to be more acceptable to mutation or respond favorably to mutation may be chosen as variable positions. Similarly, the results from such experiments may be used to guide the choice of allowed amino acid types at variable positions. For example, if certain types of amino acids arise more frequently in an experimental selection, similar types of those amino acids may be considered. In one embodiment, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that were found to be favorable experimentally may be considered at variable positions. For example, if selected mutations at a variable position that resides at an Fc/FcγR interface are found to be uncharged polar amino acids, the user may choose to include additional uncharged polar amino acids, or perhaps charged polar amino acids, at that position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequence information may also be used to guide choice of variable positions and/or the choice of amino acids considered at variable positions. As is known in the art, some proteins share a common structural scaffold and are homologous in sequence. This information may be used to gain insight into particular positions in the protein family. As is known in the art, sequence alignments are often carried out to determine which protein residues are conserved and which are not conserved. That is to say, by comparing and contrasting alignments of protein sequences, the degree of variability at a position may be observed, and the types of amino acids that occur naturally at positions may be observed. Data obtained from such analyses are useful in the present invention. The benefit of using sequence Information to choose variable positions and considered amino acids at variable positions are several fold. For choice of variable positions, the primary advantage of using sequence information is that insight may be gained into which positions are more tolerant and which are less tolerant to mutation. Thus sequence information may aid in ensuring that quality diversity, i.e. mutations that are not deleterious to protein structure, stability, etc., is sampled computationally. The same advantage applies to use of sequence information to select amino acid types considered at variable positions. That is, the set of amino acids that occur in a protein sequence alignment may be thought of as being pre-screened by evolution to have a higher chance than random for being compatible with a protein's structure, stability, solubility, function, etc. Thus higher quality diversity is sampled computationally. A second benefit of using sequence information to select amino acid types considered at variable positions is that certain alignments may represent sequences that may be less immunogenic than random sequences. For example, if the amino acids considered at a given variable position are the set of amino acids which occur at that position in an alignment of human protein sequences, those amino acids may be thought of as being pre-screened by nature for generating no or low immune response if the optimized protein is used as a human therapeutic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe source of the sequences may vary widely, and include one or more of the known databases, including but not limited to the Kabat database (\nJohnson & Wu, 2001, Nucleic Acids Res 29:205-206\n; \nJohnson & Wu, 2000, Nucleic Acids Res 28:214-218\n), the IMGT database (IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®; \nLefranc et al., 1999, Nucleic Acids Res 27:209-212\n; \nRuiz et al., 2000 Nucleic Acids Re. 28:219-221\n;\n Lefranc et al., 2001, Nucleic Acids Res 29:207-209\n; \nLefranc et al., 2003, Nucleic Acids Res 31:307-310\n), and VBASE, SwissProt, GenBank and Entrez, and EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database. Protein sequence information can be obtained, compiled, and/or generated from sequence alignments of naturally occurring proteins from any organism, including but not limited to mammals. Protein sequence information can be obtained from a database that is compiled privately. There are numerous sequence-based alignment programs and methods known in the art, and all of these find use in the present invention for generation of sequence alignments of proteins that comprise Fc and Fc ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce alignments are made, sequence information can be used to guide choice of variable positions. Such sequence information can relate the variability, natural or otherwise, of a given position. Variability herein should be distinguished from variable position. Variability refers to the degree to which a given position in a sequence alignment shows variation in the types of amino acids that occur there. Variable position, to reiterate, is a position chosen by the user to vary in amino acid identity during a computational screening calculation. Variability may be determined qualitatively by one skilled in the art of bioinformatics. There are also methods known in the art to quantitatively determine variability that may find use in the present invention. The most preferred embodiment measures Information Entropy or Shannon Entropy. Variable positions can be chosen based on sequence information obtained from closely related protein sequences, or sequences that are less closely related.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of sequence information to choose variable positions finds broad use in the present invention. For example, if an Fc/FcγR interface position in the template structure is tryptophan, and tryptophan Is observed at that position in greater than 90% of the sequences in an alignment, it may be beneficial to leave that position fixed. In contrast, if another interface position is found to have a greater level of variability, for example if five different amino acids are observed at that position with frequencies of approximately 20% each, that position may be chosen as a variable position. In another embodiment, visual inspection of aligned protein sequences may substitute for or aid visual inspection of a protein structure. Sequence information can also be used to guide the choice of amino acids considered at variable positions. Such sequence information can relate to how frequently an amino acid, amino acids, or amino acid types (for example polar or nonpolar, charged or uncharged) occur, naturally or otherwise, at a given position. In one embodiment, the set of amino acids considered at a variable position may comprise the set of amino acids that is observed at that position in the alignment. Thus, the position-specific alignment information is used directly to generate the list of considered amino acids at a variable position in a computational screening calculation. Such a strategy is well known in the art; see for example \nLehmann & Wyss, 2001, Curr Opin Biotechnol 12(4):371-5\n; \nLehmann et al., 2000, Biochim Biophys Acta 1543(2):408-415\n; \nRath & Davidson, 2000, Protein Sci, 9(12):2457-69\n; \nLehmann et al., 2000, Protein Eng 13(1):49-57\n; \nDesjarlais & Berg, 1993, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90(6):2256-60\n; \nDesjarlais & Berg, 1992, Proteins 12(2):101-4\n;\n Henikoff & Henikoff, 2000, Adv Protein Chem 54:73-97\n; \nHenikoff & Henikoff, 1994, J Mol Biol 243(4):574-8\n. In an alternate embodiment, the set of amino acids considered at a variable position or positions may comprise a set of amino acids that is observed most frequently in the alignment. Thus, a certain criteria is applied to determine whether the frequency of an amino acid or amino acid type warrants its inclusion in the set of amino acids that are considered at a variable position. As is known in the art, sequence alignments may be analyzed using statistical methods to calculate the sequence diversity at any position in the alignment and the occurrence frequency or probability of each amino acid at a position. Such data may then be used to determine which amino acids types to consider. In the simplest embodiment, these occurrence frequencies are calculated by counting the number of times an amino acid is observed at an alignment position, then dividing by the total number of sequences in the alignment. In other embodiments, the contribution of each sequence, position or amino acid to the counting procedure is weighted by a variety of possible mechanisms. In a preferred embodiment, the contribution of each aligned sequence to the frequency statistics is weighted according to its diversity weighting relative to other sequences in the alignment. A common strategy for accomplishing this is the sequence weighting system recommended by Henikoff and Henikoff (\nHenikoff & Henikoff, 2000, Adv Protein Chem 54:73-97\n;\n Henikoff & Henikoff, 1994, J Mol Biol 243:574-8\n. In a preferred embodiment, the contribution of each sequence to the statistics is dependent on its extent of similarity to the target sequence, i.e. the template structure used, such that sequences with higher similarity to the target sequence are weighted more highly. Examples of similarity measures include, but are not limited to, sequence Identity, BLOSUM similarity score, PAM matrix similarity score, and BLAST score. In an alternate embodiment, the contribution of each sequence to the statistics is dependent on its known physical or functional properties. These properties include, but are not limited to, thermal and chemical stability, contribution to activity, and solubility. For example, when optimizing aglycosylated Fc for solubility, those sequences in an alignment that are known to be most soluble (for example see\n Ewert et al., 2003, J Mol Biol 325:531-553\n), will contribute more heavily to the calculated frequencies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegardless of what criteria are applied for choosing the set of amino acids in a sequence alignment to be considered at variable positions, use of sequence information to choose considered amino acids finds broad use in the present invention. For example, to optimize Fc solubility by replacing exposed nonpolar surface residues, considered amino acids may be chosen as the set of amino acids, or a subset of those amino acids which meet some criteria, that are observed at that position in an alignment of protein sequences. As another example, one or more amino acids may be added or subtracted subjectively from a list of amino acids derived from a sequence alignment in order to maximize coverage. For example, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that are found in a sequence alignment may be considered at variable positions. For example, if an Fc position that is known to or hypothesized to bind an FcγR is observed to have uncharged polar amino acids in a sequence alignment, the user may choose to include additional uncharged polar amino acids in a computational screening calculation, or perhaps charged polar amino acids, at that position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, sequence alignment information is combined with energy calculation, as discussed below. For example, pseudo energies can be derived from sequence information to generate a scoring function. The use of a sequence-based scoring function may assist in significantly reducing the complexity of a calculation. However, as is appreciated by those skilled in the art, the use of a sequence-based scoring function alone may be inadequate because sequence information can often indicate misleading correlations between mutations that may in reality be structurally conflicting. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, a structure-based method of energy calculation is used, either alone or in combination with a sequence-based scoring function. That is, preferred embodiments do not rely on sequence alignment information alone as the analysis step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnergy calculation refers to the process by which amino acid modifications are scored. The energies of interaction are measured by one or more scoring functions. A variety of scoring functions find use in the present invention for calculating energies. Scoring functions may include any number of potentials, herein referred to as the energy terms of a scoring function, including but not limited to a van der Waals potential, a hydrogen bond potential, an atomic solvation potential or other solvation models, a secondary structure propensity potential, an electrostatic potential, a torsional potential, and an entropy potential. At least one energy term is used to score each variable or floated position, although the energy terms may differ depending on the position, considered amino acids, and other considerations. In one embodiment, a scoring function using one energy term is used. In the most preferred embodiment, energies are calculated using a scoring function that contains more than one energy term, for example describing van der Waals, solvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions, and combinations thereof. In additional embodiments, additional energy terms include but are not limited to entropic terms, torsional energies, and knowledge-based energies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of scoring functions are described in \n \nUS 6,188,965\n \n; \n \nUS 6,269,312\n \n; \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/877,695\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/071,859\n \n, \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; PCT \n \nWO 98/07254\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, scoring functions need not be limited to physico-chemical energy terms. For example, knowledge-based potentials may find use in the computational screening methodology of the present invention. Such knowledge-based potentials may be derived from protein sequence and/or structure statistics including but not limited to threading potentials, reference energies, pseudo energies, homology-based energies, and sequence biases derived from sequence alignments. In a preferred embodiment, a scoring function Is modified to include models for immunogenicity, such as functions derived from data on binding of peptides to MHC (Major Htocompatability Complex), that may be used to identify potentially immunogenic sequences (see for example \n \nUSSN 09/903,378\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/039,170\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 60/222,697\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/339788\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/21823\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/00165\n \n). In one embodiment, sequence alignment information can be used to score amino acid substitutions. For example, comparison of protein sequences, regardless of whether the source of said proteins is human, monkey, mouse, or otherwise, may be used to suggest or score amino acid mutations in the computational screening methodology of the present invention. In one embodiment, as is known in the art, one or more scoring functions may be optimized or \"trained\" during the computational analysis, and then the analysis re-run using the optimized system. Such altered scoring functions may be obtained for example, by training a scoring function using experimental data. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a number of force fields, which are comprised of one or more energy terms, may serve as scoring functions. Force fields include but are not limited to \nab initio\n or quantum mechanical force fields, semi-empirical force fields, and molecular mechanics force fields. Scoring functions that are knowledge-based or that use statistical methods may find use in the present invention. These methods may be used to assess the match between a sequence and a three-dimensional protein structure, and hence may be used to score amino acid substitutions for fidelity to the protein structure. In one embodiment, molecular dynamics calculations may be used to computationally screen sequences by individually calculating mutant sequence scores.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are a variety of ways to represent amino acids in order to enable efficient energy calculation. In a preferred embodiment, considered amino acids are represented as rotamers, as described previously, and the energy (or score) of interaction of each possible rotamer at each variable and floated position with the other variable and floated rotamers, with fixed position residues, and with the backbone structure and any non-protein atoms, is calculated. In a preferred embodiment, two sets of interaction energies are calculated for each side chain rotamer at every variable and floated position: the interaction energy between the rotamer and the fixed atoms (the \"singles\" energy), and the interaction energy between the variable and floated positions rotamer and all other possible rotamers at every other variable and floated position (the \"doubles\" energy). In an alternate embodiment, singles and doubles energies are calculated for fixed positions as well as for variable and floated positions. In an alternate embodiment, considered amino acids are not represented as rotamers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn important component of computational screening is the identification of one or more sequences that have a favorable score, i.e. are low in energy. Determining a set of low energy sequences from an extremely large number of possibilities is nontrivial, and to solve this problem a combinatorial optimization algorithm is employed. The need for a combinatorial optimization algorithm is illustrated by examining the number of possibilities that are considered in a typical computational screening calculation. The discrete nature of rotamer sets allows a simple calculation of the number of possible rotamerlc sequences for a given design problem. A backbone of length n with m possible rotamers per position will have m\nn\n possible rotamer sequences, a number that grows exponentially with sequence length. For very simple calculations, it is possible to examine each possible sequence in order to identify the optimal sequence and/or one or more favorable sequences. However, for a typical design problem, the number of possible sequences (up to 10\n80\n or more) is sufficiently large that examination of each possible sequence is intractable. A variety of combinatorial optimization algorithms may then be used to identify the optimum sequence and/or one or more favorable sequences. Combinatorial optimization algorithms may be divided into two classes: (1) those that are guaranteed to return the global minimum energy configuration if they converge, and (2) those that are not guaranteed to return the global minimum energy configuration, but which will always return a solution. Examples of the first class of algorithms include but are not limited to Dead-End Elimination (DEE) and Branch & Bound (B&B) (including Branch and Terminate) (\nGordon & Mayo, 1999, Structure Fold Des 7:1089-98\n). Examples of the second class of algorithms include, but are not limited to, Monte Carlo (MC), self-consistent mean field (SCMF), Boltzmann sampling (\nMetropolis et al., 1953, J Chem Phys 21:1087\n), simulated annealing (\nKirkpatrick et al., 1983, Science, 220:671-680\n), genetic algorithm (GA), and Fast and Accurate Side-Chain Topology and Energy Refinement (FASTER) (\nDesmet, et al., 2002, Proteins, 48:31-43\n). A combinatorial optimization algorithm may be used alone or in conjunction with another combinatorial optimization algorithm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the strategy for applying a combinatorial optimization algorithm is to find the global minimum energy configuration. In an alternate embodiment, the strategy is to find one or more low energy or favorable sequences. In an alternate embodiment, the strategy is to find the global minimum energy configuration and then find one or more low energy or favorable sequences. For example, as outlined in \n \nUSSN 6,269,312\n \n, preferred embodiments utilize a Dead End Elimination (DEE) step and a Monte Carlo step. In other embodiments, tabu search algorithms are used or combined with DEE and/or Monte Carlo, among other search methods (see \nModern Heuristic Search Methods, edited by V.J. Rayward-Smith et al., 1996, John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n). In another preferred embodiment, a genetic algorithm may be used; see for example \n \nUSSN 09/877,695\n \n and \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/071,859\n \n. As another example, as is more fully described in \n \nUS 6,188,965\n \n; \n \nUS 6,269,312\n \n; \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 98/07254\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n, the global optimum may be reached, and then further computational processing may occur, which generates additional optimized sequences. In the simplest embodiment, design calculations are not combinatorial. That is, energy calculations are used to evaluate amino acid substitutions individually at single variable positions. For other calculations it is preferred to evaluate amino acid substitutions at more than one variable position. In a preferred embodiment, all possible interaction energies are calculated prior to combinatorial optimization. In an alternatively preferred embodiment, energies may be calculated as needed during combinatorial optimization.\n\n\n \n\n\nLibrary generation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods for generating libraries that may subsequently be screened experimentally to single out optimized Fc variants. By \"\nlibrary\n\" as used herein is meant a set of one or more Fc variants. Library may refer to the set of variants in any form. In one embodiment, the library is a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, or a list of nucleic acid or amino acid substitutions at variable positions. For example, the examples used to illustrate the present invention below provide libraries as amino acid substitutions at variable positions. In one embodiment, a library is a list of at least one sequence that are Fc variants optimized for a desired property. For example see, \nFilikov et al., 2002, Protein Sci 11:1452-1461\n and\n Luo et al., 2002, Protein Sci 11:1218-1226\n. In an alternate embodiment, a library may be defined as a combinatorial list, meaning that a list of amino acid substitutions is generated for each variable position, with the implication that each substitution is to be combined with all other designed substitutions at all other variable positions. In this case, expansion of the combination of all possibilities at all variable positions results in a large explicitly defined library. A library may refer to a physical composition of polypeptides that comprise the Fc region or some domain or fragment of the Fc region. Thus a library may refer to a physical composition of antibodies or Fc fusions, either in purified or unpurified form. A library may refer to a physical composition of nucleic acids that encode the library sequences. Said nucleic acids may be the genes encoding the library members, the genes encoding the library members with any operably linked nucleic acids, or expression vectors encoding the library members together with any other operably linked regulatory sequences, selectable markers, fusion constructs, and/or other elements. For example, the library may be a set of mammalian expression vectors that encode Fc library members, the protein products of which may be subsequently expressed, purified, and screened experimentally. As another example, the library may be a display library. Such a library could, for example, comprise a set of expression vectors that encode library members operably linked to some fusion partner that enables phage display, ribosome display, yeast display, bacterial surface display, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe library may be generated using the output sequence or sequences from computational screening. As discussed above, computationally generated libraries are significantly enriched in stable, properly folded, and functional sequences relative to randomly generated libraries. As a result, computational screening increases the chances of identifying proteins that are optimized for the design goal. The set of sequences in a library is generally, but not always, significantly different from the parent sequence, although in some cases the library preferably contains the parent sequence. As is known in the art, there are a variety of ways that a library may be derived from the output of computational screening calculations. For example, methods of library generation described in \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n find use in the present invention. In one embodiment, sequences scoring within a certain range of the global optimum sequence may be included in the library. For example, all sequences within 10 kcal/mol of the lowest energy sequence could be used as the library. In an alternate embodiment, sequences scoring within a certain range of one or more local minima sequences may be used. In a preferred embodiment, the library sequences are obtained from a filtered set. Such a list or set may be generated by a variety of methods, as is known in the art, for example using an algorithm such as Monte Carlo, B&B, or SCMF. For example, the top 10\n3\n or the top 10\n5\n sequences in the filtered set may comprise the library. Alternatively, the total number of sequences defined by the combination of all mutations may be used as a cutoff criterion for the library. Preferred values for the total number of recombined sequences range from 10 to 10\n20\n, particularly preferred values range from 100 to 10\n9\n. Alternatively, a cutoff may be enforced when a predetermined number of mutations per position is reached. In some embodiments, sequences that do not make the cutoff are included in the library. This may be desirable in some situations, for instance to evaluate the approach to library generation, to provide controls or comparisons, or to sample additional sequence space. For example, the parent sequence may be included in the library, even if it does not make the cutoff.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClustering algorithms may be useful for classifying sequences derived by computational screening methods into representative groups. For example, the methods of clustering and their application described in \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n, find use in the present invention. Representative groups may be defined, for example, by similarity. Measures of similarity include, but are not limited to sequence similarity and energetic similarity. Thus the output sequences from computational screening may be clustered around local minima, referred to herein as clustered sets of sequences. For example, sets of sequences that are close in sequence space may be distinguished from other sets. In one embodiment, coverage within one or a subset of clustered sets may be maximized by including in the library some, most, or all of the sequences that make up one or more clustered sets of sequences. For example, it may be advantageous to maximize coverage within the one, two, or three lowest energy clustered sets by including the majority of sequences within these sets in the library. In an alternate embodiment, diversity across clustered sets of sequences may be sampled by including within a library only a subset of sequences within each clustered set. For example, all or most of the clustered sets could be broadly sampled by including the lowest energy sequence from each clustered set in the library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequence information may be used to guide or filter computationally screening results for generation of a library. As discussed, by comparing and contrasting alignments of protein sequences, the degree of variability at a position and the types of amino acids which occur naturally at that position may be observed. Data obtained from such analyses are useful in the present invention. The benefits of using sequence information have been discussed, and those benefits apply equally to use of sequence information to guide library generation. The set of amino acids that occur in a sequence alignment may be thought of as being pre-screened by evolution to have a higher chance than random at being compatible with a protein's structure, stability, solubility, function, and immunogenicity. The variety of sequence sources, as well as the methods for generating sequence alignments that have been discussed, find use in the application of sequence information to guiding library generation. Likewise, as discussed above, various criteria may be applied to determine the importance or weight of certain residues in an alignment. These methods also find use in the application of sequence information to guide library generation. Using sequence information to guide library generation from the results of computational screening finds broad use in the present invention. In one embodiment, sequence information is used to filter sequences from computational screening output. That is to say, some substitutions are subtracted from the computational output to generate the library. For example the resulting output of a computational screening calculation or calculations may be filtered so that the library includes only those amino acids, or a subset of those amino acids that meet some criteria, for example that are observed at that position in an alignment of sequences. In an alternate embodiment, sequence information is used to add sequences to the computational screening output. That is to say, sequence information is used to guide the choice of additional amino acids that are added to the computational output to generate the library. For example, the output set of amino acids for a given position from a computational screening calculation may be augmented to include one or more amino acids that are observed at that position in an alignment of protein sequences. In an alternate embodiment, based on sequence alignment information, one or more amino acids may be added to or subtracted from the computational screening sequence output in order to maximize coverage or diversity. For example, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that are found in a sequence alignment may be added to the library. For example, if a position is observed to have uncharged polar amino acids in a sequence alignment, additional uncharged polar amino acids may be included in the library at that position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLibraries may be processed further to generate subsequent libraries. In this way, the output from a computational screening calculation or calculations may be thought of as a primary library. This primary library may be combined with other primary libraries from other calculations or other libraries, processed using subsequent calculations, sequence information, or other analyses, or processed experimentally to generate a subsequent library, herein referred to as a secondary library. As will be appreciated from this description, the use of sequence information to guide or filter libraries, discussed above, is itself one method of generating secondary libraries from primary libraries. Generation of secondary libraries gives the user greater control of the parameters within a library. This enables more efficient experimental screening, and may allow feedback from experimental results to be interpreted more easily, providing a more efficient design/experimentation cycle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are a wide variety of methods to generate secondary libraries from primary libraries. For example, \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n, describes methods for secondary library generation that find use in the present invention. Typically some selection step occurs in which a primary library is processed in some way. For example, in one embodiment a selection step occurs wherein some set of primary sequences are chosen to form the secondary library. In an alternate embodiment, a selection step is a computational step, again generally including a selection step, wherein some subset of the primary library is chosen and then subjected to further computational analysis, including both further computational screening as well as techniques such as \n\"in silico\"\n shuffling or recombination (see, for example \n \nUS 5,830,721\n \n; \n \nUS 5,811,238\n \n; \n \nUS 5,605,793\n \n; and \n \nUS 5,837,458\n \n, error-prone PCR, for example using modified nucleotides; known mutagenesis techniques including the use of multi-cassettes; and DNA shuffling (\nCrameri et al., 1998, Nature 391:288-291\n; \nCoco et al., 2001, Nat Blotechnol 19:354-9\n;\n Coco et al., 2002, Nat Biotechnol, 20:1246-50\n), heterogeneous DNA samples (\n \nUS 5,939,250\n \n); ITCHY (\nOstermeier et al., 1999, Nat Biotechnol 17:1205-1209\n); StEP (\nZhao et al., 1998, Nat Biotechnol 16:258-261\n), GSSM (\n \nUS 6,171,820\n \n and \n \nUS 5,965,408\n \n); \nin vivo\n homologous recombination, ligase assisted gene assembly, end-complementary PCR, profusion (\nRoberts & Szostak, 1997, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:12297-12302\n); yeast/bacteria surface display (\nLu et al., 1995, Biotechnology 13:366-372\n); \nSeed & Aruffo, 1987, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 84(10):3365-3369\n; \nBoder & Wittrup, 1997, Nat Biotechnol 15:553-557\n). In an alternate embodiment, a selection step occurs that is an experimental step, for example any of the library screening steps below, wherein some subset of the primary library is chosen and then recombined experimentally, for example using one of the directed evolution methods discussed below, to form a secondary library. In a preferred embodiment, the primary library is generated and processed as outlined in \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeneration of secondary and subsequent libraries finds broad use in the present invention. In one embodiment, different primary libraries may be combined to generate a secondary or subsequent library. In another embodiment, secondary libraries may be generated by sampling sequence diversity at highly mutatable or highly conserved positions. The primary library may be analyzed to determine which amino acid positions in the template protein have high mutational frequency, and which positions have low mutational frequency. For example, positions in a protein that show a great deal of mutational diversity in computational screening may be fixed in a subsequent round of design calculations. A filtered set of the same size as the first would now show diversity at positions that were largely conserved in the first library. Alternatively, the secondary library may be generated by varying the amino acids at the positions that have high numbers of mutations, while keeping constant the positions that do not have mutations above a certain frequency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis discussion is not meant to constrain generation of libraries subsequent to primary libraries to secondary libraries. As will be appreciated, primary and secondary libraries may be processed further to generate tertiary libraries, quaternary libraries, and so on. In this way, library generation is an iterative process. For example, tertiary libraries may be constructed using a variety of additional steps applied to one or more secondary libraries; for example, further computational processing may occur, secondary libraries may be recombined, or subsets of different secondary libraries may be combined. In a preferred embodiment, a tertiary library may be generated by combining secondary libraries. For example, primary and/or secondary libraries that analyzed different parts of a protein may be combined to generate a tertiary library that treats the combined parts of the protein. In an alternate embodiment, the variants from a primary library may be combined with the variants from another primary library to provide a combined tertiary library at lower computational cost than creating a very long filtered set. These combinations may be used, for example, to analyze large proteins, especially large multi-domain proteins, of which Fc Is an example. Thus the above description of secondary library generation applies to generating any library subsequent to a primary library, the end result being a final library that may screened experimentally to obtain protein variants optimized for a design goal. These examples are not meant to constrain generation of secondary libraries to any particular application or theory of operation for the present invention. Rather, these examples are meant to illustrate that generation of secondary libraries, and subsequent libraries such as tertiary libraries and so on, is broadly useful in computational screening methodology for library generation.\n\n\n \n\n\nExperimental Production and Screening\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods for producing and screening libraries of Fc variants. The described methods are not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular application or theory of operation. Rather, the provided methods are meant to illustrate generally that one or more Fc variants or one or more libraries of Fc variants may be produced and screened experimentally to obtain optimized Fc variants. Fc variants may be produced and screened in any context, whether as an Fc region as precisely defined herein, a domain or fragment thereof, or a larger polypeptide that comprises Fc such as an antibody or Fc fusion. General methods for antibody molecular biology, expression, purification, and screening are described in \nAntibody Engineering, edited by Duebel & Kontermann, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, 2001\n; and \nHayhurst & Georgiou, 2001, Curr Opin Chem Biol 5:683-689\n; \nMaynard & Georgiou, 2000, Annu Rev Biomed Eng 2:339-76\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the library sequences are used to create nucleic acids that encode the member sequences, and that may then be cloned into host cells, expressed and assayed, if desired. Thus, nucleic acids, and particularly DNA, may be made that encode each member protein sequence. These practices are carried out using well-known procedures. For example, a variety of methods that may find use in the present invention are described in \nMolecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. (Maniatis, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 2001\n), and \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology (John Wiley & Sons\n). As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the generation of exact sequences for a library comprising a large number of sequences is potentially expensive and time consuming. Accordingly, there are a variety of techniques that may be used to efficiently generate libraries of the present invention. Such methods that may find use in the present invention are described or referenced in \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n. Such methods include but are not limited to gene assembly methods, PCR-based method and methods which use variations of PCR, ligase chain reaction-based methods, pooled oligo methods such as those used in synthetic shuffling, error-prone amplification methods and methods which use oligos with random mutations, classical site-directed mutagenesis methods, cassette mutagenesis, and other amplification and gene synthesis methods. As is known in the art, there are a variety of commercially available kits and methods for gene assembly, mutagenesis, vector subcloning, and the like, and such commercial products find use in the present invention for generating nucleic acids that encode Fc variant members of a library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be produced by culturing a host cell transformed with nucleic acid, preferably an expression vector, containing nucleic acid encoding the Fc variants, under the appropriate conditions to induce or cause expression of the protein. The conditions appropriate for expression will vary with the choice of the expression vector and the host cell, and will be easily ascertained by one skilled in the art through routine experimentation. A wide variety of appropriate host cells may be used, including but not limited to mammalian cells, bacteria, insect cells, and yeast. For example, a variety of cell lines that may find use in the present invention are described in the ATCC® cell line catalog, available from the American Type Culture Collection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are expressed in mammalian expression systems, including systems in which the expression constructs are introduced into the mammalian cells using virus such as retrovirus or adenovirus. Any mammalian cells may be used, with human, mouse, rat, hamster, and primate cells being particularly preferred. Suitable cells also include known research cells, including but not limited to Jurkat T cells, NIH3T3, CHO, COS, and 293 cells. In an alternately preferred embodiment, library proteins are expressed in bacterial cells. Bacterial expression systems are well known in the art, and include \nEscherichia coli\n (\nE. coli\n)\n, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus cremoris,\n and \nStreptococcus lividans.\n In alternate embodiments, Fc variants are produced in insect cells or yeast cells. In an alternate embodiment, Fc variants are expressed \nin vitro\n using cell free translation systems. In vitro translation systems derived from both prokaryotic (e.g. \nE. coli\n) and eukaryotic (e.g. wheat germ, rabbit reticulocytes) cells are available and may be chosen based on the expression levels and functional properties of the protein of interest. For example, as appreciated by those skilled in the art, \nin vitro\n translation is required for some display technologies, for example ribosome display. In addition, the Fc variants may be produced by chemical synthesis methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acids that encode the Fc variants of the present invention may be incorporated into an expression vector in order to express the protein. A variety of expression vectors may be utilized for protein expression. Expression vectors may comprise self-replicating extra-chromosomal vectors or vectors which integrate into a host genome. Expression vectors are constructed to be compatible with the host cell type. Thus expression vectors which find use in the present invention include but are not limited to those which enable protein expression in mammalian cells, bacteria, insect cells, yeast, and in \nin vitro\n systems. As is known in the art, a variety of expression vectors are available, commercially or otherwise, that may find use in the present invention for expressing Fc variant proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression vectors typically comprise a protein operably linked with control or regulatory sequences, selectable markers, any fusion partners, and/or additional elements. By \n\"operably linked\"\n herein is meant that the nucleic acid is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. Generally, these expression vectors include transcriptional and translational regulatory nucleic acid operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the Fc variant, and are typically appropriate to the host cell used to express the protein. In general, the transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences may include promoter sequences, ribosomal binding sites, transcriptional start and stop sequences, translational start and stop sequences, and enhancer or activator sequences. As is also known in the art, expression vectors typically contain a selection gene or marker to allow the selection of transformed host cells containing the expression vector. Selection genes are well known in the art and will vary with the host cell used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFc variants may be operably linked to a fusion partner to enable targeting of the expressed protein, purification, screening, display, and the like. Fusion partners may be linked to the Fc variant sequence via a linker sequences. The linker sequence will generally comprise a small number of amino acids, typically less than ten, although longer linkers may also be used. Typically, linker sequences are selected to be flexible and resistant to degradation. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, any of a wide variety of sequences may be used as linkers. For example, a common linker sequence comprises the amino acid sequence GGGGS. A fusion partner may be a targeting or signal sequence that directs Fc variant protein and any associated fusion partners to a desired cellular location or to the extracellular media. As is known in the art, certain signaling sequences may target a protein to be either secreted into the growth media, or into the periplasmic space, located between the inner and outer membrane of the cell. A fusion partner may also be a sequence that encodes a peptide or protein that enables purification and/or screening. Such fusion partners include but are not limited to polyhistidine tags (His-tags) (for example H\n6\n and H\n10\n or other tags for use with Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) systems (e.g. Ni\n+2\n affinity columns)), GST fusions, MBP fusions, Strep-tag, the BSP biotinylation target sequence of the bacterial enzyme BirA, and epitope tags which are targeted by antibodies (for example c-myc tags, flag-tags, and the like). As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, such tags may be useful for purification, for screening, or both. For example, an Fc variant may be purified using a His-tag by immobilizing it to a Ni\n+2\n affinity column, and then after purification the same His-tag may be used to immobilize the antibody to a Ni\n+2\n coated plate to perform an ELISA or other binding assay (as described below). A fusion partner may enable the use of a selection method to screen Fc variants (see below). Fusion partners that enable a variety of selection methods are well-known in the art, and all of these find use in the present invention. For example, by fusing the members of an Fc variant library to the gene III protein, phage display can be employed (\nKay et al., Phage display of peptides and proteins: a laboratory manual, Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1996\n;\n Lowman et al., 1991, Biochemistry 30:10832-10838\n; \nSmith, 1985, Science 228:1315-1317\n). Fusion partners may enable Fc variants to be labeled. Alternatively, a fusion partner may bind to a specific sequence on the expression vector, enabling the fusion partner and associated Fc variant to be linked covalently or noncovalently with the nucleic acid that encodes them. For example, \n \nUSSN 09/642,574\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/080,376\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/792,630\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/023,208\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/792,626\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/082,671\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/953,351\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/097,100\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 60/366,658\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 00/22906\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/49058\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/04852\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/04853\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/08023\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/28702\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/07466\n \n describe such a fusion partner and technique that may find use in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods of introducing exogenous nucleic acid Into host cells are well known in the art, and will vary with the host cell used. Techniques include but are not limited to dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, calcium chloride treatment, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, viral or phage infection, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei. In the case of mammalian cells, transfection may be either transient or stable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, Fc variant proteins are purified or isolated after expression. Proteins may be isolated or purified in a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art. Standard purification methods include chromatographic techniques, including ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, affinity, sizing or gel filtration, and reversed-phase, carried out at atmospheric pressure or at high pressure using systems such as FPLC and HPLC. Purification methods also include electrophoretic, immunological, precipitation, dialysis, and chromatofocusing techniques. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration techniques, in conjunction with protein concentration, are also useful. As is well known in the art, a variety of natural proteins bind Fc and antibodies, and these proteins can find use in the present Invention for purification of Fc variants. For example, the bacterial proteins A and G bind to the Fc region. Likewise, the bacterial protein L binds to the Fab region of some antibodies, as of course does the antibody's target antigen. Purification can often be enabled by a particular fusion partner. For example, Fc variant proteins may be purified using glutathione resin if a GST fusion is employed, Ni\n+2\n affinity chromatography if a His-tag is employed, or immobilized anti-flag antibody if a flag-tag is used. For general guidance in suitable purification techniques, see \nProtein Purification: Principles and Practice, 3rd Ed., Scopes, Springer-Verlag, NY, 1994\n. The degree of purification necessary will vary depending on the screen or use of the Fc variants. In some instances no purification is necessary. For example in one embodiment, if the Fc variants are secreted, screening may take place directly from the media. As is well known in the art, some methods of selection do not involve purification of proteins. Thus, for example, if a library of Fc variants is made into a phage display library, protein purification may not be performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFc variants may be screened using a variety of methods, including but not limited to those that use \nin vitro\n assays, \nin vivo\n and cell-based assays, and selection technologies. Automation and high-throughput screening technologies may be utilized in the screening procedures. Screening may employ the use of a fusion partner or label. The use of fusion partners has been discussed above. By \"\nlabeled\n\" herein is meant that the Fc variants of the invention have one or more elements, isotopes, or chemical compounds attached to enable the detection in a screen. In general, labels fall Into three classes: a) immune labels, which may be an epitope incorporated as a fusion partner that Is recognized by an antibody, b) isotopic labels, which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes, and c) small molecule labels, which may include fluorescent and colorimetric dyes, or molecules such as biotin that enable other labeling methods. Labels may be incorporated into the compound at any position and may be incorporated \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo\n during protein expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the functional and/or biophysical properties of Fc variants are screened in an \nin vitro\n assay. \nIn vitro\n assays may allow a broad dynamic range for screening properties of interest. Properties of Fc variants that may be screened include but are not limited to stability, solubility, and affinity for Fc ligands, for example Fc□Rs. Multiple properties may be screened simultaneously or individually. Proteins may be purified or unpurified, depending on the requirements of the assay. In one embodiment, the screen is a qualitative or quantitative binding assay for binding of Fc variants to a protein or nonprotein molecule that is known or thought to bind the Fc variant. In a preferred embodiment, the screen is a binding assay for measuring binding to the antibody's or Fc fusions' target antigen. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the screen is an assay for binding of Fc variants to an Fc ligand, including but are not limited to the family of Fc□Rs, the neonatal receptor FcRn, the complement protein C1q, and the bacterial proteins A and G. Said Fc ligands may be from any organism, with humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys preferred. Binding assays can be carried out using a variety of methods known In the art, including but not limited to FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) and BRET (Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer) -based assays, AlphaScreen™ (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay), Scintillation Proximity Assay, ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance, also known as BIACORE®), isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, gel electrophoresis, and chromatography including gel filtration. These and other methods may take advantage of some fusion partner or label of the Fc variant. Assays may employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic, fluorescent, luminescent, or isotopic labels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biophysical properties of Fc variant proteins, for example stability and solubility, may be screened using a variety of methods known in the art. Protein stability may be determined by measuring the thermodynamic equilibrium between folded and unfolded states. For example, Fc variant proteins of the present invention may be unfolded using chemical denaturant, heat, or pH, and this transition may be monitored using methods including but not limited to circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, absorbance spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry, and proteolysis. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the kinetic parameters of the folding and unfolding transitions may also be monitored using these and other techniques. The solubility and overall structural integrity of an Fc variant protein may be quantitatively or qualitatively determined using a wide range of methods that are known in the art. Methods which may find use in the present invention for characterizing the biophysical properties of Fc variant proteins include gel electrophoresis, chromatography such as size exclusion chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, analytical ultra-centrifugation, dynamic light scattering, proteolysis, and cross-linking, turbidity measurement, filter retardation assays, immunological assays, fluorescent dye binding assays, protein-staining assays, microscopy, and detection of aggregates via ELISA or other binding assay. Structural analysis employing X-ray crystallographic techniques and NMR spectroscopy may also find use. In one embodiment, stability and/or solubility may be measured by determining the amount of protein solution after some defined period of time. In this assay, the protein may or may not be exposed to some extreme condition, for example elevated temperature, low pH, or the presence of denaturant. Because function typically requires a stable, soluble, and/or well-folded/structured protein, the aforementioned functional and binding assays also provide ways to perform such a measurement. For example, a solution comprising an Fc variant could be assayed for its ability to bind target antigen, then exposed to elevated temperature for one or more defined periods of time, then assayed for antigen binding again. Because unfolded and aggregated protein is not expected to be capable of binding antigen, the amount of activity remaining provides a measure of the Fc variant's stability and solubility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the library is screened using one or more cell-based or \nin vivo\n assays. For such assays, Fc variant proteins, purified or unpurified, are typically added exogenously such that cells are exposed to individual variants or pools of variants belonging to a library. These assays are typically, but not always, based on the function of an antibody or Fc fusion that comprises the Fc variant; that is, the ability of the antibody or Fc fusion to bind a target antigen and mediate some biochemical event, for example effector function, ligand/receptor binding inhibition, apoptosis, and the like. Such assays often involve monitoring the response of cells to antibody or Fc fusion, for example cell survival, cell death, change in cellular morphology, or transcriptional activation such as cellular expression of a natural gene or reporter gene. For example, such assays may measure the ability of Fc variants to elicit ADCC, ADCP, or CDC. For some assays additional cells or components, that is in addition to the target cells, may need to be added, for example example serum complement, or effector cells such as peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs), NK cells, macrophages, and the like. Such additional cells may be from any organism, preferably humans, mice, rat, rabbit, and monkey. Antibodies and Fc fusions may cause apoptosis of certain cell lines expressing the antibody's target antigen, or they may mediate attack on target cells by immune cells which have been added to the assay. Methods for monitoring cell death or viability are known in the art, and include the use of dyes, immunochemical, cytochemical, and radioactive reagents. For example, caspase staining assays may enable apoptosis to be measured, and uptake or release of radioactive substrates or fluorescent dyes such as alamar blue may enable cell growth or activation to be monitored. In a preferred embodiment, the DELFIA® EuTDA-based cytotoxicity assay (Perkin Elmer, MA) is used. Alternatively, dead or damaged target cells may be monitoried by measuring the release of one or more natural intracellular proteins, for example lactate dehydrogenase. Transcriptional activation may also serve as a method for assaying function in cell-based assays. In this case, response may be monitored by assaying for natural genes or proteins which may be upregulated, for example the release of certain interleukins may be measured, or alternatively readout may be via a reporter construct. Cell-based assays may also involve the measure of morphological changes of cells as a response to the presence of an Fc variant. Cell types for such assays may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic, and a variety of cell lines that are known In the art may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, cell-based screens are performed using cells that have been transformed or transfected with nucleic acids encoding the Fc variants. That is, Fc variant proteins are not added exogenously to the cells. For example, in one embodiment, the cell-based screen utilizes cell surface display. A fusion partner can be employed that enables display of Fc variants on the surface of cells (\nWitrrup, 2001, Curr Opin Biotechnol, 12:395-399\n). Cell surface display methods that may find use In the present invention include but are not limited to display on bacteria (\nGeorgiou et al., 1997, Nat Biotechnol 15:29-34\n; \nGeorgiou et al., 1993, Trends Biotechnol 11:6-10\n; \nLee et al., 2000, Nat Biotechnol 18:645-648\n; \nJun et al., 1998, Nat Biotechnol 16:576-80\n), yeast (\nBoder & Wittrup, 2000, Methods Enzymol 328:430-44\n;\n Boder & Wittrup, 1997,Nat Biotechnol 15:553-557\n), and mammalian cells (\nWhitehorn et al., 1995, Bio/technology 13:1215-1219\n). In an alternate embodiment, Fc variant proteins are not displayed on the surface of cells, but rather are screened intracellularly or in some other cellular compartment. For example, periplasmic expression and cytometric screening (\nChen et al., 2001, Nat Biotechnol 19: 537-542\n), the protein fragment complementation assay (\nJohnsson & Varshavsky, 1994, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91:10340-10344\n.; \nPelletier et al., 1998, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95:12141-12146\n), and the yeast two hybrid screen (\nFields & Song, 1989, Nature 340:245-246\n) may find use in the present invention. Alternatively, if a polypeptide that comprises the Fc variants, for example an antibody or Fc fusion, imparts some selectable growth advantage to a cell, this property may be used to screen or select for Fc variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is known in the art, a subset of screening methods are those that select for favorable members of a library. Said methods are herein referred to as \"\nselection methods\"\n, and these methods find use in the present invention for screening Fc variant libraries. When libraries are screened using a selection method, only those members of a library that are favorable, that is which meet some selection criteria, are propagated, isolated, and/or observed. As will be appreciated, because only the most fit variants are observed, such methods enable the screening of libraries that are larger than those screenable by methods that assay the fitness of library members individually. Selection is enabled by any method, technique, or fusion partner that links, covalently or noncovalently, the phenotype of an Fc variant with its genotype, that is the function of an Fc variant with the nucleic acid that encodes it. For example the use of phage display as a selection method is enabled by the fusion of library members to the gene III protein. In this way, selection or isolation of variant proteins that meet some criteria, for example binding affinity for an FcγR, also selects for or isolates the nucleic acid that encodes it. Once isolated, the gene or genes encoding Fc variants may then be amplified. This process of isolation and amplification, referred to as panning, may be repeated, allowing favorable Fc variants in the library to be enriched. Nucleic acid sequencing of the attached nucleic acid ultimately allows for gene identification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of selection methods are known in the art that may find use in the present invention for screening Fc variant libraries. These include but are not limited to phage display (\nPhage display of peptides and proteins: a laboratory manual, Kay et al., 1996, Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1996\n; \nLowman et al., 1991, Biochemistry 30:10832-10838\n; \nSmith, 1985, Science 228:1315-1317\n) and its derivatives such as selective phage infection (\nMalmborg et al., 1997, J Mol Biol 273:544-551\n), selectively infective phage (\nKrebber et al., 1997, J Mol Biol 268:619-630\n), and delayed infectivity panning (\nBenhar et al., 2000, J Mol Biol 301:893-904\n), cell surface display (\nWitrrup, 2001, Curr Opin Biotechnol, 12:395-399\n) such as display on bacteria (\nGeorgiou et al., 1997, Nat Biotechnol 15:29-34\n; \nGeorgiou et al., 1993, Trends Biotechnol 11:6-10\n;\n Lee et al., 2000, Nat Biotechnol 18:645-648\n; \nJun et al., 1998, Nat Biotechnol 16:576-80\n), yeast (\nBoder & Wittrup, 2000, Methods Enzymol 328:430-44\n; \nBoder & Wittrup, 1997, Nat Biotechnol 15:553-557\n), and mammalian cells (\nWhitehorn et al., 1995, Bio/technology 13:1215-1219\n), as well as \nin vitro\n display technologies (\nAmstutz et al., 2001, Curr Opin Biotechnol 12:400-405\n) such as polysome display (\nMattheakis et al., 1994, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91:9022-9026\n), ribosome display (\nHanes et al., 1997, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:4937-4942\n), mRNA display (\nRoberts & Szostak, 1997, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:12297-12302\n; \nNemoto et al., 1997, FEBS Lett 414:405-408\n), and ribosome-inactivation display system (\nZhou et al., 2002, J Am Chem Soc 124, 538-543\n)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther selection methods that may find use in the present invention include methods that do not rely on display, such as \nin vivo\n methods including but not limited to periplasmic expression and cytometric screening (\nChen et al., 2001, Nat Biotechnol 19:537-542\n), the protein fragment complementation assay (\nJohnsson & Varshavsky, 1994, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91:10340-10344\n; \nPelletier et al., 1998, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95:12141-12146\n), and the yeast two hybrid screen (\nFields & Song, 1989, Nature 340:245-246\n) used in selection mode (\nVisintin et al., 1999, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96:11723-11728\n). In an alternate embodiment, selection is enabled by a fusion partner that binds to a specific sequence on the expression vector, thus linking covalently or noncovalently the fusion partner and associated Fc variant library member with the nucleic acid that encodes them. For example, \n \nUSSN 09/642,574\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/080,376\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/792,630\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/023,208\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/792,626\n \n; \n \nUSSN 101082,671\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/953,351\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/097,100\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 60/366,658\n \n; \n \nPCTWO 00/22906\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/49058\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/04852\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/04853\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/08023\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/28702\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/07466\n \n describe such a fusion partner and technique that may find use in the present invention. In an alternative embodiment, \nin vivo\n selection can occur if expression of a polypeptide that comprises the Fc variant, such as an antibody or Fc fusion, imparts some growth, reproduction, or survival advantage to the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA subset of selection methods referred to as \"directed evolution\" methods are those that include the mating or breading of favorable sequences during selection, sometimes with the incorporation of new mutations. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, directed evolution methods can facilitate identification of the most favorable sequences in a library, and can increase the diversity of sequences that are screened. A variety of directed evolution methods are known in the art that may find use in the present invention for screening Fc variant libraries, including but not limited to DNA shuffling (\n \nPCT WO 00/42561 A3\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/70947 A3\n \n), exon shuffling (\n \nUS 6,365,377\n \n; \nKolkman & Stemmer, 2001, Nat Biotechnol 19:423-428\n), family shuffling (\nCrameri et al., 1998, Nature 391:288-291\n; \n \nUS 6,376,246\n \n), RACHITT™ (\nCoco et al., 2001, Nat Biotechnol 19:354- 359\n; \n \nPCT WO 02/06469\n \n), STEP and random priming of \nin vitro\n recombination (\nZhao et al., 1998, Nat Biotechnol 16:258-261\n; \nShao et al., 1998, Nucleic Acids Res 26:681-683\n), exonuclease mediated gene assembly (\n \nUS 6,352,842\n \n; \n \nUS 6,361,974\n \n), Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis™ (\n \nUS 6,358,709\n \n), Gene Reassembly™ (\n \nUS 6,358,709\n \n), SCRATCHY (\nLutz et al., 2001, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:11248-11253\n), DNA fragmentation methods (\nKikuchi et al., Gene 236:159-167\n), single-stranded DNA shuffling (\nKikuchi et al., 2000, Gene 243:133-137\n), and AMEsystem™ directed evolution protein engineering technology (Applied Molecular Evolution) (\n \nUS US 5,824,514\n \n; \n \nUS 5,817,483\n \n; \n \nUS 5,814,476\n \n; \n \nUS 5,763,192\n \n; \n \nUS 5,723,323\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biological properties of the antibodies and Fc fusions that comprise the Fc variants of the present invention may be characterized in cell, tissue, and whole organism experiments. As is know in the art, drugs are often tested In animals, including but not limited to mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, cats, pigs, and monkeys, in order to measure a drug's efficacy for treatment against a disease or disease model, or to measure a drug's pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and other properties. Said animals may be referred to as disease models. Therapeutics are often tested in mice, including but not limited to nude mice, SCID mice, xenograft mice, and transgenic mice (including knockins and knockouts). For example, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention that is intended as an anti-cancer therapeutic may be tested in a mouse cancer model, for example a xenograft mouse. In this method, a tumor or tumor cell line is grafted onto or injected into a mouse, and subsequently the mouse is treated with the therapeutic to determine the ability of the antibody or Fc fusion to reduce or inhibit cancer growth. Such experimentation may provide meaningful data for determination of the potential of said antibody or Fc fusion to be used as a therapeutic. Any organism, preferably mammals, may be used for testing. For example because of their genetic similarity to humans, monkeys can be suitable therapeutic models, and thus may be used to test the efficacy, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, or other property of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention. Tests of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention in humans are ultimately required for approval as drugs, and thus of course these experiments are contemplated. Thus the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be tested in humans to determine their therapeutic efficacy, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and/or other clinical properties.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nExamples are provided below to illustrate the present invention. These examples are not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular application or theory of operation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor all positions discussed In the present invention, numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat (\nKabat et al., 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., United States Public Health Svice, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda\n). Those skilled in the art of antibodies will appreciate that this convention consists of nonsequential numbering in specific regions of an immunoglobulin sequence, enabling a normalized reference to conserved positions in immunoglobulin families. Accordingly, the positions of any given immunoglobulin as defined by the EU index will not necessarily correspond to its sequential sequence. \nFigure 3\n shows the sequential and EU index numbering schemes for the antibody alemtuzumab in order to illustrate this principal more clearly. It should also be noted that polymorphisms have been observed at a number of Fc positions, including but not limited to \nKabat\n 270, 272, 312, 315, 356, and 358, and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the scientific literature may exist.\n\n\n \nExample 1. Computational Screening and Design of Fc Libraries\n\n\n \n \n \nComputational screening calculations were carried out to design optimized Fc variants. Fc variants were computationally screened, constructed, and experimentally investigated over several computation/experimention cycles. For each successive cycle, experimental data provided feedback into the next set of computational screening calculations and library design. All computational screening calculations and library design are presented in Example 1. For each set of calculations, a table is provided that presents the results and provides relevant information and parameters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral different structures of Fc bound bound to the extracellular domain of FcγRs served as template structures for the computational screening calculations. Publicly available Fc/FcγR complex structures included \npdb accession code\n 1 E4K (\nSondermann et al., 2000, Nature 406:267-273\n.), and \npdb accession codes\n 1 IIS and 1 IIX (\nRadaev et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:16469-16477\n). The extracellular regions of FcγRIIIb and FcγRIIIa are 96% identical, and therefore the use of the Fc/FcγRIIIb structure is essentially equivalent to use of FcγRIIIa. Nonetheless, for some calculations, a more precise Fc/FcγRIIIa template structure was constructed by modeling a D129G mutation in the 1 IIS and 1 E4K structures (referred to as \nD129G\n 1 IIS and \nD129G\n 1 E4K template structures). In addition, the structures for human Fc bound to the extracellular domains of human FcγRIIb, human F158 FcγRIIIa and mouse FcγRIII were modeled using standard methods, the available FcγR sequence information, the aforementioned Fc/FcγR structures, as well as structural information for unbound complexes (pdb accession code 1H9V)(\nSondermann et al., 2001, J Mol Biol 309:737-749\n) (pdb accession code 1FCG)(\nMaxwell et al., 1999, Nat Struct Biol 6:437-442\n). FcγRIIb (pdb accession code 2FCB)(\nSondermann et al., 1999, Embo J 18:1095-1103\n), and FcγRIIIb (pdb accession code 1E4J)(\nSondermann et al., 2000, Nature 406:267-273\n.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVariable positions and amino acids to be considered at those positions were chosen by visual inspection of the aforementioned Fc/FcγR and FcγR structures, and using solvent accessibility information and sequence information. Sequence information of Fcs and FcγRs was particularly useful for determining variable positions at which substitutions may provide distinguishing affinities between activating and inhibitory receptors. Virtually all Cγ2 positions were screened computationally. The Fc structure is a homodimer of two heavy chains (labeled chains A and B in the 1 IIS, 1 IIX, and 1 E4K structures) that each include the hinge and Cγ2-Cγ3 domains (shown in \nFigure 2\n). Because the FcγR (labeled chain C in the 1 IIS, 1 IIX, and 1 E4K structures) binds asymmetrically to the Fc homodimer, each chain was often considered separately in design calculations. For some calculations, Fc and/or FcγR residues proximal to variable position residues were floated, that is the amino acid conformation but not the amino acid identity was allowed to vary in a protein design calculation to allow for conformational adjustments. These are indicated below the table for each set of calculations when relevant. Considered amino acids typically belonged to either the Core, Core XM, Surface, Boundary, Boundary XM, or All 20 classifications, unless noted otherwise. These classifications are defined as follows: Core = alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine; Core XM = alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; Surface = alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine and histidine; Boundary = alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine, histidine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine; Boundary XM = Boundary = alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine, histidine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; All 20 = all 20 naturally occurring amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe majority of calculations followed one of two general types of computational screening methods. In one method, the conformations of amino acids at variable positions were represented as a set of backbone-independent side chain rotamers derived from the rotamer library of Dunbrack & Cohen (\nDunbrack et al., 1997, Protein Sci 6:1661-1681\n). The energies of all possible combinations of the considered amino acids at the chosen variable positions were calculated using a force field containing terms describing van der Waals, solvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions, and the optimal (ground state) sequence was determined using a Dead End Elimination (DEE) algorithm. As will be appreciated by those in the art, the predicted lowest energy sequence is not necessarily the true lowest energy sequence because of errors primarily in the scoring function, coupled with the fact that subtle conformational differences in proteins can result in dramatic differences in stability. However, the predicted ground state sequence is likely to be close to the true ground state, and thus additional favorable diversity can be explored by evaluating the energy of sequences that are close in sequence space and energy around the predicted ground state. To accomplish this, as well as to generate a diversity of sequences for a library, a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm was used to evaluate the energies of 1000 similar sequences around the predicted ground state. The number of sequences out of the 1000 sequence set that contain that amino acid at that variable position is referred to as the occupancy for that substitution, and this value may reflect how favorable that substitution is. This computational screening method is substantially similar to Protein Design Automation® (PDA®) technology, as described in \n \nUS 6,188,965\n \n; \n \nUS 6,269,312\n \n; \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 98/07254\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n, and for ease of description, is referred to as PDA® technology throughout the examples. Tables that present the results of these calculations provide for each variable position on the designated chain (column 1) the amino acids considered at each variable position (column 2), the WT Fc amino acid identity at each variable position (column 3), the amino acid identity at each variable position in the DEE ground state sequence (column 4), and the set of amino acids and corresponding occupancy that are observed in the Monte Carlo output (column 5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther calculations utilized a genetic algorithm (GA) to screen for low energy sequences, with energies being calculated during each round of \"evolution\" for those sequences being sampled. The conformations of amino acids at variable and floated positions were represented as a set of side chain rotamers derived from a backbone-independent rotamer library using a flexible rotamer model (\nMendes et al., 1999, Proteins 37:530-543\n). Energies were calculated using a force field containing terms describing van der Waals, solvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions. This calculation generated a list of 300 sequences which are predicted to be low in energy. To facilitate analysis of the results and library generation, the 300 output sequences were clustered computationally into 10 groups of similar sequences using a nearest neighbor single linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm to assign sequences to related groups based on similarity scores (\nDiamond, 1995, Acta Cryst D51:127-135\n). That is, all sequences within a group are most similar to all other sequences within the same group and less similar to sequences in other groups. The lowest energy sequence from each of these ten clusters are used as a representative of each group, and are presented as results. This computational screening method is substantially similar to Sequence Prediction Algorithm™ (SPA™) technology, as described in (\nRaha et al., 2000, Protein Sci 9:1106-1119\n); \n \nUSSN 09/877,695\n \n; and \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/071,859\n \n, and for ease of description, is referred to as SPA™ technology throughout the examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComputational screening was applied to design energetically favorable interactions at the Fc/Fc□R interface at groups of variable positions that mediate or potentially mediate binding with Fc□R. Because the binding interface involves a large number of Fc residues on the two different chains, and because Fc□Rs bind asymmetrically to Fc, residues were grouped in different sets of interacting variable positions, and designed in separate sets of calculations. In many cases these sets were chosen as groups of residues that were deemed to be coupled, that is the energy of one or more residues is dependent on the identity of one or more other residues. Various template structures were used, and in many cases calculations explored substitutions on both chains. For many of the variable position sets, calculations were carried out using both the PDA® and SPA™ technology computational screening methods described. The results of these calculations and relevant parameters and information are presented in Tables 1 - 30 below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTables that present the results of these calculations provide for each variable position on the designated chain (column 1) the amino acids considered at each variable position (column 2), the WT Fc amino acid identity at each variable position (column 3), and the amino acid identity at the variable positions for the lowest energy sequence from each cluster group (columns 4-13). Tables 1-59 are broken down into two sets, as labeled below, PDA® and SPA™ technology. \nColumn\n 4 of the PDA® tables show the frequency of each residue that occurs in the top 1000 sequences during that PDA® run. Thus, in the first row of Table 1, at position 328, when run using boundary amino acids as the set of variable residues for that position, L occurred 330 times in the top 1000 sequence, M occurred 302 times, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, included within the compositions of the invention are antibodies that have any of the listed amino acid residues in the listed positions, either alone or in any combination (note preferred combinations are listed in the claims, the summary and the figures). One preferred combination is the listed amino acids residues in the listed positions in a ground state (sometimes referred to herein as the \"global solution\", as distinguished from the wild-type). Similarly, residue positions and particular amino acids at those residue positions may be combined between tables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor SPA™ technology tables, such as Table 4, \ncolumn\n 4 is a SPA™ run that results in a protein with the six listed amino acids at the six listed positions (\ne.g. column\n 4 is a single protein with a wild-type sequence except for 239E, 265G, 267S, 269Y, 270T and 299S. Thus, each of these individual proteins are included within the invention. In addition, combinations between SPA™ proteins, both within tables and between tables, are also included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, each table shows the presence or absence of carbohydrate, but specifically included are the reverse sequences; e.g. Table 1 is listed for an aglycosylated variant, but these same amino acid changes can be done on a glycosylated variant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, each table lists the template structure used, as well as \"floated\" residues; for example, Table 2 used a PDA® run that floated C120, C132 and C134.\n\n \n \nTable 1\n \n \n \n \n \nPosition\n \n \n \nConsidered Amino Acids\n \n \n \nWT\n \n \n \nGround State\n \n \n \nSequences Around Ground State\n \n \n \n \n \n328 A\n \nBoundary\n \nL\n \nL\n \nL:330 M:302 E:111 K:62 A:45 Q:39 D:36 S:30 T:28 N:10 R:7\n \n \n \n332 A\n \nSurface\n \nI\n \nR\n \nR:247 K:209 Q:130 H:95 E:92 T:59 D:51 N:51 S:42 A:24\n \n \n \n328 B\n \nBoundary\n \nL\n \nL\n \nL:321 M:237 T:166 K:73 R:72 S:55 Q:20 D:17 E:13 A:12 V:10 N:4\n \n \n \n332 B\n \nSurface\n \nI\n \nE\n \nE:269 Q:180 R:145 K:111 D:97 T:78 N:65 S:28 A:14 H:13\n \n \n \n \n \nPDA® technology, 1 IIS template structure;

The N297 carbohydrate covers up the exposed hydrophobic patch that would normally be the interface for a protein-protein interaction with another Ig domain, maintaining the stability and structural integrity of Fc and keeping the Cγ2 domains from aggregating across the central axis. Key residues for design are F241, F243, V262, and V264, which reside behind the carbohydrate on Cγ2, in addition to residues such as L328, I332, and I336, which are exposed nonpolar residues facing inward towards the opposed Cγ2 domain, that were considered in previously presented calculations. The importance of these Cγ2 residues is supported by noting that the corresponding residues in the Cγ3 domain by sequence alignment either mediate the nonpolar interaction between the two Cγ3 domains or are buried in the Cγ3 core. The results of these design calculations are presented in Table 53.\n\n \n \nTable 53\n \n \n \n \n \nPosition\n \n \n \nConsidered Amino Acids\n \n \n \nWT\n \n \n \nGround State\n \n \n \nSequences Around Ground State\n \n \n \n \n \n241 A\n \nSurface\n \nF\n \nE\n \nE:190 R:172 K:138 H:117 T:93 Q:91 D:85 S:49 N:49 A:16\n \n \n \n243 A\n \nSurface\n \nF\n \nR\n \nR:190 H:164 Q:152 E:149 K:92 T:71 D:64 N:58 S:42 A:18\n \n \n \n262 A\n \nSurface\n \nV\n \nD\n \nD:416 E:164 N:138 Q:87 T:83 R:44 S:32 K:24 A:11 H:1\n \n \n \n264 A\n \nSurface\n \nV\n \nH\n \nR:368 H:196 K:147 E:108 Q:68 T:34 N:33 D:25 S:15 A:6\n \n \n \n \n \nPDA® technology; 1 IIS template structure; - carbohydrate\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a final set of calculations, a SPA™ computational screening method was applied to evaluate the replacement of all chosen variable positions with all 20 amino acids. The lowest energy rotamer conformation for all 20 amino acids was determined, and this energy was defined as the energy of substitution for that amino acid at that variable position. These calculations thus provided an energy of substitution for each of the 20 amino acids at each variable position. These data were useful for a variety of design goals aimed at both glycosylated and aglycosylated Fc, including optimization of Fc/FcγR affinity, Fc stability, Fc solubility, carbohydrate conformation, and hinge conformation. Furthermore, because these calculations provide energies for both favorable and unfavorable substitutions, they guide substitutions that may enable differential binding to activating versus inhibitory FcγRs. Various template structures were used, and calculations explored substitutions on both chains. The results of these calculations and relevant parameters and information are presented in Tables 54 - 59 below. \nColumn\n 1 lists the variable positions on chain A and B of the 1 IIS template structure. \nColumn\n 2 lists the wild-type amino acid identity at each variable position. The remaining 20 columns provide the energy for each of the natural 20 amino acids (shown in the top row). All substitutions were normalized with respect to the lowest energy substitution, which was set to 0 energy. For example In Table 54, for L235 on chain A, serine is the lowest energy substitution, and L235A is 0.9 kcal/mol less stable than L235S. Extremely high energies were set to 20 kcal/mol for energies between 20 - 50 kcal/mol, and 50 kcal/mold for energies greater than 50 kcal/mol. Favorable substitutions may be considered to be the lowest energy substitution for each position, and substitutions that have small energy differences from the lowest energy substitution, for example substitutions within 1-2, 1-3, 1-5, or 1-10 kcal/mol.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the design calculations presented above in Tables 1 - 59 were used to construct a series of Fc variant libraries for experimental production and screening. Experimental libraries were designed in successive rounds of computational and experimental screening. Design of subsequent Fc libraries benefitted from feedback from prior libraries, and thus typically comprised combinations of Fc variants that showed favorable properties in the previous screen. The entire set of Fc variants that were constructed and experimentally tested is shown in Table 60. In this table, \nrow\n 1 lists the variable positions, and the rows that follow indicate the amino acids at those variable positions for WT and the Fc variants. For example, \nvariant\n 18 has the following four mutations: F241 E, F243Y, V262T, and V264R. The variable position residues that compose this set of Fc variants are illustrated structurally in \nFigure 3\n, and are presented in the context of the human IgG1 Fc sequence in \nFigure 4\n.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2: Experimental production and screening of Fc libraries\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe majority of experimentation on the Fc variants was carried out in the context of the anti-cancer antibody alemtuzumab (Campath®, a registered trademark of Ilex Pharmaceuticals LP). Alemtuzumab binds a short linear epitope within its target antigen CD52 (\nHale et al., 1990, Tissue Antigens 35:118-127\n; \nHale, 1995, Immunotechnology 1:175-187\n). Alemtuzumab has been chosen as the primary engineering template because its efficacy is due in part to its ability to recruit effector cells (\nDyer et al., 1989, Blood 73:1431-1439\n; \nFriend et a/., 1991, Transplant Proc 23:2253-2254\n; \nHale et al., 1998, Blood 92:4581-4590\n; \nGlennie et al., 2000, Immunol Today 21:403-410\n), and because production and use of its antigen in binding assays are relatively straightforward. In order to evaluate the optimized Fc variants of the present invention in the context of other antibodies, select Fc variants were evaluated in the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (Rituxan®, a registered trademark of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation), and the anti-Her2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin®, a registered trademark of Genentech). The use of alemtuzumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab for screening purposes is not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IgG1 full length light (V\nL\n-C\nL\n) and heavy (V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3) chain antibody genes for alemtuzumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab were constructed with convenient end restriction sites to facilitate subcloning. The genes were ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1Zeo (Invitrogen). The V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3 clone in pcDNA3.1zeo was used as a template for mutagenesis of the Fc region. Mutations were introduced into this clone using PCR-based mutagenesis techniques. Fc variants were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the sequence. Plasmids containing heavy chain gene (V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3) (wild-type or variants) were co-transfected with plasmid containing light chain gene (V\nL\n-C\nL\n) into 293T cells. Media were harvested 5 days after transfection. Expression of immunoglobulin was monitored by screening the culture supernatant of transfectomas by western using peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog # 109-035-088). \nFigure 6\n shows expression of wild-type alemtuzumab and \nvariants\n 1 through 10 in 293T cells. Antibodies were purified from the supernatant using protein A affinity chromatography (Pierce, Catalog # 20334. \nFigure 7\n shows results of the protein purification for WT alemtuzumab. Antibody Fc variants showed similar expression and purification results to WT. Some Fc variants were deglycosylated in order to determine their solution and functional properties in the absence of carbohydrate. To obtain deglycosylated antibodies, purified alemtuzumab antibodies were incubated with peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase F) at 37°C for 24h. \nFigure 8\n presents an SDS PAGE gel confirming deglycosylation for several Fc variants and WT alemtuzumab.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to confirm the functional fidelity of alemtuzumab produced under these conditions, the antigenic CD52 peptide, fused to GST, was expressed in E.coli BL21 (DE3) under IPTG induction. Both un-induced and induced samples were run on a SDS PAGE gel, and transferred to PVDF membrane. For western analysis, either alemtuzumab from Sotec (final concentration 2.5ng/µl) or media of transfected 293T cells (final alemtuzumab concentration about 0.1-0.2ng/µl) were used as primary antibody, and peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG was used as secondary antibody. \nFigure 9\n presents these results. The ability to bind target antigen confirms the structural and functional fidelity of the expressed alemtuzumab. Fc variants that have the same variable region as WT alemtuzumab are anticipated to maintain a comparable binding affinity for antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to screen for Fc/FcγR binding, the extracellular regions of human V158 FcγRIIIa, human F158 FcγRIIIa, human FcγRIIb, human FcγRIIa, and mouse FcγRIII, were expressed and purified. \nFigure 10\n presents an SDS PAGE gel that shows the results of expression and purification of human V158 FcγRIIIa. The extracellular region of this receptor was obtained by PCR from a clone obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC:22630). The receptor was fused with glutathione S-Transferase (GST) to enable screening. Tagged Fc□RIIIa was transfected in 293T cells, and media containing secreted Fc□RIIIa were harvested 3 days later and purified. For western analysis, membrane was probed with anti-GST antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding affinity to Fc□RIIIa and FcγRIIb was measured for all designed Fc variants using an AlphaScreen™ assay (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay (ALPHA), PerkinElmer, Wellesley, MA), a bead-based non-radioactive luminescent proximity assay. Laser excitation of a donor bead excites oxygen, which if sufficiently close to the acceptor bead generates a cascade of chemiluminescent events, ultimately leading to fluorescence emission at 520-620 nm. The AlphaScreen™ assay was applied as a competition assay for screening Fc variants. WT alemtuzumab antibody was biotinylated by standard methods for attachment to streptavidin donor beads, and GST-tagged FcγR was bound to glutathione chelate acceptor beads. In the absence of competing Fc variants, WT antibody and FcγR interact and produce a signal at 520-620 nm. Addition of untagged Fc variant competes with the WT Fc/FcγR interaction, reducing fluorescence quantitatively to enable determination of relative binding affinities. All Fc variants were screened for V158 FcγRIIIa binding using the AlphaScreen™ assay. Select Fc variants were subsequently screened for binding to FcγRIIb, as well as other FcγRs and Fc ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 11\n shows AlphaScreen™ data for binding to human V158 FcγRIIIa by select Fc variants. The binding data were normalized to the maximum and minimum luminescence signal provided by the baselines at low and high concentrations of competitor antibody respectively. The data were fit to a one site competition model using nonlinear regression, and these fits are represented by the curves in the figure. These fits provide the \ninhibitory concentration\n 50% (IC50) (i.e. the concentration required for 50% inhibition) for each antibody, illustrated by the dotted lines in \nFigure 11\n, thus enabling the relative binding affinities of Fc variants to be quantitatively determined. Here, WT alemtuzumab has an IC50 of (4.63x10\n-9\n)x(2) = 9.2 nM, whereas S239D has an IC50 of (3.98x10\n-10\n)x(2) = 0.8 nM. Thus S239D alemtuzumab binds 9.2 nM / 0.8 nM = 11.64-fold more tightly than WT alemtuzumab to human V158 FcγRIIIa. Similar calculations were performed for the binding of all Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa. Select Fc variants were also screened for binding to human Fc□RIIb, and examples of these AlphaScreen™ binding data are shown in \nFigure 12\n. Table 61 presents the fold-enhancement or fold-reduction relative to the parent antibody for binding of Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa (column 3) and human FcγRIIa (column 4), as determined by the AlphaScreen™ assay. For these data, a fold above 1 indicates an enhancement in binding affinity, and a fold below 1 indicates a reduction in binding affinity relative to WT Fc. All data were obtained in the context of alemtuzumab, except for those indicated with an asterix (*), which were tested in the context of trastuzumab.\n\n \n \nTable 61\n \n \n \n \n \nVariant\n \n \n

Table 61 provides Fc variants that bind more tightly to FcγRIIIa, and thus are candidates for improving the effector function of antibodies and Fc fusions. These include a number of variants that comprise substitutions at 239, 264, 330, and 332. \nFigure 13\n shows AlphaScreen™ binding data for some of these Fc variants. The majority of these Fc variants provide substantially greater FcγRIIIa binding enhancements over S29BA/E333A/K334A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the majority of Fc variants were screened in the context of the antibody alemtuzumab, select Fc variants were also screened in the context of rituximab and trastuzumab. AlphaScreen™ data for binding of select Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa in the context of rituximab and trastuzumab are shown in \nFigures 14\n and \n15\n respectively. The results indicate that the Fc variants display consistent binding enhancements regardless of the antibody context, and thus the Fc variants of the present invention are broadly applicable to antibodies and Fc fusions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFc variants have been obtained that show differentially enhanced binding to FcγRIIIa over FcγRIIb. As discussed, optimal effector function may result from Fc variants wherein affinity for activating FcγRs is greater than affinity for the inhibitory FcγRIIb. AlphaScreen™ data directly comparing binding to FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIb for two Fc variants with this specificity profile are shown in \nFigures 16a and 16b\n. This concept can be defined quantitatively as the fold-enhancement or - reduction of the activating FγR (Table 61, column 3) divided by the fold-enhancement or -reduction of the inhibitory FcγR (Table 61, column 4), herein referred to as the \nFcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold ratio.\n This value provided in \nColumn\n 5 in Table 61. Table 61 shows that Fc variants provide this specificity profile, with a FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold ratio as high as 86:1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the most promising Fc variants of the present invention for enhancing effector function have both substantial increases in affinity for FcγRIIIa and favorable FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold ratios. These include, for example, S239D/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold = 56, FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold = 3). S239D/A330Y/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold = 130), S239D/A330L/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold = 139, FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold = 18), and S239D/S29BA/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold = 295, FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold = 48). \nFigure 17\n shows AlphaScreen™ binding data for these and other Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause there are a number of FcγRs that contribute to effector function, it may be worthwhile to additionally screen Fc variants against other receptors. \nFigure 18\n shows AlphaScreen™ data for binding of select Fc variants to human R131 FcγRIIa. As can be seen, those aforementioned variants with favorable binding enhancements and specificity profiles also show enhanced binding to this activating receptor. The use of FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIb, and FcγRIIc for screening is not meant to constrain experimental testing to these particular FcγRs; other FcγRs are contemplated for screening, including but not limited to the myriad isoforms and allotypes of FcyRl, FcγRII, and FcγRIII from humans, mice, rats, monkeys, and the like, as previously described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together, the FcγR binding data provided in \nFigures 11-18\n and Table 61 indicate that a number of substitions at \n \npositions\n \n 234, 235, 239, 240, 243, 264, 266, 325, 328, 330, and 332 are promising candidates for improving the effector function of antibodies and Fc fusions. Because combinations of some of these substitutions have typically resulted in additive or synergistic binding improvements, it is anticipated that as yet unexplored combinations of the Fc variants provided in Table 61 will also provide favorable results. Thus all combinations of the Fc variants in Table 61 are contemplated. Likewise, combinations of any of the Fc variants in Table 61 with other discovered or undiscovered Fc variants may also provide favorable properties, and these combinations are also contemplated. Furthermore, it is anticipated from these results that other substitutions at \n \npositions\n \n 234, 235, 239, 240, 243, 264, 266, 325, 328, 330, and 332 may also provide favorable binding enhancements and specificities, and thus substitutions at these positions other than those presented in Table 61 are contemplated.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 4: Reduced binding to FcγRs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs discussed, although there is a need for greater effector function, for some antibody therapeutics, reduced or eliminated effector function may be desired. Several Fc variants in Table 61 substantially reduce or ablate FcγR binding, and thus may find use in antibodies and Fc fusions wherein effector function is undesirable. AlphaScreen™ binding data for some examples of such variants are shown in \nFigures 19a and 19b\n. These Fc variants, as well as their use in combination, may find use for eliminating effector function when desired, for example in antibodies and Fc fusions whose mechanism of action involves blocking or antagonism but not killing of the cells bearing target antigen.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5: Aglycosylated Fc variants\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs discussed, one goal of the current experiments was to obtain optimized aglycosylated Fc variants. Several Fc variants provide significant progress towards this goal. Because it is the site of glycosylation, substitution at N297 results in an aglycosylated Fc. Whereas all other Fc variants that comprise a substitution at N297 completely ablate FcγR binding, N297D/I332E has significant binding affinity for FcγRIIIa, shown in Table 61 and illustrated in \nFigure 20\n. The exact reason for this result is uncertain in the absence of a high-resolution structure for this variant, although the computational screening predictions suggest that it is potentially due to a combination of new favorable Fc/FcγR interactions and favorable electrostatic properties. Indeed other electrostatic substitutions are envisioned for further optimization of aglycosylated Fc. Table 61 shows that other aglycosylated Fc variants such as S239D/N297D/I332E and N297D/A330Y/I332E provide binding enhancements that bring affinity for FcγRIIIa within 0.28- and 0.43-fold respectively of glycosylated WT alemtuzumab. Combinations of these variants with other Fc variants that enhance FcγR binding are contemplated, with the goal of obtaining aglycosylated Fc variants that bind one or more FcγRs with affinity that is approximately the same as or even better than glycosylated parent Fc. An additional set of promising Fc variants provide stability and solubility enhancements in the absence of carbohydrate. Fc variants that comprise substitutions at positions 241, 243, 262, and 264, positions that do not mediate FγR binding but do determine the interface between the carbohydrate and Fc, ablate FγR binding, presumably because they perturb the conformation of the carbohydrate. In deglycosylated form, however, Fc variants F241 E/F243RN262E/V264R, F241 E/F243Q/V262T/V264E, F241R/F243Q/V262T/V264R, and F241E/F243Y/V262T/V264R show stronger binding to FcγRIIIa than in glycosylated form, as shown by the AlphaScreen™ data in \nFigure 21\n. This result indicates that these are key positions for optimization of the structure, stability, solubility, and function of aglycosylated Fc. Together these results suggests that protein engineering can be used to restore the favorable functional and solution properties of antibodies and Fc fusions in the absence of carbohydrate, and pave the way for aglycosylated antibodies and Fc fusions with favorable solution properties and full functionality that comprise substitutions at these and other Fc positions.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 6. Affinity of Fc variants for polymorphic forms of FcγRIIIa\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs discussed above, an important parameter of Fc-mediated effector function is the affinity of Fc for both V158 and F158 polymorphic forms of FcγRIIIa. AlphaScreen™ data comparing binding of select variants to the two receptor allotypes are shown in \nFigure 22a\n (V158 FcγRIIIa) and \nFigure 22b\n (F158 FcγRIIIa). As can be seen, all variants improve binding to both FcγRIIIa allotypes. These data indicate that those Fc variants of the present invention with enhanced effector function will be broadly applicable to the entire patient population, and that enhancement to clinical efficacy will potentially be greatest for the low responsive patient population who need it most.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe FcγR binding affinities of these Fc variants were further investigated using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). SPR is a sensitive and extremely quantitative method that allows for the measurement of binding affinities of protein-protein interactions, and has been used to effectively measure Fc/FcγR binding (\nRadaev et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:16478-16483\n). SPR thus provides an excellent complementary binding assay to the AlphaScreen™ assay. His-tagged V158 FcγRIIIa was immobilized to an SPR chip, and WT and Fc variant alemtuzumab antibodies were flowed over the chip at a range of concentrations. Binding constants were obtained from fitting the data using standard curve-fitting methods. Table 62 presents dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of select Fc variants to V158 FcγRIIIa and F158 FcγRIIIa obtained using SPR, and compares these with IC50s obtained from the AlphaScreen™ assay. By dividing the Kd and IC50 for each variant by that of WT alemtuzumab, the fold-improvements over WT (Fold) are obtained.\n\n \n \nTable 62\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSPR V158 FcγRIIIa\n \n \n \nSPR F158 FcγRIIIa\n \n \n \nAlphaScreen™ V158 FcγRIIIa\n \n \n \nAlphaScreen™ F158 FcγRIIIa\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKd (nM)\n \n \n \nFold\n \n \n \nKd (nM)\n \n \n \nFold\n \n \n \nIC50 (nM)\n \n \n \nFold\n \n \n \nIC50 (nM)\n \n \n \nFold\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWT\n \n \n68\n \n \n \n730\n \n \n \n6.4\n \n \n \n17.2\n \n \n \n \n \n \nV264I\n \n \n64\n \n1.1\n \n550\n \n1.3\n \n4.5\n \n1.4\n \n11.5\n \n1.5\n \n \n \n \nI332E\n \n \n31\n \n2.2\n \n72\n \n10.1\n \n1.0\n \n6.4\n \n2.5\n \n6.9\n \n \n \n \nV264I/\nI332E\n \n \n \n17\n \n4.0\n \n52\n \n14.0\n \n0.5\n \n12.8\n \n1.1\n \n15.6\n \n \n \n \nS298A\n \n \n52\n \n1.3\n \n285\n \n2.6\n \n2.9\n \n2.2\n \n12.0\n \n1.4\n \n \n \n \nS298A/\nE333A/ K334A\n \n \n \n39\n \n1.7\n \n156\n \n4.7\n \n2.5\n \n2.6\n \n7.5\n \n2.3\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe SPR data corroborate the improvements to FcγRIIIa affinity observed by AlphaScreen™ assay. Table 62 further indicates the superiority of V264I/I332E and 1332E over S298A and S298A/E333A/K334A; whereas S298A/E333A/K334A improves Fc binding to V158 and F158 FcγRIIIa by 1.7-fold and 4.7-fold respectively, I332E shows binding enhancements of 2.2-fold and 10.1-fold respectively, and V264I/I332E shows binding enhancements of 4.0-fold and 14-fold respectively. Also worth noting is that the affinity of V264I/I332E for F158 FcγRIIIa (52 nM) is better than that of WT for the V158 allotype (68 nM), suggesting that this Fc variant, as well as those with even greater improvements in binding, may enable the clinical efficacy of antibodies for the low responsive patient population to achieve that currently possible for high responders. The correlation between the SPR and AlphaScreen™ binding measurements are shown in \nFigures 23a - 23d\n. \nFigures 23a and 23b\n show the Kd - IC50 correlations for binding to V158 FcγRIIIa and F158 FcγRIIIa respectively, and \nFigures 23c and 23d\n show the fold-improvement correlations for binding to V158 FcγRIIIa and F158 FcγRIIIa respectively. The good fits of these data to straight lines (r\n2\n = 0.9, r\n2\n = 0.84, r\n2\n = 0.98, and r\n2\n = 0.90) support the accuracy the AlphaScreen™ measurements, and validate its use for determining the relative Fc□R binding affinities of Fc variants.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 7. ADCC of Fc variants\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to determine the effect on effector function, cell-based ADCC assays were performed on select Fc variants. ADCC was measured using the DELFIA® EuTDA-based cytotoxicity assay (Perkin Elmer, MA) with purified human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) as effector cells. Target cells were loaded with BATDA at 1x10\n8\n cells/ml, washed 4 times and seeded into 96-well plate at 10,000 cells/well. The target cells were then opsonized using Fc variant or WT antibodies at the indicated final concentration. Human PBMCs were added at the indicated fold-excess of target cells and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 4 hrs. The co-cultured cells were centrifuged at 500xg, supernatants were transferred to a separate plate and incubated with Eu solution, and relative fluorescence units were measured using a Packard Fusion™ reader (Packard Biosciences, IL). Samples were run in triplicate to provide error estimates (n=3, +/- S.D.). PBMCs were allotyped for the V158 or F158 FcγRIIIa allotype using PCR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nADCC assays were run on Fc variant and WT alemtuzumab using DoHH-2 lymphoma target cells. \nFigure 24a\n is a bar graph showing the ADCC of these proteins at 10 ng/ml antibody. Results show that alemtuzumab Fc variants I332E, V264I, and I332E/V264I have substantially enhanced ADCC compared to WT alemtuzumab, with the relative ADCC enhancements proportional to their binding improvements to FcγRIIIa as indicated by AlphaScreen™ assay and SPR. The dose dependence of ADCC on antibody concentration is shown in \nFigure 24b\n. These data were normalized to the minimum and maximum fluorescence signal provided by the baselines at low and high concentrations of antibody respectively. The data were fit to a sigmoidal dose-response model using nonlinear regression, represented by the curve in the figure. The fits enable determination of the \neffective concentration\n 50% (EC50) (i.e. the concentration required for 50% effectiveness), which provides the relative enhancements to ADCC for each Fc variant. The EC50s for these binding data are analogous to the IC50s obtained from the AlphaScreen™ competition data, and derivation of these values is thus analogous to that described in Example 2 and \nFigure 11\n. In \nFigure 24b\n, the log(EC50)s, obtained from the fits to the data, for WT, V264I/I332E, and S239D/I332E alemtuzumab are 0.99, 0.60, and 0.49 respectively, and therefore their respective EC50s are 9.9, 4.0, and 3.0. Thus V264I/I332E and S239E/I332E provide a 2.5-fold and 3.3-fold enhancement respectively in ADCC over WT alemtuzumab using PBMCs expressing heterozygous V158/F158 FcγRIIIa. These data are summarized in Table 63 below.\n\n \n \nTable 63\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlog(EC50)\n \n \n \nEC50 (ng/ml)\n \n \n \nFold Improvement Over WT\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWT\n \n \n0.99\n \n9.9\n \n \n \n \n \n \nV264I/I332E\n \n \n0.60\n \n4.0\n \n2.5\n \n \n \n \nS239D/I332E\n \n \n0.49\n \n3.0\n \n3.3\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to determine whether these ADCC enhancements are broadly applicable to antibodies, select Fc variants were evaluated in the context of rituximab and trastuzumab. ADCC assays were run on V264I/I332 WT, and S298A/D333A/K334A rituximab using WIL2-S lymphoma target cells. \nFigure 25a\n presents a bar graph showing the ADCC of these proteins at 1 ng/ml antibody. Results indicate that V264I/I332E rituximab provides substantially enhanced ADCC relative to WT rituximab, as well as superior ADCC to S298A/D333A/K334A, consistent with the FcγRIIIa binding improvements observed by AlphaScreen™ assay and SPR. \nFigure 25b\n shows the dose dependence of ADCC on antibody concentration. The EC50s obtained from the fits of these data and the relative fold-improvements in ADCC are provided in Table 64 below. As can be seen V264I/I332E rituximab provides an 11.3-fold enhancement in EC50 over WT for PBMCs expressing homozygous F158/F158 FcγRIIIa. The greater improvements observed for rituximab versus alemtuzumab are likely due to the use of homozygous F158/F158 FcγRIIIa rather than heterozygous V158/F158 FcγRIIIa PBMCs, as well as potentially the use of different antibodies and target cell lines.\n\n \n \nTable 64\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlog(EC50)\n \n \n \nEC50 (ng/ml)\n \n \n \nFold Improvement Over WT\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWT\n \n \n0.23\n \n1.7\n \n \n \n \n \n \nS298A/E333A/K334A\n \n \n-0.44\n \n0.37\n \n4.6\n \n \n \n \nV264I/I332E\n \n \n-0.83\n \n0.15\n \n11.3\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nADCC assays were run on Fc variant and WT trastuzumab using two breast carcinoma target cell lines BT474 and Sk-Br-3. \nFigure 26a\n shows a bar graph illustrating ADCC at 1 ng/ml antibody.

The EC50s obtained from the fits of these data and the relative fold-improvements in ADCC are provided in Table 65 below.

S239D/A330L/I332E trastuzumab shows the largest increase in effector function observed thus far, providing an approximate 50-fold enhancement in EC50 over WT for PBMCs expressing homozygous F158/F158 FcγRIIIa.\n\n \n \nTable 66\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlog(EC50)\n \n \n \nEC50 (ng/ml)\n \n \n \nFold Improvement Over WT\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWT\n \n \n0.45\n \n2.83\n \n \n \n \n \n \nS298A/E333A/K334A\n \n \n-0.17\n \n0.67\n \n4.2\n \n \n \n \nS239D/I332E\n \n \n-0.18\n \n0.66\n \n4.3\n \n \n \n \nS239D/A330Y/I332E\n \n \n-0.29\n \n0.51\n \n5.5\n \n \n \n \nS239D/S298A/I332E\n \n \n-0.52\n \n0.30\n \n9.4\n \n \n \n \nS239D/A330L/I332E\n \n \n-1.22\n \n0.06\n \n47.2\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExample 8. Complement binding and activation by Fc variants\n Complement protein C1q binds to a site on Fc that is proximal to the FcγR binding site, and therefore it was prudent to determine whether the Fc variants have maintained their capacity to recruit and activate complement. The AlphaScreen™ assay was used to measure binding of select Fc variants to the complement protein C1q. The assay was carried out with biotinylated WT alemtuzumab antibody attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2, and using C1q coupled directly to acceptor beads. Binding data of select Fc variants shown in \nFigure 27a\n indicate that C1q binding is uncompromised. Cell-based CDC assays were also performed on select Fc variants to investigate whether Fc variants maintain the capacity to activate complement. Amar Blue was used to monitor lysis of Fc variant and WT rituximab-opsonized WIL2-S lymphoma cells by human serum complement (Quidel, San Diego, CA). The results shown in \nFigure 27b\n for select Fc variants indicate that CDC is uncompromised.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 9. Protein A binding by Fc variants\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs discussed, bacterial protein A binds to the Fc region between the C□2 and C□3 domains, and is frequently employed for antibody purification. The AlphaScreen™ assay was used to measure binding of select Fc variants to the protein A using biotinylated WT alemtuzumab antibody attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2, and using protein A coupled directly to acceptor beads. The binding data shown in \nFigure 28\n for select Fc variants indicate that the capacity of the Fc variants to bind protein A is uncompromised. These results suggest that affinity of the Fc variants for other Fc ligands that bind the same site on Fc as protein A, such as the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn and protein G, are also unaffected.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 10. Capacity of Fc variants to bind mouse Fc□Rs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOptimization of Fc to nonhuman Fc□Rs may be useful for experimentally testing Fc variants in animal models. For example, when tested in mice (for example nude mice, SCID mice, xenograft mice, and/or transgenic mice), antibodies and Fc fusions that comprise Fc variants that are optimized for one or more mouse Fc□Rs may provide valuable information with regard to efficacy, mechanism of action, and the like. In order to evaluate whether the Fc variants of the present invention may be useful in such experiments, affinity of select Fc variants for mouse FcyRIII was measured using the AlphaScreen™ assay. The AlphaScreen™ assay was carried out using biotinylated WT alemtuzumab attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2, and GST-tagged mouse FcγRIII bound to glutathione chelate acceptor beads, expressed and purified as described in Example 2. These binding data are shown in \nFigure 29\n. Results show that some Fc variants that enhance binding to human FcγRIIIa also enhance binding to mouse FcγRIIIa. This result indicates that the Fc variants of the present invention, or other Fc variants that are optimized for nonhuman FcγRs, may find use in experiments that use animal models.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 11. Validation of Fc variants expressed in CHO cells\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWhereas the Fc variants of the present invention were expressed in 293T cells for screening purposes, large scale production of antibodies is typically carried out by expression in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines. In order to evaluate the properties of CHO-expressed Fc variants, select Fc variants and WT alemtuzumab were expressed in CHO cells and purified as described in Example 2. \nFigure 30\n shows AlphaScreen™ data comparing binding of CHO- and 293T- expressed Fc variant and WT alemtuzumab to human V158 FcγRIIIa. The results indicate that the Fc variants of the present invention show comparable FcγR binding enhancements whether expressed in 293T or CHO.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 12. Therapeutic application of Fc variants\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA number of Fc variants described in the present invention have significant potential for improving the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer antibodies. For illustration purposes, a number of Fc variants of the present invention have been incorporated into the sequence of the antibody rituximab. The WT rituximab light chain and heavy chain, described in \n \nUS 5,736,137\n \n, are provided in \nFigures 31a\n and 32b. The improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences are provided in \nFigure 31c\n. The improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences comprise at least non-WT amino acid selected from the group consisting of X\n1\n, X\n2\n, X\n3\n, X\n4\n, X\n5\n, and X\n6\n. These improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences may also comprise a substitution Z\n1\n. The use of rituximab here is solely an example, and is not meant to constrain application of the Fc variants to this antibody or any other particular antibody or Fc fusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll references are herein expressly incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhereas particular embodiments of the invention have been described above for purposes of illustration, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that numerous variations of the details may be made without departing from the invention as described in the appended claims.\n\nThe invention further includes the subject matter of the claims of \n \nEP 08020666.7\n \n from which this application is derived, the content of which is reproduced below as numbered paragraphs.\n\n \n \n \n \nParagraph\n 1.

No. PCT/US2008/072267 filed on Aug. 6, 2008, which claims priority from 60/954,649 filed on Aug. 8, 2007 and 61/030,082 filed on Feb. 20, 2008 in the United States.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to pyrrolopyrimidine derivatives, compositions and medicaments containing the same, as well as processes for the preparation and use of such compounds, compositions and medicaments. Such pyrrolopyrimidine derivatives are useful in the treatment of diseases associated with inappropriate IGF-1R and IR activity.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nReceptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have been implicated in cellular signaling pathways that control various cellular functions, including cell division, growth, metabolism, differentiation, and survival, through reversible phosphorylation of the hydroxyl groups of tyrosine residues in proteins. Extracellular signals are transduced via activation of the cell surface receptors, with amplification and propagation using a complex choreography of cascades of protein phosphorylation, and protein dephosphorylation events to avoid uncontrolled signaling. These signaling pathways are highly regulated, often by complex and intermeshed kinase pathways where each kinase may itself be regulated by one or more other kinases and protein phosphatases. The biological importance of these finely tuned systems is such that a variety of cell proliferative disorders have been linked to defects in one or more of the various cell signaling pathways mediated by tyrosine or serine/threonine kinases.\n\n\nReceptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) catalyse phosphorylation of certain tyrosyl amino acid residues in various proteins, including themselves, which govern cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase ubiquitous among fetal and post-natal cell types.\n\n\nThe IGF signaling axis is made up of multiple ligands (IGF-1, IGF-2 and Insulin), at least six high affinity ligand binding proteins and proteases, multiple receptors (IGF-1R & IGF-2R, IR and IRR), and many other down stream signaling proteins (Pollak, M N et al., Nature Reviews Cancer (2004) 4(7):505-518). The structure and function of the IGF-1R has been reviewed by Adams et al., Cell. Mol. Life Sci. (2000) 57:1050-1093 and Benito, M et al., Int J Biochem Cell Biol (1996) 28(5):499-510. The receptor is activated by the ligands IGF-1 and IGF-2, which are mitogenic proteins that signal through the IGF-1R and IR in an endocrine, paracrine or autocrine manner. Activation of the IGF-1 receptor elicits cellular responses which include cellular proliferation and protection of cells from apoptosis. (Id.) Overexpression of IGF-1R leads to malignant transformation of cultured cells, while downregulation can reverse the transformed phenotype of tumor cells and potentially render them susceptible to apoptosis. (Id.)\n\n\nThere are two splice variants of the IR gene, the IR-B isoform which regulates glucose uptake and is expressed in liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and the exon 11 variant human insulin receptor isoform A (IR-A) binds IGF-2 with high affinity and promotes proliferation and protection from apoptosis (Sciacca L. Oncogene (2002) 21(54):8240-8250). IR-A is predominantly expressed in fetal tissue and malignancies and at this receptor, IGF-2 is more potent than insulin in stimulating cancer cell migration. (Sciacca, Oncogene (2002) supra). Insulin receptor-related receptor (IRR) has 79% homology with the kinase domain of IR and is expressed only in a few limited cell types (Dandekar, A A et al., Endocrinology (1998) 139(8):3578-3584).\n\n\nIGF-1R is a hetero-tetrameric, transmembrane, cell surface receptor. (Benito, Int J Biochem Cell Biol (1996)) An IGF-1 binding domain is part of the extracellular alpha-chain of IGF-1R, whereas the intracellular beta-chain contains the tyrosine kinase domain. Three tyrosine residues represent autophosphorylation sites, specifically Tyr1131, Tyr1135, and Tyr1136, within the activation loop of the IGF-1R beta catalytic domain (Li, W et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2006) 281(33):23785-23791). Phosphorylation of all three is required for full receptor activation, and preceeds phosphorylation of juxtamembrane tyrosines and carboxy terminus serines. The insulin receptor has three similar autophosphorylation sites on the activation loop and juxtamembrane region. Activation and autophoshorylation results in the recruitment of multiple docking proteins and the generation of intracellular signaling (Benito, Int J Biochem Cell Biol (1996)). Once activated, IGF-1R and IR can phosphorylate or interact directly with a number of intracellular protein substrates, including IRS-1, IRS-2, grb2, grb10, grb14, Shc, SOC, 14.3.3, FAK, or indirectly with other proteins like PI3K and MAPK (Benito, M et al. Int J Biochem Cell Biol (1996) 28(5):499-510) (Brown, G C et al., Biochem. J (1992) 284:1-13; Bruning, J C et al., Mol. Cell (1998) 2(5):559-569). Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is of particular interest because of its role as a regulator of cell survival, proliferation, migration and invasion. FAK is activated by growth factor receptors such as IGF-1R, by binding through its N-terminal domain and autophosphorylation at TyR\n3\n97. Activated or over expressed FAK is common in a wide variety of cancers, and may play a role in human carcinogenesis (van Nimwegen, M J et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. (2007) 73(5):597-609).\n\n\nIn addition to its role in cancers, the insulin-like growth factor receptor plays important and diverse roles in growth and development (Benito, M et al. Int J Biochem Cell Biol (1996) 28(5):499-510). It IGF-1R has been implicated in several metabolic, and immunological diseases (Walenkamp, M J et al., Horm. Res. (2006) 66(5):221-230; Kurmasheva, R. T et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta—Rev on Cancer (2006) 1766(1):1-22; Bateman, J M et al., Cell. Mol. Life Sci. (2006) 63(15):1701-1705, LeRoith, D, et al., Can. Lett. (2003) 195:127-137 and Samani A, et al., Endocrine Reviews 28(1):20-47.)\n\n\nThe role of the IGF/IGF-1R signaling system in cancer has been thoroughly examined over the last 15 years. In particular, the implication of IGF-1R in human cancer stems from its roles in stimulating mitogenesis, mobility and metastasis and in protecting against apoptosis. (Kurmasheva, Biochim. Biophys. Acta (2006).) Interest has grown with the understanding that in addition to its antiapoptotic and mitogenic roles, IGF/IGF-1R signaling seems to be necessary for the establishment and continuation of a transformed phenotype. It has been well established that constitutive activation or over expression, often results in non-adherent cell growth, even under serum depleted conditions in vitro, and is associated with the formation of tumors in nude mice. (Kaleko M et al, Mol Cell Biol. (1990) 10(2): 464-473). Perhaps even more importantly, it has been firmly established that cells, in which the gene encoding for IGF-1R has been deactivated, are totally resistant to transformation by agents which are normally capable of immortalizing normal cells, such as over expression of PDGFR or EGFR, the T antigen of the SV40 virus, the E5 protein of bovine papilloma virus, and activated ras. (DeAngelis T et al., Cell. Physiol. (1995) 164( ):214-221; Coppola D et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. (1994) 14(7):4588-4595; Morrione A J, Virol. 1995 695300-5303; Sell C et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. (1994) 14(6):3604-3612; Sell C et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1993) 90(23):11217-11221). Thus, IGF-1R has been identified as the major survival factor that protects from oncogene induced cell death (Harrington et al., EMBO J. (1994) 13( ):3286-3295). IGF-1R is expressed in a large number and variety of tumors and the IGFs amplify the tumor growth through their interaction with the receptor. Evidence supporting the role of IGF-1R in carcinogenesis can be found in studies using monoclonal antibodies directed towards the receptor which inhibit the proliferation of numerous cell lines in culture and in vivo (Arteaga C et al., Cancer Res. (1989) 49(22):6237-6241; Li et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. (1993) 196(1):92-98; Scotlandi K et al., Cancer Res. (1998) 58(18):4127-4131). Dominant negative IGF-1R is capable of inhibiting tumor proliferation (Jiang et al., Oncogene (1999) 18(44):6071-6077).\n\n\nThe IGF signaling axis is implicated in various tumor types including: breast cancer (Surmacz, J. Mammary Gland Bio. Neoplasia (2000) 5(1):95-105, LeRoith, Can. Lett. (2003) and Artega, Cancer Res. (1989)), bone and bone marrow cancers including Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, giant cell tumor of bone (Scotlandi, Cancer Res. (1998) lung cancer, including non-small cell and small cell lung carcinomas and mesotheliomas (Jiang, Y et al., Oncogene (1999) 18:6071-6077 and LeRoith, Can. Lett. (2003), prostate cancer (Djavan et al., World J Urol. (2001) 19(4):225-233; O'Brien et al., Urology (2001) 58(1):1-7 and LeRoith, Can. Lett. (2003)), colorectal cancer (Guo et al., Gastroenterology, 1992, 102, 1101-1108; Durai, R et al., Int. J Colorectal Dis. (2005) 20(3):203-220 and LeRoith, Can. Lett. (2003)), renal cancer (Kellerer M. et al., Int. J. Cancer (1995) 62(5):501-507), pancreatic cancer (Bergmann, U et al., Cancer Res. (1995) 55(10):2007-2011), hematopoietic cancers, including lymphoblastic T cell leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy-cell leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic T cell leukemia, plasmacytoma, immunoblastic large cell leukemia, mantle cell leukemia, multiple myeloma, megakaryoblastic leukemia, acute megakaryocytic leukemia, promyelocytic leukemia, erythroleukemia, malignant lymphoma, Hodgkins lymphoma, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, lymphoblastic T cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndromes, (Zumkeller W et al., Leuk. Lymph (2002) 43(3):487-491; and Qi, Ann Hematol. (2006) 85:95-101.), neuroblastomas (Zumkeller, W et al., Horm. Metab. Res. 1999, 31, 138-141), gliomas, meningiomas, medulloblastomas, astrocytomas, and glioblastoma (Zumkeller, Wet al., Mol. Pathol. (2001) 54(4):227-229, Del Valle L, et al., Clin. Cancer Res. (2002) 8:1822-1830 and Trojan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (1992) 89:4874-4878.), thyroid cancer (Vella V et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. (2002) 87:245-254; Vella V et al., Mol. Pathol. (2001) 54(3):121-124), and hepatocarcinoma (Alexia, C et al., Biochem. Pharmacol.

present invention include those recited in the Examples which follow, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compounds of the present invention may be utilized in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) include conventional salts formed from pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic) inorganic or organic acids or bases as well as quaternary ammonium salts. Representative salts include the following: acetate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate, bromide, calcium edetate, camsylate, carbonate, chloride, clavulanate, citrate, dihydrochloride, edetate, edisylate, estolate, esylate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glutamate, glycollylarsanilate, hexylresorcinate, hydrabamine, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroxynaphthoate, iodide, isethionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, methylbromide, methylnitrate, methylsulfate, monopotassium maleate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate, N-methylglucamine, oxalate, pamoate (embonate), palmitate, pantothenate, phosphate/diphosphate, polygalacturonate, potassium, salicylate, sodium, stearate, subacetate, succinate, tannate, tartrate, teoclate, tosylate, triethiodide, trimethylammonium and valerate. Other salts, such as oxalic, which are not themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be useful in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining compounds of this invention and these form a further aspect of the invention.\n\n\nProcesses for preparing pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates of compounds such as the compounds of formula (I) are conventional in the art. See, e.g., Burger's Medicinal Chemistry And Drug Discovery 5th Edition, Vol 1: Principles And Practice.\n\n\nAs will be apparent to those skilled in the art, in the processes described below for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) certain intermediates may be in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates of the compound. Those terms as applied to any intermediate employed in the process of preparing compounds of formula (I) have the same meanings as noted above with respect to compounds of formula (I). Processes for preparing pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates of intermediates are known in the art and are analogous to the process for preparing pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates of compounds such as the compounds of formula (I).\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention may be in crystalline or non-crystalline form, and, if crystalline, may optionally be hydrated or solvated. This invention includes within its scope stoichiometric hydrates as well as compounds containing variable amounts of water.\n\n\nCertain compounds of formula (I) may exist in stereoisomeric forms (e.g. they may contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms or may exhibit cis-trans isomerism). The individual stereoisomers (enantiomers and diastereomers) and mixtures of these are included within the scope of the present invention. The present invention also covers the individual isomers of the compounds represented by formula (I) as mixtures with isomers thereof in which one or more chiral centres are inverted. It is understood that compounds of formula (I) may exist in tautomeric forms other than that shown in the formula and these are also included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nSince the compounds of formula (I) are intended for use in pharmaceutical compositions it will readily be understood that they are each preferably provided in substantially pure form, for example at least 60% pure, more suitably at least 75% pure and preferably at least 85%, especially at least 98% pure (% are on a weight for weight basis). Impure preparations of the compounds may be used for preparing the more pure forms used in the pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are inhibitors of one or more IGFR family receptors. By “IGFR inhibitor” is meant a compound which exhibits a pIC\n50 \nof greater than 5.5 against at least one IGFR family receptor in the IGFR inhibition enzyme assay described below (TR-FRET) and/or an IC\n50 \nof below about 1.0 μM potency against IGFR cellular autophosphorylation and/or in cell proliferation of a cell line that is dependent upon IGF signaling (e.g. Colo205, NCl-H929) in at least one of the cellular assay described below. In a more particular embodiment “IGFR inhibitor” refers to a compound which exhibits a pIC\n50 \nof greater than 7.6 against at least one IGFR family receptor in the IGFR inhibition enzyme assay described below. In an alternative particular embodiment “IGFR inhibitor” refers to a compound which exhibits an IC\n50 \nof below about 250 nM potency against IGFR cellular autophosphorylation and/or in cell proliferation of a cell line that is dependent upon IGF signaling (e.g. Colo205, NCl-H929) in at least one of the cellular assay described below.\n\n\nThe present invention is not limited to compounds of formula (I) which are selective for IGFR family receptor kinases; rather, the present invention expressly contemplates compounds of formula (I) which may also possess activity against receptors in addition to the IGFR family receptors. For instance, the compounds of formula (I) are selective for insulin receptor (IR) family kinases. Several compounds of the present invention also possess activity against, for instance, one or more of the Jnk1, Jnk2, and Jnk3, insulin related receptor (IRR), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK).\n\n\nWith regard to Anaplastic lymphoma kinase, ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of various cancers, and is named for its involvement in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a sub-type of non-Hodgkins lymphoma (Chiarle et al. (2008) Nature 8, 11-23).\n\n\nDysregulated activation of ALK in cancers is believed to occur primarily by fusion of the C-terminal intracellular domain containing the catalytic activity with one of several proteins having an oligomerization domain that drives the dimerization of the receptor (Duyster et al (2001) \nOncogene\n 20, 5623-5637). Dimerization of the ALK fusion proteins results in autophosphorylation and activation of downstream signal transduction cascades, ultimately leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Full-length ALK expression with or without gene amplification has been observed in neuroblastomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, and breast cancer in the absence of gene fusion (Chiarle et al. (2008)).\n\n\nALK fusions are found in some cases of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors and rare cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). In these cases, fusion of the ALK gene may play a role in tumorigenesis (Chiarle et al. (2008)). NPM-ALK has been found to be a transforming oncogene in in vitro models [Bai et al. (1998) Mol. Cell Biol. 18, 6951-6961) and in transgenic mice (Chiarle et al. (2003) Blood 101, 1919-1927), where expression of NPM-ALK in bone marrow precursor cells results in B-and T-cell lymphomas. More recently, fusions of ALK have been observed in lung cancers (Soda et al. (2007) Nature 448, 561-567; Rikova et al. (2007) Cell, 131, 1190-1203; Inamura et al. (2008) J. Thoracic Oncol. 3, 13-17; Koivenen et al, (2008) AACR Annual Meeting, San Diego, Calif., Abstract No. 2373).\n\n\nPreviously, a potent selective inhibitor of ALK, NVP-TAE68 (5-chloro-2,4-diaminophenylpyrimidine), has been shown to be active against ALCL cells in vitro and in tumor xenograft models (Galkin et al (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 270-275). The compound inhibited ALK autophosphorylation, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. PF2341066, a dual inhibitor of the Met tyrosine kinase and ALK has also been shown to inhibit the growth of ALCL cells in experimental systems in vitro and in vivo (Christensen et al. (2007) Mol. Cancer Ther. 6, 3314-3322). A series of fused pyrrolocarbazole-derived molecules (Wan et al. (2006) Blood, 107, 1617-1623), pyrazoloisoquinolines ((Li and Morris (2007)), and 5-aryl-pyridine-carboximides (Li et al (2006) J. Med. Chem. 49, 1006-1015) have also been reported to inhibit ALK activity and the proliferation of ALCL cells in vitro.\n\n\nThe present invention further provides compounds of formula (I) for use in medical therapy in a mammal, e.g. a human. In particular, the present invention provides compounds of formula (I) for use in the treatment of a condition mediated by at least one IGFR family receptor in a mammal, and, advantageously, conditions mediated by inappropriate activity of one or more IGFR family receptor in a mammal.\n\n\nThe inappropriate IGFR family receptor activity referred to herein is any IGFR receptor activity that deviates from the normal IGFR family receptor activity expected in a particular mammalian subject. Inappropriate IGFR family receptor activity may take the form of, for instance, an abnormal increase in activity, or an aberration in the timing and/or control of IGFR family receptor activity. Such inappropriate activity may result then, for example, from overexpression or mutation of the protein kinase or ligand leading to inappropriate or uncontrolled activation of the receptor. Furthermore, it is also understood that unwanted IGFR family receptor activity may reside in an abnormal source, such as a malignancy. That is, the level of IGFR family activity does not have to be abnormal to be considered inappropriate, rather the activity derives from an abnormal source.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) and salts and solvates thereof, are believed to have anticancer and antitumor activity as a result of inhibition of one or more IGFR family receptor and its effect on selected cell lines whose growth is dependent on IGFR family activity.\n\n\nThe present invention provides compounds of formula (I) for use in the treatment of a susceptible neoplasm. “Susceptible neoplasm” as used herein refers to neoplasms which are susceptible to treatment with a IGFR inhibitor. Neoplasms which have been associated with inappropriate activity of one or more IGFR family receptors and are therefor susceptible to treatment with a IGFR inhibitor are known in the art, and include both primary and metastatic tumors and cancers. For example, susceptible neoplasms within the scope of the present invention include but are not limited to breast cancer, sarcomas, lung cancer (including non-small cell lung carcinoma), prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, renal cancer, pancreatic cancer, hematologic cancers (including multiple myeloma), neuroblastomas, gliomas, head and neck cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, vulval cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, testicular cancer, bladder cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, nasopharangeal cancer, buccal cancer, cancer of the mouth, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and skin cancer (including melanoma). More particularly, susceptible neoplasms may be selected from breast cancer, sarcoma, lung cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, hematologic cancers, multiple myeloma, head and neck cancer, and ovarian cancer.\n\n\nThe present invention provides methods for the treatment of several conditions in a mammal in need thereof, all of which comprise the step of administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I). The mammal in need of treatment with a compound of the present invention is advantageously a human.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “treatment” refers to alleviating the specified condition, eliminating or reducing the symptoms of the condition, slowing or eliminating the progression of the condition and preventing or delaying the reoccurrance of the condition in a previously afflicted subject.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “therapeutically effective amount” means an amount of a compound of formula (I) which is sufficient, in the subject to which it is administered, to elicit the biological or medical response of a cell culture, tissue, system, mammal (including human) that is being sought, for instance, by a researcher or clinician. The term also includes within its scope amounts effective to enhance normal physiological function. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) for the treatment of a condition mediated by at least one IGFR family receptor is an amount sufficient to treat the condition in the subject. Similarly, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) for the treatment of a susceptible neoplasm is an amount sufficient to treat the susceptible neoplasm in the subject. In one embodiment of the present invention, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) is an amount sufficient to regulate, modulate, bind or inhibit at least one IGFR family receptor.\n\n\nThe precise therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of formula (I) will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the age and weight of the subject being treated, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, the nature of the formulation, and the route of administration, and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. Typically, the compound of formula (I) will be given for treatment in the range of 0.1 to 200 mg/kg body weight of recipient (mammal) per day and more usually in the range of 1 to 100 mg/kg body weight per day. Acceptable daily dosages, may be from about 0.1 to about 2000 mg/day, and preferably from about 0.1 to about 100 mg/day. Thus, for a 70 kg adult human being treated for a condition mediated by at least one IGFR family receptor, the actual amount per day would usually be from 5 to 700 mg and this amount may be given in a single dose per day or more usually in a number (such as two, three, four, five or six) of sub-doses per day or, alternatively, on an alternative dosing schedule such as weekly or monthly, such that the total daily dose is the same. A therapeutically effective amount of a salt or solvate, may be determined as a proportion of the therapeutically effective amount of the compound of formula (I) per se. It is envisaged that similar dosages would be appropriate for treatment of the other conditions referred to above.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides the use of a compound of formula (I) for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of condition mediated by at least one IGFR family receptor in a mammal (e.g., a human) in need thereof. The present invention further provides the use of a compound of formula (I) for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a susceptible neoplasm in a mammal.\n\n\nWhile it is possible that, for use in therapy, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) may be administered as the raw chemical, it is typically presented as the active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition or formulation. Accordingly, the invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula (I). The pharmaceutical composition may further comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, and/or excipients. The carrier(s), diluent(s) and/or excipient(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is also provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation including admixing a compound of the formula (I) with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents and/or excipients.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations may be adapted for administration by any appropriate route, for example by the oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual or transdermal), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intradermal) route. Such formulations may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for example by bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier(s) or excipient(s).\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules or tablets; powders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or whips; or oil-in-water liquid emulsions or water-in-oil liquid emulsions.\n\n\nFor instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Powders are prepared by comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing with a similarly comminuted pharmaceutical carrier such as an edible carbohydrate, as, for example, starch or mannitol. Flavoring, preservative, dispersing and coloring agent can also be present.\n\n\nCapsules are made by preparing a powder mixture, as described above, and filling formed gelatin sheaths. Glidants and lubricants such as colloidal silica, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate or solid polyethylene glycol can be added to the powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrating or solubilizing agent such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate or sodium carbonate can also be added to improve the availability of the medicament when the capsule is ingested.\n\n\nMoreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like. Tablets are formulated, for example, by preparing a powder mixture, granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and disintegrant and pressing into tablets. A powder mixture is prepared by mixing the compound, suitably comminuted, with a diluent or base as described above, and optionally, with a binder such as carboxymethylcellulose, an aliginate, gelatin, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a solution retardant such as paraffin, a resorption accelerator such as a quaternary salt and/or an absorption agent such as bentonite, kaolin or dicalcium phosphate. The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials and forcing through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powder mixture can be run through the tablet machine and the result is imperfectly formed slugs broken into granules. The granules can be lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. The compounds of the present invention can also be combined with a free flowing inert carrier and compressed into tablets directly without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A clear or opaque protective coating consisting of a sealing coat of shellac, a coating of sugar or polymeric material and a polish coating of wax can be provided. Dyestuffs can be added to these coatings to distinguish different unit dosages.\n\n\nOral fluids such as solution, syrups and elixirs can be prepared in dosage unit form so that a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of the compound. Syrups can be prepared by dissolving the compound in a suitably flavored aqueous solution, while elixirs are prepared through the use of a non-toxic alcoholic vehicle. Suspensions can be formulated by dispersing the compound in a non-toxic vehicle. Solubilizers and emulsifiers such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and polyoxy ethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavor additive such as peppermint oil or natural sweeteners or saccharin or other artificial sweeteners, and the like can also be added.\n\n\nWhere appropriate, dosage unit formulations for oral administration can be microencapsulated. The formulation can also be prepared to prolong or sustain the release as for example by coating or embedding particulate material in polymers, wax or the like.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may be administered by inhalation, such as by metered dose pressurised aerosols, metered dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, nebulizers or insufflators.\n\n\nAccording to one embodiment, the compound is provided in the form of a dry powder composition. As such, the composition is suitable for inhaled administration and may be incorporated into a plurality of sealed dose containers (e.g. containing the dry powder composition) mounted in a strip or ribbon inside a suitable inhalation device. The container is rupturable or peel-openable on demand and the dose of the dry powder composition may be administered by inhalation via a device such as the DISKUS™ device, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline. The DISKUS™ inhalation device is, for example, described in GB2242134A.\n\n\nAccording to another embodiment, the compounds of formula (I) may be formulated into spray compositions for inhalation which may, for example, be formulated as aqueous solutions or suspensions or as aerosols delivered from pressurised packs, such as a metered dose inhaler (MDI), with the use of a suitable liquefied propellant. Aerosol compositions suitable for inhalation can be either a suspension or a solution and generally contain a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and a suitable propellant such as a fluorocarbon or hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbon or mixtures thereof, particularly hydrofluoroalkanes, especially 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane or a mixture thereof. The aerosol composition may optionally contain additional formulation excipients well known in the art such as surfactants e.g. oleic acid, lecithin or an oligolactic acid derivative e.g. as described in WO94/21229 and WO98/34596 and cosolvents e.g. ethanol.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may also be delivered by the use of monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are coupled. The compounds may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the compounds may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches intended to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. For example, the active ingredient may be delivered from the patch by iontophoresis as generally described in Pharmaceutical Research, 3(6), 318 (1986).\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration may be formulated as ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols or oils.\n\n\nFor treatments of the eye or other external tissues, for example mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredient may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base or a water-in-oil base.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administrations to the eye include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges, pastilles and mouth washes.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for rectal administration may be presented as suppositories or as enemas.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the \nrange\n 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oil solutions of the active ingredient.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for administration by inhalation include fine particle dusts or mists, which may be generated by means of various types of metered, dose pressurised aerosols, nebulizers or insufflators.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation near isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets.\n\n\nIt should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavouring agents.\n\n\nIn the above-described methods of treatment and uses, a compound of the invention may be employed alone, in combination with one or more other compounds of the invention, or in combination with other therapeutic methods or agents. In particular, in methods of treating a condition improved by inhibition of IGF-1R and in methods of treating susceptible neoplasms, the compound of the invention may be used alone or in combination with one or more of a chemotherapeutic, a hormonal and/or antibody agent, surgical therapy, and radiotherapy.\n\n\nThe term “chemotherapeutic” as used herein refers to any chemical agent having a therapeutic effect on the subject to which it is administered. “Chemotherapeutic” agents include but are not limited to anti-neoplastic agents, analgesics and anti-emetics. As used herein, “anti-neoplastic agents” include both cytostatic and cytotoxic agents. Anti-emetics include but are not limited to 5HT\n3 \nantagonists such as ondansetron, granisetron, and the like; metaclopromide; dexamethasone and neurokinin-1 antagonists.\n\n\nAs an additional aspect, the present invention provides the methods of treatment and uses as described above, which comprise administering a compound of the invention together with at least one chemotherapeutic agent. In one particular embodiment, the chemotherapeutic agent is an anti-neoplastic agent. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition as described above further comprising at least one other chemotherapeutic agent, more particularly, the chemotherapeutic agent is an anti-neoplastic agent.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention and at least one additional anti-neoplastic therapy may be employed in combination concomitantly or sequentially in any therapeutically appropriate combination. The administration of a compound of the invention with one or more other anti-neoplastic agents may be in combination in accordance with the invention by administration concomitantly in (1) a unitary pharmaceutical composition including both or all compounds or (2) separate pharmaceutical compositions each including one of the compounds. The combination may be administered separately in a sequential manner wherein one anti-neoplastic agent is administered first and the other(s) second or vice versa. Such sequential administration may be close in time or remote in time.\n\n\nWhen a compound of the invention is used in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent, the dose of each compound may differ from that when the compound is used alone. Appropriate doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. The appropriate dose of the compound(s) of the invention and the other therapeutically active agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect, and are within the expertise and discretion of the attendant clinician.\n\n\nAmong the many chemotherapeutic agents, which may be used in combination with a compound of the present invention, are anti-proliferative/anti-neoplastic agents. Anti-neoplastic agents may induce anti-neoplastic effects in a cell-cycle specific manner, i.e., are phase specific and act at a specific phase of the cell cycle, or bind DNA and act in a non cell-cycle specific manner, i.e., are non-cell cycle specific and operate by other mechanisms. Both types of anti-neoplastic agents may be employed in combination with the compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nTypically, any chemotherapeutic agent that has activity against a susceptible neoplasm being treated may be utilized in combination with the compounds the invention, provided that the particular agent is clinically compatible with therapy employing a compound of the invention. Typical anti-neoplastic agents useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to: alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, antitumor antibiotics, antimitotic agents, topoisomerase I and II inhibitors, hormones and hormonal analogues, matrix metalloprotease inhibitors; signal transduction pathway inhibitors including inhibitors of cell growth or growth factor function, angiogenesis inhibitors, and serine/threonine inhibitors; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors; antisense therapies and immunotherapeutic agents.\n\n\nExamples of alkylating agents include but are not limited to: nitrogen mustards such as cyclophosphamides, temozolamide, melphalan, and chlorambucil; oxazaphosphor-ines; alkyl sulfonates such as busulfan; nitrosoureas such as carmustine; triazenes such as dacarbazine; and platinum coordination complexes such as cisplatin, oxapliplatin and carboplatin.\n\n\nExamples of antimetabolite anti-neoplastic agents include purine and pyrimidine analogues and anti-folate compounds, and more specifically, hydroxyurea, cytosine, arabinoside, raltitrexed, tegafur, fluorouracil (e.g., 5FU), methotrexate, cytarabine, mecaptopurine and thioguanine.\n\n\nExamples of antitumor antibiotic agents include, but are not limited to, actinomycins such as dactinomycin, mitomycin-C, anthracyclins such as daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin; daunomycin, adriamycin and bleomycins.\n\n\nExamples of antimitotic agents include, but are not limited to, diterpenoids, vinca alkaloids, polo-like kinase (PLK) inhibitors and CenpE inhibitors.

Such protein tyrosine kinases can be broadly classified as receptor or non-receptor kinases.\n\n\nExamples of receptor tyrosine kinases, also known as “growth factor receptor inhibitors”, in addition to IGF-1R inhibitors, include but are not limited to inhibitors of: epidermal growth factor family receptors (EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB4); platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs), tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and epidermal growth factor homology domains (TIE-2), macrophage colony stimulating factor (c-fms), c-kit, c-met, fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), hepatocyte growth factor receptors (HGFRs), Trk receptors (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC), ephrin (Eph) receptors, the RET protooncogene, and Akt kinases.\n\n\nSeveral inhibitors of growth factor receptors are under development and include ligand antagonists, antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-sense oligonucleotides and aptamers. Any of these growth factor receptor inhibitors may be employed in combination with the compounds of the present invention in any of the compositions and methods/uses described herein. Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) is an example of an anti-erbB2 antibody inhibitor of growth factor function. One example of an anti-erbB1 antibody inhibitor of growth factor function is cetuximab (Erbitux™, C225). Examples of small molecule inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptors include but are not limited to lapatinib (Tykerb™), erlotinib (TARCEVA®), gefitinib (IRESSA®), canetinib or CI1033. Imitanib is one example of a PDGFR inhibitor. Examples of VEGFR inhibitors include pazopanib, ZD6474, AZD2171, PTK787, SU11248 and sunitinib.\n\n\nTyrosine kinases that are not growth factor receptor kinases are termed non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Inhibitors of non-receptor tyrosine kinases are sometimes referred to as “anti-metastatic agents” and are useful in the present invention. Targets or potential targets of anti-metastatic agents, include, but are not limited to, c-Src, Lck, Fyn, Yes, Jak, abl kinase (c-Abl and Bcr-Abl), FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Non-receptor kinases and agents, which inhibit non-receptor tyrosine kinase function, are described in Sinha, S. and Corey, S. J., (1999) J. Hematother. Stem Cell Res. 8:465-80; and Bolen, J. B. and Brugge, J. S., (1997) Annu. Rev. of Immunol. 15:371-404.\n\n\nSH2/SH3 domain blockers are agents that disrupt SH2 or SH3 domain binding in a variety of enzymes or adaptor proteins including, but not limited to, PI3-K p85 subunit, Src family kinases, adaptor molecules (Shc, Crk, Nck, Grb2) and Ras-GAP. Examples of Src inhibitors include but are not limited to dasatinib and BMS-354825 (J. Med. Chem (2004) 47:6658-6661).\n\n\nExamples of serine/threonine kinase inhibitors include, but are not limited to polo-like kinase inhibitors (Plk family e.g., Plk1, Plk2, and Plk3),such as 5-{6-[(4-Methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl}-3-{(1R)-1-[2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]ethoxy}thiophene-2-carboxamide; MAP kinase cascade blockers, which include Ras/Raf kinase inhibitors, mitogen or extracellular regulated kinases (MEKs), and extracellular regulated kinases (ERKs); Aurora kinase inhibitors (including inhibitors of Aurora A and Aurora B); protein kinase C (PKC) family member blockers; inhibitors of kappa-B (IkB) kinase family (IKK-alpha, IKK-beta); PKB/Akt kinase family inhibitors; and inhibitors of TGF-beta receptor kinases. Examples of Plk inhibitors are described in PCT Publication No. WO04/014899 to GlaxoSmithKline.\n\n\nInhibitors of urokinase, also referred to as urokinase-type Plasminogen Activator (uPA), expression may be used in combination with the compounds of the present invention in the compositions and methods described above.\n\n\nInhibitors of kinases involved in the IGF signalling axis may also be useful in combination with the compounds of the present invention. Such inhibitors include but are not limited to inhibitors of JNK1/2/3, PI3K, AKT and MEK, and 14.3.3 signalling inhibitors.\n\n\nCell cycle signaling inhibitors, including inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) are also useful in combination with the compounds of the invention in the compositions and methods described above. Examples of cyclin dependent kinases, including CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 and inhibitors for the same are described in, for instance, Rosania G. R., et al., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents (2000) 10:215-230.\n\n\nReceptor kinase angiogenesis inhibitors may also find use in the present invention. Inhibitors of angiogenesis related to VEGFR and TIE-2 are discussed above in regard to signal transduction inhibitors (both are receptor tyrosine kinases). Other inhibitors may be used in combination with the compounds of the present invention. For example, anti-VEGF antibodies, which do not recognize VEGFR (the receptor tyrosine kinase), but bind to the ligand; small molecule inhibitors of integrin (alpha\nv\n, beta\n3\n) that inhibit angiogenesis; endostatin and angiostatin (non-RTK) may also prove useful in combination with the compounds of the invention. One example of a VEGFR antibody is bevacizumab (Avastin™).\n\n\nInhibitors of phosphotidyl inositol-3-OH kinase family members including blockers of PI3-kinase, ATM, DNA-PK, and Ku may also be useful in combination with the present invention.\n\n\nAlso of potential use in combination with the compounds of the invention are myo-inositol signaling inhibitors such as phospholipase C blockers and myoinositol analogues.\n\n\nExamples of antisense therapies include those directed towards the targets described above such as ISIS 2503 and gene therapy approaches such as those using thymidine kinase or cytosine deaminase.\n\n\nAgents used in immunotherapeutic regimens may also be useful in combination with the compounds of the invention. Immunotherapeutic regimens include ex-vivo and in-vivo approaches to increasing immunogenicity of patient tumor cells such as transfection with cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, gMCFS and MCFS), approaches to increase T-cell activity, approaches with transfected immune cells and approaches with anti-idiotypic antibodies.\n\n\nAgents used in proapoptotic regimens (e.g., Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides) may also be used in combination with the compounds of the invention. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins block apoptosis. Upregulation of Bcl-2 has therefore been linked to chemoresistance. Studies have shown that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (i.e., mcl-1). Therefore, strategies designed to downregulate the expression of Bcl-2 in tumors have demonstrated clinical benefit and are now in Phase II/III trials, namely Genta's G3139 bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide. Such proapoptotic strategies using the antisense oligonucleotide strategy for Bcl-2 are discussed in Water, J. S., et al., J. Clin. Oncol. (2000) 18:1812-1823; and Kitada, S., et al., Antisense Res. Dev. (1994) 4:71-79.\n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) may be prepared using the processes described below. In all of the schemes described below, it is understood that protecting groups may be employed where necessary in accordance with general principles known to those of skill in the art, for example, see T. W. Green and P. G. M. Wuts (1991) Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons. These groups may be removed at a convenient stage of the compound synthesis using methods known to those of skill in the art. The selection of processes as well as the reaction conditions and order of their execution shall be consistent with the preparation of compounds of formula (I).\n\n\nThe invention also provides a process for preparing the compound of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof. Specifically, compounds of formula (I) are prepared by reacting the three main components of the compounds, referred to herein as the head, core, and tail of the compounds.\n\n\nSYNTHESIS AND SCHEMES\n\n\nEach compound of formula (I) may be conveniently prepared by separately preparing three constituents of the compound and subsequently combining those constituents to form the compound (I). For convenience, the three constituents are referred to herein as the head (II), the core (III), and the tail (IV). For convenience, the head, core, and tail nomenclature is used throughout to refer to each constituent when referred to individually, and also to refer to the corresponding moiety when described in the context of head/core, tail/core, and/or head/core/tail combinations.\n\n\nThe head component of the invented compounds is an o-amino carboxamide represented by formula (II):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein substituents R\n4\n, R\n5\n, and R\n6 \nare as defined above.\n\n\n\nThe core component of the invented compounds is pyrrolopyrimidine represented by formula (III):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein each of substituents L\n1 \nand L\n2 \nrepresent a leaving group, e.g. a halogen, preferably chlorine, or OTF, and X represents a protecting group, e.g. sulfonamide or alcholated alkyl, e.g. allyl, benzyl, or SEM.\n\n\n\nThe tail component of the invented compounds is a substituted aniline represented by formula (IV):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein substituents R\n7\n, R\n8\n, R\n9\n, and R\n10 \nare as defined above.\n\n\n\nThe head (II), core (III), and tail (IV) of the compounds may be combined, for instance, with the synthetic route shown in Scheme 1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown, a core of formula (III), for instance where L\n1 \nand L\n2 \nare Cl and X is sulfonamide (CiventiChem, Research Triangle Park, N.C.), is reacted with a head of formula (II) in the presence of a tertiary amine, e.g. DIPEA, and a polar protic solvent, preferably a hindered alcoholic solvent, e.g. iPrOH, at heat, e.g. 102° C. The result is the compound of formula (V).\n\n\nCompound of formula (V) is reacted with a tail of formula (IV) under a series of three sequential reaction conditions. First, an acid, e.g. HCl (2 eq.), is used with a catalyst, e.g. an iodine salt such as Kl or TBAI, and a polar protic solvent having low nucleophilicity, e.g. TFE, at heat, e.g. 85° C. Second, an amine-containing heteroatom nucleophile, e.g. NH\n4\nOH or R\n3\nNH\n2\n, is added in solvent, e.g. THF or THF/H\n2\nO. Third, a base, e.g. NaOMe, in solvent, e.g. MeOH/THF, is used to remove the protecting group X, resulting in the compound of formula (I).\n\n\nRemoval of the protecting group, e.g. sulfonamide, is preferably accomplished with the base with a mixture of polar protic solvent and ethereal solvent, e.g. MeOH/THF. Alternatively, when substituents R\n4 \nand R\n6 \nare both halogen, e.g. F, removal of the protecting group is preferably accomplished with a base, e.g. NaOH, in solvent, e.g. THF, under heat, e.g. 120° C. by microwave.\n\n\nCompound (I) is converted from compound (V) by displacement of leaving group L\n2 \nwith the functionalized aniline (IV) according to Scheme 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more particular description of the tail addition is shown in Scheme 2. Displacement of the L\n2 \ngroup by the functionalized aniline can be carried out using the carboxamide group as a means of internal activation. Treatment of the functionalized pyrrolopyrimidine with an aniline (IV), acid, e.g. HCl, optional iodide source catalyst, e.g. Kl and solvent, e.g. TFE, at heat, e.g. 80° C. for a length of typically 1 or 2 days affords the isolable tetracyclic species (VI). Reaction of the tetracyclic species (VI) to an amine-containing heteroatom nucleophile, e.g. NH\n4\nOH or R\n3\nNH\n2\n, added in solvent, e.g. THF or THF/H\n2\nO, affords ring opened, rearomatized products (VII) and (VIII). The alkyl group of the nucleophile is retained in the compounds (VII) and (VIII).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferring to Scheme 3, the head (II) may be installed on the core (III) at the 4-L\n1 \nposition by displacement of the 4-L\n1 \ngroup using either an acid or a base. Displacement under basic conditions with base, e.g. iPr\n2\nEtN, and polar protic solvent, e.g. iPrOH, at heat, e.g. 85° C. (2-5 days), is preferable for most classes of compounds (except for compounds II where the R\n4 \nposition is halogenated). Displacement using an acid is preferred for headgroups (II) having a halogen at position R\n4\n. In these cases 4-L\n1 \ndisplacement can be efficiently carried out using an acid, e.g. trifluoroacetic acid, in a polar protic solvent, e.g. trifluoroethanol, at heat, e.g. 80° C.\n\n\nA variety of aniline tails (IV) having substituents R\n7\n, R\n8\n, R\n9\n, and R\n10 \nas defined herein, may be prepared in accordance with schemes 4-9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme 4, 4-piperidinyl aniline tails can be prepared from commercially available starting materials, such as 2-methyl-4-chloro-nitrobenzene and 2-methoxy-4-chloro-nitrobenzene (both from Aldrich). Suzuki cross-coupling (\nPalladium Reagents and Catalysts\n, Jiro Tsuji, 2004, John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.) using a palladium source and base with either 3- or 4-pyridinyl boronic acid gives the corresponding 4-pyridyl nitrobenzenes in high yield. The pyridine is alkylated with any of a variety of primary alkyl halides, e.g. alkyl iodide or allyl bromide, in solvent, e.g. pinacolone. Reduction of the resulting pyridinium with, for example, a reducing agent and solvent, e.g. NaBH\n4\n/THF, gives the corresponding 3- or 4-tetrahydropyridine analogs (XII and XIII, respectively). If an allyl halide is used (see sequence 1-5 for compound XI), then an alkyl substitution may be incorporated by removal of the allyl with a deprotecting agent, e.g. a palladium source such as Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n4\n, optionally in presence of a cation trapping agent, e.g. dimethylbarbituric acid, to provide N-dealkylated tetrahydropyridines. The N-dealkylated tetrahydropyridines may be subsequently alkylated with alkyl iodides or bromides in polar solvent and base. Compounds XII and XIII may be selectively reduced with a reducing agent and hydrogen source, e.g. with Fe(III) and hydrazine (hereinafter referred to as “selective nitro reduction”), to provide 4-piperidinyl aniline tails IVa and IVd, respectively. Alternatively, compounds XII and XIII may be exhaustively reduced with a palladium source and hydrogen source in solvent, e.g. with Pd/C, H\n2\n, EtOH under pressure, such as 60 psi (hereinafter referred to as “exhaustive reduction”) to provide 4-piperidinyl anline tails IVb and IVe, respectively. For compounds XII where the alkyl substituent is an allyl group, the allyl may be replaced by a substitute alkyl group, including branched alkyls (see discussion with respect to sequence 1-5 for compound XI above). The resultant compound is then subjected to selective nitro reduction to provide compounds IVc with a branching alkyl group on the piperidyl nitrogen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in \nScheme\n 5, 4-piperazine 2-methoxy nitrobenzene tails can be generated via Buchwald/Hartwig coupling with, for instance, Pd\n2\n(dba)\n3\n, xantphos, dioxane, and CsCO\n3\n, (see Yin, Jingjun & Buchwald, Stephen. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 6043-6048) of a functionalized piperazine, e.g. PG=Me, iPr, Boc, etc., with an aromatic halide. The tail may be selectively nitro reduced to provide a directly functionalized aniline IVf where the protecting group (PG) remains as a substituent of the tail.\n\n\nAlternatively, the protecting group (PG) may be removed from the piperazine with an acid and solvent, e.g. TFA/CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, to form compound XIII. Compound XIII may be alkylated and then exhaustively nitro reduced to form aniline tail IVg. Alternatively, compound XIII may be acylated with an acylating agent, e.g. Ac\n2\nO, base, e.g. Et\n3\nN, and solvent, e.g. CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, and then exhaustively nitro reduced to form aniline tail IVh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in scheme 5a, 4-homopiperazine 2-methoxy nitrobenzene tails can be generated by coupling an aromatic halide (IVba) with a functionalized homopiperazine, e.g. PG=Boc, under basic conditions, e.g. K\n2\nCO\n3\n/DMSO, to form an intermediate which is deprotected with an acid, e.g. TFA/CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, reacted with an electrophile, e.g. Mel, iPrI, CISO\n2\nMe, under basic conditions, e.g. K\n2\nCO\n3 \nor DIPEA, and subsequently hydrogenated to form compound IVbb.\n\n\n2-methoxy-4-alkoxy anilines can be prepared by reaction of aromatic (IVba) with an alcohol, e.g. HO—R″ where R″ is as shown, under basic conditions, e.g. K\n2\nCO\n3\n/DMSO, followed by hydrogenation, e.g. H\n2 \nand Pd/C, to provide compounds IVbc and IVbd.\n\n\nSimilarly, reaction of (IVba) with (1-propyl-4-piperidinyl)methanol, followed by subsequent deprotection with acid, e.g. TFA, alkylation, e.g. propyl iodide, and nitro-reduction gave aniline (IVfa).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in scheme 6, 4-piperidinyl 2-methoxy nitrobenzenes can be prepared via direct displacement of 4-fluoro nitrobenzenes (XIV) (commercially available, ex. R\n8\n═F,R\n10\n═H from Aldrich; or literature compounds, ex. R\n8\n═R\n10\n═H as shown in Bolton, et al., Nucleophilic displacement in polyhaloaromatic compounds, Journal of the Chemical Society, Perkin Transactions 2: Physical Organic Chemistry (1972-1999) (1978),(2), 141-4; or R\n8\n═H, R\n10\n=Me as shown in Van Zandt, et al., Design and synthesis of highly potent and selective (2-arylcarbamoyl-phenoxy)-acetic acid inhibitors of aldose reductase for treatment of chronic diabetic complications, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry (2004), 12(21), 5661-5675). The 4-piperidinyl 2-methoxy nitrobenzene may be subject to SNAR displacement (reaction with an amine nucleophile, base, e.g. K\n2\nCO\n3\n, and polar solvent, e.g. DMSO) to provide aminated intermediate XV and subsequent selective nitro reduction to obtain aniline tails IVj. Alternatively, displacement with 4-piperdinol and oxidation with the Dess-Martin Periodinane (see Tohma, Hirofumi & Kita, Yasuyuki. Adv. Synth. Catal. 2004, 346, 111-124) gives the corresponding functionalized piperidinone, which can be subjected to reductive amination with a proton source, e.g. AcOH, buffer, e.g. Et\n3\nN, solvent, e.g. ClCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCl, acid stable hydride source, e.g. Na(OAc)\n3\nBH, and primary or secondary amine to give bicyclic 4-piperidinyl 2-methoxy anilines IVk, after nitro-reduction, where the amine provides the substituent of the piperidine ring. Where the amine is a Boc protected piperazine, the piperazine of compound IVk may be alkylated by the steps of Boc deprotection, alkylation, and selective nitro reduction, as described above, to produce aniline tail IVn.\n\n\nAlternatively, 4-fluoro nitrobenzenes (XIV) may be used to prepare the compounds of (IVm) via SNAR displacement using a Boc protected, followed by Boc deprotection, followed by alkylation with alkylating agent, e.g. ethylene methyl sulfone, a base, e.g. Et\n3\nN, solvent, e.g. CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, followed by selective nitro reduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme 7, commercially available 3-amino nitrobenzenes (for example R\n7\n=Me from Alpha Aesar, Ward Hill, Mass., R\n7\n═F from 3B Medical Systems, Libertyville, Ill., R\n7\n=Aldrich, R\n7\n═OCF\n3 \nfrom Matrix Scientific, Columbia, S.C.) can be acylated with an acylating agent, e.g. N,N-dimethylglycyl chloride in the presence of a base, e.g. Et\n3\nN, catalyst, e.g. DMAP, and solvent, e.g. CH\n2\nCL\n2\n. Subsequent exhaustive reduction of the nitro gives the corresponding functionalized 3-aminoacyl anilines IVp. If a-bromo-acetyl chloride is used rather than N,N-dimethylglycyl chloride, trapping of the intermediate α-bromo-acyl amine with an appropriate nucleophile (pyrrolidine in the example above) with base, e.g. K\n2\nCO\n3\n, catalyst Kl, and solvent, e.g. MeCN, and subsequent exhaustive reduction affords further functionalized 3-aminoacyl amines IVq. Alternatively, the compound may be subject to electron transfer reduction after trapping with a metal, e.g. SnCL\n2\n, and acid, e.g. AcOH.\n\n\nAlternatively, 2-methoxy-5-acyl anilines IVr may be made directly from commercially available 2-methoxy-5-nitro aniline, Aldrich. The NH\n2 \nof the aniline is first protected with a protecting agent, e.g. Boc\n2\nO, solvent, e.g. THF, and base, e.g. Et\n3\nN, then exhaustively reduced, then acylated with N,N-dimethylglycyl chloride (see acylation of IVp), and then deprotected with acid, e.g. TFA, and solvent, e.g. CH\n2\nCL\n2\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in scheme 8, 5-piperidinyl 2-methoxy anilines IVs were generated from Suzuki cross-coupling reactions (see scheme 4) with 5-bromo-2-methoxy nitrobenzene (3B Medical Systems, Libertyville, Ill.), then alkylation with an alkyl halide, e.g. I-propane, with solvent, e.g. pinacolone, then reduction with reducing agent, e.g. Na(CN)BH3, and acid, e.g. HCl with solvent, e.g. MeOH, then selective nitro reduction or electron transfer reduction (see scheme 7, electron transfer reduction of IVq). 5-Piperazinyl 2-methoxy anilines IVt were generated from Buchwald/Hartwig coupling (see scheme 5) with 5-bromo-2-methoxy nitrobenzene, then selective nitro reduction.\n\n\nAlternatively, 5-alkoxy 2-methoxy anilines (IVu) may be prepared by direct alkylation of 3-nitro, 4-methoxy phenol (CiventiChem, Research Triangle Park, N.C.) with an alkylating agent, e.g. (S)-(+)-Glycigyl-3-nitrobenzenesulfonate, and Lewis acid, e.g. LiCl, followed by alkylation with an amine alkylating agent, and solvent, e.g. isopropanol, at heat, e.g. microwave at 140° C. The product is subjected to selective nitro reduction to provide aniline tail IVu. Alternatively, the 3-nitro, 4-methoxy phenol may be alkylated with an alkylating agent, e.g. dimethylaminopropylchloride HCl, iodide source, e.g. TBAI, base, e.g. K\n2\nCO\n3\n, and solvent, e.g. MeCN, followed by selective nitro reduction to provide aniline tail IVw.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in scheme 9, bicyclic indane tails may be prepared using 5-methoxy indole (Aldrich) as a starting material. The 5-methoxy indole is first reduced using a hydride source, e.g. Na(CN)BH\n3\n, and acid, e.g. AcOH, then protected with an acylating agent, e.g. Ac\n2\nO, in solvent, e.g. AcOH, optionally with a base. The protection provides for subsequent selective nitration with nitrating agent, e.g. HNO\n3\n, and acid, e.g. Ac\n2\nO, followed by deprotection with acid, e.g. HCl in solvent, e.g. MeOH to provide intermediate XVI.\n\n\nIntermediate XVI is subjected to subsequent acylation with an acylating agent, e.g. α-bromoacetyl chloride, acryloyl chloride, or an amino acid, with coupling reagents, e.g. HATU, DMAP, and base, e.g. PS-DIPEA, and solvent, e.g. THF. The acylating agent may be reacted with an appropriate amine base, e.g. Me\n2\nNH (with solvent, e.g. THF), and the product then reduced (see reduction of IVa, scheme 4) to provide anilino indoline tails IVx.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in scheme 9a, additional indoline tails may be prepared by alternative schemes. Chloro aniline (IVbf) is readily prepared via acylation of 6-nitro indoline with an acylating agent, e.g. α-bromoacetyl chloride, subsequent displacement with an amine base, and nitro-reduction (hydrogenation). Subsequent reaction with an electrophilic halogen source, e.g. NCS, affords (IVbf).\n\n\nSimilarly, aniline (IVbh) is produced via nitration and deprotection of amide (IVbg) (see International Patent Publication WO 2001023374), acylation, e.g. α-bromoacetyl chloride, subsequent displacement with an amine base, and nitro-reduction to afford (IVbh). (IVbj) is prepared from (IVbi) in a manner analogous to that of (IVbh) from (IVbg).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in scheme 9b, tetrahydroquinoline tails may be prepared as follows.\n\n\nIntermediate (IVbk), prepared according to Chem. Pharm. Bull. (2001) p. 822, may be alkylated with an alkylating agent and base, e.g. MeI and K\n2\nCO\n3\n, then amide reduced, e.g. borane, treated with an acylating agent, e.g. α-chloro acetyl choride, an amine base, e.g. dimethyl amine, and nitro-reduced to provide (IVbl).\n\n\nIntermediate (IVbm), readily available 4-anisidine, may be acylated with 3,3-diemthylacryloyl chloride and base, e.g. K\n2\nCO\n3\n, heated with a Lewis acid, e.g. AlCl\n3\n, and solvent, e.g. methylene chloride, followed by nitration with an oxidative reagent, e.g. NaNO\n2\n, in acid, e.g. TFA. Subsequent amide reduction, e.g. borane, followed by treatment with an acylating agent, e.g. α-bromoacetyl choride, displacement with an amine base, e.g. dimethyl amine, and nitro reduction provides (IVbo).\n\n\nNitroreduction of amide intermediates shown in scheme 9b affords intermediate (IVbn).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in scheme 9c, tetrahydroisoquinoline tails may be prepared as follows.\n\n\nIntermediate (IVbp) may be acylated with e.g. ethyl chloroformate, heated with acid, e.g. polyphosphoric acid, to afford intermediate (IVbt). Subsequently, (IVbt) may be alkylated, e.g. Mel, NaH, nitrated, e.g. HNO\n3 \nin acid, amide reduced, e.g. borane, followed by nitro-reduction, e.g. H\n2\n, Pd/C, to afford (IVbq). Alternatively, (IVbq) may be provided from (IVbt) via (IVbu) by nitration and amide reduction prior to alkylation and nitro-reduction.\n\n\n(IVbs) may be prepared from (IVbu) via reductive amination, e.g. ketone and NaCNBH\n3\n, and nitro-reduction, e.g. H\n2\n, Pd/C.\n\n\n(IVbr) may be prepared from (IVbu) via acylation, e.g. acryloyl chloride, treatment with an amine base, e.g. dimethyl amine, and heat, followed by nitro-reduction, e.g. H\n2\n, Pd/C, and amide reduction, e.g. LiAlH\n4\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in \nscheme\n 10, a number of 4-piperazinyl anilines can be prepared using standard chemistries and readily available starting materials. For instance, tails IVaa and IVab may be prepared from 2,5-difluoro-4-bromo nitrobenzene and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-chloro-nitrobenzene (Alpha Aesar, Ward Hill, Mass. and ABCR Gmbh & Co., Germany, respectively) by treatment with sodium methoxide (only for compound IVaa) and Buchwald/Hartwig coupling (see scheme 8) with isopropyl piperazine, followed by selective nitro reduction (see reduction of IVa, scheme 4) to afford tails IVaa and IVab. Tail IVac may be prepared from 2-nitro-5-chloro-benzaldehyde (Aldrich) using Buchwald/Hartwig coupling with isopropyl piperazine as with IVaa and IVab, followed by Wittig olefination (see \nReactions and Syntheses in the Organic Chemistry Laboratory\n. Tietze, Lutz-Friedjan and Eicher, Theophil. 1989. University Science Books, Mill Valley, Calif.) with a phosphonium salt, e.g. MePPh\n3\nBr, and base, e.g. nBuLi, followed by hydrogenation (see hydrogenation of IVb, scheme 4).\n\n\nSulfone-containing tails IVad and IVae are readily prepared from 3-methoxy-4-nitro-benzyl alcohol and 3-nitro-4-methoxy benzyl alcohol, respectively (both from Aldrich), via chlorination (with for instance PPh\n3\n/NCS) followed by displacement of the derived benzyl chloride with methyl sulfone (with for instance MeSO\n2\nNa/EtOH), and nitro-reduction (see reduction of IVb, scheme 4).\n\n\nThe aniline tail (IVaf) was prepared from 2-methyl-5-hydroxy-fluoro-benzene by nitration with a nitrating agent, e.g. HNO\n3\n, catalyst, e.g. TBAI, and solvent, e.g. ClCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCl, followed by phenolic alkylation with an alkylating agent, e.g. Mel, base, e.g. K\n2\nCO\n3\n, solvent, e.g. DMF, at heat, e.g. 80° C. The intermediate is subjected to SNAR displacement (see scheme 6) using Boc protected piperizine, followed by Boc deprotection (see scheme 6), followed by alkylation with an alkylating agent, e.g. CH\n2\nCHSO\n2\nMe, and solvent, e.g. Et\n3\nN, followed by selective nitro reduction, to provide IVaf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional anilines may be prepared as illustrated in Scheme 10b. Aniline (IVca) can be subjected to reductive amination conditions (e.g. formaldehyde, sodium methoxide, sodium borohydride), followed by acylation with an acylating agent and base (e.g. α-bromo-acetyl-chloride and diisopropylethylamine), followed by exposure to an amine or other nucleophile (e.g. diemthyl amine) to afford (IVcb). Nitration of (IVca) with a nitrating agent and acid (e.g. sodium nitrite/TFA) followed by nitro reduction with a reducing agent (e.g. Pd/C and hydrogen gas) affords aniline (IVcc). Similarly, (IVca) can be protected (e.g. with an acyl group) and subsequently exposed to nitration conditions as described above for (IVcb) to give (IVcd). Subsequent deprotection (e.g. deacylation with acid/alcoholic solvent), reacylation with an acylating agent and base (e.g. a-bromo-acetyl chloride and diisopropylethylamine), treatment with an amine or other nucleophile (for example dimethyl amine) and nitro reduction (e.g. Pd/C and hydrogen gas) affords (IVce). An orthogonally protected diamine (e.g. (IVcf)) can be subjected to reductive amination conditions (e.g. formaldehyde, sodium methoxide, sodium borohydride), followed by acylation with an acylating agent and base (e.g. α-bromo-acetyl-chloride and diisopropylethylamine), followed by exposure to an amine or other nucleophile (e.g. diemthyl amine) to afford (IVcg). Removal of the BOC protecting group with acid (i.e. HCl or TFA) affords (IVch).\n\n\nExposure of (IVci) (see Arp, Forrest O.; Fu, Gregory C. Kinetic Resolutions of Indolines by a Nonenzymatic Acylation Catalyst. Journal of the American Chemical Society (2006), 128(44), 14264-14265.) to nitration conditions (e.g. sodium nitrate and TFA) followed by deprotection of the acyl group with acid (e.g. HCl) affords (IVcj). Advancement of (IVcj) and (IVcl) (see: Achvlediani, R.; Natsvlishvili, M.; Baberkina, E.; Khachidze, M.; Abesadze, I.; Suvorov, N. Synthesis of 1H-pyrrolo[3,2-g]- and 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-g]quinoline. Izvestiya Akademii Nauk Gruzii, Seriya Khimicheskaya (1996), 22(1-4), 43-47.) through a reaction sequence similar to that described above (e.g. acylation with α-bromo acetyl chloride, displacement with an amine or other nucleophile, and nitro reduction) affords anilines (IVck) and (IVcn).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in scheme 11, O-amino carboxamide heads II can be prepared by treatment of the corresponding commercially available o-amino benozic acids with a diactivated carbonyl, e.g. phosgene, and subsequent opening of the in situ generated isatoic anhydride with an ammonia source, e.g. ammonium hydroxide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in scheme 12, heads may be prepared from commercially available di-halogenated anilines (for instance 3-choro-5-fluoro-aniline from Apollo Scientific, UK; 3-4-difluoro aniline from ABCR Gmbh & Co., Germany). Note, this scheme is applicable for heads wherein substituent R4 is not H. As shown, the amine group is first protected with a carbamate protecting group, e.g. Boc\n2\nO, in solvent, e.g. THF, at heat, e.g. 80° C., and then deprotonating with a strong alkyl lithium base, e.g. tBuLi, in ethereal solvent, e.g. THF, at reduced temperature, e.g. −80° C., with subsequent trapping with an electrophile, e.g. MeCO\n2\nCl to provide a methyl ester (XVII). The methyl ester XVII is Boc deprotected with with an acid and solvent, e.g. TFA/CH\n2\nCL\n2\n, and hydrolyzed with a hydroxide source, e.g. LiOH, in solvent with water, e.g. THF/H\n2\nO. Conversion of the amide to the acid (IIa) is carried out using standard coupling procedure, with for instance NH\n3\n, EDCl, and dioxane.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe following specific examples are included as illustrations and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nAs used herein, the symbols and conventions used in these processes, schemes and examples are consistent with those used in the contemporary scientific literature, for example, the Journal of the American Chemical Society or the Journal of Biological Chemistry.

The resulting slurry was stirred at −85° C. in a pressure vial until all solids had completely dissolved 12-36 hr.) The resulting solution was cooled to room temperature and diluted with dichloromethane and saturated sodium bicarbonate as to adjust the aqueous layer to pH>10. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and the solvents removed under reduced pressure to afford the corresponding 3-[(4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl]-5-(phenylamino)pyrrolo[2′,3′:4,5]pyrimido[6,1-b]quinazolin-7(3H)-ones (ii).\n\n\nStep B: Tetracyclic ii was suspended in tetrahydrofuran (12-20 mL) and either 27% aqueous ammonium hydroxide (50 mL) or another primary amine (i.e. 4-fluorobenzylamine, 2-15 equiv.) was added. The resulting solution was warmed to ˜80° C. in a pressure vessel until all solids had dissolved (1-10 hr.) After cooling to room temperature, the vessel was cautiously opened and the organic layer was dried with solid sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford adequately pure intermediate iii.\n\n\nStep C: These solids (iii) were dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of tetrahydrofuran and methanol and solid sodium methoxide was added. The resulting suspension was stirred at room temperature (or 80° C. in a pressure vessel) until all starting materials were judged consumed by thin layer chromatography. Upon cooling to room temperature saturated sodium bicarbonate (10 mL) and ethyl acetate (20 mL) were added.

The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation was measured using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and quantified by homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay purchased from CisBio (62TK0PEJ).\n\n\nReactions were performed in black 384-well polystyrene low volume plates in a final volume of 5 μl. Assays were performed by adding 2.5 μl of each of the following solutions, enzyme mix and substrate: The enzyme mix, final concentration in plate, contained 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.0); 10 nM supplement enzymatic buffer; 0.03% NaN3; 0.01% BSA, 0.1 mM orthovanadate, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CHAPS, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.25 nM ALK. The Substrate mix, final concentration in plate, contained 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.0); 10 nM supplement enzymatic buffer; 0.03% NaN3; 0.01% BSA, 0.1 mM orthovanadate, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CHAPS, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 15.0 μM ATP, and 0.25 uM TK substrate-biotin.\n\n\nTo quantify compound potencies, the enzyme mix was added to the compound plates and the plates were incubated at 20° C. for 30 minutes. The reactions were then started by adding the substrate mix. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 120 minutes at 20° C. The reactions were then terminated by the addition of 5 μl HTRF detection mix to each well. The final concentrations of the detection reagents were: 50 mM HEPES (pH7.0); 0.1% BSA; 0.8 M KF; 20 mM EDTA; 1 mM CHAPS; TK-antibody Europium Cryptate; and 41 nM streptavidin-XL665. Assay plates were left unsealed, stacked and incubated at 20° for 60 minutes. Quantification of activity was achieved by counting in an Envision Counter (PerkinElmer).\n\n\nCompounds under analysis were dissolved in Me\n2\nSO to 1.0 mM and serially diluted 1 to 3 with Me\n2\nSO through twelve dilutions. 0.05 μl of each concentration was transferred to the corresponding well of an assay plate. This creates a final compound concentration range from 0.00017 to 10 μM.\n\n\nThe data for dose responses were plotted as % Inhibition calculated with the data reduction formula 100*(1-(U1-C2)/(C1-C2)) versus concentration of compound where U is the unknown value, C1 is the average control value obtained for 1% DMSO, and C2 is the average control value obtained for 0.1 M EDTA.

Inhibition of Cell Proliferation by IGF-1R Inhibitors\n\n\n\nCell proliferation was measured by either CellTiter-Glo (measures cellular ATP level as a surrogate for total cell number) or by InCell analyzer (counts number of nuclei as a measure of cell number).\n\n\nFor CellTiter-Glo assay, exponentially growing cell lines of different tumor origins, cultured in appropriate media containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2 \nincubator, were plated at low density (less than 2000cells/well) in 96-well plates. Twenty four hours post-plating, cells were treated with different concentrations of test compounds ranging from 30 uM to 1.5 nM. Several wells were left untreated as a control. Seventy two hours post-treatment, cell numbers were determined using 50-100 ul per well of CellTiter-Glo (Promega #G7573). Plates were incubated at 37° C. for 30 minutes and the chemiluminescent signal was read on the Victor V or Envison 2100 reader. Percent inhibition of cell growth was expressed as percent proliferation relative to 100% proliferation (control). Concentration of test compound that inhibited 50% of cell growth (IC\n50\n) was determined by 4 parameter fit of data using XLfit, (value of no cell control was substracted from all samples for background).\n\n\nFor InCell Analyser assay, various cell lines of different tumor origins were grown to 70-80% confluency in appropriate culture media containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2 \nincubator. On day −1, cells were seeded at 2 densities in 384-well plates and incubated at 37° C. overnight. Stock compound plates were prepared in advance which contained dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) alone and a 9-point half-log decreasing dose range of the compound in DMSO. The compound plates were stored at −80° C. and each plate was only thawed once and used. On day 0, the main assay plates received compound or DMSO via a sonic delivery system (ECHO). The highest final concentration of compound of the dose range in the culture plates was 10 uM. These plates were cultured at 37° C. for 3 days. A parallel set of cell line plates, which did not receive compound, were processed and read on day 0 to provide a T=0 (time zero). On day 3, the compound treated plates were stained and fixed to measure proliferation, apoptosis, and mitotic index using an InCelL\n1\n000 analyser. A nuclear stain was used to identify cells in the wells. By counting the number of nuclei, the proliferation index of compound treated groups were calculated as a percentage relative to the DMSO control, which was set to 100%. The IC50 values were calculated using model 205 in ExcelFit.\n\n\nIC50 (nM) values for compounds of select examples were categorized by relative inhibition of cell proliferation.

IGF-1R and IR Cellular Autophosphorylation\n\n\n\nNIH-3T3 cells overexpressing human IGF-1R or IR were plated in 96-well plates (10,000 cells/well) in culture media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2 \nincubator. Twenty four hours post-plating, cells were treated with different concentrations of test compounds ranging from 30 uM to 1.5 nM. Two hours after compound addition, cells were stimulated with either human IGF-1 (30 ng/ml) or insulin (3 ug/ml) for 15 minutes. Cell lysates are analyzed for phosphorylated receptors using dissociation enhanced lanthanide fluor-immuno assay (DELFIA) with anti-IGF-1R (MAB391, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) or anti-IRβ (sc-711, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif.) capture antibody and europium-labeled anti-pTyr antibody (Eu-N1 PT66, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass.) for detection. The fluorescence signal for cells treated with compounds was expressed as percent relative to 100% stimulation (IGF-1 or insulin stimulated signal). Concentration of test compound that inhibited 50% of ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation (IC\n50\n) was determined by 4 parameter fit of data using XLfit, (value of no cell control was substracted from all samples for background).\n\n\nIC50 values for the compounds of the examples (if available) were categorized by relative inhibition of IGF-1R and IR.
