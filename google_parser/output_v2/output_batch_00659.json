Description\n\n\n\n\n Title: Activity based probes (ABPs) interacting with glycosidases \n\n\nThe present invention refers to an activity based probe (ABP) comprising a glycosidase inhibitor, in particular a beta-glucosidase inhibitor, preferably covalently binding to a glycosidase comprising a detection- group. Background of the invention \n\n\n Over the past decade, activity based protein profiling has been used to study many biological processes. The activity based probes (ABPs) used in these studies generally consist of three elements: a warhead, a linker/recognition element and ligation handle or identification tag. The enzyme reacts selectively with the warhead forming a covalent adduct which can then be visualized either by direct visualization (e.g the identification tag is present on the probe) or by two step labeling (e.g post-labeling modification of the ligation handle). This strategy has been widely applied to study proteases such as cathepsins, the proteasome, and esterases such as acetylcholinesterase. \n\n\nWith regard to glycosidases, in particular exo-glycosidases, only a few examples of ABPs are known. Vocadlo and Bertozzi describe a galactosidase probe, which is based on the activated fluorinated glycosides, a class of mechanism based inhibitors of glycosidases. The anomeric center of this galactosidase probe is activated by protonation by one of two carboxylic acids present in the active site of the glycosidase. The other carboxylic acid attacks the anomeric center forming a glycosyl- enzyme complex. The fluorine residue in the galactosidase probe slows formation as well as hydrolysis of the glycosyl- enzyme complex down. The activated leaving group increases the reaction rate of the first step leading to accumulation of the inhibitor complex. Although the complex is stabilized, the acylal ester linkage slowly hydrolyzes due to the endo-cyclic oxygen. Lifetimes ranging from seconds to months have been reported for these complexes. Despite this disadvantage, all ABPs reported so far are based on this class of mechanism-based inhibitors. \n\n Numerous lysosomal storage disorders are based on malfunctions of one or more enzymes, for example glucosidases, involved in the metabolism of different substances. A storage disorder is any disease or condition which is characterised by the abnormal accumulation and storage of material within the cells. The stored material will vary depending upon the type of condition. One of the most common lysosomal storage disorders is Gaucher disease, which is characterized by a defective catabolism of glucosylceramide based on the malfunctioning of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GBAl). GBAl is an acid hydrolase that primarily degrades its substrate in acidic compartments such as endosomes and lysosomes, particularly of macrophages. Increasing GBAl activity is the rational target for therapy of Gaucher disease. This can be accomplished by enzyme therapy, by which mannose-terminated GBAl upon intravenous infusion reaches lysosomes of macrophages Clinical response to enzyme therapy is spectacular, but their remain disadvantages. Firstly, the costs are extremely high (>100.000€/adult patient/year) and secondly, enzyme therapy does not prevent neurological manifestations given the inability of enzymes to effectively cross the blood-brain barrier. \n\n\nHence, since many years intensive research is ongoing to identify a therapeutic for effective treatment of storage disorders such as Gaucher disease. So-called substrate reduction therapy, using iminosugars or ceramide-mimicks, aims to reduce biosynthesis of glucosylceramide in Gaucher patients, thus restoring the balance with impaired degradation. The common drugs for treating Gaucher disease these days (for example Zavesca, GENZ) show severe side-effects leading to gastrointestinal complications, such as flatulence and severe diarrhoea resulting in abrupt weight loss, and poorly penetrate the brain. An interesting new approach for treating storage disease is the use of chaperones. The concept of chaperones implies that particular (point)mutant forms of an enzyme such as GBAl can be assisted in their folding and stability by chaperones interacting with the catalytic pocket of the enzyme. For example isofagomine and \n\n hydrophobic iminosugars are considered as promising chaperones. When cells containing mutant GBAl are incubated for some days with such chaperones (at concentrations close to IC50 values), indeed an increased GBAl activity is measured in cell lysates and increased GBAl protein is detected by \n\n\nimmunofluorescence. Unfortunately, it has not yet been documented that endo/lysosomal degradation of the glucosidase's substrate such as \n\n\nglucosylceramide improves, i.e., increases by chaperone treatment. \n\n\nThe lack of experimental evidence results from the fact that measurement of an increase in active enzyme in situ is difficult. No reliable methods for its measuring exists. Presently, some groups test the effect of chaperone treatment by incubating cells for 1 hour in acetate buffer (pH 4.0) containing the artificial substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucoside. It is far from being clear that under this condition the cellular surrounding of GBAl is not fundamentally changed. Other research groups have measured GBAl activity in living cells using fluoresceine-diglucoside (FDG) or fluorescent NBD-glucosylceramide as substrates. FDG is cleaved by GBAl to generate fluorescent fluoresceine that can be detected for example by FACS. Fluorescent C6-NBD-GlcCer is added to cells, where after it is intracellularly converted to C6-NBD-Cer by GBAl. After harvesting the cells and extraction of lipids, the fluorescent NBD- glucosylceramide and NBD-ceramide can be separated, for example by thin layer chromatography, and be quantified. These advanced assays require considerable expertise, are labour-intensive and cumbersome. Hence, it is presently problematic to assess the value of small compounds as effective chaperones for stabilization of a defect glucosidase such as GBAl and thus, their therapeutic value for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders such as Gaucher disease. Researchers presently still rely on artificial assays that poorly reflect a chaperone-mediated increase in in vivo degradative capacity, see for example Mu TW, Ong DS, Wang YJ, Balch WE, Yates JR 3rd, \n\n Segatori L, Kelly JW, Chemical and biological approaches synergize to \n\n\nameliorate protein-folding diseases. Cell 2008 Sep 5;134(5):769-81. \n\n\nThe present invention now provides the development of highly efficient ABPs interacting with a glycosidase, providing basis for diagnosing a storage disorder and/or screening of compounds for preventing and/or treating a storage disorder such as Gaucher disease. \n\n\nThe present invention is further directed to efficient ABPs interacting with a glycosidase, providing basis for in vitro or in vivo monitoring of glycosidases in living organisms and cells. \n\n\n Moreover, the present invention refers to efficient ABPs interacting with a therapeutic glycosidase, providing basis for in vitro or in vivo monitoring of a pre- labeled enzyme with respect to its delivery to lysosomes in cells and tissues of model animals and patients. \n\n\nFurther, the present invention relates to efficient ABPs interacting with a glycosidase-fusion protein, providing basis for ultra- sensitive in vitro or in vivo monitoring of the fusion protein. \n\n\nSummary \n\n\n The present invention is directed to an activity based probe (ABP), which interacts with an enzyme, in particular a glycosidase, and preferably binds covalently to the active site of the enzyme. In one embodiment the ABP comprises a beta-glucosidase inhibitor, and a detection group. Optionally, the beta-glucosidase inhibitor is substituted for an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, an alpha-galactosidase inhibitor, a beta-galactosidase inhibitor, an alpha- hexosaminidase inhibitor, a beta-hexosaminidase inhibitor, an alpha- mannosidase inhibitor, a beta-mannosidase inhibitor, an alpha-xylosidase inhibitor or a beta-xylosidase inhibitor. Optionally, the glycosidase inhibitor is \n\n not an iminosugar or an iminosugar derivative in particular not an \n\n\niminoalditol derivative. In a preferred embodiment, the glycosidase inhibitor is a glucocerebrosidase inhibitor such as cyclophellitol or an analogue thereof. The ABP is used for diagnosing a storage disorder, preferably a lysosomal storage disorder such as Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, Pompe disease, or Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease and/or for screening of a compound to prevent and/or treat a storage disease. In a preferred embodiment the screened compound is a chaperone. Moreover, the present invention refers to a method for producing and detecting an ABP and to kits for diagnosing a storage disorder and/or for screening of a compound to prevent and/or treat a storage disease comprising an ABP. \n\n\nThe ABP is used for ultra- sensitive labeling of therapeutic glycosidases used for treatment of lysosomal storage disorders, allowing in vitro or in vivo monitoring of cell/tissue targeting and stability of the therapeutic enzymes. \n\n\nThe ABP is used to label an appropriate glucosidase-fusion protein to monitor its expression, subcellular and/or tissue localization, and stability in vitro or in vivo. \n\n\nDetailed description \n\n\nThe ABPs of the present invention comprise enzyme inhibitors such as a glycosidase inhibitor, in particular a glucocerebrosidase inhibitors. In one embodiment inhibitors of the invention comprise cyclophellitol as a core structure or sterio-isomers thereof. The oxigen atom in the epoxide group of cyclophellitol can be substituted for a nitrogen or a sulfur atom, thereby forming an aziridine group or an episulfide group. Cycophellitol was originally isolated form Phellinus sp. The inhibitors comprise a detection group in \n\n physical linkage with the inhibitor. For the inhibitors based on cyclophellitol the detection group is attached to the carbon atom that corresponds to the C6 position in glucose. For the cyclophellitol inhibitors with an aziridine or episulfide group instead of the epoxide group, the detection group can be attached to said Nitrogen or Sulfur atom. A preferred inhibitor is fluorophore- cyclophellitol, which is able to interact with, in particular covalently bind to, the active site of an enzyme such as a glucosidase. The present invention also provides inhibitors comprising an analogue of cyclophellitol. The term \n\n\n\"analogue\" comprises any compound that differs from the chemical structure of cyclophellitol, but shows the same effect on enzymes, in particular on glucosidases such as a glucocerebrosidase. \n\n\nA glycosidase, comprising a- and β-glycosidases is any enzyme that belongs to the class of hydrolases and cleaves the glycosidic bond between two molecules. Examples of glycosidases are beta-glucosidases (e.g. glucocerebrosidase), alfa- glucosidase, beta-xylosidases, alfa-hexosaminidases, beta-hexosaminidases, alfa-galactosidases, beta- galactosidases, alfa-mannosidases and beta- mannosidases. \n\n\nConduritol B-epoxide (CBE), an irreversible inhibitor of GBAl is known since a certain time. CBE has a xylose-type configuration and clicks covalently in the catalytic pocket of GBAl after a nucleophile attack shown in Fig. 1, 1\nst\n reaction. An advantage of CBE is that cells, are permeable for CBE, and the longer cells are incubated with CBE in situ, the more enzyme is irreversibly inactivated via CBE. It can be seen that cells from Gaucher patients with mutant N370S GBAl are less sensitive for inactivation of their GBAl compared to cells from healthy donors (Fig. 13). \n\n In contrast to CBE, cyclophellitol, a natural compound for example produced by yeast, has a glucose-type configuration as can be seen in Fig. 3. Cyclophellitol is intrinsically a superior inhibitor of beta-glucosidases such as GBAl or lactase- phloridzin hydrolase. In a preferred embodiment, the glycosidase inhibitor such as cyclophellitol is modified for example by introducing an azid at position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 of the glycosidase inhibitor, preferably at position 6 of the glycosidase inhibitor such as azido-cyclophellitol (Fig. 4). Azido- cyclophellitol is an excellent inhibitor of a glucosidase for example GBAl (Tables 1 and 2) or lactase-phloridzin hydrolase or sucrase, and advantageously, the azide-group is detectable, for example on SDS-PAGE. However, coupling the detection group to the inhibitor prior to incubating the inhibitor with the target enzyme surprisingly led to a markedly improved affinity/sensitivity of detection/inhibition. In a very preferred embodiment, the modification group such as azid is coupled to the glycosidase inhibitor during the synthesis of the inhibitor. This group can subsequently be used to click on the detection group. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the modified group of the glucosidase inhibitor, for example the azid group of azido-cyclophellitol, is linked to a detection group such as a fluorophore, a fluorescent moiety, or biotine. The glycosidase inhibitor and the detection group such as a fluorophore or biotine is for example linked via \n\n\n Staudinger reaction (Fig. 3), or any other state-of-the art ligation reactions. The combination of for example an azid group and a fluorophore or a biotine, or of for example an azid group with more than one detection group, e.g., a combination of a fluorophore and biotine leads in a preferred embodiment to an increase of the detection signal. \n\n\nThe detection group is connected to the glycosidase inhibitor before the inhibitor binds to the target glycosidase (which is for example a glucocerebrosidase or a lactase-phloridzin hydrolase or a sucrase). The inventors noticed that the affinity of the inhibitor unexpectedly increases, even if the detection group leads to a \n\n significant extension of the inhibitor (see for example Tables 1 and 2 for fluorophore 1-cyclophellitol, fluorophore 2 -cyclophellitol). Table 1 shows a comparison of CBE and cyclophellitol analogues such as azido-cyclophellitol, fluorophore 1-cyclophellitol, wherein the IC50 of the compound decreases with increase of the size of the compound. Fluorophore-cyclophellitols are highly potent inhibitors of GBAl, being ~5000 x more potent than CBE. Table 2 shows the kinetic constants CBE, azidocyclophellitol, fluorophor 1-cyclophellitol, and fluorophor 2-cyclophelltiol. It should be noted that the affinity for binding (Ki) has been enormously improved by the presence of the hydrophobic fluorophore. \n\n\nTable 1 \n\n\n Structure formulas are shown in Fig.3. \n\n\n Structure Compound Apparent IC50 (nM) \n\n\n rec.

Using an ABP of the invention such as fluorophore 1- cyclophellitol, an amount of GBAl of 10 attomole was detected on slab gel. To illustrate this enormous and unexpected sensitivity of ABPs of the invention, a comparison with the detection of GBAl using an antibody in a western blot is useful (see also Fig. 13). A supreme anti-GBAl monoclonal antibody in an excess concentration allows only detection of GBAl in the range of 100 femtomoles. A further advantage of the ABPs of the invention such as fluorophore-cyclophellitol used for the detection of a glucosidase is the fact that the inventive ABPs like fluorophore-cyclophellitol detect only active glucosidase such as a \n\n\nglucocerebrosidase, e.g., GBAl or a lactase-phloridzin hydrolase, whereas an antibody detects active and inactive enzyme. Thus, the present invention allows the differentiation of active and inactive enzyme, in particular of glucosidase such as glucocerebrosidase. \n\n\nIn addition, the specificity of the fluorophore-cyclophellitol is excellent, which is shown by the competition of GBAl labelling by AMP-DNM, a competitive \n\n inhibitor showing Ki=~200 nM (Fig. 7). The dependency of the labelling on active glucosidase is demonstrated by the effect of heat denaturation of the glucosidase, which prevents the labeling (Fig. 7). Even when total tissue lysates are labeled with fluorophore-cyclophellitols remarkable specific labeling of GBAl occurs (Fig. 8). \n\n\nIn another preferred embodiment, the ABPs of the invention such as \n\n\nfluorophore-cyclophellitol are likewise efficient, i.e., specific and sensitive, on living cells (Fig. 9) for example on isolated cell or tissue samples. The ABPs of the invention were detectable in cultured fibroblasts, COS and HepG2 cells, respectively, allowing detection of the glucosidase such as a glucocerebrosidase, e.g., GBAl in the attomole range after incubation of cells for 1 hour with a low amount for example 100 nM of fluorophore-cyclophellitol. Moreover, the ABPs of the invention such as fluorophore-cyclophellitols can be used to label glycosidases and visualize them by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 10), or FACS (Fig. 11) as illustrated for glucocerebrosidase. Using two distinctly fluorescent fluorophore-cyclophellitols, e.g. fluorophore 1-cyclophellitol being green fluorescent and fluorophore 2-cyclophellitol being red fluorescent, pulse- chase experiments can be conducted in living, cells, tissue, preferably isolated, or organisms, allowing assessment of life cycle and stability of glucocerebrosidase (Fig.12) in vivo or in vitro.. \n\n\nMoreover, the ABPs of the invention such as fluorophore-cyclophellitols can be used for detection, in particular diagnostic purposes. Patients deficient in active glycosidases can be identified by incubation of cells with appropriate \n\n\ncyclophellitols. This is illustrated in Fig.13 showing the visualization of glucocerebrosidase upon incubation of cells with fluorophore 1-cyclophellitol. The approach is more sensitive and convenient compared to Western blotting. \n\n In another preferred embodiment, the ABPs of the invention such as fluorophore 1-cyclophellitol or fluorophore 2-cyclophellitol are likewise efficient, i.e., specific and sensitive, on living mice (Fig. 14). The ABPs of the present invention will allow, for example by intravenous or intrathecal administration to animals, the ultra- sensitive detection of active GBA in situ. The results allow to generate new insights for example in pathophysiology of storage disorders such as Gaucher disease and render insights for therapy improvement. \n\n\nThe approach of ABPs can be extended to other glycosidases such as lactase, amylase, chitinase, sucrase, maltase, neuraminidase, invertase, hyaluronidase, lysozyme etc. by variation of the glycosidase inhibitor to selectively label specific alfa- or beta-glycosidase (see Fig 15 for an example). This variation is in particular in the sterio-isomeric carbons. The glycosidases are generally very specific for a certain sterio-isomeric sugar that is bound in the catalytic site. For instance, the fluorophore 1-cyclophellitol or fluorophore 2-cyclophellitol compounds depicted in figure 3, are very specific for the beta-glycosidase cerebrosidase. These inhibitors efficiently detect and inhibit only one other beta- glycosidase, i.e. lactase (lactase-phloridzin hydrolase). Moreover, the fluorophore can be varied allowing selective detection of labeled enzyme in a specific environment, e.g., a pH dependent fluorophore (see Fig 16), which for example provides a signal at a specific pH, changes the colour at a specific pH, or changes the intensity of the fluorescence at a specific pH. Moreover to the fluorophore can be attached an additional functional moiety, for example biotin allowing purification of ABP-labeled protein by streptavidin pull downs (see Fig. 16 and 17). The fluorophore is preferably a bodipy fluorophore, preferably a bopidy fluorophore according to figure 45. Bodipy (short for boron- dipyrromethene), is a class of fluorescent dyes that are very versatile. They are exhibit efficient fluorescent and are thus very brigth, form a chemical group of compounds that are relatively similar to each other, while at the same time providing clearly distinguishable staining, or fluorescence pattens (see figures 45 and 46). In \n\n another preferred embodiment said fluorophore is a far red or preferably infrared, and more preferably near infrared fluorophore. Examples of such fluorophores are the Alexa series sold by invitrogen. Their emission spectrum is provided in figure 46. The detection group can also comprise radiolabel. In cases wherein R2 comprises a hydrophobic group, preferably one or more aromatic groups, The radiolabel can be present on X, Rl or R2, preferably said radiolabel is present on R2. \n\n\nGiven the subtle and ultra- sensitive labeling of glycosidases by the ABPs of the invention, this can be exploited to monitor pre-labeled therapeutic glycosidases in living cells, e.g., cell samples, and living organisms, including patients. The principle of this is illustrated for glucocerebrosidase and Gaucher disease in Figs. 18 and 19. In a further embodiment, ABPs of the invention are used to visualize fusion proteins comprising an ABP-reactive glycosidase, i.e., a glycosidase binding to the glycosidase inhibitor of the ABP. The ABP-reactive glycosidase preferably represents a marker and tag, respectively, allowing the detection of the fusion protein. The glycosidase-fusion protein is preferably based on genetic \n\n\nmodification for example expressed by a genetically modified expression vector Given the ultra- sensitive detection of glycosidases with the ABPs of the invention, a similar use to (E)GFP-fusion proteins is envisioned. Glycosidases with desired properties have to be selected for construction of fusion proteins. For example, a fusion protein containing glucocerebrosidase is only useful when the fusion protein resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, endosomes, lysosomes, the plasma membrane or is a secretory protein since otherwise glucocerebrosidase will not acquire the N-linked glycans required for its enzymatic activity. \n\n\n A major advantage of the present approach of an ABP and glycosidase fusion protein compared to the conventional EGFP fusion protein approach is the \n\n ability to fluorescently label the fusion protein at any desired moment and to select ABPs with special features such as fluorescence in the infra red \n\n\n(allowing more sensitive in vitro or in vivo molecular imaging) or dependent on the environment like pH or calcium concentration (Fig. 16). Moreover, pulse- chase experiments can be conducted employing different ABPs that allow in vitro or in vivo visualization of the life time of the fusion protein. \n\n\nThe ABPs are detectable by detecting the detection group that it comprises. The detection group for example a fluorophore or a biotine is connected to the glycosidase inhibitor, preferably the glucosidase inhibitor, before the binding to the enzyme and once the inhibitor is bound to the enzyme, the detection group is detected. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the ABP comprises a cylophellitol, or a sterio-isomer thereof or analogue, which is selected from the group consisting of for example: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRi = Hydrogen, Carbohydrate, Alkyl, Aromate, Amide, biotin, fluorophore R2 = Alkyl, Aromate, Biotin, Fluorophore \n\n\nX = O, N, S \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRi = Hydrogen, Carbohydrate, Alkyl, Aromate, Amide, biotin, fluorophore R2 = Alkyl, Aromate, Biotin, Fluorophore \n\n\nR3 = Amide, Alkyl, or Fluorophore \n\n\nX = O, N, S \n\n\nThe azide/alkyne of the two-step probes can be clicked to a fluorophore, a biotin or both using Cu (I) catalyzed click-reaction. The \"clicked\" probes can be used to directly visualize glycosidase in vivo. Furthermore the azide of the two- step probes can be reduced with and subsequently condensed with an acid giving acetamide probes. The stereo-centers can have any configuration allowing labeling of the various glycosidases. R can be a carbohydrate, to label endo-glycosidases, alkyl and/or aromatic to enhance binding. X can be O, N, S; or \n\n\n\n\n\nRi = Hydrogen, Carbohydrate, Alkyl, Aromate, Amide, biotin, fluorophore R2 = Alkyl, Aromate, Biotin, Fluorophore \n\n\nX = O, N, S \n\n an aziridine based probe: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR-i = Hydrogen, Carbohydrate, Alkyl, Aromatic, Amide \n\n\nR\n2\n= alkyl, aromatic, Azide, alkyne, biotin, fluorophore \n\n\nX= O, N, S \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n R Hydrogen, Carbohydrate, Alkyl, Aromatic, Amide \n\n\nR\n2\n= alkyl, aromatic, azide, alkyne, biotin, fluorophore \n\n\nX= O, N, S \n\n\nAziridines can be functionalized with acetyl or alkyl equipped with an azide or alkyne (two-step labeling) or with biotin/fluorophore (direct labeling). The stereo-centers can have any configuration allowing labeling of the various glycosidases. R can be a carbohydrate, to label endo-glycosidases, alkyl and/or aromatic to enhance binding. X can be O, N, S; \n\n\nAs mentioned herein above, the cyclophellitol can have various sterio-isomeric configurations. Examples of such configurations are given in figure 44. In a preferred embodiment the ABP is compound 5 or compound 6 of figure 23. In another preferred embodiment the ABP is compound 6 of figure 38. \n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment the ABP is a compound marked \"direct probe\" of figure 47. \n\n In a preferred embodiment the ABP is compound MDWIOOO depicted in figure 51. \n\n\nIn a further embodiment, an ABP of the invention for example a fluorophore- cyclophellitol is used for diagnosing a storage disorder (see Fig. 13 for an example).. Advantageously, one or more glycosidases are detectable using different glycosidase inhibitors, which are specific for each glycosidase. \n\n\nAlternatively, one glycosidase inhibitor inhibits one or more glycosidases, for example glucocerebrosidase and/or lactase-phloridzin hydrolase and/or sucrase. A storage disorder is tested for example on a body fluid, such as blood, serum, urine, liquor, or sputum, or any other isolated cells or tissue. \n\n\nFurthermore, ABPs of the present invention are able to monitor the targeting of enzyme therapeutics in patients suffering from a storage disorder for example a Gaucher patient, in particular due to the ability of these ABPs to penetrate various tissues, or the bone compartment (see Fig. 19). \n\n\nIn another embodiment, ABPs of the present inventions are used in screening of a compound for use in preventing and/or treating a storage disease, e.g., Gaucher disease. Such compound is preferably a chaperone, wherein a chaperone is any molecule, for example a protein, peptide, DNA, RNA, small molecule that assists a protein in achieving proper folding. The compound is screened either in vivo or in vitro. The detection of chaperones allows also monitoring the efficacy of chaperones in different environments, e.g., different parts of the human or animal body. Fig.20 presents an example of screening with an ABP the efficacy of a tentative chaperone for mutant \n\n\nglucocerebrosidase in Gaucher disease patients. \n\n\nIn a further embodiment, ABPs are used to detect a catalytic site directed to inhibitors of glucocerebrosidase that act on living cells for example by screening such catalytic side in libraries. For the screening of living cells for \n\n example the cells are incubated with an ABP and lack of staining points to competition at the catalytic side. This screening assay is particularly useful as a first screening step. In a further embodiment, ABPs are used in molecular imaging, i.e. to visualize fusion proteins containing an ABP-reactive glycosidase. Given the ultrasensitive detection of glycosidases with the ABPs of the invention, a similar use to (E)GFP-fusion proteins is envisioned. The glycosidases with desired properties have to be selected for construction of glycosides fusion proteins. For example, a fusion protein containing glucocerebrosidase is only useful when the fusion protein resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, endosomes, lysosomes, the plasma membrane or is a secretory protein since otherwise glucocerebrosidase will not acquire the N-linked glycans required for its enzymatic activity. \n\n\nA major advantage of the innovative ABP and glycosidase fusion protein approach compared to the conventional (E)GFP fusion protein approach, is the ability to fluorescently label the fusion protein at any desired moment and to select ABPs with special features such as fluorescence detectable signal like fluorescence for example in the infra red or dependent on the environment like pH or calcium concentration (Fig. 16). Moreover, pulse-chase experiments can be conducted employing different ABPs that allow in vitro or in vivo \n\n\nvisualization of the life time of the fusion protein. Moreover, an embodiment refers to a method for producing an ABP wherein the glycosidase inhibitor is chemically modified and linked to a detection- group. The glycosidase inhibitor is preferably the irreversible glucosidase inhibitor cyclophellitol, which is modified with a fluorophore or biotine. \n\n\nAlternatively, the azido- cyclophellitol is linked to a fluorophore, fluorescent moiety, or biotine. \n\n Figures \n\n\n The following figures illustrate, but do not limit the present invention: \n\n\nFigure 1 shows the reaction mechanism of glucocerebrosidase (GBAl) with natural substrate and conduritol B-epoxide (CBE), wherein CBE binds covalently to the nucleophile E340 in the catalytic pocket of GBAl. \n\n\nFigure 2 shows the 3-dimensional structure of GBAl based on \n\n\ncrystallography, wherein E340 is catalytic nucleophil and E235 is acid/base.. \n\n\nFigure 3 shows the chemical structures of CBE, cyclophellitol, and analogues of cyclophellitol. Fluorophore 1 -cyclophellitol (Inhibody Green) is a green fluorescent, fluorophore 2-cyclophellitol (Inhibody Red) is red fluorescent. Figure 4 presents the Staudinger reaction allowing ligation of a fluorescent moiety to an azid. \n\n\nFigure 5 shows schematically the reaction of an ABP with an enzyme and its detection on a gel or via a blot. \n\n\nFigure 6a shows the sensitivity of the detection of the ABP bound to GBAl. Pre-labeled GBAl (10 nM ABP fluorophore 1 -cyclophellitol, for example incubated for 30 min) was put on the gel in decreasing concentrations (total amounts applied per lane are indicated in Fig. 6a). The detection limit on the slab gel is in the low attomole range, visualized with fluorescence imaging. Figure 6b shows the equipotent labeling of recombinant GBAl with fluorophore 1 -cyclophellitol (Inhibody Green, green fluorescent) and with fluorophore 2-cyclophellitol (Inhibody Red, red fluorescent) as visualized on slab gel with fluorescence imaging. The enzyme was incubated for 30 min. with \n\n different proportions of Inhibody Green and Inhibody Red, and the total inhibitor concentration was 10 nM. \n\n\nFigure 7 demonstrates the competition of the inventive ABP and \n\n\nazidocyclophellitol for binding to the catalytic centre of GBAl, wherein the binding of ABP is competed by the presence of azidocyclophellitol. In addition the figure shows that prior denatured GBAl by heat-inactivation (for example 5 min.) is unable to bind the ABP, illustrating the specific labeling of active GBAl molecules via their catalytic centre. The enzyme was incubated with 10 nM fluorescent probe (Inhibody Green) and 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000 μΜ \n\n\nazidocyclophellitol. \n\n\nFigure 8 illustrates the specificity of GBAl labeling with the inventive ABP. Lysates were prepared from various mouse tissues, i.e., jejunum, spleen, testis and liver, and incubated with 10 nM Fluorophore 1-cyclophellitol for example for 30 min. Labeled lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide). \n\n\nFluorescent proteins were visualized by fluorescence scanning. In all tissues only GBAl is visualized with exception of intestinal fractions showing additional MW forms reflecting fragments of lactase and sucrase as identified by LC-MS/MS. \n\n\nThe scheme of Figure 9 (right panel) shows the life cycle of GBAl in living cells, i.e. in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; 61 kDa), in the Golgi (63-66 kDa), and in the lysosomes (57-66 kDa). Fibroblasts contain notoriously a low rate of GBAl (purification factor vs. total protein >200.000 x). Figure 9 (left panel) \n\n\nillustrates that labeling of GBAl in intact, living cells is feasible and specific. Depicted as example are skin fibroblasts incubated with 100 nM fluorophore 1- cyclophellitol for 1 h. Next, a cell lysate was prepared and subjected onto the gel (0.1 mg cellular protein per lane), fluorescently labelled GBAl is detected. At the same time almost no unspecific background based on staining of other proteins is detectable. Total protein is visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) staining. \n\n Figure 10a shows fibroblasts labeled with an ABP of the invention in comparison to labeling with an antibody (Fig. 10 b). Cultured skin fibroblasts were grown on glass slides, and incubated with 100 nM ABP for 1 hour and were washed afterwards. Cells were subsequently fixed and indirect immuno- fluorescence was performed using an anti-GBAl monoclonal antibody (8E4). Depicted is the fluorescent staining by ABP (Fig. 10a), the fluorescent staining by the monoclonal anti-GBAl antibody 8E4 (Fig. 10b), the staining of nuclei with DAPI (Fig. 10c) and the overlay of stains (Fig. lOd). Figure 11 shows results of FACS. Cultured suspended skin fibroblasts from healthy individuals were preincubated with 0 or 1 mM conduritol B-epoxide (CBE) for 30 min.. Conditol-B-epoxide occupies the binding sites for the ABP. Next the cells were incubated with [0, 2 or 10 nM ABP for 1 h and cell- associated fluorescence was detected by = FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorter). The shift to the right indicates the amount of fluorescent per cell, being maximal in cells incubated withlO nM ABP, and intermediate in cells incubated with 2 nM ABP. In cells pre-incubated with CBE the background fluorescence per cell was very low. Red: no fluorophore 1- cyclophellitol, purple: pre-incubation with CBE + 10 nM fluorophore 1- cyclophellitol, brown: pre- incubated with CBE + 2 nM fluorophore 1- cyclophellitol, green: pre-incubated without CBE + 10 nM fluorophore 1- cyclophellitol, blue: pre-incubated without. CBE + 2 nM fluorophore 1- cyclophellitol \n\n\nFigure 12 shows an example of pulse-chase labeling of GBAl using two distinctly fluorescent ABPs. Fibroblasts were firstly labeled with 100 nM Fluorophore 1-cyclophellitol (Inhibody Green) labeling all GBAl. Next cells were washed and labeled with 100 nM Fluorophore 2-cyclophellitol (Inhibody Red) labeling all newly formed GBAl molecules. Cells were harvested at different time points and labeled GBAl was visualized by SDS-PAGE. The approach allows visualization of life cycle and stability of GBAl in living cell. \n\n Figure 13 illustrates the diagnostic application of ABPs for Gaucher disease. Cultured fibroblasts from normal subject, a mildly affected Gaucher patient homozygous for N370S GBAl, a neurologically affected patient homozygous for L444P GBAl and an extremely severely affected patient completely lacking GBAl (colloidon baby) were labeled with 100 nM fluorophore 1-cyclophellitol (Inhibody Green) for 1 hour, harvested and lysate subjected SDS-PAGE. The lower panel shows subsequent Western-blot on which GBAl was visualized using anti-GBAl monoclonal antibody 8E4. The ABP labeling allows superior and more convenient detection of the GBAl abnormality. \n\n\nFigure 14 demonstrates the feasibility of ABP labeling of GBAl in living mice., 10 nmoles of fluorophore 1-cyclophellitol were infused into mice intravenously. Animals were sacrificed after 2 hours and tissues were examined on fluorescent GBAl by microscopy and by preparation of tissue lysate that was next subjected to SDS-PAGE. \n\n\n Fig, 14a shows an example of the labeled kidney as visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Fig. 14 b shows an example of labeled GBAl in various tissues, visualized after SDS-PAGE. Note the labeling of additional proteins in the intestinal fractions (sucrase and lactase). \n\n\nFigure 15 presents the ABP azido-cyclophellitol in a- and β-conformation. \n\n\nFigure 16 shows additional ABPs designed for GBAl. From left to right: Fluorophore 1-cyclophellitol (Inhibody Green) IC50= 2 nM; fluorophore 2- cyclophellitol (Inhibody Red) IC50 = 2 nM; Fluorophore 3-cyclophelitol (only fluorescent at pH < 5.5) IC50= 100 nM; Fluorophore 4-cyclophellitol \n\n\n('BOCLICKY\": containing additional biotin moiety allowing capture by streptavidin) IC50= 10 nM. \n\n Figure 17 illustrates schematically the use of the bifunctional ABP containing biotin. \n\n\nFigure 18 demonstrates the ABP labeling of recombinant therapeutic GBAl molecules: Cerezyme (Genzyme Corp.) and Velaglucerase (Shire TKT Corp.), wherein Cerezyme has a smaller MW on SDS-PAGE as Velaglucerase due to difference in N-linked glycan composition. Left lane: Velaglucerase-red labeled with fluorophore 2-cyclophellitol, Cerezyme-green labeled with fluorophore 1- cyclophellitol. Right lane: Cerezyme-red labeled with fluorophore 2- cyclophellitol, Velaglucerase-green labeled with fluorophore 1-cyclophellitol. \n\n\nFigure 19 renders an example of use of ABP-labeling of therapeutic enzymes. Cultured human macrophages were incubated with 1:1 mixture of distinctly pre-labeled therapeutic enzymes in the absence or presence of mannan. The experiment allows comparative analysis of mannose-receptor medicated uptake of Velaglucerase and Cerezyme. \n\n\nFigure 20 presents a schematic illustration of Gaucher treatment (Fig. 20a) via the chaperone isofagimine, whose structure is separately shown in Fig. 20b. Fig. 20c presents the results of fibroblasts of Gaucher patients (N370S GBAl homozygote), which were grown for 3 days in the presence of the indicated concentration of isofagomine. The fibroblasts were labeled with Fluorophore 1-cyclophellitol (for example 20 nM for 1 hour), wherein about 50 % of cellular GBAl was labeled. The labeled fibroblasts were harvested and lysed: Left panel F shows the enzymatic activity in the lysate, which was measured with 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-glucosidase as substrate reflecting total GBAl. Right panel G shows the amount of in vivo fluorescently labeled GBAl, which was determined by SDS-PAGE and fluorescence imaging. The results indicate that in vivo high concentrations of isofogamine inhibit GBAl as shown by the reduced labeling with ABP. \n\n Figure 21 describes the use of ABPs to visualize glucosidase-fusion proteins in living organism, isolated tissue or cells. A fusion protein with GBAl (to be used for example for proteins with signal peptide that reside in ER, Golgi, endosomes, lysosomes, plasma membrane or are secreted, Fig. 21a), and a fusion protein with an appropriate glycosidase (bGA) (to be used for proteins without signal peptide that reside in cytosol, mitochondria, peroxisomes, Fig.21b. \n\n\nFigure 22 Compounds for example 3 \n\n\nFigure 23 Structures of isofagomine, CBE, cyclophellitol, KY170, MDW933 and MDW941. \n\n\nFigure 24 In vitro labeling of GBA with MDW933 and MDW941.

Because of the use of low concentration of MDW933 during the first 8 h of the chase, incomplete labeling of newly formed GBA molecules was accomplished.

Recombinant GBA labeled with KYI 70 4 is digested with trypsin and analyzed by LC tandem MS (upper path). To release the label and to install the hydroxamic acid residue, GBA labeled with MDW933 5 is treated with hydroxylamine prior to tryptic digestion and analysis by LC-MS/MS (lower path). KYI 70 4 (B) and MDW933 5 (C) are covalently linked to E340 in recombinant GBA. One peptide that was selected for fragmentation in the tryptic digest of GBA labeled with 4 had a parent mass (2071.99 amu) and one peptide that was selected for \n\n\nfragmentation in the tryptic digest of GBA labeled with 5 and treated with hydroxylamine had a parent mass (1885.92 amu). The mass of these peptides was 201.09 amu and 15.02 amu increased compared to the theoretic mass\n\n\n(1870.90 amu) of the sequence of the tryptic peptide containing residue E340 (shown in bold red). This is in accordance with the addition of the mass of respectively KY170 4 (201.08 amu) and hydroxylamine (15.01 amu). \n\n\nFurthermore it is clear from the tandem mass spectra shown, that the adduct mass is localized at the glutamic acid residue of the peptide resulting in a \n\n delta-mass of 329.03 amu between y6, y7 and 330.14 amu between blO, bll, and a delta-mass of 144.03 amu between y6, y7 and 143.98 amu between blO, bl l for respectively KY170 4 (B) and MDW933 5 (C). This is consistent with the mass of glutamic acid covalently linked to KY170 4 (330.12 amu) and hydroxylamine (144.05 amu) at that site.

All numbers in brackets refer to scheme 1. \n\n\nExample 1: Synthesis of azido-cyclophellitol \n\n\nFor producing azido-cyclophellitol connected to a fluorophore or biotine, the epoxide of cyclophellitol (2) is protonated in the active site by a carboxylic residue. Subsequent ring-opening by the nucleophilic residue in catalytic side results in an inhibitor-enzyme. In contrast to the fluorinated glycosides, the glycosyl epoxides (2 and 3 in scheme 1) lack an endo-cyclic oxygen and therefore form highly stable adducts making them good leads for ABPs. Based on the glucosidase inhibitor cyclophellitol (2) and its synthetic diastereomer epi-cyclophellitol (4), a new set of activity based probes was designed, which are applied as glucosidase labels. Modification of the C6-position of \n\n\ncyclophellitol (2) and epi-cyclophellitol (4) with an azide allows visualization of inhibitor-enzyme adducts by Staudinger-Bertozzi ligation or Cu\n:\n-catalyzed \n\n click reaction. To this end, azido-cyclophellitol (5) and azido-epicyclophellitol (6) were synthesized as depicted in scheme 1. \n\n\n \n'\n''OH \n\n\n D-Xylose \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6 11 , 49% \n\n\n Scheme 1 \n\n\nThe core carbocycle (7) was synthesized in 7 steps from D-xylose as described by Madsen and coworkers. Selective tosylation of the primary alcohol in (7) by treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in CH2CI2 followed by substitution of the tosylate with sodium azide afforded azido alcohol (8) in 72%. It is important to note that purification of the tosyl-intermediate by silica gel column prior to azidation resulted in a dramatic drop in the yield (42 %) Epoxidation of (8) with m-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) followed by deprotection with boron trichloride was unsuccessful. Therefore, the benzyl groups in (8) were removed under the agency of BCI3 prior to epoxidation. The resulting free hydroxyls were protected as the corresponding benzoyl protective groups using benzoyl chloride in pyridine. Epoxidation of \n\n\ncyclohexene (9) using in situally formed trifluoro dimethyldioxirane gave epoxides (10) and (11) as a separable mixture. Deprotection with sodium \n\n methoxide in methanol gave azidocyclophellitol (5) and epi-azidocyclophellitol (6). \n\n\n\n\nExample 2 \n\n\nDeficiency of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) underlies Gaucher disease, a common lysosomal storage disorder. Carriership for Gaucher disease has recently been identified as major risk for parkinsonism. Presently, no method exists to visualize active GBA molecules in situ. We here report the design, synthesis and application of two fluorescent activity-based probes allowing highly specific labeling of active GBA molecules in vitro and in cultured cells and mice in vivo. Detection of in vitro labeled recombinant GBA on slab gels after electrophoresis is in the low attomolar range. Using cell or tissue lysates, we obtained exclusive labeling of GBA molecules. We present evidence from fluorescence- activated cell sorting analysis, fluorescence microscopy and pulse- chase experiments of highly efficient labeling of GBA molecules in intact cells as well as tissues of mice. In addition, we illustrate the use of the fluorescent probes to study inhibitors and tentative chaperones in living cells. \n\n\nThe lysosomal hydrolase GBA hydrolyzes glucosylceramide\n1\n \n'\n \n2\n. This \n\n\nubiquitously expressed enzyme is initially synthesized as a 519-residue protein that cotranslationally acquires four N-linked glycans. After the removal of its signal peptide, GBA undergoes no further post-translational proteolytic modification and does not acquire mannose-6-phosphate moieties in the Golgi apparatus. The expression of disease in individuals with a defective GBA is remarkably heterogeneous. Substantial deficiency results in Gaucher disease, and recently carriership has been recognized as major risk for parkinsonism\n2\n \n'\n \n3\n. The manifestation of Gaucher disease is highly variable, ranging from the common non-neuronopathic (type 1) variant to more severe manifestations with lethal neurological complications (type 2 and 3 variants) and extreme cases with abnormalities in skin permeability (so-called collodion babies)\n2\n. The marked phenotypic heterogeneity is only partly explained by differences in underlying mutations in the GBA gene. The heteroallelic presence of N370S \n\n GBA, the most frequent mutation in Caucasian individuals, protects against a neuronopathic manifestation, whereas homozygosity for L444P GBA is associated with severe neurological symptoms\n2\n. Several studies have indicated that the relationship between GBA genotype and Gaucher phenotype is not very strict\n4\n. Even phenotypic heterogeneity among identical twins has been reported, suggesting that additional factors influence the in situ residual activity of GBA\n5\n. \n\n\n Two treatments for Gaucher disease presently exist: enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy. Enzyme replacement therapy is based on chronic intravenous administration of recombinant GBA \n\n\n (imiglucerase; trade name: Cerezyme)\n6\n \n'\n \n7\n. Substrate reduction therapy is based on chronic oral administration of N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, which catalyzes the formation of glucosylceramide\n8\n \n'\n \n9\n. More recently, an alternative approach has received considerable attention, so-called chaperone therapy. Common in Gaucher patients are mutant forms of GBA that show impaired folding and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, ultimately resulting in elimination via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD)\n10-15\n. Studies have investigated small compounds, designated 'chemical chaperones', that are able to increase the amount of GBA by stabilizing and/or promoting folding of the enzyme. One extensively studied example is isofagomine (1), which is a potent competitive inhibitor interacting with the catalytic pocket\n16-20\n. Beneficial effects on the amount and lysosomal localization of mutant GBA forms in cultured cells have been reported for isofagomine, but the assays used to demonstrate increased degradative capacity have been quite artificial: cells are exposed to high concentrations of fluorogenic substrate at acidic pH (see, for example, ref. 17). It is not likely that exposing cells to low pH and millimolar concentrations of 4- methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucopyranoside for a prolonged period reflects faithfully the in situ ability of the enzyme to degrade glucosylceramide. \n\n Pharmacologic chaperones like isofagomine will only exert a positive clinical effect at a particular dose range: their concentration should be sufficiently high to promote folding of the enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum to increase transport to lysosomes, whereas the concentration in lysosomes should also be sufficiently low to prevent marked inhibition of catalytic activity. The present lack of a suitable method for specific visualization of active GBA molecules is a major limitation in research on Gaucher disease and parkinsonism, as well as the development of new therapies. For this reason, we embarked on the development of such a method using activity-based labeling. The catalytic mechanism of GBA, a retaining glucosidase, has been elucidated in detail\n21\n \n'\n \n22\n. Briefly, unprotonated Glu340 in GBA performs the initial nucleophilic attack on the substrate, forming a covalently linked enzyme-substrate intermediate. \n\n\nEpoxides like conduritol B epoxide (2, CBE) and cyclophellitol (3) (Fig. 23) form first a noncovalent inhibitor-enzyme complex that then reacts with the Glu340 carboxylate to form a covalent bond, thus acting as irreversible inhibitors. Cyclophellitol resembles more closely the structure of glucoside substrates and is the more potent irreversible inhibitor of the two\n23\n. We capitalized on this by grafting boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) fluorophores on to the cyclophellitol core (Fig. 23). We here demonstrate highly efficient labeling of GBA in situ by these probes and reveal their use in monitoring GBA activity in Gaucher fibroblasts. \n\n\nRESULTS \n\n\nCompounds are referred to herein below by their chemical name, an arbitrary name and/or by an arbitrary number. The chemical structures that are associated with these names and number are depicted in figure 22. \n\n Design and synthesis of activity-based probes \n\n\n We synthesized cyclophellitol (ref. 24) and 8-deoxy-8-azidocyclophellitol (4, KY170) (Fig. 23; for synthesis see Example 3 results) and tested their inhibitory properties toward recombinant GBA (Genzyme). Cyclophellitol and its azido analog KYI 70 were found to be far more potent inhibitors of GBA than CBE. Click ligating BODIPY moieties to KY170 gave fluorescent inhibitors MDW933 (5) and MDW941 (6) (Fig. 23; for synthesis, see Example 3 results). Examination of the inhibitory properties revealed that MDW933 and MDW941 were comparably potent as irreversible inhibitors, being markedly superior to CBE and even surpassing cyclophellitol and KY170. The apparent half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of both fluorescent compounds (MDW933: IC50 = 1.24 ± 0.04 nM; MDW941: IC50 = 1.94 ± 0.08 nM) were very similar, being about 100- and 1,000-fold lower than those of cyclophellitol and KY170 (IC50 = 0.15 ± 0.009 μΜ and 0.12 ± 0.004 μΜ, respectively) and CBE (IC50 = 9.49 ± 0.042 μΜ). We determined next the inhibition constants— the\n\n\n (the equilibrium constant for initial binding), the rate constant (¾) and the relative rate constant fa/Ki— for CBE, cyclophellitol, KYI 70, MDW933 and MDW941 using a continuous substrate release assay (see Fig. 28 for progress curves). A general trend that we observed for the equilibrium constant for initial binding was that increased hydrophobicity resulted in decreased Ki values (Table 3). Comparison of relative rate constants demonstrated that the fluorescent probes inhibited GBA 22-, 34- and 4,300-fold better than KY170, cyclophellitol and CBE. \n\n Table 3.

For a better understanding of this finding, we performed molecular docking analysis using the GBA crystal structure (PDB: 2V3E)\n25\n. The docking model revealed that at minimum free energy of the simulated enzyme-ligand complex, both fluorescent probes efficiently bound to the GBA active site. Tight fitting of the BODIPY moiety in a hydrophobic pocket near the position in the active site where the 6'-hydroxyl of its natural substrate would reside appears to contribute to the binding. In this orientation, the epoxide was positioned 3 A away from Glu340, close enough to allow nucleophilic addition of the Glu340 carboxylate (Fig. 29). The calculations yielded minimum free energy values that were significantly lower for the hydrophobic fluorescent probes MDW933 and MDW941 (-8.1 kcal mol-\n1\n and -8.4 kcal mol-\n1\n) than for KY170 (-5.2 kcal mol-\n1\n), explaining their superior inhibitory properties. Notably, when we compared the crystal structure of GBA (PDB: 2VT0) with the modeled enzyme structure (PDB: 2V3E) with CBE or MDW933 (Fig. 29), the cyclitol moiety did not completely overlap with that of CBE covalently bound to 2VT0. The intrinsic differences in structure coordinates between the crystal structures, as well as the comparison of the positioning of CBE and MDW933 before the prenucleophilic attack with the already covalently bound state of CBE, could \n\n have caused this discrepancy. The presence of the latter was likely enough to physically alter the local protein structure. \n\n\nIn vitro labeling of GBA with the fluorescent ABPs \n\n\nTo examine labeling of recombinant GBA by MDW933 and MDW941, we incubated the enzyme for 30 min at 37 °C with mixtures of both probes at pH 5.2, with 0.2% (w/v) taurocholate and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X- 100, an optimal condition for enzymatic activity and activity-based labeling. After the incubation, we resolved the protein preparations with SDS-PAGE and analyzed the labeled proteins by fluorescence scanning of the slab gel on a Typhoon Variable Mode Imager (Fig. 24a). Labeled recombinant GBA migrated at the expected mass of 57 kDa. At equimolar concentration of MDW933 and MDW941 (100 nM), both probes bound the enzyme equally well. Thus, labeling of GBA with both probes was comparable, as expected given their similar inhibition constants. Boiling of the samples before electrophoresis had no impact on the detection of the fluorescently labeled protein on the slab gel, indicating that the probe was firmly attached. The presence of reducing agent also did not affect the covalent binding of the probes. \n\n\nWe determined the sensitivity of detection of labeled GBA by incubating 2 pmol GBA with an excess of MDW933 (20 nmol at 1 mM concentration) for 1 h at 37 °C and subsequent titration of the amount applied on the gel (Fig. 24b). We could detect as little as 20 attomol GBA by fluorescence scanning. Next, we incubated equal amounts of GBA (2 pmol) for 30 min with decreasing amounts of MDW933 and applied all protein to a gel. Incubation with as little as 20 attomol of probe resulted in detectable GBA on the slab gel (Fig. 24b). \n\n\n Apparently, nearly all of the probe had been covalently bound to recombinant GBA, consistent with its high affinity for binding. These experiments indicated that ultrasensitive detection of GBA was feasible on slab gels following in vitro labeling with the fluorescent probes 5 and 6. \n\n As a next step, we analyzed the site of binding of the probe on GBA using a competition assay. Prior to labeling with MDW933, we incubated recombinant GBA with 2 mM CBE for 30 min (Fig. 24c). Preincubation with CBE, shown via crystallography to bind Glu340 (ref. 26), blocked labeling completely. \n\n\nSimilarly, we also noticed competition with labeling by the competitive inhibitor AMP-DNM (7) (Fig. 24c)\n27\n. These results from competition experiments indicated that indeed the probe was bound in the catalytic center of GBA. We unambiguously identified the site of binding of KY170 and \n\n\nMDW933 by mass spectrometry. Using tryptic digestion and LC-MS/MS, we detected active site fragments of GBA that showed a shift in mass coinciding with binding of KYI 70 to Glu340 (Fig. 30). A similar experiment with \n\n\nMDW933 did not render detectable tryptic fragments of interest, most likely because the attachment of the hydrophobic moieties impaired ionization. We circumvented this complication by treating GBA labeled with MDW933 with hydroxylamine before tryptic digestion. This released the probe from GBA and concomitantly converted the modified residue into a hydroxamic acid. The outcome of this experiment demonstrated that MDW933 also bound covalently to Glu340 (Fig. 30). \n\n\n Enzymatically active GBA molecules are a prerequisite for labeling with the probe, as demonstrated by the lack of labeling of GBA that had been denatured by boiling (Fig. 24c). The same conclusion could be drawn from the pH dependence of irreversible inhibition of GBA by the fluorescent probes. It exactly coincided with the pH profile of enzymatic activity toward 4- methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucopyranoside (Fig. 24d). \n\n\nLabeling of GBA in cell and tissue extracts \n\n\n To determine the labeling specificity of both fluorescent probes, we incubated homogenates of cultured cells and mouse tissues with 100 nM green \n\n\nfluorescent MDW933 for 30 min at 37 °C and analyzed the preparation with SDS-PAGE. In the case of homogenates of cultured RAW cells, fluorescence \n\n scanning showed exclusive labeling of GBA by MDW933. The various GBA forms, with molecular mass ranging 58-66 kDa owing to glycan differences, were visualized (Fig. 24e). With several other cell types such as HepG2 cells, COS cells and human fibroblasts, we obtained similar results (Fig. 31). \n\n\nFurthermore, red fluorescent MDW941 also labeled GBA selectively in RAW cells (Fig. 31). It was striking that incubation of cell lysates with the probes did not result in fluorescent labeling of other cellular proteins. Furthermore, we observed very similar results— that is, highly specific labeling of GBA— using lysates of mouse tissues (Fig. 24f). Homogenates of mouse intestine were the only exception, most likely owing to labeling of high-molecular weight lactase and fragments thereof. Lactase (lactase-phloridzin hydrolase: LPH) is known to covalently bind CBE\n28\n, and we therefore reasoned that MDW933 may also irreversibly inhibit lactase activity. This was indeed the case: incubation for 30 min with 1 mM of MDW933 resulted in ~90 % inhibition of lactase activity. Next, we demonstrated that a high concentration of lactose (250 mM) reduced markedly (>90%) the labeling of the high-molecular weight protein in the intestinal fraction while leaving labeling of GBA practically unaltered (Fig. 32). In situ labeling of GBA in cultured cells \n\n\n We investigated whether labeling of GBA in intact cells was also feasible. For this purpose we added MDW933 or MDW941 to the culture medium at a concentration of 5 nM. At different time points, we harvested the cells and determined the GBA activity in the cell homogenates with artificial substrate (Fig. 25a). Even in intact cells, GBA was inactivated by both probes. \n\n\nApparently, the more hydrophobic MDW941 could more easily reach \n\n\nintracellular GBA. It is presently not clear how exactly the probes enter cellular compartments. It is unlikely that uptake occurred only by endocytosis, given the fast speed of labeling and its occurrence at low temperature at which endocytosis is blocked (Fig. 33). Direct uptake of the probes, either by \n\n diffusion of the amphiphilic structures or by facilitation by transporters, seems most likely. \n\n\n We studied in situ labeling of GBA in cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. We first preincubated cells in the absence or presence of CBE and subsequently incubated the cells with a subsaturating or an excess amount of the green fluorescent probe 5. FACS analysis revealed dose- dependent fluorescent labeling of cells and no labeling above background in CBE pretreated cells (Fig. 25b). These positive results prompted us to analyze labeling of the cells with fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 25c-f). For this pur- pose, we cultured fibroblasts for 2 h with 5 nM MDW941. We also detected GBA protein by indirect immunofluorescence using the specific anti-GBA monoclonal antibody 8E4 (ref. 29). Using multispectral image analysis, we could specifically distinguish the respective fluorescent emission spectra (Fig. 25d-e) from autofluorescent background (Fig. 25c). The intracellular pattern of labeling with MDW941 showed an almost complete overlap with the detection of GBA by monoclonal antibody 8E4 using this method (Fig. 25f). As probes with a hydrophobic BODIPY moiety might nonspecifically be retained in membranes, in particular the plasma membrane, we studied this possibility more closely. First, we cultured fibroblasts obtained from a Gaucher patient homozygous for the RecNCI GBA mutation (a mutation resulting in premature degradation of GBA by the proteasome) with MDW941. In contrast to control fibroblasts, the patient's cells did not show labeling in the lysosomal compartment by MDW941 but only in the perinuclear area (Fig. 34). As expected, immunofluorescence using monoclonal 8E4 showed a lysosomal staining pattern for GBA in the control cells whereas RecNCI cells revealed staining for GBA in the cytosol, most likely because of high levels of ERAD and proteasomal degradation in these cells. Next, we cultured wild-type fibroblasts for 16 h in presence of 3 mM CBE to irreversibly inhibit GBA molecules and block labeling. Subsequent culturing of the cells for 2 h with 5 nM MDW941, again in presence of CBE, rendered perinuclear red BODIPY fluorescence that \n\n was distinct from the autofluorescence. Control fibroblasts cultured with MDW941 in the absence of CBE revealed labeling in the lysosomal \n\n\ncompartment largely overlapping with the autofluorescence (Fig. 35). Finally, we synthesized MDW1064 (8) and MDW1065 (9) as nonreactive analogs of probes MDW933 and MDW941 (see Example 3 Methods for structure and synthesis). These control probes did inhibit GBA in vitro with IC\n50\n values of 41 and 95 μΜ, respectively. However, inhibition is presumably reversible. After culturing of fibroblasts for 2 h with 5 nM control, MDW1065 resulted in hardly any detectable labeling. In the presence of CBE, MDW1065 only weakly labeled the fibroblasts, in a pattern that may suggest interaction with the cell membrane (Fig. 35). \n\n\n To show the versatility of the probes, we performed pulse-chase experiments using cultured cells. For this purpose, we incubated fibroblasts overnight with 10 nM red fluorescent MDW941. Subsequently, we treated the cells with 10 nM of the green fluorescent probe, harvested them at different time points (0— 48 h) and subjected aliquots of cell homogenates to gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 25g for the lifecycle of GBA as visualized in this manner). It should be noted that GBA pulse labeled with the red fluorescent MDW941 disappeared gradually from the cells with an estimated half- life of about 30 h. The obtained half- life was consistent with the half- life determined previously using conventional pulse-chase labeling with radioactive methionine\n10\n. During the chase, GBA was increasingly labeled with MDW933, coinciding with formation of new GBA molecules (Fig. 25g). \n\n\n We next studied the labeling of GBA by MDW941 in intact fibroblasts using time-lapse microscopy. Fibroblasts treated with the probe showed very rapid fluorescent labeling of lysosome-like structures (data not shown). With 5 nM MDW941, labeling reached a maximum within 15 min. Even after 100 h of exposure to the compound, cells did not show any signs of apoptosis or toxicity. Finally, we examined the possibility of labeling GBA in mice by intravenously administering 0.1 nmol green fluorescent MDW933 dissolved in phosphate- \n\n buffered saline to adult mice. As a control, matched mice received the buffer solution intravenously. After 2 h, we killed the animals, prepared tissue extracts, labeled them with excess red fluorescent MDW941 to visualize unlabeled GBA and subjected them to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 26 shows the outcome of a typical experiment). In most tissues— here we show lung and liver— MDW933 already labeled a considerable proportion of GBA (Fig. 26a). \n\n\nConsistently, in such tissues the probe also irreversibly inhibited a large proportion of GBA in the living mouse (see Fig. 26b). An exception in this respect was the brain (Fig. 26a), in which MDW933 apparently labeled almost no GBA in vivo and GBA was not inactivated. As observed earlier, intestinal fractions showed labeling of proteins of multiple molecular masses (Fig. 26a). In addition to GBA, MDW933 clearly labeled other proteins that occur in the intestine in the mouse. Analysis of Gaucher materials \n\n\n We investigated labeling of mutant GBA in fibroblasts from a normal individual and from Gaucher donors (a N370S GBA homozygote, a L444P homozygote and a RecNCI homozygote manifesting as collodion Gaucher and almost entirely lacking GBA protein) by treating cell lysates with MDW933 (10 nM) for 1 h and subjecting these to SDS-PAGE. A comparison of cells from a normal subject and from a Gaucher donor homozygous for L444P GBA revealed that the amount of L444P GBA was markedly lower in the Gaucher donor (Fig. 27a). It is indeed known that L444P GBA undergoes largely premature degradation by ERAD as a result of impaired folding\n11\n. This \n\n\nphenomenon is far less striking in the case of N370S GBA\n10\n. Cells from a\n\n\nGaucher donor homozygous for N370S GBA also showed reduced labeling of GBA but to a lesser extent than cells from a L444P homozygote (Fig. 27a). As expected, cells from the RecNCI collodion Gaucher did not show any labeled GBA (Fig. 27a). We obtained similar results by analysis of the fibroblast \n\n extracts using western blotting and the anti-human GBA antibody 8E4, although the detection limit of this method was far inferior (Fig. 27a). \n\n\n It has been noted that the irreversible inhibition by CBE of N370S GBA is less strong than its inhibition of wild- type GBA\n20\n-\n30\n. We therefore determined inactivation curves of GBA activity in cells of a normal subject and a N370S GBA homozygote (Fig. 27b). Notably, MDW933 inactivated GBA activity in wild-type and N370S GBA cells quite similarly. Analysis of GBA in spleen from a Gaucher patient with solely N370S GBA resulted in a similar picture. Labeling of spleen lysates with variable concentrations of MDW933 again resulted in a lower amount of detected GBA protein in that tissue (Fig. 36). \n\n\nImpact of isofagomine on N370S GBA in cultured fibroblasts \n\n\n It has been reported that for cells from N370S GBA homozygotes, prolonged incubation with isofagomine yields an increase in GBA activity\n31\n. The interaction of isofagomine with the catalytic pocket has been intensely studied, including at the level of crystals\n21\n. We therefore examined whether incubation of N370S GBA homozygous fibroblasts with isofagomine increased the amount of GBA that can be labeled with fluorescent probes. We cultured cells for 7 d with different concentrations of isofagomine (0, 10, 30 and 300 nM) and subsequently incubated them for 2 h with or without excess MDW941 in the presence of the original concentration of isofagomine. Determination of the activity of GBA in homogenates of cells not treated with MDW941 using 4- methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucopyranoside as substrate revealed a modest isofagomine dose-dependent increase in enzyme activity (seen in Fig. 27c). Aliquots from the homogenates of cells labeled with MDW941 were subjected to gel electrophoresis, and the detected fluorescent GBA was quantified. Again we noted a modest dose-dependent increase (Fig. 27d), although less marked than the increase in in vitro enzyme activity in the homogenates. This discrepancy might be due to concomitant in situ stabilization of GBA by isofagomine in combination with competitive inhibition of enzymatic activity. \n\n We therefore investigated the effect of isofagomine on GBA activity in the intact cell using 5'-pentafluorobenzoylaminofluorescein-di-6-D-glucoside (FDG) as a substrate. Incubation of fibroblasts with various concentrations of isofagomine for 20 min, subsequent addition of FDG to the medium and quantification of the hydrolysis of FDG by FACS allowed determination of the IC50 value of isofagomine in intact cells\n32\n. The IC50 of isofagomine for hydrolysis of FDG was about 1 μΜ (Fig. 28e). Apparently, isofagomine at concentrations >1 mM completely inhibited activity of GBA in intact cells. We studied the reversibility of isofagomine competition for the fluorescent active site labeling. For this purpose, we preincubated recombinant GBA attached to monoclonal antibody 8E4 immobilized to Sepharose beads for 15 min with increasing concentrations of isofagomine at pH 5.2 in the presence of taurocholate (0.2% w/v) and Triton X-100 (0.1% v/v). Prior to labeling with MDW933 (10 nM for 15 min), we either washed or did not wash the bead suspension with the same buffer. Quantification of the labeled GBA on slab gel indicated that the competition of isofagomine for the active site was fully reversible (Fig. 37). \n\n\nDISCUSSION \n\n\nThe need for a method allowing visualization of active GBA molecules in situ in living cells is evident. It is of importance to understand better what the precise cell and tissue distribution of active GBA molecules is because this may render a better understanding of the pathogenesis of Gaucher disease. \n\n\nMoreover, demonstration of a true increase in active GBA molecules by tentative chaperones is of interest. At present the detection of GBA still relies on the use of antibodies that do not distinguish between active and inactive GBA molecules and can not label enzyme in intact cells. Our search for a suitable probe for activity-based labeling of GBA in situ has yielded the desired result. As starting point for the development of such a probe, we selected cyclophellitol, a known potent irreversible inhibitor of GBA that forms a \n\n covalent adduct. Next we linked, via a spacer, hydrophobic BODIPY moieties to cyclophellitol. Serendipitously, this led to even more potent irreversible inhibitors. Molecular docking analysis suggested that interaction of the hydrophobic BODIPY moiety in MDW933 and MDW941 with a hydrophobic pocket at the surface of GBA guides the epoxide to a position close to Glu340. This effect may plausibly underlie the remarkable avidity of the two fluorescent compounds as activity-based probes. The labeling of GBA with the fluorescent probes MDW933 and MDW941 seemed to proceed exactly via the expected mechanism for cyclophellitol inhibition of a betaglucosidase\n33\n. We could indeed demonstrate that labeling could be blocked with CBE or KYI 70 and potent competitive inhibitors such as hydrophobic deoxynojirimycines could compete away labeling. Labeling also required the folded enzyme and occurred proportional to enzymatic activity at different pH. \n\n\nThe affinity of both probes for GBA is in fact quite notable: truly ultrasensitive detection of GBA molecules was obtained. The high affinity of the fluorescent probes for GBA offered the opportunity to label the enzyme very specifically. With cell or tissue lysates, exclusive labeling of GBA molecules was observed following electrophoresis. In the case of homogenates of intestine alone we noticed labeling of other proteins, probably fragments of LPH known to covalently interact with CBE. The highly selective labeling of GBA is notable when taking into account the fact that GBA is a very low-abundance protein and constitutes <10-\n5\n of all cellular or tissue protein\n29\n. Another favorable feature of these probes is their ability to enter various cellular compartments. It will be of interest to determine the precise mechanism(s) more closely, although it is already clear that cellular entry seems not to depend on endo- cytosis. The entry of the probes into living cells allows their use in FACS analysis, and one can perform pulse-chase experiments in intact cells as we have demonstrated. Time-lapse microscopy confirmed that GBA can be labeled very efficiently in intact fibroblasts. We obtained no indications that fluorescent labeling of GBA was toxic to the cells. Initial experiments also \n\n indicated that in mice cellular GBA can be labeled with fluorescent \n\n\ncyclophellitol-based compounds. Notably, the brain showed a different picture. Almost no brain GBA was labeled in mice upon intravenous administration of MDW933. This may suggest that MDW933 does not pass the blood-brain barrier or is actively removed from the brain by some P-glycoprotein. The fluorescence features of the green and red fluorescent probes are intrinsically suboptimal for in situ imaging of labeled GBA in tissues or whole animals. The potential applications for the activity-based fluorescent probes MDW933 and MDW941 are substantial. They offer an alternative to antibodies, which are species-specific and can not reach compartmental GBA in intact cells. Moreover, in contrast to antibodies, our probes uniquely label active GBA molecules. One tentative area of application of the fluorescent probes may be diagnosis of Gaucher disease, in particular the demonstration of low amounts of active GBA molecules in fibroblasts or blood cells of patients. This is helpful, as low amounts of active GBA molecules are usually associated with severe, neuronopathic Gaucher disease. Another area of application for these fluorescent probes may be found in the analysis of compounds for their possible inhibitory or chaperone effects. As we demonstrated, the beneficial effect of isofagomine on N370S GBA in cultured fibroblasts could be confirmed with activity-based labeling. This finding is of importance as it implies that at an optimal concentration of isofagomine, occupation of the catalytic center by the competitive inhibitor is in situ sufficiently low to allow labeling by the fluorescent probe. In other words, at an appropriate concentration isofagomine indeed increases GBA levels and intralysosomal enzymatic capacity. This finding for isofagomine is not entirely unexpected, as it has been proposed that at the low intralysosomal pH isofagomine interacts less well with 6- glucosidases than at neutral pH in the endoplasmic reticulum\n34\n. Our observations render support for the approach of chaperone therapy, although the dosing of drugs in patients to reach optimal (steady- state) concentrations in various tissues may prove to be a major challenge. \n\n Our approach of selective detection of GBA molecules using fluorescently labeled irreversible inhibitors allows unprecedented, ultrasensitive in vivo monitoring of active enzyme molecules. The same approach also applies for other glycosidases. Another option is to use the (fluorescent) probes in living animals. Several approaches are possible. In the first approach the fluorescent probes are used to report on local GBA activity. In the second strategy, recombinant GBA is labeled with the fluorescent probe so that after administration, trafficking of the construct can be monitored in a strategy that is related to another recently reported strategy that uses active site labeling of recombinant and purified GBA with a radiotag\n35\n. In another approach, probes with infrared fluorescence are used for in vivo imaging. Tissue and organs are more transparent for infra-red light than for visisble light. In conclusion, the reported fluorescent activity-based probes offer very versatile research tools to visualize active GBA, ultrasensitively and specifically. This accomplishment is not only relevant for Gaucher disease but also for parkinsonism. \n\n\nMETHODS \n\n\n See Example 3 Methods for the synthesis of the probes, the methods used to determine the binding constants, molecular docking studies, time-lapse microscopy and mass spectrometric analysis of GBA labeled with KY170 and MDW933. \n\n\nGeneral methods. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich if not otherwise indicated. Recombinant GBA was obtained from Genzyme. Monoclonal anti-human GBA antibody 8E4 was produced from hybridoma cells as described earlier\n36\n. Gaucher patients were diagnosed on the basis of reduced GBA activity and demonstration of an abnormal genotype\n37\n. Fibroblasts were obtained with consent from donors. Cell lines were cultured in HAMF12- DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplied with 10% (v/v) FBS. \n\n Enzyme activity assays. Activity of GBA was measured at 37 °C with 4- methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucopyranoside as substrate as reported previously. To determine the IC50 value, the inhibitors were preincubated for 30 min with the enzyme before addition of the substrate mixture. The incubation mixture contained 3 mM fluorogenic substrate, 0.2% (w/v) sodium taurocholate and\n\n\n0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 150 mM Mcllvaine buffer, pH 5.2. After stopping the incubation with excess NaOH-glycine (pH 10.3), we measured fluorescence with a fluorimeter LS 30 (Perkin Elmer) using Aex 366 nm and X\nem\n 445 nm. Activity of lactase was quantified by measuring liberated glucose from lactase\n38\n. In vivo activity of GBA in cells was measured using FDG as substrate and FACS\n32\n. \n\n\nGel electrophoresis and fluorescence scanning. Electrophoresis in sodium dodecylsulfate containing either 7.5% or 10% polyacrylamide gels was performed as earlier described\n29\n. Wet slab gels were scanned on fluorescence using the Typhoon Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences) USing Aex 488 nm and X\nem\n 520 nm (bandpass 40) for green fluorescent MDW933 and X\nex\n 532 nm and X\nem\n610 nM (bandpass 30) for red fluorescent MDW941. Fluorescence microscopy and multispectral imaging. Fibroblasts were cultured on glass slides. Cells were incubated with MDW941 (5 nM) or control probe MDW1065 (5 nM) for 2 h. Next, cells were washed, fixed with 3% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed and incubated first with 0.05% (w/v) saponine for 15 min, next with 0.1 mM NH4C1 in PBS for 10 min and then with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Next, the slides were incubated with anti-GBA monoclonal antibody 8E4 (1:500). Bound mouse monoclonal antibody was visualized with a secondary antibody conjugated with AlexaFluor488. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Cells were examined using epifluorescence microscopy (Leica DM5000B) with an HCX PL APO x63 1.40-0.60 oil immersion objective. Filter blocks used were A4 (360/40 nm band \n\n pass excitation, 400 nm dichromatic mirror, 470/40 nm band pass suppression) for DAPI, L5 (480/40 nm band pass excitation, 505 nm dichromatic mirror, 527/30 nm band pass suppression) for AlexaFluor488 and N2.1 (515-560 nm band pass excitation, 580 nm dichromatic mirror, 590 nm long pass \n\n\nsuppression) for MDW941 and MDW1065. Analysis was performed with multispectral imaging using a Nuance N-MSI-420-20 camera with Nuance 2.10 software (Cambridge Research & Instrumentation). Data sets were acquired at 440-500 nm for A4, 500-580 nm for L5, and 580-720 nm for N2.1 filter blocks, each at 10 nm intervals. In each experiment, nonlabeled control cells were imaged to define the autofluorescence spectral library. Spectral libraries for DAPI, AlexaFluor488 and MDW941 or MDW1065, each obtained from single- stained cells, were used to unmix the triple staining patterns into the individual components and separate these from autofluorescence. Nuance software was used to construct composite images. \n\n\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting. Fibroblasts were cultured in the presence or absence of 0.3 mM CBE overnight. Next, cells were incubated with MDW933 (2 and 10 nM, for 300 min). Cells were suspended by trypsinization and analyzed by FACS using FACS Vantage (B.D. Bioscience), X\nex\n 488 nm, X\nem\n 530 nm (bandpass filter 30 nm). \n\n\nPulse-chase experiments. Fibroblasts were cultured overnight with \n\n\nMDW941 (10 nM), after which they were extensively washed with PBS and incubated with MDW933 (10 nM). Cells were harvested at different time points; homogenates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE. GBA labeled with MDW933 and with MDW941 were separately visualized using the Typhoon Variable Mode Imager with the above described settings. \n\n\nLabeling of GBA in live mice. Experimental procedures were all approved by the appropriate ethics committee for animal experiments. C57BI/6J mice \n\n were obtained from Harlan and fed a commercially available lab diet (RMH-B; Hope Farms). Two Npcl BALB/c WT (+/+) mice were injected intravenously via tail vein, using a restrainer with 100 μΐ PBS or 100 μΐ 100 nM MDW933 dissolved in PBS. After 2 h of administration the mice were anesthetized with FFM mix (1 ml of fentanylcitrate, 1 ml of midazalam and 2 ml of distilled water), and blood, urine and organs were collected and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Homogenates were made in 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and labeled with MDW941 (100 nM). Homogenates were analyzed as described above. \n\n\nChaperone experiment using isofagomine. A cell line homozygous for N370S was cultured in HAMF12-DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplied with 10% (v/v) FBS. Cells were cultured for one week with 0, 10, 30 and 300 nM isofagomine in the medium at confluency. In vitro activity: After one week, cells were scraped and lysed, and activity of GBA was measured at 37 °C with 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucopyranoside as described above. The incubation mixture contained the corresponding concentration of isofagomine, 3 mM fluorogenic substrate, 0.2% (w/v) sodium taurocholate and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X- 100 in 150 mM Mcllvaine buffer, pH 5.2. For in situ labeling, after one week, similarly treated cells were labeled with 10 nM MDW941 for 2 h. Cells were scraped and lysed, and 25 pg of cell lysate was subjected to electrophoresis in sodium dodecylsulfate containing 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Fluorescence of GBA labeled with MDW941 was imaged as described above and was quantified using the supplied ImageQuant software (5.1). \n\n\nLiterature cited in example 2 \n\n\n1.

The chemical structures that are associated with these names and number are depicted in figure 22. \n\n\nResults Synthesis of the probes \n\n\n KY170 4, and fluorescent probes MDW933 5 and MDW941 6 were synthesized as follows (See also Figure 38, scheme 1). First, core carbocycle 10 was synthesized in 7 steps from D-xylose as described (1). Selective tosylation of the primary alcohol in 1 by treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in CH2CI2 followed by substitution of the tosylate with sodium azide afforded azido alcohol 11 in 72%. The benzyl groups in 11 were removed under the agency of BCI3 prior to epoxidation. The resulting free hydroxyls were protected as the corresponding benzoyl protective groups using benzoyl chloride in pyridine. Epoxidation of cyclohexene 12 using in situ formed methyl (triflu or omethyl)dioxirane gave epoxides 13 and 14 as a separable mixture. Deprotection with sodium methoxide in methanol gave 8-deoxy-8- azidocyclophellitol (KYI 70, 4). BODIPY Green-alkyne 15 (green fluorescent) or BODIPY Redalkyne 16 (red fluorescent) was conjugated to KYI 70 4 using copper-catalyzed click chemistry, giving MDW933 5 and MDW941 6 \n\n\nrespectively. Non-reactive control probes MDW1064 8 and MDW1065 9 were synthesized by removing the protective groups in azido alcohol 11 with BC13 and subsequent conjugation to either BODIPY Green 15 or BODIPY Red 16. \n\n Determination of inhibition constants \n\n\n Previously discontinuous methods have been used to determine the inhibition constants of glycosidase inhibitors. This method however proved to be unsuitable for the determination of the inhibition constants of KY170 4, \n\n\nMDW933 5 and MDW941 6 due to their high affinity/fast binding. Therefore the inhibition constants have been determined in a continuous substrate assay which was first described in 1982 (2) and has recently been reappraised in 2010 (3). In these experiments, inhibition of the enzyme and hydrolysis of the substrate proceed concurrently making the situation slightly more complex than the discontinuous (Figure 39 Scheme 2). The time- dependent interaction of inhibitor (I) with free β-glucosidase (E) was considered to occur in separate stages (A). A rapid reversible interaction is followed by a slower, irreversible reaction that transforms the reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI) into an irreversible enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI*) (Figure 39 Scheme 2). Progress curves were obtained (Figure 28a) and apparent rate constant k' was plotted versus the concentration (Figure 28b) to obtain estimates of the ¾ \n\n\n(equilibrium constant) and ki (rate constant) \n\n\nMolecular docking \n\n\nMolecular docking was performed with KY170 4, MDW933 5 and MDW941 6 as ligands. MDW933 5 and MDW941 6 revealed to bind tightly to the GBA active site (Figure 29). Both probes displayed free binding energies of ~8 kcal/mol. For both ligands we observed binding of the polar cyclophellitol head group in the active site pocket, with the epoxide being within 4 Angstrom of E340. The region immediately outside the active site pocket on the protein surface accommodated the hydrophobic tails. Inspection of binding showed tight binding of the hydrophobic part of the ligand with this part of the protein. Binding of KYI 70 4 was much weaker in the range of 5 kcal/mol, further illustrating how the hydrophobic tail greatly increased the binding affinity. \n\n Cellular uptake of the probes \n\n\n To identify the mechanism of entry of the probes, we performed a temperature experiment. We incubated cells with a serial dilution of MDW933 5 either at 18°C, a temperature at which endocytosis is blocked, or 37°C for 2 hours. We harvested the cells and determined the residual activity using a fluorogenic substrate assay. The residual activities showed that the temperature did not have an pronounced effect on in situ inhibition. At both temperatures, 10 nM MDW933 5 blocked glucocerebrosidase activity in situ (SI Fig 33). We therefore exclude that the uptake is solely by endocytosis. \n\n\nMethods \n\n\nAll reagents were of a commercial grade and were used as received unless stated otherwise. Isofagomine 1 (4), cyclophellitol 3 (1) and BODIPY alkyne green 15 and red 16 (5) were synthesized as described in literature and their spectral data was in accordance with those reported in literature. \n\n\nThe AMP-DNM 7 used in this research was from a previously synthesized batch (6). Diethyl ether (Et20), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), light petroleum ether and toluene were obtained from Riedel-de Haen. Acetonitrile, \n\n\ndichloromethane, dimethylformamide (DMF), methanol (MeOH), pyridine, tetrahydrofuran (THF) were purchased from Biosolve. Dichloromethane was distilled from CaF and THF was distilled over L1AIH4 prior to use. All reactions were performed under an inert atmosphere or Argon unless stated otherwise. Solvents used for flash chromatography were of pro analysi quality. Reactions were monitored by TLC analysis using Merck aluminum sheets precoated with silica gel 60 with detection by UV-absorption (254 nm) and by spraying with a solution of (NH^eMovC^ Ή\n2\n0 (25g/L) and (NH\n4\n)\n4\nCe(S0\n4\n)4 Ή\n2\n0 (10 g/L) in 10% aqueous sulfuric acid followed by charring at ~150°C or by spraying with 20% sulfuric acid in ethanol followed by charring at ~150°C. Column chromatography was performed using either Baker- or Screening \n\n Device silica gel in the indicated solvents. Ή NMR and \n13\nC NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DMX-400 (400/100 MHz) or a Bruker AV-400 (400/100 MHz) spectrometer in the given solvent. Chemical shifts are reported as δ- values in ppm relative to the chloroform residual solvent peak or \n\n\ntetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. Coupling constants are given in Hz. All given \n13\nC spectra are proton decoupled. Spin multiplicities are given as s, d, dd, ddd, dddd, dt, t, td, q and m. High resolution mass spectra were recorded with a LTQ Orbitrap (Thermo Finnigan). LC/MS analysis was performed on a Jasco HPLCsystem (detection simultaneously at 214 nm and 254 nm) equipped with an analytical Alltima C18 column (Alltech, 4.6 mmD x 250 mmL, 5μ particle size) in combination with buffers A: H20, B: acetonitrile and C: 1% aq. TFA and coupled to a Perkin Elmer Sciex API 165 mass instrument. \n\n\n Optical rotations were measured on a Propol automatic polarimeter (sodium D line, λ = 589 nm). FTIR-spectra were recorded on a Paragon-PE 1000. \n\n\n(lR,2R,5S,6S)-2-(azidomethyl)-5,6-bis(benzyloxy)cyclohex-3-enol (11)\n\n\nTo a solution of 10 (1.24 g, 3.65 mmol) in dichloromethane (26 mL) were added p-toluenesulfonylchloride (1.04 g, 5.48 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) and triethylamine (0.90 mL, 6.57 mmol, 1.8 equiv.) at 0°C. The solution was stirred for 5 h before being poured in 1M HC1 solution. The mixture was extracted with Et20 and the organic layer was dried over MgSC before being concentrated in vacuo, yielding the crude tosylate which was immediately subjected to azidation. To a solution of tosylated intermediate (1.75 g, 3.65 mmol) in DMF (35 ml) was added sodium azide (2.40 g, 36.7 mmol, 10.4 equiv.). The solution was stirred for 24 h at 60°C before being concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was diluted with EtOAc, washed with 1 M HC1, saturated aqueous NaHC03 and brine. \n\n\n The combined organic layers were dried over MgSC and concentrated in vacuo.

Protein digests were desalted using reversed phase Cis-Ziptips (2 pg capacity, Millipore). After activation in acetonitrile and loading of the samples, the Ziptips were washed with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 39.9% water. Prior to loading onto the LC-MS system samples were diluted 10-fold with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. \n\n\nIdentification of the site of binding of MDW933 \n\n\n Some 40 pg of recombinant GBA (1 pg/pL) was diluted in 60 pL Mcllvaine buffer (150 mM, pH 5.2, 0.2% sodium taurocholate (w/v), 0.1% Triton X- 100 (v/v)), incubated with MDW933 5 (10 pL, 20 pM stock in DMSO) for lh at 37°C and precipitated with chloroform/methanol (C/M, (9)). The protein pellet was rehydrated in 90 pL 8 M urea/100 mM NH4HCO3, reduced with 5 pL 90 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37°C, alkylated with 7.5 pL 200 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at RT in the dark and desalted by C/M. The pellet was dispersed in 100 pL 8 M urea/50 mM Na\n2\nC0\n3\n buffer (pH 9.4). To 50 pL of the protein solution was added 5 pL hydroxylamine hydrochloride (10 M) and 45 pL 8 M Urea/50 mM Na\n2\nC0\n3\n buffer (pH 9.2). The pH was adjusted to pH -9.2 by the addition of NaOH (5M). The resulting mixture was incubated overnight at 37°C, precipitated with C/M, redissolved in 10 pL 8 M urea/100 mM \n\n\nNH4HCO3, diluted with 90 pL digest buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl, ImM CaCb, 2% ACN) and digested with 500 ng trypsin overnight at 37°C. Peptides were collected and desalted on stage tips (10). \n\n LC-MS analysis \n\n\n Tryptic peptides were analyzed on a Surveyor nanoLC system (Thermo) hyphenated to a LTQOrbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo). Gold and carbon coated emitters (OD/ID=360/25pm tip ID=5 pm), trap column (OD/ID=360/100 pm packed with 25 mm robust Poros®10R2/ 15 mm BioSphere C18 5 pm 120A) and analytical columns (OD/ID=360/75 pm packed with 20 cm BioSphere C18 5 pm 120A) were from Nanoseparations (Nieuwkoop, The Netherlands). The mobile phases (A: 0.1% FA/H20, B: 0.1%FA/ACN) were made with ULC/MS grade solvents (Biosolve). The emitter tip was coupled end-to-end with the analytical column via a 15 mm long TFE teflon tubing sleeve (OD/ID 0.3x1.58 mm, Supelco, USA) and installed in a stainless steel holder mounted in a nano-source base (Upchurch scientific, Idex, USA). \n\n\n General mass spectrometric conditions were: an electrospray voltage of 1.8 kV was applied to the emitter, no sheath and auxiliary gas flow, ion transfer tube temperature 150°C, capillary voltage 41V, tube lens voltage 150V. Internal mass calibration was performed with air-borne protonated \n\n\npolydimethylcyclosiloxane (m/z = 445.12002) and the plasticizer protonated dioctyl phthalate ions (m/z = 391.28429) as lock mass (11). \n\n\n10 pL of the samples was pressure loaded on the trap column with a 10 pL/min flow for 5 min followed by peptide separation with a gradient of 35 min 5-30% B, 15 min 30-60% B, 5 min A at a flow of 300 pL/min split to 250 nL/min by the LTQ divert valve. For each data dependent cycle, one full MS scan (300-2000 m/z) acquired at high mass resolution (60,000 at 400 m /z, AGC target lxlO\n6\n, maximum injection time 1,000 ms) in the LTQ linear ion trap (AGC target 5xl0\n3\n, max inj time 120 ms) from the three most abundant ions. MS\n2\n settings were: collision gas pressure 1.3 mT, normalized collision energy 35%, ion selection threshold of 500 counts, activation q = 0.25 and activation time of 30 ms. Fragmented precursor ions that were measured twice within 10 s were dynamically excluded for 60s and ions with z<2 or unassigned were not analyzed. Data from MS\n2\n was validated manually. \n\n Literature cited in example 3 \n\n\n(1) Hansen, F. G., Bundgaard, E. & Madsen, R. A short synthesis of (+)- cyclophellitol. J. Org.

Description\n\n\n\n\n Aza-benzimidazolone Chymase Inhibitors\n\n\nApplication Data\n\n\nThis application claims benefit is US provisional application serial no. 61/095,335 filed September 9, 2008.\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\nThe invention relates to small molecule inhibitors which are useful in treating various diseases and conditions involving Chymase.\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\nIn cardiac tissue of cardiomyopathic patients, transforming growth factor-β (TGF- β), which has been demonstrated to stimulate cardiac fibrosis in animal models (Kuwahara, et al. Circulation, 2002, 106, 130), is increased (Li et al., Circulation, 1997, 96, 874). In the myocardial fibrotic area, it is known that mast cells are increased in number and may contribute to the development of fibroblast proliferation in cardiac tissues of patients with cardiomyopathy (Patella et al., Circulation, 1998, 97, 971). Chymase is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease contained in the secretory granules of mast cells. Although the precise physiological roles of Chymase have not been completely revealed, Chymase is known to transform angiotensin I to angiotensin II and may contribute to activation of TGF-β, matrix proteases, and cytokines (Taipale et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, 4689; Takai et al., Life ScL, 1996, 58, 591; Takai et al., Circulation, 1999, 100, 654).\n\n\nA potent and selective Chymase inhibitor may have potential use as a treatment of chronic heart failure, atherosclerosis, restenosis, and myocardial infarction by inhibiting local production of angiotensin II in the heart and release of TGF-β, two independent mediators of cardiac remodeling. An inhibitor may also have potential use for treatment of mast cell mediated diseases such as dermatitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary inflammation, since Chymase is implicated in microvascular leakage, neutrophil \n\n accumulation, the stimulation of mucus secretion, and the modulation of cytokines (He et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1998, 352, 91).\n\n\nSeveral small molecule Chymase inhibitors have been reported to be efficacious in the cardiomyopathic hamster model of heart failure (Takai et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003, 305, 17), in carotid artery injury by a balloon catheter in dogs (Takai et al. J. Pharmacol.Exp. Ther, 2003, 304, 841), and in the hamster left anterior descending coronary artery ligation model of heart failure (WO 03/018061). Additionally, a Chymase inhibitor has been demonstrated to be efficacious in a sheep asthma model (WO 2005/073214). However, there is no example of commercialization of a Chymase inhibitor as a medicament.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIt is therefore an object of the invention to provide a small molecule a Chymase inhibitor as defined herein, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof.\n\n\nIt is also an object of the invention to provide methods of using said Chymase inhibitors to treat various diseases and conditions related thereto.\n\n\nIt is a further object of the invention to provide processes of preparing said Chymase inhibitors.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn a first generic embodiment, there is provided a compound of the formula (I):\n\n\n \n\n wherein: one of A, Y or X is N and the other two are CH which forms a pyridolo ring or\n\n\nA and Y are both N and X is CH which forms a pyrimidolo ring;\n\n\nRi is -SO\n2\nR\n6\n , -SO\n2\n-NH-R\n6\n , -N(R\n5\n)-SO\n2\nR\n6\n , -NR\n5\nR\n7\n, hydroxyl, d-\n4\n alkoxy and aryloxy;\n\n\nR\n2\n is aryl or heteroaryl each optionally substituted by halogen, Ci -\n4\n alkyl, Ci -\n4\n alkoxy, C\n1\n-\n4\n acyl, C\n1\n-\n4\n alkoxycarbonyl, aryl and benzyl;\n\n\nR\n3\n is attached to a carbon atom on the pyridolo or pyrimidolo ring and is chosen from carboxyl, halogen, cyano, C\n1\n-\n4\n alkyl, C\n1\n-\n4\n alkoxy, C\n1\n-\n4\n acyl, C\n3\n-\n7\n cycloalkyl, - C(0)-NRiiRi\n2\n, NR\n11\nR\n12\n, Rn and R\n12\n are independently chosen from hydrogen, Ci- \n4\n alkyl, C\n1\n-\n4\n alkoxy, C\n1\n-\n4\n acyl, C\n1\n-\n4\n alkoxycarbonyl, aryl and benzyl;\n\n\nR\n5\n, Re and R\n9\n are independently chosen from hydrogen or C\n1\n-\n7\n alkyl, wherein Rs and R\n9\n optionally form a C\n3\n-\n7\n cycloalkyl group optionally substituted by halogen, C\n1\n-\n4\n alkyl, C\n1\n-\n4\n alkoxy, C\n1\n-\n4\n acyl, C\n1\n-\n4\n alkoxycarbonyl, aryl and benzyl;\n\n\nR\n6\n is chosen from Ci-\n6\n alkyl, C\n3\n-\n6\n cycloalkyl, aryl and heteroaryl each optionally independently substituted with a substituents chosen from Ci_\n5\n alkyl, Ci_\n4\n alkoxy, halogen and cyano;\n\n\nR\n7\n is chosen from hydrogen, cyano, aryl, heteroaryl, Ci-\n6\n alkyl and C\n3\n-\n6\n cycloalkyl;\n\n\nRio is chosen from hydrogen, C\n1\n-\n7\n alkyl, C\n1\n-\n7\n alkoxyl, aryl, heteroaryl, and C\n3\n-\n6\n cycloalkyl, each cyclic group for Ri\n0\n is optionally substituted with a substituent chosen from Ci_\n5\n alkyl, Ci^ alkoxy, halogen and cyano;\n\n\nn = 0-3;\n\n\nwherein all R groups are optionally partially or fully halogenated where possible;

Compounds of the invention may be physically combined with the conventional therapeutics or other adjuvants into a single pharmaceutical composition. Advantageously, the compounds may then be administered together in a single dosage form. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions comprising such combinations of compounds contain at least about 5%, but more preferably at least about 20%, of a compound (w/w) or a combination thereof. The optimum percentage (w/w) of a compound of the invention may vary and is within the purview of those skilled in the art. Alternatively, the compounds may be administered separately (either serially or in parallel). Separate dosing allows for greater flexibility in the dosing regime.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, dosage forms of the above-described compounds include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and adjuvants known to those of ordinary \n\n skill in the art. These carriers and adjuvants include, for example, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, buffer substances, water, salts or electrolytes and cellulose -based substances. Preferred dosage forms include, tablet, capsule, caplet, liquid, solution, suspension, emulsion, lozenges, syrup, reconstitutable powder, granule, suppository and transdermal patch. Methods for preparing such dosage forms are known (see, for example, H.C. Ansel and N.G. Popovish, Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 5th ed., Lea and Febiger (1990)). Dosage levels and requirements are well- recognized in the art and may be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art from available methods and techniques suitable for a particular patient. In some embodiments, dosage levels range from about 1-1000 mg/dose for a 70 kg patient. Although one dose per day may be sufficient, up to 5 doses per day may be given. For oral doses, up to 2000 mg/day may be required. As the skilled artisan will appreciate, lower or higher doses may be required depending on particular factors. For instance, specific dosage and treatment regimens will depend on factors such as the patient's general health profile, the severity and course of the patient's disorder or disposition thereto, and the judgment of the treating physician.\n\n\nThe term \"patient\" includes both human and non-human mammals.\n\n\nThe term \"effective amount\" means an amount of a compound according to the invention which, in the context of which it is administered or used, is sufficient to achieve the desired effect or result. Depending on the context, the term effective amount may include or be synonymous with a pharmaceutically effective amount or a diagnostically effective amount.\n\n\nThe terms \"pharmaceutically effective amount\" or \"therapeutically effective amount\" means an amount of a compound according to the invention which, when administered to a patient in need thereof, is sufficient to effect treatment for disease-states, conditions, or disorders for which the compounds have utility. Such an amount would be sufficient to elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, or patient that is sought by a researcher or clinician. The amount of a compound of according to the invention which constitutes a therapeutically effective amount will vary depending on such factors as the compound and its \n\n biological activity, the composition used for administration, the time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of treatment, the type of disease-state or disorder being treated and its severity, drugs used in combination with or coincidentally with the compounds of the invention, and the age, body weight, general health, sex, and diet of the patient. Such a therapeutically effective amount can be determined routinely by one of ordinary skill in the art having regard to their own knowledge, the prior art, and this disclosure.\n\n\nThe term \"diagnostically effective amount\" means an amount of a compound according to the invention which, when used in a diagnostic method, apparatus, or assay, is sufficient to achieve the desired diagnostic effect or the desired biological activity necessary for the diagnostic method, apparatus, or assay. Such an amount would be sufficient to elicit the biological or medical response in a diagnostic method, apparatus, or assay, which may include a biological or medical response in a patient or in a in vitro or in vivo tissue or system, that is sought by a researcher or clinician. The amount of a compound according to the invention which constitutes a diagnostically effective amount will vary depending on such factors as the compound and its biological activity, the diagnostic method, apparatus, or assay used, the composition used for administration, the time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of administration, drugs and other compounds used in combination with or coincidentally with the compounds of the invention, and, if a patient is the subject of the diagnostic administration, the age, body weight, general health, sex, and diet of the patient. Such a diagnostically effective amount can be determined routinely by one of ordinary skill in the art having regard to their own knowledge, the prior art, and this disclosure.\n\n\nThe terms \"treating\" or \"treatment\" mean the treatment of a disease-state in a patient, and include:\n\n\n(i) preventing the disease-state from occurring in a patient, in particular, when such patient is genetically or otherwise predisposed to the disease-state but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; \n\n (ii) inhibiting or ameliorating the disease-state in a patient, i.e., arresting or slowing its development; or\n\n\n(iii) relieving the disease-state in a patient, i.e., causing regression or cure of the disease-state.\n\n\nIn vitro assay for inhibition of Chymase\n\n\nChymase assays were performed in a total volume of 15 μL in Corning black opaque 384-well microtiter plates with a non-binding surface (Corning, NY). The assay buffer was comprised of 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.01% CHAPS. The test compounds were serially diluted 3-fold with neat DMSO in a 96-well polypropylene plate from a 1OmM DMSO stock to give the 10 point dose response curve. 3 μL of the resulting DMSO solution were transferred to a 384- well polypropylene plate in duplicate, and 37 μL of assay buffer was added. Chymase was added to the assay plate in 3 uL of assay buffer followed by 2 uL of the appropriate compound dilution using a PlateMate Plus (Matrix Technologies Corp., Hudson, NH). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 uL rhodamine 110, bis-(succinoyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanylamide) (American Peptides, Sunnyvale, CA) in assay buffer containing 150 μM tris(2- carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL) using a Multidrop (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA). Final assay concentrations were 500 pM chymase, 100 nM substrate, 100 μM TCEP, and 1% DMSO. The plates were incubated at 28° C and 80% humidity for 1 hour, at which time the fluorescence was read on a Viewlux 1430 Microplate Imager (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) with 485 nm excitation, 530 nm emission, and a fluorescein dichroic mirror. The percentage of control values were calculated relative to assay blanks containing complete reaction minus chymase and a 100% control containing assay buffer with 1% DMSO in place of compound. IC50 values were obtained by fitting the data using XLFit4 (IDBS Software). Preferred compounds of the invention have an activity of 100 nanoMolar or less.\n\n\nAll patent and literature references cited in this application are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety."
