It has been reported that ANGPTL4 inhibits LPL and retards lipoprotein catabolism, in humans and rodents. ANGPTL4 null mice exhibit a significant decrease in serum TG. Conversely, ANGPTL4 injection into mice produces a rapid increase in circulating lipids and this is at a higher rate than the injection of angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) (Yoshida et al., 2002\n, J Lipid Res \n43:1770-1772). The N-terminal coiled-coil region, not the C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain, of ANGPTL4 is known to be important in the inhibition of LPL activity and, therefore, for the hypertriglyceridemia indication. These observations indicate that inhibition of ANGPTL4 could be beneficial in treating diseases characterized by elevated lipid levels, including primary dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes, and the like. ANGPTL4 has also been implicated as having a role in angiogenesis and cancer (Galaup et al., 2006\n, PNAS \n103(49):18721-18726; Kim et al., 2000\n, Biochem J \n346:603-610; and Ito et al., 2003\n, Cancer Res \n63(20):6651-6657).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid and the amino acid sequences of human ANGPTL4 are shown in SEQ ID NOS: 475 and 476, respectively. Antibodies to ANGPTL4 are disclosed in, for example, WO 2006/074228 and WO 2007/109307.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a first aspect, the invention provides fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antigen-binding fragments thereof that specifically bind and neutralize human ANGPTL4 (hANGPTL4) activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies (Abs) can be full-length (for example, an IgG1 or IgG4 antibody) or may comprise only an antigen-binding portion (for example, a Fab, F(ab′)\n2 \nor scFv fragment), and may be modified to affect functionality, e.g., to eliminate residual effector functions (Reddy et al., 2000\n, J. Immunol. \n164:1925-1933).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention comprises an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of an antibody comprising a heavy chain variable region (HCVR) selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:2, 18, 22, 26, 42, 46, 50, 66, 70, 74, 90, 94, 98, 114, 118, 122, 138, 142, 146, 162, 166, 170, 186, 190, 194, 210, 214, 218, 234, 238, 242, 258, 262, 266, 282, 286, 290, 306, 310, 314, 330, 334, 338, 354, 358, 362, 378, 382, 386, 402, 406, 410, 426, 430, 434, 450, 454, 458, 466, 468 and 487, or a substantially similar sequence thereof having at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98% or at least 99% sequence identity.

Methods and techniques for identifying CDRs within HCVR and LCVR amino acid sequences are known in the art and can be applied to identify CDRs within the specified HCVR and/or LCVR amino acid sequences disclosed herein. Conventional definitions that can be applied to identify the boundaries of CDRs include the Kabat definition, the Chothia definition, and the AbM definition. In general terms, the Kabat definition is based on sequence variability, the Chothia definition is based on the location of the structural loop regions, and the AbM definition is a compromise between the Kabat and Chothia approaches.

In certain embodiments, the antibody of the invention exhibits a K\nD \nof about 500 pM or less; about 400 pM or less; about 300 pM or less; about 200 pM or less; about 150 pM or less; about 100 pM or less; or about 50 pM or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a seventh aspect, the present invention provides an anti-hANGPTL4 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds hANGPTL4 protein of SEQ ID NO:476, but does not cross-react with a related protein, such as a human angiopoietin-like protein 3 (hANGPTL3; SEQ ID NO:485), as determined by, for example, ELISA, surface plasmon resonance assay, or LUMINEX® XMAP® Technology, as described herein. ANGPTL3 is another secreted protein that is known to reduce LPL activity and has an N-terminal coiled-coil region and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain (Ono et al., 2003\n, J Biol Chem \n43:41804-41809). In related embodiments, the invention provides an anti-hANGPTL4 antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that binds a hANGPTL4 protein and cross-reacts with a hANGPTL3 protein. In certain embodiments, the binding affinity of the hANGPTL4 antibody or fragment thereof to hANGPTL3 protein is about 75% or less, or about 50% or less, of the binding affinity of the antibody or fragment to the hANGPTL4 protein. In another related embodiment, the invention provides an anti-hANGPTL4 antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that does not cross-react with mouse ANGPTL4 (mANGPTL4: SEQ ID NO:478) but does cross-react with cynomolgus monkey (\nMacaca fascicularis\n; the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal 1-148 residues and the encoding DNA sequences are shown as SEQ ID NOS:490 and 489, respectively) and/or rhesus monkey (\nMacaca mulatta\n; the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal 1-148 residues and the encoding DNA sequences are shown as SEQ ID NOS:492 and 491, respectively) ANGPTL4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention encompasses anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies having a modified glycosylation pattern. In some applications, modification to remove undesirable glycosylation sites may be useful, or e.g., removal of a fucose moiety to increase antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) function (see Shield et al. (2002) JBC 277:26733). In other applications, removal of N-glycosylation site may reduce undesirable immune reactions against the therapeutic antibodies, or increase affinities of the antibodies. In yet other applications, modification of galactosylation can be made in order to modify complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an eighth aspect, the invention features a pharmaceutical composition comprising a recombinant human antibody or fragment thereof which specifically binds hANGPTL4 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment, the invention features a composition which is a combination of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention, and a second therapeutic agent. The second therapeutic agent may be one or more of any agent such as (1) 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, such as cerivastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and the like; (2) inhibitors of cholesterol uptake and/or bile acid re-absorption; (3) niacin, which increases lipoprotein catabolism; (4) fibrates or amphipathic carboxylic acids, which reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level, improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and TG levels, and reduce the number of non-fatal heart attacks; and (5) activators of the LXR transcription factor that plays a role in cholesterol elimination such as 22-hydroxycholesterol, or fixed combinations such as ezetimibe plus simvastatin; a statin with a bile resin (e.g., cholestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam), a fixed combination of niacin plus a statin (e.g., niacin with lovastatin); or with other lipid lowering agents such as omega-3-fatty acid ethyl esters (for example, omacor). Furthermore, the second therapeutic agent can be one or more other inhibitors of ANGPTL4 as well as inhibitors of other molecules, such as ANGPTL3, ANGPTL5, ANGPTL6 and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which are involved in lipid metabolism, in particular, cholesterol and/or triglyceride homeostasis. Inhibitors of these molecules include small molecules and antibodies that specifically bind to these molecules and block their activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn related embodiments, the second therapeutic agent may be one or more anti-cancer agents, such as chemotherapeutic agents, anti-angiogenic agents, growth inhibitory agents, cytotoxic agents, apoptotic agents, and other agents well known in the art to treat cancer or other proliferative diseases or disorders, as well as other therapeutic agents, such as analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as Cox-2 inhibitors, and the like, so as to ameliorate and/or reduce the symptoms accompanying the underlying cancer/tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a ninth aspect, the invention features methods for inhibiting hANGPTL4 activity using the anti-hANGPTL4 antibody or antigen-binding portion of the antibody of the invention, wherein the therapeutic methods comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the invention and, optionally one or more additional therapeutic agents described above. The disease or disorder treated is any disease or condition which is improved, ameliorated, inhibited or prevented, or its occurrence rate reduced compared to that without anti-hANGPTL4 antibody treatment (e.g., ANGPTL4-mediated diseases or disorders), by removal, inhibition or reduction of ANGPTL4 activity. Examples of diseases or disorders treatable by the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, those involving lipid metabolism, such as hyperlipidemia, hyperlipoproteinemia and dyslipidemia, including atherogenic dyslipidemia, diabetic dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, including severe hypertriglyceridemia with TG>1000 mg/dL, hypercholesterolemia, chylomicronemia, mixed dyslipidemia (obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, etc.), lipodystrophy, lipoatrophy, and the like, which are caused by, for example, decreased LPL activity and/or LPL deficiency, decreased LDL receptor activity and/or LDL receptor deficiency, altered ApoC2, ApoE deficiency, increased ApoB, increased production and/or decreased elimination of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), certain drug treatment (e.g., glucocorticoid treatment-induced dyslipidemia), any genetic predisposition, diet, life style, and the like. The methods of the invention can also prevent or treat diseases or disorders associated with or resulting from hyperlipidemia, hyperlipoproteinemia, and/or dyslipidemia, including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases or disorders, such as atherosclerosis, aneurysm, hypertension, angina, stroke, cerebrovascular diseases, congestive heart failure, coronary artery diseases, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular diseases, and the like; acute pancreatitis; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); blood sugar disorders, such as diabetes; obesity, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther examples of diseases or disorders treatable by the methods of the invention include cancer/tumor as well as non-neoplastic angiogenesis-associated diseases or disorders, including ocular angiogenic diseases or disorders, such as age-related macular degeneration, central retinal vein occlusion or branch retinal vein occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and the like, inflammatory diseases or disorders, such as arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther embodiments will become apparent from a review of the ensuing detailed description.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURE\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n shows a sequence alignment of heavy chain variable regions (HCVR) of antibodies H1H268P, H1H284P, H1H291P AND H1H292P.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n shows a sequence alignment of light chain variable regions (LCVR) of antibodies H1H268P, H1H284P, H1H291P AND H1H292P.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 3A and 3B\n show the pharmacokinetic clearance of anti-ANGPTL4 antibodies in wild-type mice (\nFIG. 3A\n) and in transgenic mice expressing human ANGPTL4 [hAngptl4(+/+) mice; or “humanized ANGPTL4 mice”] (\nFIG. 3B\n).

It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present invention will be limited only by the appended claims.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, preferred methods and materials are now described. All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe term “human angiopoietin-like protein 4” or “hANGPTL4”, as used herein, refers to hANGPTL4 having the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:475 and the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:476, or a biologically active fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antibody”, as used herein, is intended to refer to immunoglobulin molecules comprised of four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (HCVR) and a heavy chain constant region (C\nH\n; comprised of \ndomains C\n \n \n \nH\n1, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and C\nH\n3). Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (LCVR) and a light chain constant region (C\nL\n). The HCVR and LCVR can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each HCVR and LCVR is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution of one or more CDR residues or omission of one or more CDRs is also possible. Antibodies have been described in the scientific literature in which one or two CDRs can be dispensed with for binding. Padlan et al. (1995 FASEB J. 9:133-139) analyzed the contact regions between antibodies and their antigens, based on published crystal structures, and concluded that only about one fifth to one third of CDR residues actually contact the antigen. Padlan also found many antibodies in which one or two CDRs had no amino acids in contact with an antigen (see also, Vajdos et al. 2002 J Mol Biol 320:415-428).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDR residues not contacting antigen can be identified based on previous studies (for example, residues H60-H65 in CDRH2 are often not required), from regions of Kabat CDRs lying outside Chothia CDRs, by molecular modeling and/or empirically. If a CDR or residue(s) thereof is omitted, it is usually substituted with an amino acid occupying the corresponding position in another human antibody sequence or a consensus of such sequences. Positions for substitution within CDRs and amino acids to substitute can also be selected empirically. Empirical substitutions can be conservative or non-conservative substitutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “human antibody”, as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human mAbs of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example in the CDRs and in particular CDR3. However, the term “human antibody”, as used herein, is not intended to include mAbs in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species (e.g., mouse), have been grafted onto human FR sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fully-human anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies disclosed herein may comprise one or more amino acid substitutions, insertions and/or deletions in the framework and/or CDR regions of the heavy and light chain variable domains as compared to the corresponding germline sequences. Such mutations can be readily ascertained by comparing the amino acid sequences disclosed herein to germline sequences available from, for example, public antibody sequence databases. The present invention includes antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments thereof, which are derived from any of the amino acid sequences disclosed herein, wherein one or more amino acids within one or more framework and/or CDR regions are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of the germline sequence from which the antibody was derived, or to the corresponding residue(s) of another human germline sequence, or to a conservative amino acid substitution of the corresponding germline residues(s) (such sequence changes are referred to herein collectively as “germline mutations”). A person of ordinary skill in the art, starting with the heavy and light chain variable region sequences disclosed herein, can easily produce numerous antibodies and antigen-binding fragments which comprise one or more individual germline back-mutations or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, all of the framework and/or CDR residues within the V\nH \nand/or V\nL \ndomains are mutated back to the residues found in the original germline sequence from which the antibody was derived. In other embodiments, only certain residues are mutated back to the original germline sequence, e.g., only the mutated residues found within the first 8 amino acids of FR1 or within the last 8 amino acids of FR4, or only the mutated residues found within CDR1, CDR2 or CDR3. In other embodiments, one or more of the framework and/or CDR residue(s) are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of a different germline sequence (i.e., a germline sequence that is different from the germline sequence from which the antibody was originally derived). Furthermore, the antibodies of the present invention may contain any combination of two or more germline mutations within the framework and/or CDR regions, e.g., wherein certain individual residues are mutated to the corresponding residues of a particular germline sequence while certain other residues that differ from the original germline sequence are maintained or are mutated to the corresponding residue of a different germline sequence. Once obtained, antibodies and antigen-binding fragments that contain one or more germline mutations can be easily tested for one or more desired property such as, improved binding specificity, increased binding affinity, improved or enhanced antagonistic or agonistic biological properties (as the case may be), reduced immunogenicity, etc. Antibodies and antigen-binding fragments obtained in this general manner are encompassed within the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes anti-ANGPTL4 antibodies comprising variants of any of the HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences disclosed herein having one or more conservative substitutions. For example, the present invention includes anti-ANGPTL4 antibodies having HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences with, e.g., 10 or fewer, 8 or fewer, 6 or fewer, 4 or fewer, 2 or 1, conservative amino acid substitution(s) relative to any of the HCVR, LCVR, and/or CDR amino acid sequences disclosed herein. In one embodiment, a HCVR comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:487 with 10 or fewer conservative amino acid substitutions therein. In another embodiment, a HCVR comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:487 with 8 or fewer conservative amino acid substitutions therein. In another embodiment, a HCVR comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:487 with 6 or fewer conservative amino acid substitutions therein. In another embodiment, a HCVR comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:487 with 4 or fewer conservative amino acid substitutions therein. In yet another embodiment, a HCVR comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:487 with 2 or 1 conservative amino acid substitution(s) therein. In one embodiment, a LCVR comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:44 with 10 or fewer conservative amino acid substitutions therein. In another embodiment, a LCVR comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:44 with 8 or fewer conservative amino acid substitutions therein. In another embodiment, a LCVR comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:44 with 6 or fewer conservative amino acid substitutions therein. In another embodiment, a LCVR comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:44 with 4 or fewer conservative amino acid substitutions therein. In yet another embodiment, a LCVR comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:44 with 2 or 1 conservative amino acid substitution(s) therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless specifically indicated otherwise, the term “antibody,” as used herein, shall be understood to encompass antibody molecules comprising two immunoglobulin heavy chains and two immunoglobulin light chains (i.e., “full antibody molecules”) as well as antigen-binding fragments thereof. The terms “antigen-binding portion” of an antibody, “antigen-binding fragment” of an antibody, and the like, as used herein, include any naturally occurring, enzymatically obtainable, synthetic, or genetically engineered polypeptide or glycoprotein that specifically binds an antigen to form a complex. Antigen-binding fragments of an antibody may be derived, e.g., from full antibody molecules using any suitable standard techniques such as proteolytic digestion or recombinant genetic engineering techniques involving the manipulation and expression of DNA encoding antibody variable and (optionally) constant domains. Such DNA is known and/or is readily available from, e.g., commercial sources, DNA libraries (including, e.g., phage-display antibody libraries), or can be synthesized. The DNA may be sequenced and manipulated chemically or by using molecular biology techniques, for example, to arrange one or more variable and/or constant domains into a suitable configuration, or to introduce codons, create cysteine residues, modify, add or delete amino acids, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-limiting examples of antigen-binding fragments include: (i) Fab fragments; (ii) F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments; (iii) Fd fragments; (iv) Fv fragments; (v) single-chain Fv (scFv) molecules; (vi) dAb fragments; and (vii) minimal recognition units consisting of the amino acid residues that mimic the hypervariable region of an antibody (e.g., an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR)). Other engineered molecules, such as diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies and minibodies, are also encompassed within the expression “antigen-binding fragment,” as used herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antigen-binding fragment of an antibody will typically comprise at least one variable domain. The variable domain may be of any size or amino acid composition and will generally comprise at least one CDR which is adjacent to or in frame with one or more framework sequences. In antigen-binding fragments having a V\nH \ndomain associated with a V\nL \ndomain, the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains may be situated relative to one another in any suitable arrangement. For example, the variable region may be dimeric and contain V\nH\n-V\nH\n, V\nH\n-V\nL \nor V\nL\n-V\nL \ndimers. Alternatively, the antigen-binding fragment of an antibody may contain a monomeric V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody may contain at least one variable domain covalently linked to at least one constant domain. Non-limiting, exemplary configurations of variable and constant domains that may be found within an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention include: (i) V\nH\n-\nC\n \n \n \nH\n1; (ii) V\nH\n-\nC\n \n \n \nH\n2; (iii) V\nH\n-C\nH\n3; (iv) V\nH\n-C\nH\n1-\nC\n \n \n \nH\n2; (v) V\nH\n-C\nH\n1-C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3; (vi) V\nH\n-C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3; (vii) V\nH\n-C\nL\n; (viii) V\nL\n-\nC\n \n \n \nH\n1; (ix) V\nL\n-\nC\n \n \n \nH\n2; (X) V\nL\n-C\nH\n3; (xi) V\nL\n-C\nH\n1-\nC\n \n \n \nH\n2; (xii) V\nL\n-C\nH\n1-C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3; (xiii) V\nL\n-C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3; and (xiv) V\nL\n-C\nL\n. In any configuration of variable and constant domains, including any of the exemplary configurations listed above, the variable and constant domains may be either directly linked to one another or may be linked by a full or partial hinge or linker region. A hinge region may consist of at least 2 (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60 or more) amino acids which result in a flexible or semi-flexible linkage between adjacent variable and/or constant domains in a single polypeptide molecule. Moreover, an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention may comprise a homo-dimer or hetero-dimer (or other multimer) of any of the variable and constant domain configurations listed above in non-covalent association with one another and/or with one or more monomeric V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomain (e.g., by disulfide bond(s)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs with full antibody molecules, antigen-binding fragments may be monospecific or multispecific (e.g., bispecific). A multispecific antigen-binding fragment of an antibody will typically comprise at least two different variable domains, wherein each variable domain is capable of specifically binding to a separate antigen or to a different epitope on the same antigen. Any multispecific antibody format, including the exemplary bispecific antibody formats disclosed herein, may be adapted for use in the context of an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention using routine techniques available in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, antibody or antibody fragments of the invention may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety (“immunoconjugate”), such as a cytotoxin, a chemotherapeutic drug, an immunosuppressant or a radioisotope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “specifically binds,” or the like, means that an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof forms a complex with an antigen that is relatively stable under physiological conditions. Specific binding can be characterized by an equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of about 1×10\n−6 \nM or less (i.e., a smaller K\nD \ndenotes a tighter binding). Methods for determining whether two molecules specifically bind are well known in the art and include, for example, equilibrium dialysis, surface plasmon resonance, and the like. An isolated antibody that specifically binds hANGPTL4 may, however, exhibit cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as ANGPTL4 molecules from other species, for example, cynomolgus monkey ANGPTL4, and/or hANGPTL3 having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:485. Moreover, multi-specific antibodies (e.g., bispecifics) that bind to hANGPTL4 and one or more additional antigens are nonetheless considered antibodies that “specifically bind” hANGPTL4, as used herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “high affinity” antibody refers to those antibodies having a binding affinity to hANGPTL4, expressed as K\nD\n, of about 1×10\n−9 \nM or less, about 0.5×10\n−9 \nM or less, about 0.25×10\n−9 \nM or less, about 1×10\n−10 \nM or less, or about 0.5×10\n−10 \nM or less, as measured by surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE™ or solution-affinity ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “K\nD\n”, as used herein, is intended to refer to the equilibrium dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the term “slow off rate”, “Koff” or “k\nd\n” is meant an antibody that dissociates from hANGPTL4 with a rate constant of 1×10\n−3 \ns\n−1 \nor less, preferably 1×10\n−4\ns\n−1 \nor less, as determined by surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE™\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the term “intrinsic affinity constant” or “k\na\n” is meant an antibody that associates with hANGPTL4 at a rate constant of about 1×10\n−3 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nor higher, as determined by surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE™\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “isolated antibody”, as used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody that is substantially free of other mAbs having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds hANGPTL4 is substantially free of mAbs that specifically bind antigens other than hANGPTL4). An isolated antibody that specifically binds hANGPTL4 may, however, have cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as ANGPTL4 molecules from other species, such as cynomolgus monkey, and/or other related proteins, such as human ANGPTL3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “neutralizing antibody”, as used herein (or an “antibody that neutralizes ANGPTL4 activity”), is intended to refer to an antibody whose binding to ANGPTL4 results in inhibition of at least one biological activity of ANGPTL4. This inhibition of the biological activity of ANGPTL4 can be assessed by measuring one or more indicators of ANGPTL4 biological activity by one or more of several standard in vitro or in vivo assays known in the art (also see examples below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “surface plasmon resonance”, as used herein, refers to an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BIACORE™ system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, N.J.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “epitope” is a region of an antigen that is bound by an antibody. Epitopes may be defined as structural or functional. Functional epitopes are generally a subset of the structural epitopes and have those residues that directly contribute to the affinity of the interaction. Epitopes may also be conformational, that is, composed of non-linear amino acids. In certain embodiments, epitopes may include determinants that are chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl groups, or sulfonyl groups, and, in certain embodiments, may have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “substantial identity” or “substantially identical,” when referring to a nucleic acid or fragment thereof, indicates that, when optimally aligned with appropriate nucleotide insertions or deletions with another nucleic acid (or its complementary strand), there is nucleotide sequence identity in at least about 90%, and more preferably at least about 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the nucleotide bases, as measured by any well-known algorithm of sequence identity, such as FASTA, BLAST or GAP, as discussed below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs applied to polypeptides, the term “substantial similarity” or “substantially similar” means that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 90% sequence identity, even more preferably at least 95%, 98% or 99% sequence identity. Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. A “conservative amino acid substitution” is one in which an amino acid residue is substituted by another amino acid residue having a side chain (R group) with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity). In general, a conservative amino acid substitution will not substantially change the functional properties of a protein. In cases where two or more amino acid sequences differ from each other by conservative substitutions, the percent or degree of similarity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., Pearson (1994) Methods Mol. Biol. 24: 307-331. Examples of groups of amino acids that have side chains with similar chemical properties include 1) aliphatic side chains: glycine, alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine; 2) aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains: serine and threonine; 3) amide-containing side chains: asparagine and glutamine; 4) aromatic side chains: phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; 5) basic side chains: lysine, arginine, and histidine; 6) acidic side chains: aspartate and glutamate, and 7) sulfur-containing side chains: cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamate-aspartate, and asparagine-glutamine. Alternatively, a conservative replacement is any change having a positive value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix disclosed in Gonnet et al. (1992) Science 256: 1443 45. A “moderately conservative” replacement is any change having a nonnegative value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequence similarity for polypeptides is typically measured using sequence analysis software. Protein analysis software matches similar sequences using measures of similarity assigned to various substitutions, deletions and other modifications, including conservative amino acid substitutions. For instance, GCG software contains programs such as GAP and BESTFIT which can be used with default parameters to determine sequence homology or sequence identity between closely related polypeptides, such as homologous polypeptides from different species of organisms or between a wild type protein and a mutein thereof. See, e.g., GCG Version 6.1. Polypeptide sequences also can be compared using FASTA with default or recommended parameters; a program in GCG Version 6.1. FASTA (e.g., FASTA2 and FASTA3) provides alignments and percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and search sequences (Pearson (2000) supra). Another preferred algorithm when comparing a sequence of the invention to a database containing a large number of sequences from different organisms is the computer program BLAST, especially BLASTP or TBLASTN, using default parameters. See, e.g., Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403 410 and (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389 402.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the phrase “therapeutically effective amount” is meant an amount that produces the desired effect for which it is administered. The exact amount will depend on the purpose of the treatment, the age and the size of a subject treated, the route of administration, and the like, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques (see, for example, Lloyd (1999) The Art, Science and Technology of Pharmaceutical Compounding).\n\n\n \nPreparation of Human Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods for generating human antibodies in transgenic mice are known in the art. Any such known methods can be used in the context of the present invention to make human antibodies that specifically bind to ANGPTL4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing VELOCIMMUNE™ technology or any other known method for generating monoclonal antibodies, high affinity chimeric antibodies to ANGPTL4 are initially isolated having a human variable region and a mouse constant region. As in the experimental section below, the antibodies are characterized and selected for desirable characteristics, including affinity, selectivity, epitope, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the antibodies of the instant invention possess very high affinities, typically possessing K\nD \nof from about 10\n−12 \nM through about 10\n−9 \nM, when measured by binding to antigen either immobilized on solid phase or in solution phase. The mouse constant regions are replaced with desired human constant regions, for example, wild-type IgG1 (SEQ ID NO:481) or IgG4 (SEQ ID NO:482), or modified IgG1 or IgG4 (for example, SEQ ID NO:483), to generate the fully human antibodies of the invention. While the constant region selected may vary according to specific use, high affinity antigen-binding and target specificity characteristics of the antibodies reside in the variable region.\n\n\n \nEpitope Mapping and Related Technologies\n\n\n \n \n \nTo screen for antibodies that bind to a particular epitope, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in \nAntibodies\n, Harlow and Lane (Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harb., NY) can be performed. Other methods include alanine scanning mutants, peptide blots (Reineke (2004) Methods Mol Biol 248:443-63), or peptide cleavage analysis. In addition, methods such as epitope excision, epitope extraction and chemical modification of antigens can be employed (Tomer (2000) Protein Science 9: 487-496).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “epitope” refers to a site on an antigen to which B and/or T cells respond. B-cell epitopes can be formed both from contiguous amino acids or noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of a protein. Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids are typically retained on exposure to denaturing solvents, whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding are typically lost on treatment with denaturing solvents. An epitope typically includes at least 3, and more usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModification-Assisted Profiling (MAP), also known as Antigen Structure-based Antibody Profiling (ASAP) is a method that categorizes large numbers of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the same antigen according to the similarities of the binding profile of each antibody to chemically or enzymatically modified antigen surfaces (US 2004/0101920). Each category may reflect a unique epitope either distinctly different from or partially overlapping with epitope represented by another category. This technology allows rapid filtering of genetically identical mAbs, such that characterization can be focused on genetically distinct mAbs. When applied to hybridoma screening, MAP may facilitate identification of rare hybridoma clones that produce mAbs having the desired characteristics. MAP may be used to sort the anti-ANGPTL4 mAbs of the invention into groups of mAbs binding different epitopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nANGPTL4 contains an amino-terminal coiled-coil domain and a carboxyl-terminal fibrinogen like domain and the full-length ANGPTL4 protein forms an oligomer held by intermolecular disulfide bonds (Ge et al., 2004\n, J Bio Chem \n279(3):2038-2045). It has been reported that the N-terminal coiled-coil domain mediates ANGPTL4's oligomerization (Ge et al., supra) and is also important in the inhibition of LPL activity (Ge et al., 2005\n, J Lipid Res \n46:1484-1490; and Ono et al., 2003\n, J Biol Chem \n278:41804-41809). Thus, in certain embodiments, the anti-hANGPTL4 antibody or antigen-binding fragment of an antibody binds an epitope within the N-terminal coiled-coil domain (residues 1-123) of hANGPTL4 (SEQ ID NO:476). In certain embodiments, anti-hANGPTL4 antibody or fragment thereof binds an epitope within the region from about \nresidue\n 1 to about \nresidue\n 25, from about \nresidue\n 25 to about \nresidue\n 50, from about \nresidue\n 50 to about \nresidue\n 75, from about \nresidue\n 75 to about \nresidue\n 100, from about \nresidue\n 100 to about residue 125, from about residue 125 to about residue 150, of hANGPTL4 (SEQ ID NO:476). In some embodiments, the antibody or antibody fragment binds an epitope which includes more than one of the enumerated epitopes within the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of hANGPTL4. In other embodiments, hANGPTL4 antibody or fragment thereof binds one or more fragments of hANGPTL4, for example, a fragment from residues 26 to 406, from residues 26 to 148, from residues 34 to 66, and/or residues 165 to 406, of SEQ ID NO:476.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes hANGPTL4 antibodies that bind to the same epitope as any of the specific exemplary antibodies described herein. Likewise, the present invention also includes anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies that compete for binding to hANGPTL4 or a hANGPTL4 fragment with any of the specific exemplary antibodies described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne can easily determine whether an antibody binds to the same epitope as, or competes for binding with, a reference anti-hANGPTL4 antibody by using routine methods known in the art. For example, to determine if a test antibody binds to the same epitope as a reference anti-hANGPTL4 antibody of the invention, the reference antibody is allowed to bind to a hANGPTL4 protein or peptide under saturating conditions. Next, the ability of a test antibody to bind to the hANGPTL4 molecule is assessed. If the test antibody is able to bind to hANGPTL4 following saturation binding with the reference anti-hANGPTL4 antibody, it can be concluded that the test antibody binds to a different epitope than the reference anti-hANGPTL4 antibody. On the other hand, if the test antibody is not able to bind to the hANGPTL4 molecule following saturation binding with the reference anti-hANGPTL4 antibody, then the test antibody may bind to the same epitope as the epitope bound by the reference anti-hANGPTL4 antibody of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine if an antibody competes for binding with a reference anti-hANGPTL4 antibody, the above-described binding methodology is performed in two orientations: In a first orientation, the reference antibody is allowed to bind to a hANGPTL4 molecule under saturating conditions followed by assessment of binding of the test antibody to the hANGPTL4 molecule. In a second orientation, the test antibody is allowed to bind to a hANGPTL4 molecule under saturating conditions followed by assessment of binding of the reference antibody to the ANGPTL4 molecule. If, in both orientations, only the first (saturating) antibody is capable of binding to the ANGPTL4 molecule, then it is concluded that the test antibody and the reference antibody compete for binding to hANGPTL4. As will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art, an antibody that competes for binding with a reference antibody may not necessarily bind to the identical epitope as the reference antibody, but may sterically block binding of the reference antibody by binding an overlapping or adjacent epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo antibodies bind to the same or overlapping epitope if each competitively inhibits (blocks) binding of the other to the antigen. That is, a 1-, 5-, 10-, 20- or 100-fold excess of one antibody inhibits binding of the other by at least 50% but preferably 75%, 90% or even 99% as measured in a competitive binding assay (see, e.g., Junghans et al., Cancer Res, 1990:50:1495-1502). Alternatively, two antibodies have the same epitope if essentially all amino acid mutations in the antigen that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other. Two antibodies have overlapping epitopes if some amino acid mutations that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional routine experimentation (e.g., peptide mutation and binding analyses) can then be carried out to confirm whether the observed lack of binding of the test antibody is in fact due to binding to the same epitope as the reference antibody or if steric blocking (or another phenomenon) is responsible for the lack of observed binding. Experiments of this sort can be performed using ELISA, RIA, surface plasmon resonance, flow cytometry or any other quantitative or qualitative antibody-binding assay available in the art.\n\n\n \nImmunoconjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention encompasses a human anti-ANGPTL4 monoclonal antibody conjugated to a therapeutic moiety (“immunoconjugate”), such as a cytotoxin, a chemotherapeutic drug, an immunosuppressant or a radioisotope. Cytotoxin agents include any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples of suitable cytotoxin agents and chemotherapeutic agents for forming immunoconjugates are known in the art, see for example, WO 05/103081.\n\n\n \nBispecifics\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention may be monospecific, bispecific, or multispecific. Multispecific mAbs may be specific for different epitopes of one target polypeptide or may contain antigen-binding domains specific for more than one target polypeptide. See, e.g., Tutt et al. (1991) J. Immunol. 147:60-69. The human anti-hANGPTL4 mAbs can be linked to or co-expressed with another functional molecule, e.g., another peptide or protein. For example, an antibody or fragment thereof can be functionally linked (e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other molecular entities, such as another antibody or antibody fragment, to produce a bispecific or a multispecific antibody with a second binding specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary bi-specific antibody format that can be used in the context of the present invention involves the use of a first immunoglobulin (Ig) C\nH\n3 domain and a second Ig C\nH\n3 domain, wherein the first and second Ig C\nH\n3 domains differ from one another by at least one amino acid, and wherein at least one amino acid difference reduces binding of the bispecific antibody to Protein A as compared to a bi-specific antibody lacking the amino acid difference. In one embodiment, the first Ig C\nH\n3 domain binds Protein A and the second Ig C\nH\n3 domain contains a mutation that reduces or abolishes Protein A binding such as an H95R modification (by IMGT exon numbering; H435R by EU numbering). The second C\nH\n3 may further comprise a Y96F modification (by IMGT; Y436F by EU). Further modifications that may be found within the second C\nH\n3 include: D16E, L18M, N44S, K52N, V57M, and V821 (by IMGT; D356E, L358M, N384S, K392N, V397M, and V4221 by EU) in the case of IgG1 antibodies; N44S, K52N, and V821 (IMGT; N384S, K392N, and V422I by EU) in the case of IgG2 antibodies; and Q15R, N44S, K52N, V57M, R69K, E79Q, and V82I (by IMGT; Q355R, N384S, K392N, V397M, R409K, E419Q, and V4221 by EU) in the case of IgG4 antibodies. Variations on the bi-specific antibody format described above are contemplated within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \nBioequivalents\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies and antibody fragments of the present invention encompass proteins having amino acid sequences that vary from those of the described mAbs, but that retain the ability to bind human ANGPTL4. Such variant mAbs and antibody fragments comprise one or more additions, deletions, or substitutions of amino acids when compared to parent sequence, but exhibit biological activity that is essentially equivalent to that of the described mAbs. Likewise, the hANGPTL4 antibody-encoding DNA sequences of the present invention encompass sequences that comprise one or more additions, deletions, or substitutions of nucleotides when compared to the disclosed sequence, but that encode an anti-hANGPTL4 antibody or antibody fragment that is essentially bioequivalent to an anti-hANGPTL4 antibody or antibody fragment of the invention. Examples of such variant amino acid and DNA sequences are discussed above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo antigen-binding proteins, or antibodies, are considered bioequivalent if, for example, they are pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives whose rate and extent of absorption do not show a significant difference when administered at the same molar dose under similar experimental conditions, either single does or multiple dose. Some antibodies will be considered equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives if they are equivalent in the extent of their absorption but not in their rate of absorption and yet may be considered bioequivalent because such differences in the rate of absorption are intentional and are reflected in the labeling, are not essential to the attainment of effective body drug concentrations on, e.g., chronic use, and are considered medically insignificant for the particular drug product studied. In one embodiment, two antigen-binding proteins are bioequivalent if there are no clinically meaningful differences in their safety, purity, and potency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, two antigen-binding proteins are bioequivalent if a patient can be switched one or more times between the reference product and the biological product without an expected increase in the risk of adverse effects, including a clinically significant change in immunogenicity, or diminished effectiveness, as compared to continued therapy without such switching.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, two antigen-binding proteins are bioequivalent if they both act by a common mechanism or mechanisms of action for the condition or conditions of use, to the extent that such mechanisms are known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBioequivalence may be demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro methods. Bioequivalence measures include, e.g., (a) an in vivo test in humans or other mammals, in which the concentration of the antibody or its metabolites is measured in blood, plasma, serum, or other biological fluid as a function of time; (b) an in vitro test that has been correlated with and is reasonably predictive of human in vivo bioavailability data; (c) an in vivo test in humans or other mammals in which the appropriate acute pharmacological effect of the antibody (or its target) is measured as a function of time; and (d) in a well-controlled clinical trial that establishes safety, efficacy, or bioavailability or bioequivalence of an antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBioequivalent variants of anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies of the invention may be constructed by, for example, making various substitutions of residues or sequences or deleting terminal or internal residues or sequences not needed for biological activity. For example, cysteine residues not essential for biological activity can be deleted or replaced with other amino acids to prevent formation of unnecessary or incorrect intramolecular disulfide bridges upon renaturation.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Administration and Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides therapeutic compositions comprising the anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof of the present invention and the therapeutic methods using the same. The administration of therapeutic compositions in accordance with the invention will be administered with suitable carriers, excipients, and other agents that are incorporated into formulations to provide improved transfer, delivery, tolerance, and the like. A multitude of appropriate formulations can be found in the formulary known to all pharmaceutical chemists: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. These formulations include, for example, powders, pastes, ointments, jellies, waxes, oils, lipids, lipid (cationic or anionic) containing vesicles (such as LIPOFECTIN™), DNA conjugates, anhydrous absorption pastes, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, emulsions carbowax (polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights), semi-solid gels, and semi-solid mixtures containing carbowax. See also Powell et al. “Compendium of excipients for parenteral formulations” PDA (1998) J Pharm Sci Technol 52:238-311.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose may vary depending upon the age and the size of a subject to be administered, target disease, the purpose of the treatment, conditions, route of administration, and the like. When the antibody of the present invention is used for treating various conditions and diseases directly or indirectly associated with ANGPTL4, including hypercholesterolemia, disorders associated with LDL and apolipoprotein B, and lipid metabolism disorders, and the like, in an adult patient, it is advantageous to intravenously or subcutaneously administer the antibody of the present invention at a single dose of about 0.01 to about 20 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.02 to about 7, about 0.03 to about 5, or about 0.05 to about 3 mg/kg body weight. Depending on the severity of the condition, the frequency and the duration of the treatment can be adjusted. In certain embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention can be administered as an initial dose of at least about 0.1 mg to about 800 mg, about 1 to about 500 mg, about 5 to about 300 mg, or about 10 to about 200 mg, to about 100 mg, or to about 50 mg. In certain embodiments, the initial dose may be followed by administration of a second or a plurality of subsequent doses of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof in an amount that can be approximately the same or less than that of the initial dose, wherein the subsequent doses are separated by at least 1 day to 3 days; at least one week, at least 2 weeks; at least 3 weeks; at least 4 weeks; at least 5 weeks; at least 6 weeks; at least 7 weeks; at least 8 weeks; at least 9 weeks; at least 10 weeks; at least 12 weeks; or at least 14 weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the pharmaceutical composition of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the mutant viruses, receptor mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu et al. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432). Methods of introduction include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The composition may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition can be also delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer (1990) Science 249:1527-1533; Treat et al. (1989) in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365; Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327; see generally ibid.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain situations, the pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton (1987) CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used; see, Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974). In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the composition's target, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138, 1984).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe injectable preparations may include dosage forms for intravenous, subcutaneous, intracutaneous and intramuscular injections, drip infusions, etc. These injectable preparations may be prepared by methods publicly known. For example, the injectable preparations may be prepared, e.g., by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying the antibody or its salt described above in a sterile aqueous medium or an oily medium conventionally used for injections. As the aqueous medium for injections, there are, for example, physiological saline, an isotonic solution containing glucose and other auxiliary agents, etc., which may be used in combination with an appropriate solubilizing agent such as an alcohol (e.g., ethanol), a polyalcohol (e.g., propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol), a nonionic surfactant [e.g., \npolysorbate\n 80, HCO-50 (polyoxyethylene (50 mol) adduct of hydrogenated castor oil)], etc. As the oily medium, there are employed, e.g., sesame oil, soybean oil, etc., which may be used in combination with a solubilizing agent such as benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, etc. The injection thus prepared is preferably filled in an appropriate ampoule. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be delivered subcutaneously or intravenously with a standard needle and syringe. In addition, with respect to subcutaneous delivery, a pen delivery device readily has applications in delivering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Such a pen delivery device can be reusable or disposable. A reusable pen delivery device generally utilizes a replaceable cartridge that contains a pharmaceutical composition. Once all of the pharmaceutical composition within the cartridge has been administered and the cartridge is empty, the empty cartridge can readily be discarded and replaced with a new cartridge that contains the pharmaceutical composition. The pen delivery device can then be reused. In a disposable pen delivery device, there is no replaceable cartridge. Rather, the disposable pen delivery device comes prefilled with the pharmaceutical composition held in a reservoir within the device. Once the reservoir is emptied of the pharmaceutical composition, the entire device is discarded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous reusable pen and autoinjector delivery devices have applications in the subcutaneous delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Examples include, but certainly are not limited to AUTOPEN™ (Owen Mumford, Inc., Woodstock, UK), DISETRONIC™ pen (Disetronic Medical Systems, Burghdorf, Switzerland), \nHUMALOG MIX\n 75/25™ pen, HUMALOG™ pen, \nHUMALIN\n 70/30™ pen (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, Ind.), NOVOPEN™ I, II and III (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark), NOVOPEN JUNIOR™ (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark), BD™ pen (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.), OPTIPENT™, OPTIPEN PRO™, OPTIPEN STARLET™, and OPTICLIK™ (sanofi-aventis, Frankfurt, Germany), to name only a few. Examples of disposable pen delivery devices having applications in subcutaneous delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention include, but certainly are not limited to the SOLOSTAR™ pen (sanofi-aventis), the FLEXPEN™ (Novo Nordisk), and the KWIKPEN™ (Eli Lilly).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdvantageously, the pharmaceutical compositions for oral or parenteral use described above are prepared into dosage forms in a unit dose suited to fit a dose of the active ingredients. Such dosage forms in a unit dose include, for example, tablets, pills, capsules, injections (ampoules), suppositories, etc. The amount of the aforesaid antibody contained is generally about 0.1 to about 800 mg per dosage form in a unit dose; especially in the form of injection, the aforesaid antibody is contained in about 1 to about 500 mg, in about 5 to 300 mg, in about 8 to 200 mg, and in about 10 to about 100 mg for the other dosage forms.\n\n\n \nCombination Therapies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention further provides therapeutic methods for treating diseases or disorders, which is directly or indirectly associated with hANGPTL4, by administering the hANGPTL4 antibody or fragment thereof of the invention in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents. The additional therapeutic agent may be one or more of any agent that is advantageously combined with the antibody or fragment thereof of the invention, including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, such as cerovastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, pitavastin, ros uvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and the like; niacin; various fibrates, such as fenofibrate, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, clofibrate, gemfibrozil, and the like; LXR transcription factor activators, and the like. Furthermore, the hANGPTL4 antibody or fragment thereof of the invention can be co-administered with other ANGPTL4 inhibitors as well as inhibitors of other molecules, such as ANGPTL3, ANGPTL5, ANGPTL6 and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which are involved in lipid metabolism, in particular, cholesterol and/or triglyceride homeostasis. Inhibitors of these molecules include small molecules and antibodies that specifically bind to these molecules and block their activity (see, for example, anti-PCSK9 antibodies disclosed in U.S. 2010/0166768 A1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the additional therapeutic agent may be one or more anti-cancer agents, such as chemotherapeutic agents, anti-angiogenic agents, growth inhibitory agents, cytotoxic agents, apoptotic agents, and other agents well known in the art to treat cancer or other proliferative diseases or disorders. Examples of anti-cancer agents include, but are not limited to, an anti-mitotic agent, such as docetaxel, paclitaxel, and the like; a platinum-based chemotherapeutic compound, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, iproplatin, oxaliplatin, and the like; or other conventional cytotoxic agent, such as 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, irinotecan, leucovorin, gemcitabine, and the like, and anti-angiogenic agents, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonists, such as anti-VEGF antibodies, e.g., bevacizumab (AVASTIN®, Genentech) and a receptor-based blocker of VEGF, e.g., “VEGF trap” described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,070,959, delta-like ligand 4 (DII4) antagonists, such as anti-DII4 antibodies as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0181899, and a fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of DII4, e.g., DII4-Fc as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0107648; inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases and/or angiogenesis, including sorafenib (NEXAVAR® by Bayer Pharmaceuticals Corp.), sunitinib (SUTENT® by Pfizer), pazopanib (VOTRIENT™ by GlaxoSmithKline), toceranib (PALLADIA™ by Pfizer), vandetanib (ZACTIMA™ by AstraZeneca), cediranib (RECENTIN® by AstraZeneca), regorafenib (BAY 73-4506 by Bayer), axitinib (AG013736 by Pfizer), lestaurtinib (CEP-701 by Cephalon), erlotinib (TARCEVA® by Genentech), gefitinib (IRESSA™ by AstraZeneca), BIBW 2992 (TOVOK™ by Boehringer Ingelheim), lapatinib (TYKERB® by GlaxoSmithKline), neratinib (HKI-272 by Wyeth/Pfizer), and the like, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, acids or derivatives of any of the above. In addition, other therapeutic agents, such as analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as Cox-2 inhibitors, and the like, may be also co-administered with the hANGPTL4 antibody or fragment thereof of the invention so as to ameliorate and/or reduce the symptoms accompanying the underlying cancer/tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hANGPTL4 antibody or fragment thereof of the invention and the additional therapeutic agent(s) can be co-administered together or separately. Where separate dosage formulations are used, the antibody or fragment thereof of the invention and the additional agents can be administered concurrently, or separately at staggered times, i.e., sequentially, in appropriate orders.\n\n\n \nDiagnostic Uses of the Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-ANGPTL4 antibodies of the present invention can be also used to detect and/or measure ANGPTL4 in a sample, e.g., for diagnostic purposes. For example, an anti-ANGPTL4 Ab or fragment thereof, can be used to diagnose a condition or disease characterized by aberrant expression (e.g., over-expression, under-expression, lack of expression, etc.) of ANGPTL4. Exemplary diagnostic assays for ANGPTL4 may comprise, e.g., contacting a sample obtained from a patient, with an anti-ANGPTL4 Ab of the invention, wherein the anti-ANGPTL4 antibody is labeled with a detectable label or reporter molecule or used to selectively capture and isolate ANGPTL4 protein from patient samples. Alternatively, an unlabeled anti-ANGPTL4 Ab can be used in diagnostic applications in combination with a secondary antibody which is itself detectably labeled. The detectable label or reporter molecule can be a radioisotope, such as \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n131\nI or \n125\nI; a fluorescent or chemiluminescent moiety, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, or rhodamine; or an enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, horseradish peroxidase, or luciferase. Assays that can be used to detect or measure ANGPTL4 in a sample include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and the like.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the methods and compositions of the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers used but some experimental errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, molecular weight is average molecular weight, temperature is in degrees Centigrade, and pressure is at or near atmospheric.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nGeneration of Human Antibodies to Human ANGPTL4\n\n\n \n \n \nVELOCIMMUNE™ mice were immunized with human ANGPTL4, and the antibody immune response monitored by antigen-specific immunoassay using serum obtained from these mice. Anti-hANGPTL4 expressing B cells were harvested from the spleens of immunized mice shown to have elevated anti-hANGPTL4 antibody titers and were fused with mouse myeloma cells to form hybridomas. The hybridomas were screened and selected to identify cell lines expressing hANGPTL4-specific antibodies using assays as described below. The assays identified several cell lines that produced chimeric anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies designated as H1M222, H1M223, H1M224, H1M225, H1M234 and H1M236.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman ANGPTL4-specific antibodies were also isolated directly from antigen-immunized B cells without fusion to myeloma cells, as described in U.S. 2007/0280945 A1. Heavy and light chain variable regions were cloned to generate fully human anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies designated as H1H257, H1H268, H1H283, H1H284, H1H285, H1H291, H1H292, H1H295, H1H624, H1H637, H1H638, H1H644 and H1H653. Stable recombinant antibody-expressing CHO cell lines were established.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nVariable Gene Utilization Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nTo analyze the structure of antibodies produced, the nucleic acids encoding antibody variable regions were cloned and sequenced. From the nucleic acid sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of the antibodies, gene usage was identified for each Heavy Chain Variable Region (HCVR) and Light Chain Variable Region (LCVR).

Thus, N, P and L variants of a particular antibody have identical CDR sequences within their heavy and light chain variable regions but contain modifications within the framework regions.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHCVR/LCVR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nName\n\n\nSEQ ID NOs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M222N\n\n\n314/322\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M223N\n\n\n410/418\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M224N\n\n\n338/346\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M225N\n\n\n362/370\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M234N\n\n\n434/442\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M236N\n\n\n386/394\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H236N2\n\n\n458/394\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H257N\n\n\n 2/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H268N\n\n\n26/34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H283N\n\n\n50/58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H284N\n\n\n74/82\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H285N\n\n\n 98/106\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H291N\n\n\n122/130\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H292N\n\n\n146/154\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H295N\n\n\n170/178\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H624N\n\n\n194/202\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H637N\n\n\n218/226\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H638N\n\n\n242/250\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H644N\n\n\n266/274\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H653N\n\n\n290/298\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M222P\n\n\n330/332\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M223P\n\n\n426/428\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M224P\n\n\n354/356\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M225P\n\n\n378/380\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M234P\n\n\n450/452\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M236P\n\n\n402/404\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H236P2\n\n\n466/404\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H257P\n\n\n18/20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H268P\n\n\n42/44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH4H268P2\n\n\n487/44 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H283P\n\n\n66/68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H284P\n\n\n90/92\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H285P\n\n\n114/116\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H291P\n\n\n138/140\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H292P\n\n\n162/164\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H295P\n\n\n186/188\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H624P\n\n\n210/212\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H637P\n\n\n234/236\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H638P\n\n\n258/260\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H644P\n\n\n282/284\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H653P\n\n\n306/308\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M222L\n\n\n334/336\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M223L\n\n\n430/432\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M224L\n\n\n358/360\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M225L\n\n\n382/384\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M234L\n\n\n454/456\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1M236L\n\n\n406/408\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H236L2\n\n\n468/408\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H257L\n\n\n22/24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H268L\n\n\n46/48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H283L\n\n\n70/72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H284L\n\n\n94/96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H285L\n\n\n118/120\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H291L\n\n\n142/144\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H292L\n\n\n166/168\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H295L\n\n\n190/192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H624L\n\n\n214/216\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H637L\n\n\n238/240\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H638L\n\n\n262/264\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H644L\n\n\n286/288\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H653L\n\n\n310/312\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nhANGPTL4 Binding Affinity Determination\n\n\n \n \n \nEquilibrium dissociation constants (K\nD \nvalues) for antigen binding to selected antibodies that bind amino acid residues 26-148 of human ANGPTL4 fused in-line to mouse IgG2a (hANGPTL4-mFc; SEQ ID NO:480) were determined by surface kinetics using a real-time biosensor surface plasmon resonance assay (BIACORE™ T100). hANGPTL4-mFc was captured with goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (GE Healthcare) that was chemically coupled to a BIACORE™ chip through free amino groups. Varying concentrations (ranging from 12.5 nM to 50 nM) of anti-ANGPTL4 antibodies were injected over the captured antigen surface for 90 seconds. Antigen-antibody binding and dissociation were monitored in real time at 25° C. and 37° C. Kinetic analysis was performed to calculate K\nD \nand half-life of antigen/antibody complex dissociation. Results are shown in Table 3. A human anti-EGFR antibody was used as a negative control, which showed no binding to the captured hANGPTL4-mFc.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n25° C.\n\n\n \n\n\n37° C.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\nK\nD \n(pM)\n\n\nt\n1/2 \n(min)\n\n\nK\nD \n(pM)\n\n\nt\n1/2 \n(min)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H257P\n\n\n201\n\n\n91\n\n\n238\n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H268P\n\n\n275\n\n\n80\n\n\n389\n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H283P\n\n\n130\n\n\n119\n\n\n1360\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H284P\n\n\n168\n\n\n162\n\n\n349\n\n\n81\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H285P\n\n\n92.5\n\n\n156\n\n\n194\n\n\n71\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H291P\n\n\n87.6\n\n\n303\n\n\n178\n\n\n122\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H292P\n\n\n136\n\n\n112\n\n\n167\n\n\n88\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H295P\n\n\n30.7\n\n\n874\n\n\n2620\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H624P\n\n\n1190\n\n\n7\n\n\n3710\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H638P\n\n\n193\n\n\n85\n\n\n299\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H644P\n\n\n111\n\n\n144\n\n\n3000\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H653P\n\n\n411\n\n\n43\n\n\n2130\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor H1H268P and H1H284P, Fab fragments were prepared by papain digestion and purified by standard purification methods, and their binding affinities to hANGPTL4 were measured at 25° C. at pH 7.2 and pH 5.75 using the BIACORE™ system, essentially according to the method described above. Briefly, various concentrations (3.125 nM-100 nM) of anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies (i.e., H1H268 Fab, entire H1H268 mAb, H1H284 Fab, and entire H1H284 mAb) were injected over a low density anti-mFc captured hANGPTL4(26-148)-mFc (−68±4 RU) surface, or the surface of amino-coupled hANGPTL4(26-406)-His (R&D Systems) (450 RU) or amino-coupled cynomolgus monkey N-terminal region (amino acid residues 1-130 of SEQ ID NO:490) expressed with an C-terminal hexa-histidine tag (MfANGPTL4(1-130)-His) (1,028 RU). Kinetic analysis was performed to measure k\na \nand k\nd\n, and K\nD \nvalues and half-life of antigen/antibody complex dissociation were calculated.

Briefly, anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies as well as negative controls, i.e., two monoclonal antibodies (Control a and Control b) that are non-binders to any ANGPTL proteins, were injected at 3.125 μg/mL-50 μg/mL over amine coupled chip surfaces of hANGPTL3-His (R&D Systems, cat #3829-AN) at 5228 RU, hANGPTL4-His (R&D Systems, cat #4487-AN) at 6247 RU, hANGPTL5-His (Abnova Corp., cat #H00253935-P01) at 5265 RU, and mANGPTL4-His [R26-S410 of mANGPTL4 (SEQ ID NO: 478) fused with an AS linker to a C-terminal 6-histidine tag] at 5233 RU, respectively.

Briefly, H1H268P (1348±11 RU) and H1H284P (868±13 RU) were captured over anti-human Fc surface and various concentrations (62.5 nM-500 nM) of the hANGPTL3 and hANGPTL4 peptides were injected. The peptides tested were hANGPTL4 (R34-L66 of SEQ ID NO:476), N-terminally biotinylated hANGPTL4 (R34-L66 of SEQ ID NO:476), hANGPTL3 (R36-I68 of SEQ ID NO:485), and N-terminally biotinylated hANGPTL3 (R36-I68 of SEQ ID NO:485).

In addition, H1H284P did not bind to any of the hANGPTL4 peptides even at the highest peptide concentration tested (500 nM), while H1H268P was able to bind to both hANGPTL4 peptides. This suggests that H1H268P recognizes a linear epitope within the 34-66 region. In contrast, H1H284P either binds outside this region or does not recognize a linear epitope in this region.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nInhibition of hANGPTL4 by Anti-ANGPTL4 Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nLipoprotein Lipase (LPL) plays a critical role in lipid metabolism in humans. LPL catalyzes hydrolysis of triglycerides and releases fatty acids to be metabolized. ANGPTL4 inhibits LPL activity leading to increased level of lipids (Oike et al., 2005\n, Trends in Molecular Medicine \n11(10):473-479). The N-terminal coiled-coil region of ANGPTL4 undergoes homo-multimerization, both in isolation and when joined to the C-terminal fibrinogen-like region. The N-terminal region also inhibits LPL when expressed without the C-terminal fibrinogen region. A cell-free bioassay was developed to determine the ability of selected anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies to inhibit ANGPTL4-induced decrease in LPL activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of hANGPTL4 activity by selected anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies was determined using the CONFLUOLIP™ Continuous Fluorometric Lipase Test (Progen, Germany) using two hANGPTL4 proteins: full-length hANGPTL4 (i.e., amino acid residues 26-406 of SEQ ID NO:476) with a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag (hANGPTL4-His; R&D Systems, MN) and hANGPTL4-mFc (SEQ ID NO:480) containing the N-terminal coiled-coil region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, 2 nM bovine LPL, 0.25 μM human ApoCII (a cofactor of LPL), 2 mg/mL BSA and 1.6 mM CaCl\n2\n, were premixed in a 96-well assay plate. Either hANGPTL4-His or hANGPTL4-mFc protein was added to the Apo/LPL mixture to a final concentration of 10 nM and 2 nM, respectively. The Apo/LPL/ANGPTL4 protein mixtures were then added together with serially diluted anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies with a starting concentration of 300 nM (for inhibition of hANGPTL4-His) or 100 nM (for inhibition of hANGPTL4-mFc) and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes (\nfinal volume\n 50 μl). Following the incubation, 200 μl of reconstituted lipase substrate, 1-trinitrophenyl-amino-dodecanoyl-2-pyrendecanoyl-3-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycerol (LS-A, Progen), was added to the antibody mixture and incubated at 37° C. for two hours. Fluorescence was then measured at 342 nm/400 nm (excitation/emission) using a FlexStation® 3 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, CA). Fluorescence is directly proportional to LPL activity. Results are shown in Table 8. Control I: a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for hANGPTL4 (BioVendor). Control II: an irrelevant human antibody that does not bind hANGPTL4. NT: not tested. The total inhibition (i.e., 100% inhibition) was determined from the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) of the assay with 2 nM bovine LPL, 0.25 μM human ApoCII, 2 mg/mL BSA and 1.6 mM CaCl\n2\n, in the absence of anti-ANGPTL4 antibodies and ANGPTL4 proteins.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n% Inhibition of hANGPTL4 Activity\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nhANGPTL4-mFc\n\n\nhANGPTL4-His\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n(2 nM)\n\n\n(10 nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H236N2\n\n\n13\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H257P\n\n\n16\n\n\nNT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H268P\n\n\n76\n\n\n80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H284P\n\n\n82\n\n\n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H285P\n\n\n28\n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H292P\n\n\n20\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H624P\n\n\n62\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH1H653P\n\n\n55\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nControl I\n\n\n29\n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nControl II\n\n\nNo inhibition\n\n\nNo inhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies H1H284P and H1H268P exhibited the highest inhibition of ANGPTL4's inhibitory activity against LPL among the antibodies tested, including the polyclonal hANGPTL4 antibody control. For antibodies H1H284P and H1H268P, the antibody concentrations required for 50% maximum inhibition (1050) of 2 nM hANGPTL4-mFc were determined to be 0.8 nM and 1.2 nM, respectively. In addition, the antibody concentrations required for 50% maximum inhibition of 10 nM hANGPTL4-His were determined to be 0.5 nM and 0.2 nM, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, H1H284P and H1H268P were tested in the LPL bioassay for their ability to inhibit cross-species orthologs: the cynomolgus monkey N-terminal region (amino acid residues 26-148) expressed with an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag (His-MfANGPTL4; SEQ ID NO:488) and the mouse full-length ortholog (amino acid residues 26-410 of SEQ ID NO:478) with a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag (mANGPTL4-His). A full dose-response using the ANGPTL4 protein in the LPL assay was first performed to determine the ANGPTL4 EC50 for each experiment and 1050 determinations for each antibody were then performed using constant concentrations of ANGPTL4 protein, as shown in Table 9. Antibody concentrations ranged from 0 to 100 nM.

Briefly, C57BL/6 mice were put into four groups of five animals and each group was administered with different amount of hANGPTL4-mFc protein (SEQ ID NO:480): 25 μg, 50 μg, 100 μg and 300 μg, per mouse. A control group received injections of PBS. hANGPTL4-mFc protein and PBS were administered by intravenous injection (i.v.) via tail vein. Mice were bled at 15 min, 30 min, 60 min and 120 min after delivery of hANGPTL4-mFc or PBS and plasma lipid levels were determined by ADVIA® 1650 Chemistry System (Siemens). Measurements of triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA-C) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) were determined for each dose group. Measurements of total cholesterol, LDL, NEFA-C and HDL were not significantly different across each dose group for each time point post-injection. Injection of 25 μg/mouse of hANGPTL4-mFc increased circulating triglycerides greater than two-fold as compared to control mice (PBS) 30 minutes post injection. Thus, the 25 μg dose of hANGPTL4-mFc was selected as a possible minimum dosage for analysis of inhibition of ANGPTL4-induced increase in serum triglyceride levels by selected anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies as described below.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nIn Vivo Inhibition of ANGPTL4 by Anti-ANGPTL4 Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another set of experiments, selected anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies were tested for their ability to inhibit hANGPTL4-induced increase of triglyceride levels. Measurements of total cholesterol, LDL, NEFA-C and HDL were also made. Briefly, C57BL/6 mice were put into groups of five mice each for each antibody tested. Antibodies were administered at 5 mg/kg dose by subcutaneous injection. Control group I, i.e., mice that received neither anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies nor hANGPTL4, were administered with PBS. Twenty-four hours post-injection of antibody, hANGPTL4-mFc (SEQ ID NO:480) was administered (i.v.) at a dose of 25 μg/mouse to each antibody group. Mice were bled at 30 min after hANGPTL4-mFc injection and lipid levels were determined by ADVIA® 1650 Chemistry System (Siemens). Averages were calculated for each of the measurements of triglycerides, total cholesterol (Total-C), LDL, NEFA-C and HDL for each antibody or control group. Levels of circulating anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies (Serum Ab) were also determined using a standard ELISA assay. Briefly, plates were coated with a goat anti-human Fc antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) to capture Serum Ab. Serum was then added to the plates and captured anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Results, expressed as (mean±SEM) of serum lipid concentration, are shown in Tables 10-12. Control I: Mice that received PBS, but neither anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies nor hANGPTL4-mFc. Control II: Mice that received a human antibody specific for CD20 (i.e., the mAb having the sequence of 2F2 clone disclosed in US 2008/0260641) and hANGPTL4-mFc.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSerum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTriglycerides\n\n\nTotal-C\n\n\nLDL\n\n\nNEFA-C\n\n\nHDL\n\n\nAb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n(μg/mL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl I\n\n\n98.20 ± 5.49\n\n\n89.80 ± 4.28\n\n\n5.60 ± 0.66\n\n\n1.01 ± 0.04\n\n\n44.18 ± 2.43\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl II\n\n\n211.60 ± 58.29\n\n\n93.40 ± 5.52\n\n\n6.30 ± 0.22\n\n\n1.33 ± 0.17\n\n\n44.62 ± 3.14\n\n\n12.76 ± 0.52 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H284P\n\n\n99.20 ± 9.52\n\n\n80.80 ± 6.40\n\n\n4.98 ± 0.87\n\n\n0.99 ± 0.11\n\n\n39.60 ± 3.46\n\n\n7.96 ± 0.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H257P\n\n\n115.80 ± 6.43 \n\n\n84.40 ± 3.53\n\n\n5.30 ± 0.36\n\n\n0.97 ± 0.03\n\n\n41.38 ± 3.24\n\n\n8.43 ± 0.86\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSerum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTriglycerides\n\n\nTotal-C\n\n\nLDL\n\n\nNEFA-C\n\n\nHDL\n\n\nAb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n(μg/mL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl I\n\n\n66.60 ± 7.94\n\n\n70.00 ± 2.3 \n\n\n3.88 ± 0.36\n\n\n0.76 ± 0.08\n\n\n35.26 ± 1.09\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl II\n\n\n161.00 ± 17.83\n\n\n73.60 ± 0.93\n\n\n4.12 ± 0.17\n\n\n1.18 ± 0.09\n\n\n35.10 ± 0.6 \n\n\n11.05 ± 2.28 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H236N2\n\n\n151.80 ± 9.26 \n\n\n72.40 ± 1.81\n\n\n4.26 ± 0.25\n\n\n1.11 ± 0.18\n\n\n33.78 ± 1.13\n\n\n9.20 ± 0.63\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H624P\n\n\n81.20 ± 9.26\n\n\n72.80 ± 5.49\n\n\n4.36 ± 0.92\n\n\n0.86 ± 0.07\n\n\n35.40 ± 2.68\n\n\n11.76 ± 0.89 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H268P\n\n\n 92.60 ± 11.44\n\n\n76.00 ± 2.14\n\n\n4.94 ± 0.51\n\n\n0.82 ± 0.04\n\n\n35.94 ± 1.64\n\n\n8.05 ± 1.06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSerum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTriglycerides\n\n\nTotal-C\n\n\nLDL\n\n\nNEFA-C\n\n\nHDL\n\n\nAb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n(mg/dL)\n\n\n(μg/mL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl I\n\n\n94.20 ± 10.91\n\n\n75.00 ± 5.32\n\n\n3.98 ± 0.25\n\n\n1.01 ± 0.05\n\n\n40.46 ± 3.25\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl II\n\n\n179.80 ± 28.06 \n\n\n76.80 ± 3.46\n\n\n4.38 ± 0.09\n\n\n1.30 ± 0.13\n\n\n39.06 ± 2.94\n\n\n11.59 ± 1.2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H291P\n\n\n111.00 ± 7.51 \n\n\n71.20 ± 3.26\n\n\n3.84 ± 0.12\n\n\n1.11 ± 0.04\n\n\n38.24 ± 2.14\n\n\n 9.46 ± 0.73\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H283P\n\n\n113.60 ± 8.74 \n\n\n75.80 ± 1.53\n\n\n4.62 ± 0.39\n\n\n1.13 ± 0.05\n\n\n40.30 ± 0.72\n\n\n 7.85 ± 1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H295P\n\n\n104.80 ± 9.44 \n\n\n74.60 ± 4.82\n\n\n4.04 ± 0.40\n\n\n1.12 ± 0.04\n\n\n39.70 ± 3.13\n\n\n12.61 ± 0.83\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H653P\n\n\n88.00 ± 13.52\n\n\n74.20 ± 4.49\n\n\n3.84 ± 0.32\n\n\n1.04 ± 0.1 \n\n\n40.10 ± 2.72\n\n\n 8.77 ± 1.06\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H285P\n\n\n91.40 ± 11.99\n\n\n76.40 ± 1.75\n\n\n3.72 ± 0.44\n\n\n0.97 ± 0.06\n\n\n42.20 ± 0.91\n\n\n10.49 ± 0.67\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H292P\n\n\n85.80 ± 7.00 \n\n\n74.40 ± 2.11\n\n\n3.96 ± 0.15\n\n\n1.06 ± 0.06\n\n\n39.44 ± 1.68\n\n\n12.61 ± 0.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1H638P\n\n\n102.80 ± 10.75 \n\n\n73.80 ± 2.78\n\n\n4.14 ± 0.18\n\n\n1.06 ± 0.05\n\n\n39.54 ± 1.65\n\n\n12.20 ± 0.80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter injection of hANGPTL4-mFc (25 μg), most of the anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies tested (shown in Tables 10-12) exhibited significantly reduced levels of serum triglycerides compared to mice treated with irrelevant antibody (control II).\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nPreparation of Anti-ANGPTL4 Antibodies with hIgG4 Isotype\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibodies H1H268P and H1H284P with hIgG1 isotype were converted to hIgG4 isotype by replacing the respective constant regions with the hIgG4 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:483, which contains a S108P mutation in the hinge region.

The strain background for both wild-type and transgenic mice was C57BL6 (75%) and 129Sv (25%). Separate cohorts consisting of 5 mice each of either wild-type or hANGPTL4(+/+) mice received subcutaneously (s.c.) 1 mg/kg of H4H268P2, H4H284P, or an isotype-matched (hIgG4) control with irrelevant specificity. Blood samples were collected at 0 hour, 6 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 7 days, 10 days, and 15 days, 22 days, and 30 days after the injection. Serum levels of human antibodies were determined by a sandwich ELISA. Briefly, a goat polyclonal anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) capture antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA) was coated in 96-well plates at a concentration of 1 μg/mL and incubated overnight at 4° C. After the plates were blocked with BSA, serum samples in a six-point serial dilution and reference standards of the respective antibody in a twelve-point serial dilution were added to the plate and incubated for one hour at room temperature. After washing with a suitable washing buffer, captured human antibodies were detected using the same goat polyclonal anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) antibody conjugated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA) and developed by standard colorimetric response using tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate, measuring absorbance at 450 nm in a plate reader. Concentrations of human antibodies in serum were determined using the reference standard curve generated for the same sample plate.

In the transgenic mice expressing only human ANGPTL4 [hANGPTL4(+/+)], the clearance rates as reflected in AUCs were faster for both H4H268P2 (37.0 hr*μg/mL) and H4H284P (7.60 hr*μg/mL) compared to clearance rates in wild-type mice (318 and 200 hr*μg/mL, respectively) and compared to the clearance rate of the isotype-matched control antibody in either the hANGPTL4(+/+) mice (168 hr*μg/mL) or the wild-type mice (199 hr*μg/mL) (also see \nFIG. 3B\n). In the hANGPTL4(+/+) mice, the 30-day AUC for H4H284P (7.60 hr*μg/mL) was about 5-fold less than that for H4H268P2 (37.0 hr*μg/mL). Together these results suggest that both anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies exhibit target-mediated clearance in mice expressing human ANGPTL4, and H4H284P exhibits a substantially faster clearance rate than H4H268P2.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nIn Vivo Effect of IgG1 Anti-hANGPTL4 Antibodies on Circulating TG Levels in Humanized ANGPTL4 Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies H1H268P and H1H284P on serum TG levels was determined in mice expressing the ANGPTL4 protein containing the human N-terminal coil-coil region (“humanized ANGPTL4 mice”). The humanized ANGPTL4 mouse was made by replacing first three exons of the mouse Angptl4 gene (the N terminal coil-coil region) with the corresponding human N-terminal coil-coil ANGPLT4 sequence in C57BL6/129 (F1H4) embryonic stem cells. After germ line transmission was established, heterozygous mice (ANGPTL4hum/+) were bred together to generate homozygous mice [ANGPTL4hum/hum or hANGPTL4(+/+)] on a C57BL6 background. Humanized ANGPTL4 mice were pre-bled 7 days before (day −7) the experiment and put into groups of six mice each for each antibody tested. Antibodies (H1H268P, H1H284P and isotype-matched (hIgG1) control with no known cross-reactivity to mouse antigens) were administered at 10 mg/kg dose by subcutaneous injection.

TG reduction resulting from H1H284P administration was most effective at day 4 after injection of the antibody (˜34% in TG reduction), but by \nday\n 11 TG levels were increased back to control level, probably due to fast clearance rate of the antibody.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nIn Vivo Effect of IgG4 Anti-hANGPTL4 Antibodies on Circulating TG Levels in Humanized ANGPTL4 Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of anti-hANGPTL4 antibodies, H4H268P2 and H4H284P, on serum TG levels was determined in humanized ANGPTL4 mice.

The ApoE null mouse model is known as a highly atherogenic and hyperlipidemic model with the majority of cholesterol and TG circulating in VLDL particles due to impaired VLDL remnant clearance. Humanized ANGPTL4×ApoE null mice were pre-bled 7 days before the experiment and put into 2 groups of six mice each.

Mice were bled after 4 hours of fasting on \n \n \n \ndays\n \n \n \n 1, 4, 7, 11 and 17 after antibody injection and TG levels were determined in the serum by ADVIA® 1800 Chemistry System (Siemens).

The mice were pre-bled 7 days before the experiment after 4 hours of fasting and put into 4 groups of six mice each. \nGroups\n 2 and 4 were administered with H4H268P2 at 10 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection on \nday\n 0 and groups 1 (control group) and 2 were placed on regular chow diet. Groups 3 and 4 received chow diet supplemented with 0.05% (w/w) of fenofibrate (the dosage level was determined experimentally in a pilot study). Serum was collected from a terminal bleed on \nday\n 7 after H4H268P2 and/or fenofibrate administration (after 4 hours of fasting) and analyzed by ADVIA® 1800 Chemistry System (Siemens). The results are shown in \nFIG. 5\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of H4H268P2 alone and in combination with fenofibrate led to significant reduction in circulating \nTG levels\n 7 days after administration. TG levels were reduced by ˜40% (mean) 7 days after H4H268P2 administration alone, ˜25% after fenofibrate treatment alone, and ˜50% after combination treatment of H4H268P2 and fenofibrate, compared to control group treated with chow diet. H4H268P2 showed more efficacy than fenofibrate in reducing circulating TG levels in mouse models. Combination treatment showed a synergistic effect of H4H268P2 and fenofibrate on TG levels. Remarkably, livers collected from mice consumed fenofibrate (groups 3 and 4) for 7 days were significantly enlarged (1.8 times, liver weight/body weight), compared to mice consumed control chow diet (\ngroups\n 1 and 2) (data not shown).\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nPilot Study on Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics of Anti-ANGPTL4 Antibodies in Obese Rhesus Monkeys\n\n\n \n \n \nPhase I: In a pilot non-GLP pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study, H4H268P2 and H4H284P were administered as a single bolus intravenous (IV) injection, to obese rhesus monkeys (\nMacaca mulatta\n). Rhesus monkeys were selected because this species is closely related, both phylogenically and physiologically, to humans and is a species commonly used for nonclinical toxicity evaluations. Obese monkeys that had been on a high fat diet for greater than 6 months were selected because they typically display moderately elevated TG levels (i.e., mean\n\n \n \n \n>100 mg/dL; hyper-TG). Eight confirmed healthy, male monkeys were acclimated and assigned to the study for baseline assessment for 7 days prior to dosing. All animals received a vehicle (10 mM histidine, pH 6) IV infusion on Day −5, after which four of them received H4H268P2 and another four H4H284P at 10 mg/kg IV on \nday\n 0. No injection site reactions or other adverse effects were observed at any time point after infusion.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nSerum samples were collected from the baseline period through \nday\n 35 post-dosing and assessed for serum lipid levels by ADVIA® 1800 Chemistry System (Siemens). The average baseline for each animal was determined based on the samples taken on Days −7, −5 and 0. Preliminary analysis of samples taken after vehicle administration revealed that 3 obese animals from each group displayed elevated fasted TG levels (i.e., TG>100 mg/dL) while one animal from each group had an average TG level well within the normal range (i.e., mean fasting TG level of 42 mg/dL and 84 mg/dL). Thus the data analysis was done with 3 animals in each group. Percent (%) changes of serum TG levels from the baseline were determined for each animal and averaged for each Ab group. The results are shown in \nFIG. 6\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of H4H268P2 to the three mildly hyper-TG animals showed a maximal reduction of 57% at day 4 post-dosing. The mean serum TG levels for these animals after H4H268P2 treatment remained at or below 100 mg/dL until approximately \nDay\n 25. Moderate effects were observed on additional lipids, such as LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and HDL-C; however total-C was unchanged (data not shown). Administration of H4H268P2 to the single obese animal with low TG levels did not yield any significant effect to lower fasting TG's or any other lipid parameters (data not shown), suggesting a lower limit for the reduction of TG levels by the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhase II: In the second non-GLP pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study only H4H268P2 was administered as a single bolus intravenous (IV) injection to eight obese rhesus monkeys (\nMacaca mulatta\n). The step of pre-dosing vehicle injection was omitted in this study. Three baseline assessments were taken at days −7, −3 and 0 of the study and all eight monkeys received H4H268P2 at 10 mg/kg by IV on \nday\n 0, Serum samples were collected from the baseline period through \nday\n 35 post-dosing and assessed for serum lipid levels by ADVIA® 1800 Chemistry System (Siemens). Animals were grouped for data analysis according to average baseline TG levels so as to prospectively predict the effect: A. TG<150 mg/dL (n=3); B. 150 mg/dL<TG<500 mg/dL (n=4); and C. TG>1000 mg/dL (n=1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 7\n shows the TG levels of the three groups expressed as percent changes of TG levels from the average of 3 baseline TG values. As expected on the basis of preclinical data, the greater reduction in fasting TG levels was seen in the animals with higher basal serum TG levels. An especially dramatic and rapid drop in TG level was observed in an individual animal whose baseline TG level was >1000 mg/dL. A robust decrease in TG levels (50-68%) was observed for animals with baseline 150 mg/dL<TG<500 mg/dL. In this group of obese monkeys administration of H4H268P2 increased HDL-C, but had no effect on LDL-C or Total-C (data not shown). Animals with baseline TG<150 mg/dL (normal TG levels) were largely unresponsive to H4H268P2."
