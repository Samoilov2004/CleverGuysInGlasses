Description\n\n\n\n\nThis application is the U.S. National stage filing of PCT Application Ser. No. PCT/US2006/024122, filed Jun. 21, 2006, which claims the benefit of priority under 35 USC 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/693,604, filed Jun. 24, 2005.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to tetrahydrocarbazole compounds that are useful as therapeutic agents, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, to methods of using the compounds to treat disorders in patients, and to intermediates and processes useful in the synthesis of the compounds.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nNuclear hormone receptors are an evolutionarily conserved class of intracellular receptor proteins which have been termed “ligand dependent transcription factors”. Evans et al., SCIENCE, 240: 889 (1988). The nuclear hormone receptor gene superfamily encodes structurally-related receptor proteins for glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol, corticosterone, cortisone), androgens, mineralocorticoids (e.g. aldosterone), progestins, estrogen, and thyroid hormone. Also included within this superfamily of nuclear receptors are receptor proteins for vitamin D, retinoic acid, 9-cis retinoic acid, as well as those receptors for which no cognate ligands have been identified (“orphan receptors”) Ribeiro et al., Annual Rev. Med., 46:443-453 (1995); Nature Rev. Drug Discovery, 3: 950-964 (November 2004). Steroid hormone receptors represent a subset of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. So named according to the cognate ligand which complexes with the receptor in its native state, the steroid hormone nuclear receptors include the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the androgen receptor (AR), the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), the estrogen receptor (ER), and the progesterone receptor (PR). Tenbaum et al., Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Bio., 29(12):1325-1341(1997).\n\n\nIn contrast to membrane bound receptors, nuclear hormone receptors encounter their respective ligands following entry of the ligand into the cell. Once ligand binding occurs, the ligand-receptor complex modulates transcription of target genes within the cell nucleus. For example, most ligand-free nuclear receptors are bound in a complex with heat shock proteins (hsps) in the cytoplasm. Following entry of circulating hormone into the cell, binding elicits a conformational change in the receptor, dissociating the receptor from the hsp. The ligand bound receptors translocate to the nucleus, where they act as monomers as well as hetero-and homodimers in binding to particular hormone response elements (HREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. The HRE-receptor complex then, in turn, regulates transcription of proximally-located genes. (see Ribeiro et al., supra.). On the other hand, thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) and other non-steroid receptors such as vitamin D receptor (VDR) and retinoic acid receptors (RAR) are bound to their respective HRE in the absence of hsps and/or cognate ligand. Hormones released from the circulation enter the cell, binding in the nucleus to these receptors which, in turn, hetero-dimerize to other nuclear receptors such as 9-cis retinoic acid (RXR). As with the steroid hormone nuclear receptors, following ligand binding, the ligand-bound receptor complex again regulates transcription of neighboring genes.\n\n\nAndrogens exert profound influences on a multitude of physiological functions by virtue of their diverse roles in inter alia male sexual development and function, maintenance of muscle mass and strength in both males and females, maintenance of bone mass, erythropoeisis, memory and cognition, and maintenance of sexual behaviour (e.g. libido and potency). The actions of androgens (testosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)) are mediated by the AR which, upon androgen binding, translocates to the cell nucleus where it binds to specific DNA sequences termed androgen respone elements (AREs) to initiate or repress transcription of target genes. The effects of androgens can be generally characterized as anabolic or androgenic in nature. Anabolic (i.e. tissue building) effects of androgens include increasing muscle mass and strength and bone mass, whereas androgenic (i.e. masculinizing) effects include the development of male secondary sexual characteristics such as the internal reproductive tissues (i.e. prostate and seminal vesicle), the external genetalia (penis and scrotum), libido, and hair growth patterns.\n\n\nReductions in bioavailable serum androgen levels that occur with aging can have serious physiological effects in both males and females. In males, for example, decreases in androgen levels are associated with loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, depression, decreased cognitive ability, lethargy, osteoporosis, and loss of muscle mass and strength. Rajfer (2003), \nRev. Urol., \n5 (Suppl. 1): S1-S2. In addition, as men age and testosterone levels decline, bones weaken, diabetes and cardiovascular disease rates increase, and the ratio of muscle mass to fat decreases. Vastag, B. (2003), \nJAMA; \n289: 971-972. In females, low plasma levels of circulating testosterone are associated with diminished libido, unexplained fatigue, and general lack of well being. Davis, S. R. (1999), \nMedical J. Australia; \n170: 545-549. Clinically, the principal application of androgen therapy has been in the treatment of hypogonadism in men. Significantly, androgen replacement therapy in hypogonadal men has also been shown to decrease bone resorption and increase bone mass. Katznelon, L., et al., \nJ. Clin. Endocrinol Metab.; \n81: 4358 (1996). Other indications for which androgens have been used clinically include treatment of delayed puberty in boys, anemia, primary osteoporosis, and muscle wasting diseases. In addition, androgen replacement therapy has been used recently in aging men and for the regulation of male fertility. T. R. Brown, \nEndocrinology; \n145(12): 5417-5419 (2004). In females, androgen therapy has been used clinically for the treatment of sexual dysfunction or diminished libido. W. Arlt, \nEuro. J. Endocrinol.; \n154(1) 1-11 (2006).\n\n\nHowever, activation of AR in certain tissues is also associated with serious deleterious consequences. For example, unwanted side effects of steroidal androgen therapy include growth stiumulation of the prostate and seminal vesicles. Feldkorn et al., \nJ. Steroid Bichem and Mol. Biol.; \n94(5): 481-487 (2005). Prostate cancers, for example, depend on AR for growth and development. Gegory, C. W. et al. (2001), \nCancer Res.\n, June 1; 61(11):4315-4319; and Jenster, G. (1999), \nSemin. Oncol.\n, August; 26(4): 407-421. Androgen therapy has also been associated with sleep apnea, stimulation of prostate tumors and elevations in prostate specific antigen (PSA), an indication of increased prostate cancer risk. Vastag, B. (2003), \nJAMA; \n289: 971-972. In addition, use of androgen agonists have specifically been associated with liver damage, adverse effects on male sexual function, adverse effects associated with cardiovascular and erythropoetic function, prostate enlargement, hisutism, and virilization. (see Published International Patent Applications WO 03/011824 and WO 03/034987). Furthermore, preparations of unmodified and modified steroidal androgens have been found to suffer from rapid degradation in the liver leading to poor oral bioavailability and short duration of activity following parenteral administration, variations in plasma levels, hepatotoxicity, or cross reactivity with other steroid hormone receptors (e.g. the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and the progesterone receptor (PR) which have ligand binding domains homologous to AR) Yin et al., \nJPET; \n304(3): 1323-1333 (2003). Furthermore, in females, the use of steroidal androgens may lead to hirsutism or virilization.\n\n\nThus, there remains a need in the art for alternatives to classical steroidal androgen therapy which possess the beneficial pharmacological properties of steroidal androgens, but with a reduced likelihood or incidence of the typical limitations associated with steroidal androgen therapy. Recent efforts to identify suitable replacements for steroidal androgens have focused on identifying tissue selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) which display a differentiated profile of activity in androgenic tissues. In particular, such agents preferably display androgen agonist activity in anabolic tissues such as muscle or bone, yet are only partial agonists or even antagonists in androgenic tissues such as the prostate or seminal vesicles.\n\n\nLigands used to modulate (i.e., agonize, partially agonize, partially antagonize, or antagonize) the transcriptional activity of AR display androgenic or antiandrogenic activity (or anabolic or antianabolic activity) and, further, may be steroidal or nonsteroidal in structure. Androgenic agents (AR Agonists or partial AR agonists) mimic the effects of natural androgens in either activating or repressing the transcriptional activity of AR, whereas antiandrogenic agents (AR antagonists or partial AR antagonists) block androgen mediated transactivation or transrepression of AR. Further, the AR ligand-AR complex has also been reported to influence the recruitment of cofactor proteins to the enhancer and or promoter sites. Shang et al. (March 2002), \nMol. Cell. \n9(3): 601-610. In addition to their effects on target gene transcription, ligands for AR may also induce “non-genotropic” effects. For example, ligands can bind to AR localized in non-nuclear compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum, outer cell membrane, or cytoplasm and induce biochemical changes that are mediated by adaptor proteins such as phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), extracellular regulated kinases (ERKs), mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), or p38/stress activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (p38/SAP/JNK). These “non-genotropic” effects encompass a wide array of physiological changes including the triggering of antiapoptotic and survival pathways. (see Bowen, R. L. (2001), \nJAMA \n286(7): 790-1; Gouras, G. K., H. Xu, et at. (2000), \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n97(3): 1202-5; Kousteni, S., T. Bellido, et al. (2001), \nCell \n104(5): 719-30; and Kousteni, S., L. Han, et al. (2003) [comment] \nJournal of Clinical Investigation \n111(11): 1651-64.)\n\n\nThus, it is clear that a ligand which has affinity for AR could be used to modulate receptor activity and thereby influence a multitude of physiological effects related to alterations in androgen levels and/or AR activity. Furthermore, the effects of such agents can be accomplished by both classical conventional HRE-mediated (e.g. “genotropic”) or non-genotropic mechanisms. Preferably such agents function as selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) displaying androgenic effects in tissues such as muscle and/or bone, while concomitantly displaying antiandrogenic properties in tissues such as the prostate, liver, and those responsible for virilization in females. Alternatively, SARMs may display tissue selectivity with regard to their androgenic effects functioning as, for example, agonists in anabolic tissue such as muscle or bone but only partial agonists or antagonists in tissues such as the prostate or seminal vesicles. In addition, such ligands are preferably non-steroidal in nature thus avoiding many of the undesired pharmacological, physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of their steroidal counterparts, including poor oral bioavailability, rapid hepatic metabolism, and cross activation of other steroid receptors. He, Y, et al. (2002), \nEur. J. Med. Chem.; \n37: 619-634.\n\n\nSeveral physiological disorders are believed to be susceptible to AR modulation, and in particular, modulation by SARMs. Frailty represents one such disorder. Frailty is a geriatric condition which results in a reduction in one's reserve capacity to the extent that multiple physiological systems are close to, or past the threshold of symptomatic clinical failure. As a consequence, the frail person is at an increased risk of disability and death from minor external stresses (e.g. disease or life events). Campbell, A. J., et al. (1997), Age and Ageing; 26(4): 315-318. Frailty represents a complex syndrome characterized by numerous musculoskeletal symptoms including declines in muscle mass and strength, decreased range of motion, slowness and paucity of movement, balance and gait abnormalities, weight loss and reduced food intake, weakness and fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, and sarcopenia (loss of lean body mass). Brown, M., et al. (2000), \nJ. of Gerontology; \n55(6): M350-M355; and Fried, L. and Watson, J. (1999), \nPrinciples of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontolgy, \n1387-1402, New York: McGraw Hill. As such, an agent with androgenic properties in tissues such as muscle and bone would be expected to have utility in treating the frail patient.\n\n\nOther physiological disorders are also suitable for AR modulation. For example, it is now well known that hypogonadism is associated with osteoporosis in men. Kaufman, J. M., et al., \nAnn. Rheum. Dis.\n; October; 59(10): 765-772 (2000). Furthermore, In men with prostate cancer, androgen deprivation therapy increased the rate of bone mineral density loss. Preston, D. M., et al., \nProstate Cancer Prostatic Dis.; \n5(4): 304-310 (2002). In addition, androgen replacement therapy in hypogonadal men decreases bone resorption and increases bone mass. Katznelon, L., et al., \nJ. Clin. Endocrinol Metab.; \n81: 4358 (1996). As such, AR modulators are believed to be useful in the treatment of osteoporosis (either as a monotherapy or in combination with other inhibitors of bone resorption including, but not limited to estrogens, bisphosphonates, and selective estrogen receptor modulators). In fact, small clinical trials have in fact shown that testosterone replacement therapy in older men may help delay or reverse osteoporosis, possibly preventing hip and vertebral fractures. Vastag, B., \nJAMA; \n289: 971-972 (2003).\n\n\nMoreover, AR modulators, can be used to enhance performance in the treatment of male and female sexual dysfunction (see Morley, J. E. and Perry, H. M., \nJ. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol.\n; June; 85(2-5): 367-373 (2003) and \nMedical J. Australia; \n170: 545-549 (1999), supra). Other indications or physiological disorders or for which an AR modulator is believed to have utility include maintenance of muscle mass, strength and function; as bone anabolic agents in the treatment of osteoporosis or osteopenia; restoration of bone either independently or as an adjunct to androgen deprivation therapy in the treatment of prostate or pancreatic cancer; as an agent to accelerate bone repair (e.g. bone fractures); as a treatment for sarcopenia or Age Related Functional Decline (ARFD); as an agent to increase energy (e.g. reduce lethargy) and libido; or as a treatment for hypogonadism. In addition, AR modulators can be used for the treatment of prostate cancer.\n\n\nThus, it is an object of the present invention to provide nonsteroidal AR ligands which possess androgen receptor modulating activity. In particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide nonsteroidal AR ligands which possess androgen receptor agonist activity. More particularly, it is a preferred embodiment of the present invention to provide nonsteroidal androgen agonists which bind to AR with greater affinity relative to the other steroid hormone receptors. Even more particularly, it is a preferred embodiment of the present invention to provide tissue selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) which display androgen agonist activity in muscle or bone, but only partial agonist, partial antagonist or antagonist activity in other androgenic tissues such as the prostate or seminal vesicle.\n\n\nThe following references provide some examples of the state of the art as it relates to the present invention.\n\n\nHe et al., Eur.

In particular, compounds of Formula (I) are potent AR ligands, which preferably agonize the androgen receptor. In addition, particularly preferred compounds of Formula (I) selectively bind to AR with greater affinity relative to the other steroid hormone receptors. More particularly, the compounds of the present invention are selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) which display both androgenic and antiandrogenic properties, acting as agonists of AR in some tissues while antagonizing AR in yet other tissues. Alternatively, the present invention provides as a more partiuclar embodiment SARMs which display agonist activity in tissues such as muscle or bone, yet only partial agonist activity in tissues such as the prostate or seminal vesicles. In this regard, such ligands are believed to be useful in treating or preventing a multitude of disorders and conditions susceptible to AR modulation. Thus, methods for the treatment or prevention of disorders or conditions susceptible to AR modulation constitute an important embodiment of the present invention. As a particularly preferred aspect, the present invention provides compounds useful as SARMs.\n\n\nIt is also understood that many of the compounds of the present invention may exist as pharmaceutically acceptable salts and, as such, pharmaceutically acceptable salts are therefore included within the scope of the present invention. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” as used herein, refers to salts of the compounds of the present invention, which are substantially non-toxic to living organisms. Typical pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the compounds of the present invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acid or an organic or inorganic base. Such salts are known as acid addition and base addition salts. It is further understood by the skilled reader that salt forms of pharmaceutical compounds are commonly used because they are often more readily crystallized, or more readily purified, than are the free bases. In all cases, the use of the pharmaceutical compounds of the present invention as salts is contemplated in the description herein. Hence, it is understood that where compounds of the present invention are capable of forming salts, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and isoforms thereof are encompassed in the names or structures provided herein. Acids and bases suitable for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, as well as procedures for preparing such salts, are well within the knowledge of those skilled in the art. See for example, Stahl et al., “Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use,” VCHA/Wiley-VCH, (2002); Gould, P. L., “Salt selection for basic drugs,” \nInternational Journal of Pharmaceutics, \n33: 201-217 (1986); Berge et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts,” \nJournal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n66, No. 1, (January 1977); Bastin et al. “Salt Selection and Optimization Procedures for Pharmaceutical New Chemical Entities,” \nOrganic Process Research and Development, \n4: 427-435 (2000).\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “stereoisomer” refers to a compound made up of the same atoms bonded by the same bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not interchangeable. The three-dimensional structures are called configurations. As used herein, the term “enantiomer” refers to one of two stereoisomers whose molecules are nonsuperimposable mirror images of one another. The term “chiral center” refers to a carbon atom to which four different groups are attached. As used herein, the term “diastereomers” refers to stereoisomers which are not enantiomers. In addition, two diastereomers which have a different configuration at only one chiral center are referred to herein as “epimers”. The terms “racemate”, “racemic mixture” or “racemic modification” refer to a mixture of equal parts of enantiomers.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may have one or more chiral centers and may, therefore, exist in a variety of stereoisomeric configurations. As a consequence of these chiral centers the compounds of the present invention may occur as racemates, mixtures of enantiomers, and as individual enantiomers as well as diastereomers and mixtures of diastereomers. All such racemates, enantiomers, and diastereomers are within the scope of the present invention. Enantiomers of the compounds provided by the present invention can be resolved, for example, by one of ordinary skill in the art using standard techniques such as those described by J. Jacques, et al., “Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions”, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1981. The terms “R” and “S” are used herein as commonly used in organic chemistry to denote specific configuration of a chiral center. The term “R” (rectus) refers to that configuration of a chiral center with a clockwise relationship of group priorities (highest to second lowest) when viewed along the bond from the chiral carbon toward the lowest priority group. The term “S” (sinister) refers to that configuration of a chiral center with a counterclockwise relationship of group priorities (highest to second lowest) when viewed along the bond from the chiral carbon toward the lowest priority group. The priority of groups is based upon their atomic number (in order of decreasing atomic number). A partial list of priorities and a discussion of stereochemistry is contained in “Nomenclature of Organic Compounds: Principles and Practice”, (J. H. Fletcher, et al., eds., 1974) at pages 103-120.\n\n\nThe specific stereoisomers and enantiomers of compounds of the present invention can be prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art utilizing well known techniques and processes, such as those disclosed by Eliel and Wilen, “Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds”, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, Chapter 7; Separation of Stereoisomers, Resolution, Racemization; and by Collet and Wilen, “Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions”, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1981. For example, specific stereoisomers and enantiomers can be prepared by stereospecific syntheses using enantiomerically and geometrically pure, or enantiomerically or geometrically enriched starting materials. In addition, the specific stereoisomers and enantiomers can be resolved and recovered by techniques such as chromatography on chiral stationary phases, enzymatic resolution or fractional recrystallization of addition salts formed by reagents used for that purpose.\n\n\nThe term “enantiomeric enrichment” as used herein refers to the increase in the amount of one enantiomer as compared to the other. A convenient method of expressing the enantiomeric enrichment achieved is the concept of enantiomeric excess, or “ee”, which is found using the following equation:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \ne\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \ne\n \n \n=\n \n \n \n \n \nE\n \n1\n \n \n-\n \n \nE\n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \nE\n \n1\n \n \n+\n \n \nE\n \n2\n \n \n \n \n×\n \n100\n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein E\n1 \nis the amount of the first enantiomer and E\n2 \nis the amount of the second is enantiomer. Thus, if the initial ratio of the two enantiomers is 50:50, such as is present in a racemic mixture, and an enantiomeric enrichment sufficient to produce a final ratio of 50:30 is achieved, the ee with respect to the first enantiomer is 25%. However, if the final ratio is 90:10, the ee with respect to the first enantiomer is 80%. An ee of greater than 90% is preferred, an ee of greater than 95% is most preferred and an ee of greater than 99% is most especially preferred. Enantiomeric enrichment is readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using standard techniques and procedures, such as gas or high performance liquid chromatography with a chiral column. Choice of the appropriate chiral column, eluent and conditions necessary to effect separation of the enantiomeric pair is well within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art. In addition, the enantiomers of compounds of Formula I can be resolved by one of ordinary skill in the art using standard techniques well known in the art, such as those described by J. Jacques, et al., “Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions”, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1981.\n\n\n\nWhere used herein, the term “Pg” refers to a suitable oxygen or nitrogen protecting group. Suitable oxygen or nitrogen protecting groups, as used herein, refers to those groups intended to protect or block the oxygen or nitrogen group against undesirable reactions during synthetic procedures. Whether the term “Pg”, as used herein, represents an oxygen protecting group or a nitrogen protecting group will be readily apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan. The suitability of the oxygen or nitrogen protecting group used will depend upon the conditions that will be employed in subsequent reaction steps wherein protection is required, and is well within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art. Commonly used nitrogen and oxygen protecting groups are disclosed in Greene, “Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis, 3\nrd \nEdition” (John Wiley & Sons, New York (1999)).\n\n\nAs used herein, the following terms have the meanings indicated: “i.v.” refers to intravenously; “p.o.” refers to orally; “i.p.” refers to intraperitoneally; “s.c.” refers to subcutaneously; “eq” or “equiv.” refers to equivalents; “g” refers to grams; “Kg” refers to kilograms; “mg” refers to milligrams; “μg” refers to micrograms; “L” refers to liters; “mL” refers to milliliters; “μL” refers to microliters; “mol” refers to moles; “mmol” refers to millimoles; “M” refers to molar; “mM” refers to millimolar; “nM” refers to nanomolar; “μM” refers to micromolar; “N” refers to normal; “psi” refers to pounds per square inch; “mm Hg” refers to millimeters of mercury; “min” refers to minutes; “h” or “hr” or “hrs.” refers to hours; “° C.” refers to degrees Celsius; “δ” refers to part per million down-field from tetramethylsilane; “MHz” refers to megahertz; “TLC” refers to thin layer chromatography; “HPLC” refers to high performance liquid chromatography; “R\nt\n” refers to retention time; “UV” refers to ultraviolet; “nm” refers to nanometer; “Anal” refers to analytical; “Calcd” refers to calculated; “mp” or “m.p.” refers to melting point; “CDCl\n3\n” refers to chloroform-d; “THF” refers to tetrahydrofuran; “DMF” refers to N,N-dimethylformamide; “DMSO” refers to dimethyl sulfoxide; “DMSO-d\n6\n” refers to dimethyl-d\n6\n-sulfoxide; “EtOAc” refers to ethyl acetate; “MeOH” refers to methanol; “EtOH” refers to ethanol; “i-PrOH” refers to isopropanol; “Et\n2\nO” refers to diethyl ether; “MTBE” refers to tert-butyl methyl ether; “DMEA” refers to N,N-dimethylethylamine; “Na\n2\nSO\n4\n” refers to sodium sulfate; “MgSO\n4\n” refers to magnesium sulfate; “Na\n2\nCO\n3\n” refers to sodium carbonate; “K\n2\nCO\n3\n” refers to potassium carbonate; “NaHCO\n3\n” refers to sodium bicarbonate; Na\n2\nS\n2\nO\n3 \nrefers to sodium thiosulfate; “NaOH” refers to sodium hydroxide; “HCl” refers to hydrogen chloride or hydrochloric acid; “H\n2\nO\n2\n” refers to hydrogen peroxide; “NaH” refers to sodium hydride; “LDA” refers to lithium diisopropylamide; “CH\n2\nCl\n2\n” refers to dichloromethane; “NH\n4\nOH” refers to ammonium hydroxide; “NH\n4\nCl” refers to ammonium chloride; “NH\n3\n” refers to ammonia; and “Al—Ni” refers to aluminum-nickel.\n\n\nAlso as used herein, “K\nd\n” refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant for a ligand-receptor complex; “K\ni\n” refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant for drug-receptor complex, and is an indication of concentration of drug that will bind to half the binding sites at equilibrium; “IC50” refers to the concentration of an agent which produces 50% of the maximal inhibitory response possible for that agent; “IC50” also refers to the concentration of an agent which produces 50% displacement of ligand binding to the receptor; “EC50” refers to the concentration of an agent which produces 50% of the maximal response possible for that agent; and “ED50” refers to the dose of an administered therapeutic agent which produces 50% the maximal response for that agent.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl” refers to a straight or branched, monovalent, saturated aliphatic chain of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and includes, but is not limited to methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl and the like.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl” refers to a straight or branched, monovalent, saturated aliphatic chain of 1 to 6 carbon atoms and includes, but is not limited to methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, and the like.

The term “androgen receptor modulator” or “androgen modulator” or “AR modulator” as used herein, refers to those nuclear hormone receptor ligands which bind to the AR subtype and modulate (i.e. agonize, partially agonize, partially antagonize, antagonize) the receptor activity. As a particular embodiment, the present invention provides selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) which display androgenic properties in certain tissues (e.g. muscle and/or bone) while concomitantly displaying antiandrogenic effects in other tissues such as the prostate or liver. Alternatively, SARMs of the present invention may display agonist activity in anabolic tissues such as muscle or bone, yet display only parital agonist activity or antagonist activity in tissues such as the prostate or seminal vesicles.\n\n\nAs appreciated by one of skill in the art, physiological disorders may present as a “chronic” condition, or an “acute” episode. The term “chronic”, as used herein, means a condition of slow progress and long continuance. As such, a chronic condition is treated when it is diagnosed and treatment continued throughout the course of the disease. Conversely, the term “acute” means an exacerbated event or attack, of short course, followed by a period of remission. Thus, the treatment of pathological disorders contemplates both acute events and chronic conditions. In an acute event, compound is administered at the onset of symptoms and discontinued when the symptoms disappear. As described above, a chronic condition is treated throughout the course of the disease.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “patient” refers to a mammal, such a mouse, gerbil, guinea pig, rat, dog or human. It is understood, however, that the preferred patient is a human. As used herein, the terms “treating”, “treatment”, or “to treat” each mean to alleviate symptoms, eliminate the causation of resultant symptoms either on a temporary or permanent basis, and to prevent, slow the appearance, or reverse the progression or severity of resultant symptoms of the named disorder or condition. As such, the methods of treatment provided by this invention encompass both therapeutic and prophylactic administration.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “effective amount” refers to the amount or dose of the compound, upon single or multiple dose administration to the patient, which provides the desired effect in the patient undergoing diagnosis or treatment. An effective amount can be readily determined by the attending diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, by the use of known techniques and by observing results obtained under analogous circumstances. In determining the effective amount or dose of compound administered, a number of factors are considered by the attending diagnostician, including, but not limited to: the species of mammal; its size, age, and general health; the degree of involvement or the severity of the disease involved; the response of the individual patient; the particular compound administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristics of the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the use of concomitant medication; and other relevant circumstances.\n\n\nA typical daily dose will contain as an effective amount about 0.001 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of an active compound of the present invention. Preferably, the daily dose will contain as an effective amount about 0.05 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg of the compound of the present invention.\n\n\nOral administration is a preferred route of administering the compounds employed in the present invention whether administered alone, or in combination with other therapeutic agents. Oral administration, however, is not the only route, nor even the only preferred route. Other preferred routes of administration include transdermal, percutaneous or subcutaneous, pulmonary, intravenous, intramuscular, intranasal, intraperitoneal, buccal, sublingual, or intrarectal routes. Where the AR modulator is administered in combination with other compounds, one of the compounds may be administered by one route, such as oral, and the other may be administered by the transdermal, percutaneous or subcutaneous, pulmonary, intravenous, intramuscular, intranasal, intraperitoneal, buccal, sublingual, or intrarectal route, as particular circumstances require. The route of administration may be varied in any way, limited by the physical properties of the compounds and the convenience of the patient and the caregiver.\n\n\nThe compounds employed in the present invention may be administered as pharmaceutical compositions and, therefore, pharmaceutical compositions incorporating compounds of the present invention are important embodiments of the present invention. Such compositions may take any physical form that is pharmaceutically acceptable, but orally administered pharmaceutical compositions are particularly preferred. Such pharmaceutical compositions contain, as an active ingredient, an effective amount of a compound of Formula I, including the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and hydrates thereof, which effective amount is related to the daily dose of the compound to be administered. Each dosage unit may contain the daily dose of a given compound, or may contain a fraction of the daily dose, such as one-half or one-third of the dose. The amount of each compound to be contained in each dosage unit depends on the identity of the particular compound chosen for the therapy, and other factors such as the indication for which it is given.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained, or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing well known procedures.\n\n\nThe following discussion provides typical procedures for preparing pharmaceutical compositions incorporating the compounds of the present invention. However, the following is in no way intended to limit the scope of the pharmaceutical compositions provided by the present invention.\n\n\nCompositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 1 to about 500 mg of each compound individually or in a single unit dosage form, more preferably about 5 to about 300 mg (for example 25 mg). The term “unit dosage form” refers to a physically discrete unit suitable as unitary dosages for a patient, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier, diluent, or excipient.\n\n\nThe inert ingredients and manner of formulation of the pharmaceutical compositions are conventional. The usual methods of formulation used in pharmaceutical science may be used here. All of the usual types of compositions may be used, including tablets, chewable tablets, capsules, solutions, parenteral solutions, intranasal sprays or powders, troches, suppositories, transdermal patches and suspensions. In general, compositions contain from about 0.5% to about 50% of the compound in total, depending on the desired doses and the type of composition to be used. The amount of the compound, however, is best defined as the “effective amount”, that is, the amount or dose of each compound which provides the desired effect to the patient in need of such treatment. The activity of the compounds employed in the present invention does not depend on the nature of the composition, hence, the compositions are chosen and formulated solely for convenience and economy.\n\n\nCapsules are prepared by mixing the compound with a suitable diluent and filling the proper amount of the mixture in capsules. The usual diluents include inert powdered substances such as starches, powdered cellulose especially crystalline and microcrystalline cellulose, sugars such as fructose, mannitol and sucrose, grain flours, and similar edible powders.\n\n\nTablets are prepared by direct compression, by wet granulation, or by dry granulation. Their formulations usually incorporate diluents, binders, lubricants and disintegrators as well as the compound. Typical diluents include, for example, various types of starch, lactose, mannitol, kaolin, calcium phosphate or sulfate, inorganic salts such as sodium chloride and powdered sugar. Powdered cellulose derivatives are also useful. Typical tablet binders are substances such as starch, gelatin and sugars such as lactose, fructose, glucose and the like. Natural and synthetic gums are also convenient, including acacia, alginates, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine and the like. Polyethylene glycol, ethylcellulose and waxes can also serve as binders.\n\n\nTablets are often coated with sugar as a flavor and sealant. The compounds may also be formulated as chewable tablets, by using large amounts of pleasant-tasting substances such as mannitol in the formulation, as is now well-established practice. Instantly dissolving tablet-like formulations are also now frequently used to assure that the patient consumes the dosage form, and to avoid the difficulty in swallowing solid objects that bothers some patients.\n\n\nA lubricant is often necessary in a tablet formulation to prevent the tablet and punches from sticking in the die. The lubricant is chosen from such slippery solids as talc, magnesium and calcium stearate, stearic acid and hydrogenated vegetable oils.\n\n\nTablet disintegrators are substances which swell when wetted to break up the tablet and release the compound. They include starches, clays, celluloses, algins and gums. More particularly, corn and potato starches, methylcellulose, agar, bentonite, wood cellulose, powdered natural sponge, cation-exchange resins, alginic acid, guar gum, citrus pulp and carboxymethylcellulose, for example, may be used, as well as sodium lauryl sulfate.\n\n\nEnteric formulations are often used to protect an active ingredient from the strongly acid contents of the stomach. Such formulations are created by coating a solid dosage form with a film of a polymer which is insoluble in acid environments, and soluble in basic environments. Exemplary films are cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate.\n\n\nWhen it is desired to administer the compound as a suppository, the usual bases may be used. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, which may be modified by addition of waxes to raise its melting point slightly. Water-miscible suppository bases comprising, particularly, polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights are in wide use, also.\n\n\nTransdermal patches have become popular recently. Typically they comprise a resinous composition in which the drugs will dissolve, or partially dissolve, which is held in contact with the skin by a film which protects the composition. Many patents have appeared in the field recently. Other, more complicated patch compositions are also in use, particularly those having a membrane pierced with innumerable pores through which the drugs are pumped by osmotic action.\n\n\nIt is understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the procedures as described above can also be readily applied to a method of treating disorders susceptible to androgen receptor modulation, and particularly frailty, osteoporosis, osteopenia, and male or female sexual dysfunction.\n\n\nWhen used in conjunction with the methods and uses of the present invention, the compounds and compositions of the present invention may be administered either alone, or in combination with conventional therapeutic agents used to treat the particular disorder or condition. Where the compounds or compositions of the present invention are used as part of a combination, the compound or composition comprising Formula I may be administered separately or as part of a formulation comprising the therapeutic agent with which it is to be combined.\n\n\nCombination Therapy for Osteoporosis:\n\n\nConventional therapeutic agents for the treatment of osteoporosis may advantageously be combined with the compounds of Formula I, or compositions comprising a compound of Formula I. Conventional agents for the treatment of osteoporosis include hormone replacement therapies such as conjugated equine estrogen (Premarin®), synthetic conjugated estrogen (Cenestin®), esterified estrogen (Estratab® or Menest®), estropiate (Ogen® or Ortho-est®); as well as transdermal estradiol preparations such as Alora®, Climara®, Estraderm®, and Vivelle®. Combination estrogen-progestin formulations are also available for the treatment of osteoporosis including Prempro® (conjugated equine estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate), Premphase® (conjugated equine estrogen and norgestimate), Ortho-Prefest® (estradiol and norgestimate), Femhrt® (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone acetate), and Combipatch (transdermal estradiol and norethindrone acetate). Other conventional osteoporosis treatments which may be combined with the compounds or compositions of the present invention include bisphosphonates such as alendronate (Fosamax®), risedronate (Actonel®), and pamidronate (Aredia®); selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as raloxifene (Evista®); calcitonin (Calcimar® or Miacalcin®); parathyroid hormone (Forteo®); calcium; Vitamin D; diuretics (to reduce Ca\n2+\n excretion); fluoride; and androgens (testosterone or 5α-dihydrotestosterone).\n\n\nThus, a formulation for combination therapy in treating osteoporosis 1 5 comprises:\n\n \n \n \n \nIngredient (A1): a compound of formula I;\n \nIngredient (A2): one or more co-agents that are conventional for the treatment of osteoporosis selected from the group consisting of Premarin®, Cenestin®, Estratab®, Menest®, Ogen®, Ortho-est®, Alora®, Climara®, Estraderm®, Vivelle®, Prempro®, Premphase®, Ortho-Prefest®, Femhrt®, Combipatch®, Fosamax®, Actonel®, Aredia®); Evista®; Calcimar®, Miacalcin®, Forteo®, calcium, Vitamin D, diuretics, fluoride, testosterone, and 5α-dihydrotestosterone;\n \nand optionally\n \nIngredient (A3): a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient.\n\n\nParticular Aspects of the Invention\n\n \n \n \n\n\nThe following lists set out several groupings of particular substituents and particular variables for compounds of Formula I. It will be understood that compounds of Formula I having such particular substituents or variables, as well as methods and uses employing such compounds, represent particular aspects of the present invention.

All ligands, radioligands, solvents, and reagents employed in the binding assays are readily available from commercial sources, or can be readily synthesized by the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\nSteroid Hormone Nuclear Receptor Binding Assay:\n\n\nCell lysates from 293 cells overexpressing human GR (glucocorticoid receptor), AR (androgen receptor), MR (mineralocorticoid receptor) or PR (progesterone receptor) are used for competition binding assays to determine Ki values for test compounds. Briefly, competition binding assays are run in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.2 mM EDTA, 75 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 20 mM sodium molybdate, 0.2 mM DTT, 20 ug/inl aprotinin and 20 ug/ml leupeptin, using either 0.3 nM \n3\nH-dexamethasone for GR binding, 0.36 nM \n3\nH-methyltrienolone for AR binding, 0.25 nM \n3\nH-aldosterone for MR binding, or 0.29 nM \n3\nH-methyltrienolone for PR binding, and either 20 ug 293-GR lysate, 22 ug 293-AR lysate, 20 ug 293-MR lysate or 40 ug 293-PR lysate per well. Competing compounds are added at various concentrations ranging from about 0.01 nM to 10 μM. Non-specific binding is determined in the presence of 500 nM dexamethasone for GR binding, 500 nM aldosterone for MR binding, or 500 nM methyltrienolone for AR and PR binding. The binding reaction (140 μl) is incubated for overnight at 4° C., then 70 μl of cold charcoal-dextran buffer (containing per 50 ml of assay buffer, 0.75 g of charcoal and 0.25 g of dextran) is added to each reaction. Plates are mixed 8 minutes on an orbital shaker at 4° C. Plates are then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm at 4° C. for 10 minutes. An aliquot of 120 μl of the mix is transferred to another 96-well plate and 175 μl of Wallac Optiphase “Hisafe 3” scintillation fluid is added to each well. Plates are sealed and shaken vigorously on an orbital shaker. After an incubation of 2 hrs, plates are read in a Wallac Microbeta counter. The data is used to calculate an IC\n50 \nand % Inhibition at 10 μM. The K\nd \nfor \n3\nH-dexamethasone for GR binding, \n3\nH-methyltrienolone for AR binding, \n3\nH-aldosterone for MR binding, or \n3\nH-methyltrienolone for PR binding, is determined by saturation binding. The IC\n50 \nvalues for test compounds are converted to K\ni \nusing Cheng-Prusoff equation and the K\nd \ndetermined by saturation binding assay.\n\n\nBinding assay protocols for steroid hormone nuclear receptors similar to those described above can be readily designed by the ordinarily skilled artisan.

In addition, the most particularly preferred compounds of the present invention selectively bind to the androgen receptor with greater affinity relative to the other steroid hormone receptors (MR, GR, and PR)\n\n\nTo demonstrate the ability of compounds of the present invention to modulate the activity of the androgen receptor (i.e. either agonize, partially agonize, partially antagonize, or antagonize), bioassays are performed which detect modulation of target gene expression in cells transiently transfected with a nuclear receptor protein and a hormone response element-reporter gene construct. The solvents, reagents, and ligands employed in the functional assay are readily available from commercial sources, or can be synthesized by one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nFunctional Assay of Steroid Hormone Nuclear Receptor Modulation:\n\n\nHuman embryonic kidney hEK293 cells are co-transfected using FuGEN™. Briefly, the reporter plasmid containing two copies of probasin ARE (androgen response element \n5′\nGGTTCTTGGAGTACT\n3′\n) (SEQ ID NO:1) and TK promoter upstream of the luciferase reporter cDNA, is transfected with a plasmid constitutively expressing human androgen receptor (AR) using viral CMV promoter. The reporter plasmid containing two copies of GRE (glucocorticoid response element \n5′\nTGTACAGGATGTTCT\n3\n) (SEQ ID NO:2) and TK promoter upstream of the luciferase reporter cDNA, is transfected with a plasmid constitutively expressing either human glucocorticoid receptor (GR), human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), or human progesterone receptor (PR), using viral CMV promoter. Cells are transfected in T150 cm\n2 \nflasks in DMEM media with 5% charcoal-stripped Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). After an overnight incubation, transfected cells are trypsinized, plated in 96 well dishes in DMEM media containing 5% charcoal-stripped FBS, incubated for 4 h and then exposed to various concentrations of test compounds ranging from about 0.01 nM to 10 μM. In the antagonist assays low concentrations of agonist for each respective receptor are added to the media (0.25 nM dexamethosone for GR, 0.3 nM of methyltrienolone for AR, 0.05 nM of promegestone for PR and 0.05 nM aldosterone for MR). After 24 h of incubations with compounds, cells are lysed and luciferase activity is determined.\n\n\nData are fitted to a four parameter-fit logistic curve fit to determine EC50 values The percentage efficacy (compounds with saturated maximum responses) or the percent maximum stimulations (compounds with maximum responses that do not saturate) are determined relative to maximum stimulation obtained with the following reference agonists: 100 nM methyltrienolone for AR assay, with 30 nM promegestone for PR assay, with 30 nM aldosterone for MR assay and with 100 nM dexamethasone for GR assay. IC50 values may be determined similarly using antagonist mode assay data. In the antagonist mode, percent inhibitions are determined by comparing test compound activity in the presence of low concentration of agonist (0.25 nM dexamethasone for GR, 0.3 nM of methyltrienolone for AR, 0.05 nM of promegestone for PR and 0.05 nM aldosterone for MR) to the response produced by the same low concentration of agonist in the absence of test compound.\n\n\nC2C12 AR/ARE Reporter Assay:\n\n\nAs an indicator of agonist activity in muscle tissue, the C2C12 AR/ARE reporter assay is performed. Briefly, mouse myoblast C2C12 cells are co-transfected using FuGENE™. A reporter plasmid containing a GRE/ARE (glucocorticoid response element/androgen response element \n5′\nTGTACAGGATGTTCT\n3\n) (SEQ ID NO:3) and TK promoter upstream of the luciferase reporter cDNA, is transfected with a plasmid constitutively expressing human androgen receptor (AR) using viral CMV promoter. Cells are transfected in T150 cm\n2 \nflasks in DMEM media with 4% or 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (PBS). After a 5 hour incubation, transfected cells are trypsinized, plated in 96 well dishes in DMEM media containing 10% charcoal-stripped FBS, incubated for 2 h and then exposed to various concentrations of test compounds ranging from about 0.01 nM to 10 μM. After 48 h of incubations with compounds, cells are lysed and luciferase activity is determined using standard techniques. Data is fit to a 4 parameter-fit logistics to determine EC50 values. The % efficacy is determined versus maximum stimulation obtained with 10 nM methyltrienolone.\n\n\nFunctional assays of nuclear hormone receptor modulation similar to those described above can be readily designed by the ordinarily skilled artisan. Table I (see below) provides average EC50 and % Efficacy data in the C2C12 AR/ARE reporter assay for a representative sample of the exemplified compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nIn vivo Mouse Model of Efficacy and Selectivity:\n\n\nMale ICR mice (8 weeks old) are castrated according to approved procedures (Taconic, N.Y.) and allowed to waste for eight weeks. Age-matched sham-operated mice are also prepared. (Sham-operated mice are animals that have been exposed to the same surgical procedures as castrated animals except their testes are not removed.) Animals are housed in a temperature-controlled room (24° C.) with a reversed 12 hour light/dark cycle (dark 10:00/22:00) and water and food are available ad libitum.\n\n\nIn order to demonstrate in vivo efficacy, compounds of the present invention are administered daily by oral gavage or subcutaneous injection to the castrated sixteen week old mice (body weight about 48-50 g). Test compounds are administered to the animals using conventional vehicles. For example, for oral dosing 1% Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)+0.25% Tween 80 in sterile H\n2\nO can be used for oral formulation and 6% Ethyl-alcohol (EtOH)+94% cyclodexitrane (CDX) can be used for subcutaneous injections. Castrated mice treated with Testosteron Enanthate (TE) (10 mg/kg/d) are used as a treatment positive control whereas castrated mice treated only with vehicle are used as treatment negative control. In addition, sham-operated mice treated with vehicle only are used as control for the surgical method.\n\n\nTest animals are dosed over a two week timeframe, orally or subcutaneously, with, for example, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg/day of a compound of the present invention. After the two-week treatment, as an indicator of activity the wet weight of the Levator Ani muscle in the test group is determined and compared to the weight in the castrated, vehicle only control group. The percent efficacy is then calculated as follows:\n\n\n(Wet weight in treatment group/Wet weight in control group)×100\n\n\nAs an indicator of tissue selective activity, the wet weight of the seminal vesicle from test animals is similarly compared to the weight of the seminal vesicles from the castrated, vehicle-only group. In addition, a comparison of the wet weight of the prostate glands from the drug-treated group, to the wet weight of the prostate glands removed from the castrated, vehicle-only group, may also be used as an indicator of tissue selective activity.\n\n\n\nTable II (see below) provides % efficacy data for a select sample of exemplified compounds of the present invention.
