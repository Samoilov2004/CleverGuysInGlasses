Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n1. Field of the Invention\n\n\nThis invention is in the field of medicinal chemistry. In particular, the invention relates to the discovery that (R)(−)-2,7,8-triamino-4-(3-bromo-4,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-cyano-4H-chromene (1R), substantially free from the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer, is an inducer of apoptosis and is a vascular disrupting agent. The invention also relates to the use of compound 1R, substantially free from the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer, as a therapeutically effective anti-cancer agent, and combination with other anticancer agents, as well as for the treatment of diseases due to overgrowth of vasculature, such as ocular neovascularization.\n\n\n2. Description of Related Art\n\n\nOrganisms eliminate unwanted cells by a process variously known as regulated cell death, programmed cell death, or apoptosis. Such cell death occurs as a normal aspect of animal development, as well as in tissue homeostasis and aging (Glucksmann, A., \nBiol. Rev. Cambridge Philos. Soc. \n26:59-86 (1951); Glucksmann, A., \nArchives de Biologie \n76:419-437 (1965); Ellis, et al., \nDev. \n112:591-603 (1991); Vaux, et al., \nCell \n76:777-779 (1994)). Apoptosis regulates cell number, facilitates morphogenesis, removes harmful or otherwise abnormal cells and eliminates cells that have already performed their function. Additionally, apoptosis occurs in response to various physiological stresses, such as hypoxia or ischemia (WO96/20721).\n\n\nThere are a number of morphological changes shared by cells experiencing regulated cell death, including plasma and nuclear membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage (condensation of nucleoplasm and cytoplasm), organelle relocalization and compaction, chromatin condensation and production of apoptotic bodies (membrane enclosed particles containing intracellular material) (Orrenius, S., \nJ. Internal Medicine \n237:529-536 (1995)).\n\n\nApoptosis is achieved through an endogenous mechanism of cellular suicide (Wyllie, A. H., in \nCell Death in Biology and Pathology\n, Bowen and Lockshin, eds., Chapman and Hall (1981), pp. 9-34). A cell activates its internally encoded suicide program as a result of either internal or external signals. The suicide program is executed through the activation of a carefully regulated genetic program (Wyllie, et al., \nInt. Rev. Cyt. \n68:251 (1980); Ellis, et al., \nAnn. Rev. Cell Bio. \n7:663 (1991)). Apoptotic cells and bodies are usually recognized and cleared by neighboring cells or macrophages before lysis. Because of this clearance mechanism, inflammation is not induced despite the clearance of great numbers of cells (Orrenius, S., \nJ. Internal Medicine \n237:529-536 (1995)).\n\n\nIt has been found that a group of proteases is a key element in apoptosis (see, e.g., Thornberry, \nChemistry and Biology \n5:R97-R103 (1998); Thornberry, \nBritish Med. Bull. \n53:478-490 (1996)). Genetic studies in the nematode \nCaenorhabditis elegans \nrevealed that apoptotic cell death involves at least 14 genes, 2 of which are the pro-apoptotic (death-promoting) ced (for cell death abnormal) genes, ced-3 and ced-4. CED-3 is homologous to interleukin 1 beta-converting enzyme, a cysteine protease, which is now called caspase-1. When these data were ultimately applied to mammals, and upon further extensive investigation, it was found that the mammalian apoptosis system appears to involve a cascade of caspases, or a system that behaves like a cascade of caspases. At present, the caspase family of cysteine proteases comprises 14 different members, and more can be discovered in the future. All known caspases are synthesized as zymogens that require cleavage at an aspartyl residue prior to forming the active enzyme. Thus, caspases are capable of activating other caspases, in the manner of an amplifying cascade.\n\n\nApoptosis and caspases are thought to be crucial in the development of cancer (\nApoptosis and Cancer Chemotherapy\n, Hickman and Dive, eds., Humana Press (1999)). There is mounting evidence that cancer cells, while containing caspases, lack parts of the molecular machinery that activates the caspase cascade. This makes the cancer cells lose their capacity to undergo cellular suicide and the cells become immortal—they become cancerous. In the case of the apoptosis process, control points are known to exist that represent points for intervention leading to activation. These control points include the CED-9-BCL-like and CED-3-ICE-like gene family products, which are intrinsic proteins regulating the decision of a cell to survive or die and executing part of the cell death process itself, respectively (see, Schmitt, et al., \nBiochem. Cell. Biol. \n75:301-314 (1997)). BCL-like proteins include BCL-xL and BAX-alpha, which appear to function upstream of caspase activation. BCL-xL appears to prevent activation of the apoptotic protease cascade, whereas BAX-alpha accelerates activation of the apoptotic protease cascade.\n\n\nIt has been shown that chemotherapeutic (anti-cancer) drugs can trigger cancer cells to undergo suicide by activating the dormant caspase cascade. This can be a crucial aspect of the mode of action of most, if not all, known anticancer drugs (Los, et al., Blood 90:3118-3129 (1997); Friesen, et al., \nNat. Med. \n2:574 (1996)). The mechanism of action of current antineoplastic drugs frequently involves an attack at specific phases of the cell cycle. In brief, the cell cycle refers to the stages through which cells normally progress during their lifetime. Normally, cells exist in a resting phase termed G\no\n. During multiplication, cells progress to a stage in which DNA synthesis occurs, termed S. Later, cell division, or mitosis occurs, in a phase called M. Antineoplastic drugs, such as cytosine arabinoside, hydroxyurea, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate are S phase specific, whereas antineoplastic drugs, such as vincristine, vinblastine, and paclitaxel are M phase specific. Many slow growing tumors, e.g., colon cancers, exist primarily in the G\no \nphase, whereas rapidly proliferating normal tissues, e.g., bone marrow, exist primarily in the S or M phase. Thus, a drug like 6-mercaptopurine can cause bone marrow toxicity while remaining ineffective for a slow growing tumor. Further aspects of the chemotherapy of neoplastic diseases are known to those skilled in the art (see, e.g., Hardman, et al., eds., \nGoodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics\n, Ninth Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York (1996), pp. 1225-1287). Thus, it is clear that the possibility exists for the activation of the caspase cascade, although the exact mechanisms for doing so are not clear at this point. It is equally clear that insufficient activity of the caspase cascade and consequent apoptotic events are implicated in various types of cancer. The development of caspase cascade activators and inducers of apoptosis is a highly desirable goal in the development of therapeutically effective antineoplastic agents. Moreover, since autoimmune disease and certain degenerative diseases also involve the proliferation of abnormal cells, therapeutic treatment for these diseases could also involve the enhancement of the apoptotic process through the administration of appropriate caspase cascade activators and inducers of apoptosis.\n\n\nIt is well known that tumor vasculature is essential for the growth and metastasis of solid tumors. Therefore tumor vasculature is an attractive target for therapy because damaging or blocking a single tumor vessel can kill many tumor cells. There are two major therapeutic approaches targeting tumor vasculature. Antiangiogenic approaches, using antiangiogenic agents such as small molecular inhibitors of VEGF receptors or monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF receptors, are designed to prevent the neovascularization processes in tumors, thus blocking the formation of new blood vessels and tumor growth. Antivascular approaches, using vascular disrupting agents (VDAs, which also were known as vascular targeting agents, VTAs), target the preexisting vessels of tumors, causing vascular shutdown and leading to rapid haemorrhagic necrosis and tumor cell death (Tozer, et al., \nNature Review Cancer, \n5:423-435 (2005), and Kelland, \nCurrent Cancer Therapy Reviews, \n1:1-9 (2005)). Vasculature in tumors is known to be proliferating, relatively immature, more permeable and disorganized, in comparison to vasculature in normal tissues. Tumor vascular disrupting agents were designed to exploit these differences between normal and tumor blood vessels and to selectively target tumor vasculature.\n\n\nTwo types of VDAs have been developed. The first types are biological or ligand-directed VDAs which use antibodies, peptides or growth factors to target toxins or pro-coagulants to the tumor endothelium. The second types are small molecule VDAs, and most of them are tubulin-binding agents. Some work through induction of local cytokine production, such as 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA). VDAs are most effective at killing cells in the poorly perfused hypoxic core of tumors, and leaving a viable rim of well-perfused tumor tissues at the periphery, which can rapidly regrow if not treated. Therefore VDAs as single agents in general have poor anti-tumor effects. However, combination therapies of VDAs with cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and radioimmunotherapy, which target the peripheral tumor cells, have produced excellent responses in many animal tumor models. In general, VDAs are well tolerated and have different side-effect profiles than other types of anticancer therapies. Since VDAs target tumor vasculature, they can kill tumor cells that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In addition, VDAs also should be useful for the treatment of other diseases due to overgrowth of vasculature, such as ocular neovascularization (Numbu, H. et al., \nInvest Opthalmol. Vis. Sci. \n44: 3650-5 (2003)).\n\n\nVinca alkaloids and colchicine are known to induce haemorrhagic necrosis of solid tumors. However, these antivascular effects were only observed at doses approaching or exceeding their maximum tolerated doses, therefore they could not be used for therapeutic application. More recently, several tubulin-binding agents interacting at the colchicine-binding site have been found to preferentially target tumor endothelial cells while sparing normal vasculature, and to induce haemorrhagic necrosis of solid tumors at doses that are well tolerated. These compounds include combretastatin A-4 phosphate (CA4P), ZD6126 (N-Acetylcolchinol-O-phosphate) and AVE8062, and have shown high antitumor activity in animal studies, especially in combination with other anticancer agents. Therefore vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) are a promising new class of anti-cancer drugs and several VDAs are currently in clinical trials.\n\n\nIn addition, CA4P was reported recently (Vincent, L. et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n115: 2992-3006 (2005)) to induce rapid regression of tumor neovessels through interference with vascular endothelial-cadherin signaling. Specifically, CA4P was found to selectively target endothelial cells, but not smooth muscle cells, and to induce regression of unstable nascent tumor neovessels by rapidly disrupting the molecular engagement of the endothelial cell-specific junctional molecule vascular endothelial-cadherin both in vitro and in vivo. These results provided a mechanism for the antiangiogenic effects of CA4P and for its selectivity against nascent tumor neovessels as opposed to normal stabilized vasculature.

For example, in a given composition of stereoisomer 1R that is substantially free of the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer, 1S, the (R)-stereoisomer is present in greater than 95%. Stereoisomers can be detected using a variety of techniques, for example, chiral HPLC is used.\n\n\nThe present invention arises out of the surprising discovery that when compound 1, 2,7,8-triamino-4-(3-bromo-4,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-cyano-4H-chromene, which is a potent and efficacious activator of the caspase cascade and inducer of apoptosis, and exists as a racemic mixture, was separated into the corresponding R-isomer (−) and S-isomer (+), the R-isomer 1R is found to be the active isomer and the S-isomer (+) is found to be essentially inactive. In addition, the R-isomer (−) is found to be an efficacious antivascular agent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an embodiment, the present invention relates to a compound of Formula 1R, substantially free from the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof. In one example, the compound 1R is about 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or greater free from the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer. In another example, the compound 1R is about 99.9% free from the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer.\n\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable addition salts include, but are not limited to, inorganic and organic acid addition salts, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, sulphate, citrate, lactate, tartrate, maleate, fumarate, mandelate and oxalate.\n\n\nProdrugs for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, amides (e.g., those obtained by condensation with a C\n1-40 \ncarboxylic acid, such as 4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), C\n3-6 \ndioic acid or anhydride thereof, such as succinic and fumaric anhydrides, amino acids, such as glycine or alanine, according to methods known in the art); imines (e.g., those obtained by condensation with a C\n1-4 \naldehyde or ketone according to methods known in the art); and carbamate, such as those described by Leu, et. al., (\nJ. Med. Chem. \n42:3623-3628 (1999)) and Greenwald, et. al., (\nJ. Med. Chem. \n42:3657-3667 (1999)).\n\n\nAmino acids for use in the present invention include natural and non-natural amino acids. Natural amino acids for use in the present invention include alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine.\n\n\nOne specific group of prodrugs are amides prepared using amino acid, especially natural amino acid. Specifically, prodrug of compound 1R having the Formula of II:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, wherein\n\n\n\nR is hydrogen, alkyl and alkyl substituted with hydroxy, carboxy, carbamoyl, mercapto, imidazolyl, methylthio, aryl, amino or guanidine, or\n\n\nR and the NH\n2 \ngroup that is bonded to the carbon atom to which R is bonded, are taken together to form a ring such as in proline.\n\n\nCompound 1 can be prepared using any method known in the art. In one example, compound 1 is prepared as illustrated in Scheme 1. Reaction of 2,3-diaminophenol with 5-bromoveratraldehyde (3-bromo-4,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde) and malononitrile in the presence of a base such as dimethylisopropylamine (DMIPA) in a solvent such as ethanol produced the racemic mixture 1 in yield of 82-90%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another embodiment, as shown in Scheme 2, the present invention relates to a method for the separation of stereoisomers having Formula 1R or 1S from their racemic mixture having Formula 1. In one example, the stereoisomer 1R or 1S can be isolated from the eluting solvent substantially free from the other corresponding stereoisomer. In another example, the stereoisomer 1R can be isolated from the eluting solvent about 96, 97, 98, 99% or greater free from the other corresponding stereoisomer. In another example, the stereoisomer 1R can be isolated from the eluting solvent about 99% free from the other corresponding stereoisomer. In another example, the stereoisomer 1R can be isolated from the eluting solvent about 99.9% free from the other corresponding stereoisomer.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, as shown in Scheme 2, the present invention relates to a method for the separation of a stereoisomer having Formula 1R from the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer. The method includes contacting a mixture comprising solvent and a racemic mixture comprising 1R and the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer with a chiral stationary phase, contacting the mixture and the chiral stationary phase with an eluting solvent, and isolating said stereoisomer 1R from the eluting solvent, wherein the stereoisomer 1R is isolated substantially free of the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer. In another example, the stereoisomer 1R is isolated about 99% free from the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer.\n\n\nThe phrase “chiral stationary phase” refers to separation media capable of separating corresponding stereoisomers (enantiomeric compounds). The chiral stationary phase can include chiral molecules and/or polymers bonded to solid supports, chiral phases created in situ on the surface of the solid adsorbent, or surface cavities that allow for specific interactions with one stereoisomer. For example, chiral stationary phases for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, stationary phases in which chiral proteins, small chiral molecules, polymers of cellulose or amylose, marocyclic glycopeptides or cyclodextrins are coated, bonded or otherwise adsorbed to silica or other solid matrices. Another example of a chiral stationary phase for use in the present invention is an Amylose tris[(S)-α-methylbenzylcarbamate] coated on 20 μm silica gel (available from Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd. as the CHIRALPAK® AS-V, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n\nExample solvents for use in the chiral separation include MeOH and acetonitrile. Other solvents can be used, for example, ethyl acetate and ethanol.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the racemic mixture 1 can also be separated using other methods, including supercritical fluid conditions (SFC) or using simulated moving bed (SMB) technology.\n\n\nA simulated moving bed apparatus which allows for the separation of 1R from a mixture of 1R and 1S is commercially available from, for example, NovaSep, Inc., Boothwyn, Pa., or from Knauer, ASI, Franklin, Mass. (CSEP® Models). See, for example, the apparatuses disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,268,605; 4,434,051 and 5,456,825. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,126,055; 5,434,298 and 6,533,936 for methods of purifying stereoisomers using simulated moving bed technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention relates to a method of producing a prodrug of Formula II. The method includes contacting a compound of Formula 1R with a protected amino acid and coupling reagent to form a protected prodrug, and deprotecting the protected prodrug to form the compound of Formula II. The compound of Formula 1R is substantially free of the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer.\n\n\nProtected amino acids for use in the present invention include protected natural and non-natural amino acids. In one example, the protected amino acid is 9-fluorenylmethyl carbamate protected L-alanine (Fmoc-L-alanine).\n\n\nCoupling reagents for use in the present invention include those reagents that efficiently, and in high yield, couple amino acids to amino groups. For example, the coupling reagent is a mixture that includes dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), or in another example, the coupling reagent is a mixture that includes 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt). It is understood by one ordinary skill in the art that other coupling reagents can be used.\n\n\nProtected prodrugs can be deprotected using any method that efficiently, and in high yield, cleaves the protecting group from the prodrug. For example, the protected prodrug is deprotected using aqueous base. Examples of base for use in the deprotection includes, but are not limited to, aqueous hydroxide bases, including aqueous solutions of a hydroxide salt. Hydroxide salts include, for example, ammonium, sodium, calcium potassium and magnesium hydroxide.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, amino acid prodrugs of compound 1R can be prepared as shown in Scheme 3. Reaction of 1R with a 9-fluorenylmethyl carbamate (Fmoc) protected amino acid, such as Fmoc-L-alanine, in the presence of coupling agents, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), produced the protected prodrug, Fmoc-alanine amide, of 1R. The Fmoc protecting group can be removed under basic conditions, such as using 2N NaOH, to produce the alanine amide of 1R, which is expected to have better aqueous solubility than that of 1R due to the presence of the more basic amino group. When the amide prodrug is injected into animals, such as mice or human, it is expected that the amino acid will be removed by amino peptidase to produce the active drug 1R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn embodiment of the present invention relates to the discovery that compound 1R is an activator of caspases and inducer of apoptosis. Therefore, compound 1R is useful in a variety of clinical conditions in which there is uncontrolled cell growth and spread of abnormal cells, such as in the case of cancer.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention relates to the discovery that compound 1R is a potent and highly efficacious activator of caspases and inducer of apoptosis in drug resistant cancer cells, such as breast and prostate cancer cells, which enables it to kill these drug resistant cancer cells. In comparison, most standard anti-cancer drugs are not effective in killing drug resistant cancer cells under the same conditions. Therefore, compound 1R is useful for the treatment of drug resistant cancer in animals.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention relates to the discovery that compound 1R is a potent antivascular agent. Therefore, compound 1R is useful for inhibiting the growth of endothelial cells and inhibiting the vascularization of a tissue. In particular, compound 1R is useful for the treatment of cancer in animals via targeting or disrupting vasculature in tumors, blocking blood supply to the tumors and causing tumor cell death. Compound 1R also is expected to be useful for the treatment of other diseases due to overgrowth of vasculature, such as ocular neovascularization.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention relates to a therapeutic method useful to modulate in vivo apoptosis or in vivo neoplastic disease, comprising administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of compound 1R, substantially free from the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug, which functions as a caspase cascade activator and inducer of apoptosis.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention relates to a therapeutic method comprising administering to an animal an effective amount of compound 1R, substantially free from the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug of said compound, wherein said therapeutic method is useful to treat cancer, which is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Such diseases include, but are not limited to, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphotic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, neuroblastoma, breast carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, lung carcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical carcinoma, testicular carcinoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, primary macroglobulinemia, bladder carcinoma, chronic granulocytic leukemia, primary brain carcinoma, malignant melanoma, small-cell lung carcinoma, stomach carcinoma, colon carcinoma, malignant pancreatic insulinoma, malignant carcinoid carcinoma, choriocarcinomas, mycosis fungoides, head or neck carcinoma, osteogenic sarcoma, pancreatic carcinoma, acute granulocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, genitourinary carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, malignant hypercalcemia, cervical hyperplasia, renal cell carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, adrenal cortex carcinoma, skin cancer, and prostatic carcinoma.\n\n\nIn practicing the therapeutic methods of the present invention, effective amounts of compositions containing therapeutically effective concentrations of the compound formulated for oral, intravenous, local and topical application, for the treatment of cancer, neoplastic diseases and other diseases in which caspase cascade mediated physiological responses are implicated, are administered to an individual exhibiting the symptoms of one or more of these disorders. The amounts are effective to ameliorate or eliminate one or more symptoms of the disorders. An effective amount of a compound for treating a particular disease is an amount that is sufficient to ameliorate, or in some manner reduce, the symptoms associated with the disease. Such amount can be administered as a single dosage or can be administered according to a regimen, whereby it is effective. The amount can cure the disease but, typically, is administered in order to ameliorate the disease. Typically, repeated administration is required to achieve the desired amelioration of symptoms.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising compound 1R, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug of said compound, which functions as a caspase cascade activator and inducer of apoptosis in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle is provided. In one example, the pharmaceutical composition comprising compound 1R is substantially free of the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer. In another example, the pharmaceutical composition comprising compound 1R is about 95, 96, 97, 98 or 99% or greater free of the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer. In another example, the pharmaceutical composition comprising compound 1R is about 99.9% free from the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention relates to a composition effective to treat cancer comprising compound 1R, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug of said compound, which functions as a caspase cascade activator and inducer of apoptosis, in combination with at least one known cancer chemotherapeutic agent, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said agent. Examples of known anti-cancer agents which can be used for combination therapy include, but not are limit to alkylating agents, such as busulfan, cis-platin, mitomycin C, and carboplatin; antimitotic agents, such as colchicine, vinblastine, paclitaxel, and docetaxel; topo I inhibitors, such as camptothecin and topotecan; topo II inhibitors, such as doxorubicin and etoposide; RNA/DNA antimetabolites such as 5-azacytidine, 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate; DNA antimetabolites, such as 5-fluoro-2′-deoxy-uridine, ara-C, hydroxyurea and thioguanine; and antibodies, such as Herceptin® and Rituxan®. Other known anti-cancer agents which can be used for combination therapy include melphalan, chlorambucil, cyclophosamide, ifosfamide, vincristine, mitoguazone, epirubicin, aclarubicin, bleomycin, mitoxantrone, elliptinium, fludarabine, octreotide, retinoic acid, tamoxifen and alanosine.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention relates to a composition effective to treat cancer comprising compound 1R, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug of said compound, which functions as a caspase cascade activator, inducer of apoptosis, and as a vascular disrupting agent, in combination with at least one approved cancer therapeutic agent (approved now or in the future), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said agent. These combinations of compound 1R with approved cancer therapeutic agents include, as examples, combination with sunitinib, e.g. for the treatment of renal cell cancer; combination with sorafenib, e.g. for the treatment of liver cancer; combination with carbotaxel or bevacuzimab, e.g. for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer; combination with doxorubicin, e.g. for the treatment of ovarian cancer; combination with satraplatin, e.g. for the treatment of prostate cancer; and combination with bevacuzimab, e.g. for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The approved cancer therapeutic can be used at its approved dose and schedule, such as once every 21 days. Compound 1R can be administered, for example, starting the day before, the same day or the day after the approved therapeutic agent. Compound 1R can be administered once a day for 3 consecutive days on a 21 days cycle. Alternative cycles for compound 1R can be, as an example, once a week for 3 weeks on a 28 days cycle. These combination treatments are expected to provide a statistically significant improvement in the reduction of disease progression compared to when the approved cancer therapeutic agent is administered alone.\n\n\nIn practicing the methods of the present invention, the compound of the invention can be administered together with at least one known chemotherapeutic agent as part of a unitary pharmaceutical composition. Alternatively, the compound of the invention can be administered apart from the at least one known cancer chemotherapeutic agent. In one embodiment, the compound of the invention and the at least one known cancer chemotherapeutic agent are administered substantially simultaneously, i.e. the compounds are administered at the same time or one after the other, so long as the compounds reach therapeutic levels in the blood at the same time. In another embodiment, the compound of the invention and the at least one known cancer chemotherapeutic agent are administered according to their individual dose schedule, so long as the compounds reach therapeutic levels in the blood.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention relates to a composition effective to treat cancer comprising a bioconjugate of said compound 1R, which functions as a caspase cascade activator and inducer of apoptosis, in bioconjugation with at least one known therapeutically useful antibodies, such as Herceptin® or Rituxan®, growth factors such as DGF, NGF, cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-4, or any molecule that binds to cell surface. The antibodies and other molecules will deliver compound 1R to its targets and make it an effective anticancer agent. The bioconjugates also could enhance the anticancer effect of therapeutically useful antibodies, such as Herceptin® or Rituxan®.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention relates to a composition effective to treat cancer comprising compound 1R or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug of said compound, which functions as a caspase cascade activator and inducer of apoptosis, in combination with radiation therapy. In this embodiment, the compound of the invention can be administered at the same time as the radiation therapy is administered or at a different time.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the present invention relates to a composition effective for post-surgical treatment of cancer, comprising compound 1R, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug of said compound, which functions as a caspase cascade activator and inducer of apoptosis. The invention also relates to a method of treating cancer by surgically removing the cancer and then treating the animal with one of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein.\n\n\nA wide range of immune mechanisms operate rapidly following exposure to an infectious agent. Depending on the type of infection, rapid clonal expansion of the T and B lymphocytes occurs to combat the infection. The elimination of the effector cells following an infection is one of the major mechanisms maintaining immune homeostasis. This deletion of reactive cells has been shown to be regulated by a phenomenon known as apoptosis. Autoimmune diseases have been identified as a consequence of deregulated cell death. In certain autoimmune diseases, the immune system directs its powerful cytotoxic effector mechanisms against specialized cells, such as oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis, the beta cells of the pancreas in diabetes mellitus, and thyrocytes in Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Ohsako, S. & Elkon, K. B., \nCell Death Differ. \n6:13-21 (1999)). Mutations of the gene encoding the lymphocyte apoptosis receptor Fas/APO-1/CD95 are reported to be associated with defective lymphocyte apoptosis and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), which is characterized by chronic, histologically benign splenomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy, hypergammaglobulinemia, and autoantibody formation. (Infante, A. J., et al., \nJ. Pediatr. \n133:629-633 (1998) and Vaishnaw, A. K., et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n103:355-363 (1999)). It was reported that overexpression of Bcl-2, which is a member of the Bcl-2 gene family of programmed cell death regulators with anti-apoptotic activity, in developing B cells of transgenic mice, in the presence of T cell dependent costimulatory signals, results in the generation of a modified B cell repertoire and in the production of pathogenic autoantibodies (Lopez-Hoyos, M., et al., \nInt. J. Mol. Med. \n1:475-483 (1998)). It is therefore evident that many types of autoimmune disease are caused by defects of the apoptotic process, and one treatment strategy would be to turn on apoptosis in the lymphocytes that are causing autoimmune disease (O'Reilly, L. A. & Strasser, A., \nInflamm. Res. \n48:5-21 (1999)).\n\n\nFas-Fas ligand (FasL) interaction is known to be required for the maintenance of immune homeostasis. Experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT), characterized by autoreactive T and B cell responses and a marked lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid, is a good model to study the therapeutic effects of FasL. Batteux, F., et al., (\nJ. Immunol. \n162:603-608 (1999)) reported that by direct injection of DNA expression vectors encoding FasL into the inflamed thyroid, the development of lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid was inhibited and induction of infiltrating T cells death was observed. These results show that FasL expression on thyrocytes can have a curative effect on ongoing EAT by inducing death of pathogenic autoreactive infiltrating T lymphocytes.\n\n\nBisindolylmaleimide VIII is known to potentiate Fas-mediated apoptosis in human astrocytoma 1321N1 cells and in Molt-4T cells, both of which were resistant to apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibody in the absence of bisindolylmaleimide VIII. Potentiation of Fas-mediated apoptosis by bisindolylmaleimide VIII was reported to be selective for activated, rather than non-activated, T cells, and was Fas-dependent. Zhou, T., et al., (\nNat. Med. \n5:42-48 (1999)) reported that administration of bisindolylmaleimide VIII to rats during autoantigen stimulation prevented the development of symptoms of T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases in two models, the Lewis rat model of experimental allergic encephalitis and the Lewis adjuvant arthritis model. Therefore, the application of a Fas-dependent apoptosis enhancer, such as bisindolylmaleimide VIII, can be therapeutically useful for the more effective elimination of detrimental cells and inhibition of T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. Therefore, an effective amount of compound 1R, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug of compound 1R, which functions as a caspase cascade activator and inducer of apoptosis, is an effective treatment for autoimmune disease.\n\n\nPsoriasis is a chronic skin disease that is characterized by scaly red patches. Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) is a widely used and effective treatment for psoriasis vulgaris and Coven, et al. (\nPhotodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. \n15:22-27 (1999)) reported that lymphocytes treated with psoralen 8-MOP or TMP plus UVA displayed DNA degradation patterns typical of apoptotic cell death. Ozawa, et al. (\nJ. Exp. Med. \n189:711-718 (1999)) reported that induction of T cell apoptosis could be the main mechanism by which 312-nm UVB resolves psoriasis skin lesions. Low doses of methotrexate can be used to treat psoriasis to restore a clinically normal skin. Heenen, et al. (\nArch. Dermatol. Res. \n290:240-245 (1998)) reported that low doses of methotrexate can induce apoptosis and this mode of action could explain the reduction in epidermal hyperplasia during treatment of psoriasis with methotrexate. Therefore, an effective amount of compound 1R, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug of compound 1R, which functions as a caspase cascade activator and inducer of apoptosis, is an effective treatment for hyperproliferative diseases, such as psoriasis.\n\n\nSynovial cell hyperplasia is a characteristic of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Excessive proliferation of RA synovial cells, as well as those defective in synovial cell death, might be responsible for the synovial cell hyperplasia. Wakisaka, et al. (\nClin. Exp. Immunol. \n114:119-128 (1998)) found that although RA synovial cells could die via apoptosis through Fas/FasL pathway, apoptosis of synovial cells was inhibited by proinflammatory cytokines present within the synovium, and suggested that inhibition of apoptosis by the proinflammatory cytokines can contribute to the outgrowth of synovial cells, and lead to pannus formation and the destruction of joints in patients with RA. Therefore, an effective amount of compound 1R, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug of compound 1R, which functions as a caspase cascade activator and inducer of apoptosis, is an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nConvincing evidence has been accumulating that apoptosis plays a major role in promoting resolution of the acute inflammatory response. Neutrophils are constitutively programmed to undergo apoptosis, thus limiting their pro-inflammatory potential and leading to rapid, specific, and non-phlogistic recognition by macrophages and semi-professional phagocytes (Savill, J., \nJ. Leukoc. Biol. \n61:375-380 (1997)). Boirivant, et al. (\nGastroenterology \n116:557-565 (1999)) reported that lamina propria T cells isolated from areas of inflammation in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and other inflammatory states manifest decreased CD2 pathway-induced apoptosis, and that studies of cells from inflamed Crohn's disease tissue indicate that this defect is accompanied by elevated Bcl-2 levels. Therefore, an effective amount of compound 1R, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug, which functions as a caspase cascade activator and inducer of apoptosis, is an effective treatment for inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n\nCompositions within the scope of the present invention include all compositions wherein compound 1R is contained in an amount that is effective to achieve its intended purpose. While individual needs vary, determination of optimal ranges of effective amounts of each component is within the skill of the art. Typically, the compounds can be administered to mammals, e.g., humans, orally at a dose of 0.0025 to 50 mg/kg, or an equivalent amount of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, per day, of the body weight of the mammal being treated for apoptosis-mediated disorders. In one example, about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg is orally administered to treat or prevent such disorders. For intramuscular injection, the dose is generally about one-half of the oral dose. For example, a suitable intramuscular dose would be about 0.0025 to about 25 mg/kg, and another example would be from about 0.01 to about 5 mg/kg. If a known cancer chemotherapeutic agent is also administered, it is administered in an amount which is effective to achieve its intended purpose. The amounts of such known cancer chemotherapeutic agents effective for cancer are well known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\nIn one example, the unit oral dose comprises about 0.01 to about 50 mg. In another example, the unit oral dose comprises about 0.1 to about 10 mg of the compounds of the present invention. The unit dose can be administered one or more times daily as one or more tablets, each containing from about 0.1 to about 10, conveniently about 0.25 to 50 mg of the compound or its solvates.\n\n\nIn a topical formulation, the compound can be present at a concentration of about 0.01 to 100 mg per gram of carrier.\n\n\nIn addition to administering the compound as a raw chemical, the compounds of the present invention can be administered as part of a pharmaceutical preparation. The pharmaceutical preparation can contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that include, for example, excipients and auxiliaries. The excipients and auxiliaries facilitate processing the compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically.\n\n\nIn one example, the orally administered preparations comprise 0.01 to 99 percent, of active compound(s), together with the excipient. In another example, the orally administered preparations comprise about 0.25 to 75 percent of active compound(s), together with the excipient. In further exemplary embodiments, tablets, dragees, or capsules can be used as the forms for orally administering the compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nIn another example, the rectally administered preparations, as well as oral solutions and solutions for injection, comprise about 0.01 to 99 percent of active compound(s), together with the excipient. In another example, these preparations comprise from about 0.25 to 75 percent of active compound(s), together with the excipient. In a further example, suppositories can be used as the form for rectally administering the compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered to any animal that can experience the beneficial effects of the compounds of the invention. Foremost among such animals are mammals, e.g., humans and veterinary animals, although the invention is not intended to be so limited.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be administered by any means that achieve their intended purpose. For example, administration can be by parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, transdermal, buccal, intrathecal, intracranial, intranasal or topical; routes. Alternatively, or concurrently, administration can be by the oral route. The dosage administered will be dependent upon the age, health, and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment, and the nature of the effect desired.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention are manufactured in a manner which is itself known, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, granulating, dragee-making, dissolving, or lyophilizing processes. Thus, pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compounds with solid excipients, optionally grinding the resultant mixture and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired or necessary, to obtain tablets or dragee cores.\n\n\nExcipients for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, fillers, such as saccharides, e.g., lactose or sucrose, mannitol or sorbitol; cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, e.g., tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate; and binders, such as starch paste, using, e.g., maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinyl pyrrolidone. Optional, disintegrating agents can be added such as the above-mentioned starches and also carboxymethyl-starch, cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Auxiliaries are, above all, flow-regulating agents and lubricants, e.g., silica, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium stearate or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings which, optionally, are resistant to gastric juices. For this purpose, concentrated saccharide solutions can be used, which can optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. In order to produce coatings resistant to gastric juices, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropymethyl-cellulose phthalate, are used. Dye stuffs or pigments can be added to the tablets or dragee coatings, e.g., for identification or in order to characterize combinations of active compound doses.\n\n\nOther pharmaceutical preparations, which can be used orally, include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active compounds in the form of granules, which can be mixed with fillers, such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds are dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, or liquid paraffin. Stabilizers can optionally be added.\n\n\nPharmaceutical preparations which can be used rectally include, e.g., suppositories, which consist of a combination of one or more of the active compounds with a suppository base. For example, suitable suppository bases are natural or synthetic triglycerides, or paraffin hydrocarbons. In addition, it is also possible to use gelatin rectal capsules, which consist of a combination of the active compounds with a base. Possible base materials include, e.g., liquid triglycerides, polyethylene glycols, or paraffin hydrocarbons.\n\n\nFormulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form, e.g., water-soluble salts and alkaline solutions. The active compound can be present in about 0.01 to about 50 mg/mL. In addition, suspensions of the active compounds as appropriate oily injection suspensions can be administered.\n\n\nSuitable lipophilic solvents, vehicles, excipients or carriers include fatty oils, e.g., sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, e.g., ethyl oleate or triglycerides; polyethylene glycols (“PEG”), e.g., PEG-200, 400, 600, 800 or 1000; cremophor; cyclodextrins; or block copolymers of poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(propylene glycol) (“poloxamers”), e.g., LUTROL®. In one example, the excipient or carrier is selected from the group consisting of poly(ethylene glycol), block copolymers of poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(propylene glycol), and saline. In another example, a pharmaceutical composition for use in the present invention includes about 10 mg/mL of the compound 1R, substantially free from the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer, about 25% (v/v) poly(ethylene glycol), about 5% (v/v) block copolymers of poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(propylene glycol) and saline.\n\n\nAqueous injection suspensions can contain substances, which increase the viscosity of the suspension, e.g., sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, polysorbate, e.g. polysorbate 20, 80, 81, 90 and 94 (e.g., TWEEN®), dextrose, e.g. 1%, 2%, 5%, 10% or 20% solutions of dextrose in water (e.g., 5% dextrose in water “D5W”), and/or dextran. Optionally, the suspension can also contain stabilizers. In one example, the excipient or carrier is selected from the group consisting of poly(ethylene glycol), polysorbate, and a solution of 5% dextrose in water. In another example, a pharmaceutical composition for use in the present invention includes about 10 mg/mL of the compound 1R, substantially free from the corresponding (S)-stereoisomer, about 7% (v/v) poly(ethylene glycol) 400, about 9% (v/v) polysorbate 80 and about 84% (v/v) of a solution of 5% dextrose in water.\n\n\nIn accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, compounds of the invention are employed in topical and parenteral formulations and are used for the treatment of skin cancer.\n\n\nThe topical compositions of this invention are formulated as oils, creams, lotions, ointments and the like by choice of appropriate carriers. Suitable carriers include vegetable or mineral oils, white petrolatum (white soft paraffin), branched chain fats or oils, animal fats and high molecular weight alcohol (greater than C\n12\n). Particular examples of carriers include those in which the active ingredient is soluble. Emulsifiers, stabilizers, humectants and antioxidants can also be included, as well as agents imparting color or fragrance, if desired. Additionally, transdermal penetration enhancers can be employed in these topical formulations. Examples of such enhancers can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,989,816 and 4,444,762.\n\n\nIn on example, creams are formulated from a mixture of mineral oil, self-emulsifying beeswax and water, in which the active ingredient, dissolved in a small amount of an oil, such as almond oil, is admixed. A typical example of such a cream is one which includes about 40 parts water, about 20 parts beeswax, about 40 parts mineral oil and about 1 part almond oil.\n\n\nOintments can be formulated by mixing a solution of the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, such as almond oil with warm soft paraffin, and allowing the mixture to cool. A typical example of such an ointment is one which includes about 30% almond oil and about 70% white soft paraffin by weight.\n\n\nThe following examples are illustrative, but not limiting, of the method and compositions of the present invention. Other suitable modifications and adaptations of the variety of conditions and parameters normally encountered in clinical therapy and which are obvious to those skilled in the art are within the spirit and scope of the invention.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nSynthesis of 2,7,8-Triamino-4-(3-bromo-4,5-dimethoxy-phenyl)-3-cyano-4H-chromene (1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA suspension of 3-bromo-4,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (1500 g, 6.12 moles, 1.1 eq) and malononitrile (404 g, 6.12 moles, 1.1 eq) in ethanol 99% (12 L, 7 volumes) was stirred at room temperature under N\n2\n(g).

S(+)-2,7,8-triamino-4-(3-bromo-4,5-dimethoxy-phenyl)-3-cyano-4H-chromene (1S) is the inactive isomer of the racemate 2,7,8-triamino-4-(3-bromo-4,5-dimethoxy-phenyl)-3-cyano-4H-chromene. The observed activity of 1S might be due to the presence of small percent (˜1%) of 1R in the sample tested. Compound 4, the alanine amide prodrug of 1R, also is a potent caspase cascade activator and inducer of apoptosis.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\nIdentification of R(−)-2,7,8-triamino-4-(3-bromo-4,5-dimethoxy-phenyl)-3-cyano-4H-chromene (1R) As Antineoplastic Compound That Inhibits Cell Proliferation (GI\n50\n)\n\n\nHuman breast cancer cells MX-1 and MDAMB435, hepatocarcinoma cells SNU398, colon cancer cells HCT116 and HeLa cells were grown and harvested as in Example 7. An aliquot of 90 μL of cells (4.4×10\n4 \ncells/mL) was added to a well of a 96-well microtiter plate containing 5 μL of a 10% DMSO in RPMI-1640 media solution containing 10 nM to 100 μM of R(−)-2,7,8-triamino-4-(3-bromo-4,5-dimethoxy-phenyl)-3-cyano-4H-chromene (1 nM to 10 μM final). An aliquot of 45 μL of cells was added to a well of a 96-well microtiter plate containing 5 μL of a 10% DMSO in RPMI-1640 media solution without compound as the control sample for maximal cell proliferation (L\nMax\n). The samples were mixed by agitation and then incubated at 37° C. for 72 h in a 5% CO\n2\n−95% humidity incubator. After incubation, the samples were removed from the incubator and 25 μL of CellTiter-Glo™ reagent (Promega) was added. The samples were mixed by agitation and incubated at room temperature for 10-15 min. Plates were then read using a luminescent plate reader (Model SPECTRAfluor Plus, Tecan) to give L\ntest \nvalues.\n\n\nBaseline for GI\n50 \n(dose for 50% inhibition of cell proliferation) of initial cell numbers was determined by adding an aliquot of 45 μL of cells or 45 μL of media, respectively, to wells of a 96-well microtiter plate containing 5 μL of a 10% DMSO in RPMI-1640 media solution. The samples were mixed by agitation and then incubated at 37° C. for 0.5 h in a 5% CO\n2\n−95% humidity incubator. After incubation, the samples were removed from the incubator and 25 μL of CellTiter-Glo™ reagent (Promega) was added. The samples were mixed by agitation and incubated at 37° C. for 10-15 min at room temperature in a 5% CO\n2\n−95% humidity incubator.

HUVEC cells (3×10\n4\n) were added per well in EGM-2 and incubated for 4 h at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2 \natmosphere to allow the cells to form tube-like structures. Compound 1R was diluted in DMSO to its respective concentrations, added to cells, and allowed to incubate for 1 h at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2 \natmosphere. Following the incubation, the medium was gently aspirated and fresh EGM-2 was added and cells were further incubated for 24 h. Miroscopy images were recorded with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss Canada Ltd, Toronto, Ontario, Canada).

A solution of 6.67% Lutrol in saline was prepared by adding 933 μL of saline into a vial containing 66.7 mg of Lutrol, and mixed until the Lutrol dissolved in the saline. A solution of 40 mg/mL compound 1R in PEG 400 was prepared by adding 973 μL of PEG 400 into a vial containing 40 mg of compound 1R, vortexed and the vial was placed on shaker or rotator until 1R was dissolved in PEG 400. The mixture can be heated occasionally to 50° C. to facilitate dissolution if needed. A solution of 10 mg/mL compound 1R in 25% PEG 400 (v/v), 5% Lutrol (w/v) in saline was prepared by pipetting 750 μL of 6.67% Lutrol in saline into a vial containing 250 μL of 40 mg/mL compound 1R in PEG 400, mixing while adding the saline solution.

Tumor bits were implanted with a trocar into the right mammary area of female nu/nu mice and allowed to grow to an average size of 200-250 mg, about 12 days after being implanted. Animals were randomized and assigned to study groups of 8-10 animals/group. Body weight were determined and tumor size were measured by calipers and converted to volume by the standard formula of Vol=L×W\n2\n/2. Compound 1R was formulated in 7% PEG400/9% Tween80/84% D5W and administered IV via the tail vein at the indicated days and doses. Day 1 of the study was the first day of treatment.
