Dengue viruses cause dengue outbreaks and major epidemics in most tropical and subtropical areas where \nAedes albopictus \nand \nAedes aegypti \nmosquitoes are abundant. Dengue infection produces fever, rash, and joint pain in humans. A more severe and life-threatening form of dengue, characterized by hemorrhagic fever and hemorrhagic shock, has occurred with increasing frequency in. Southeast Asia and Central and South America, where all four dengue virus serotypes circulate. The underlying cause of severe dengue remains controversial (Halstead, S. 1982 \nProgress in Allergy. \n31:301-364; Rosen, L 1986 \nAm. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. \n35:642-653). An association of severe dengue with increased viral replication has been reported recently (Wang, W. K. et al. 2002 \nJ. Virol. \n76:4662-4665). A safe and effective vaccine against dengue is currently not available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dengue virus contains a positive strand RNA genome, coding for a polyprotein that is cleaved co- and post-translationally by a combination of cellular and viral proteases to generate the individual viral proteins (Markoff, L. 1989 \nJ. Virol. \n63:3345-3352; Chambers, T. J. et al. 1990. \nAnn. Rev. Microbiol. \n44:649-688; Falgout, B. et al. 1991 \nJ. Virol. \n65:2467-2475). Dengue virus prM and E structural proteins and nonstructural NS1 protein are glycosylated. The prM glycoprotein is further cleaved by the cellular enzyme furin following viral assembly, generating M, which is present in the mature virus (Stadler, K. et al. 1997 \nJ. Virol. \n71:8475-8481). Flavivirus prM and E form heterodimers, which are assembled into viral particles during infection (Wengler, G. and G. Wengler 1989 \nJ. Virol. \n63:2521-2526). In this manner, the prM serves to protect the functional integrity of E from acid-induced conformational change (Heinz, F. X. et al. 1994 \nVirology \n198:109-117; Holzmann, H. et al. 1995 \nArch. Virol. \n140:213-221). The E glycoprotein is responsible for cell attachment, possibly mediated by a receptor, and for fusion with the cell membranes following viral entry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMouse monoclonal antibodies against the dengue viruses have been valuable for dengue virus serotype determination (Gentry, M. K. et al. 1982 \nAm. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. \n31:548-555; Henchal, E. A. et al. 1982 \nAm. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. \n31:830-836). Studies in which monoclonal antibodies were used against dengue virus and other flaviviruses have also provided valuable information concerning the antigenic structure of the major viral antigen E (Heinz, F. X. et al. 1983 \nVirology \n126:525-537; Henchal, E. A. et al. 1985 \nAm. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. \n34:162-169; Heinz, F. X. 1986 \nAdv. Virus Res. \n31:103-168; Mandl, C. W. et al. 1989 \nJ. Virol. \n63:564-571; Roehrig, J. T. et al. 1998 \nVirology \n246:317-328). The three-dimensional structure of the E glycoprotein has been determined at 2 Å resolution for tick-borne encephalitis virus and recently for \ndengue type\n 2 virus (Rey, P. A. et al. 1995 \nNature \n375:291-298; Modis, Y. et al. 2003 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n100:6986-6991). These studies showed that the monomeric E polypeptide is folded into three distinct domains and that the E glycoprotein consists of a flat, elongated dimer structure with an interdomain ligand-binding pocket.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies reactive to flavivirus envelope proteins have been shown to mediate protection against homologous virus challenge in animal models (Mathews, J. H. and J. T. Roehrig 1984 \nJ. Immunol. \n132:1533-1537; Brandriss, M. W. et al. 1986 \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n67:229-234; Gould, E. A. et al. 1986 \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n67:591-595; Kaufman, B. M. et al. 1987 \nAm. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. \n36:427-434; Kimura-Kuroda, J., and K. Yasui 1988 \nJ. Virol. \n141:3606-3610). In most cases, protection by passive immunization has been correlated with the ability of these antibodies to neutralize the virus in vitro. Protection against dengue virus challenge was also demonstrated in mice following passive immunization with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies specific to prM (Bray, M., and C. J. Lai. 1991 \nVirology \n185:505-508; Kaufman, B M et al. 1987 \nAm. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. \n36:427-434) or NS1 (Falgout, B. et al. 1990. \nJ. Virol. \n64:4356-4363; Henchal, E. A. et al. 1988 \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n69:2101-2107).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost research efforts directed to the development of an attenuated live dengue vaccine have not yielded a satisfactory result. Recently, clinical evaluation was conducted on a genetically engineered DENV-4 mutant containing a 30-nucleotide deletion in the 3′ non-coding region that exhibited reduced replicative capacity in simian cell culture and in primates (Durbin, A. P. et al. 2001 \nAm. J. Trap. Med. Hyg, \n65:405-413; Men R., et al. 1996 \nJ. Virol. \n70:3930-3937). Following a single-dose inoculation, a total of 20 volunteers remained afebrile and exhibited very few clinical signs. Each of the vaccinees developed a high titer of DENV-4 neutralizing antibodies four to six weeks after immunization. However, five vaccinees showed an elevation of serum levels of the liver enzyme alanine transaminase (ALT). The ALT elevations were mostly transient and eventually subsided, but there remains a concern about the safety of a live dengue virus vaccine. Passive immunization with clinically acceptable dengue virus neutralizing antibodies provides an attractive alternative to prevention of dengue virus infection. Highly efficient neutralizing antibodies might also be useful for consideration as a possible therapy for severe dengue virus infection. Recently, a phage display of combinatorial antibody libraries has allowed for the isolation of antibodies against important viral pathogens from human or non-human primates (Persson, M. A. et al. 1991 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n88:2432-2436; Williamson, R. A. et al. 1993 \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. \n90:41413-4145 [Erratum 91:1193, 1994]; Burton, D. R. et al. 1994 \nScience \n266:1024-1027; Crowe, J. E. Jr. et al. 1994. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n91:1386-1390; Maruyama, T. et al. 1999 \nJ. Virol. \n73:6024-6030; Schofield, D. J. et al. 2000 \nJ. Virol. \n74:5548-5555).\n\n\n \nSEGUE TO THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the current study, we employed this technique to identify a panel of chimpanzee Fab antibodies against DENV-4. One of these Fab antibodies neutralized DENV-4 efficiently by an in vitro assay and was combined with human sequences to convert it to the whole immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody. The humanized chimpanzee IgG1 antibody produced in CHO cells neutralized DENV-4 efficiently.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to monoclonal antibodies that bind or neutralize \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3, and/or 4 virus. The invention provides such antibodies, fragments of such antibodies retaining dengue virus-binding ability, fully human or humanized antibodies retaining dengue virus-binding ability, and pharmaceutical compositions including such antibodies. The invention further provides for isolated nucleic acids encoding the antibodies of the invention and host cells transformed therewith. Additionally, the invention provides for prophylactic, therapeutic, and diagnostic methods employing the antibodies and nucleic acids of the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n.

Passive immunization using monoclonal antibodies from humans or non-human primates represents an attractive alternative for prevention of dengue virus infection. Fab monoclonal antibodies to \ndengue type\n 4 virus (DENV-4) were recovered by repertoire cloning of bone marrow mRNAs from an immune chimpanzee and analyzed for antigen binding specificity, Y\nR \nand V\nL \nsequences, and neutralizing activity against DENV-4 in vitro. Fabs 5A7, 3C1, 3E4 and 7G4 were isolated from a library constructed from a chimpanzee following intrahepatic transfection with infectious DENV-4 RNA. Fabs 5H2 and 5D9, which had nearly identical V\nH \nsequences, but varied in their V\nL \nsequences, were recovered from a library constructed from the same chimpanzee after superinfection with a mixture of DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3. In radioimmunoprecipitation, Fab 5A7 precipitated only DENV-4 prM, and Fabs 3E4, 7G4, 5D9 and 5H2 precipitated DENV-4 E but little or no prM. Fab 3E4 and Fab 7G4 competed with each other for binding to DENV-4 in and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as did Fab 3C1 and Fab 5A7. Fab 5H2 recognized an epitope on DENV-4 that was separate from the epitope(s) recognized by other Fabs. Both Fab 5H2 and Fab 5D9 neutralized DENV-4 efficiently with a titer of 0.24-0.58 μg/ml by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), whereas DENV-4 neutralizing activity of other Fabs was low or not detected. Fab 5H2 was converted to full-length IgG1 by combining it with human sequences. The humanized chimpanzee antibody IgG1 5H2 produced in CHO cells neutralized DENV-4 strains from different geographical origins at a similar 50% plaque reduction (PRNT\n50\n) titer of 0.03-0.05 μg/ml. The DENV-4 binding affinities were 0.42 nM for Fab 5H2 and 0.24 nM for full-length IgG1 5H2. Monoclonal antibody IgG1 5H2 is predicted to be invaluable for prophylactic and therapeutic application against dengue virus in humans.\n\n\n \nDefinitions\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “antibody” means an immunoglobulin molecule or a fragment of an immunoglobulin molecule having the ability to specifically bind to a particular antigen. Antibodies are well known to those of ordinary skill in the science of immunology. As used herein, the term “antibody” means not only full-length antibody molecules but also fragments of antibody molecules retaining antigen binding ability. Such fragments are also well known in the art and are regularly employed both in vitro and in vivo. In particular, as used herein, the term “antibody” means not only full-length immunoglobulin molecules but also antigen binding active fragments such as the well-known active fragments F(ab′)\n2\n, Fab, Fv, and Fd.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “dengue virus disease” means any disease caused, directly or indirectly, by one of the four serotypes of a dengue virus, which is a flavivirus. Dengue is an acute febrile disease characterized by sudden onset, with headache, fever, prostration, joint and muscle pain, lymphadenopathy, and a rash that appears simultaneously with a temperature rise. A second phase of temperature rise may appear following an afebrile period. Dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome is an acute disease occurring primarily in children characterized by an abrupt febrile onset followed by hemorrhagic manifestations and circulatory collapse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein with respect to polypeptides, the term “substantially pure” means that the polypeptides are essentially free of other substances with which they may be found in nature or in vivo systems to an extent practical and appropriate for their intended use. In particular, the polypeptides are sufficiently pure and are sufficiently free from other biological constituents of their host cells so as to be useful in, for example, generating antibodies, sequencing, or producing pharmaceutical preparations. By techniques well known in the art, substantially pure polypeptides may be produced in light of the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences disclosed herein. Because a substantially purified polypeptide of the invention may be admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in a pharmaceutical preparation, the polypeptide may comprise only a certain percentage by weight of the preparation. The polypeptide is nonetheless substantially pure in that it has been substantially separated from the substances with which it may be associated in living systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein with respect to nucleic acids, the term “isolated” means: (1) amplified in vitro by, for example, polymerase chain reaction (PCR); (ii) recombinantly produced by cloning; (iii) purified, as by cleavage and gel separation; or (iv) synthesized by, for example, chemical synthesis. An isolated nucleic acid is one which is readily manipulable by recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art. Thus, a nucleotide sequence contained in a vector in which 5′ and 3′ restriction sites are known or for which polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sequences have been disclosed is considered isolated but a nucleic acid sequence existing in its native state in its natural host is not. An isolated nucleic acid may be substantially purified, but need not be. For example, a nucleic acid that is isolated within a cloning or expression vector is not pure in that it may comprise only a tiny percentage of the material in the cell in which it resides. Such a nucleic acid is isolated, however, as the term is used herein because it is readily manipulable by standard techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a coding sequence and regulatory sequences are said to be “operably joined” when they are covalently linked in such a way as to place the expression or transcription of the coding sequence under the influence or control of the regulatory sequences. If it is desired that the coding sequences be translated into a functional protein, two DNA sequences are said to be operably joined if induction of a promoter in the 5′ regulatory sequences results in the transcription of the coding sequence and if the nature of the linkage between the two DNA sequences does not (1) result in the introduction of a frame-shift mutation, (2) interfere with the ability of the promoter region to direct the transcription of the coding sequences, or (3) interfere with the ability of the corresponding RNA transcript to be translated into a protein. Thus, a promoter region would be operably joined to a coding sequence if the promoter region were capable of effecting transcription of that DNA sequence such that the resulting transcript might be translated into the desired protein or polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe precise nature of the regulatory sequences needed for gene expression may vary between species or cell types, but shall in general include, as necessary, 5′ non-transcribing and 5′ non-translating sequences involved with initiation of transcription and translation respectively, such as a TATA box, capping sequence, CAAT sequence, and the like. Especially, such 5′ non-transcribing regulatory sequences will include a promoter region which includes a promoter sequence for transcriptional control of the operably joined gene. Regulatory sequences may also include enhancer sequences or upstream activator sequences, as desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “vector” may be any of a number of nucleic acids into which a desired sequence may be inserted by restriction and ligation for transport between different genetic environments or for expression in a host cell. Vectors are typically composed of DNA although RNA vectors are also available. Vectors include, but are not limited to, plasmids and phagemids. A cloning vector is one which is able to replicate in a host cell, and which is further characterized by one or more endonuclease restriction sites at which the vector may be cut in a determinable fashion and into which a desired DNA sequence may be ligated such that the new recombinant vector retains its ability to replicate in the host cell. In the case of plasmids, replication of the desired sequence may occur many times as the plasmid increases in copy number within the host bacterium or just a single time per host before the host reproduces by mitosis. In the case of phage, replication may occur actively during a lytic phase or passively during a lysogenic phase. An expression vector is one into which a desired DNA sequence may be inserted by restriction and ligation such that it is operably joined to regulatory sequences and may be expressed as an RNA transcript. Vectors may further contain one or more marker sequences suitable for use in the identification and selection of cells which have been transformed or transfected with the vector. Markers include, for example, genes encoding proteins which increase or decrease either resistance or sensitivity to antibiotics or other compounds, genes which encode enzymes whose activities are detectable by standard assays known in the art (e.g., B-galactosidase or alkaline phosphatase), and genes which visibly affect the phenotype of transformed or transfected cells, hosts, colonies or plaques. Preferred vectors are those capable of autonomous replication and expression of the structural gene products present in the DNA segments to which they are operably joined.\n\n\n \nNovel Anti-DENV-4 Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention derives, in part, from the isolation and characterization of a novel chimpanzee Fab fragment and its humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds and neutralizes \ndengue type\n 4 virus and that we have designated 5H2. As described more fully herein, this new monoclonal antibody has been shown to bind and neutralize the \ndengue type\n 4 virus. The paratope of the 5H2 Fab fragment associated with the neutralization epitope on the \ndengue type\n 4 virus is defined by the amino acid (aa) sequences of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain V-regions depicted in \nFIG. 2\n and SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 9. The nucleic acid sequences coding for these as sequences were identified as described in \nProtocol\n 1, by sequencing the Fab heavy chain and light chain fragments. Due to the degeneracy of the DNA code, the paratope is more properly defined by the derived as sequences depicted in \nFIG. 2\n and SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention derives, additionally in part, from the isolation and characterization of novel chimpanzee Fab monoclonal antibodies that selectively bind and precipitate \ndengue type\n 4 virus prM or E glycoproteins that we have designated 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, 5H2, and. 5D9. As described more fully herein, these new monoclonal antibodies have been shown to bind and precipitate the \ndengue type\n 4 virus prM or E glycoproteins. The paratopes of the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, 5H2, and 5D9 Fab fragments associated with the epitopes on the \ndengue type\n 4 virus are defined by the amino acid (aa) sequences of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain V-regions depicted in \nFIG. 2\n and, for 5A7, SEQ ID NO: 17 and SEQ ID NO: 25;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nfor 3C1, SEQ ID NO: 33 and SEQ ID NO: 41;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nfor 3E4, SEQ ID NO: 49 and SEQ ID NO: 57;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nfor 7G4, SEQ ID NO: 65 and SEQ ID NO: 73; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nfor 5D9, SEQ ID NO: 81 and SEQ ID NO: 89.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one set of embodiments, the present invention provides the full-length, humanized monoclonal antibody of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody in isolated form and in pharmaceutical preparations. Similarly, as described herein, the present invention provides isolated nucleic acids, host cells transformed with nucleic acids, and pharmaceutical preparations including isolated nucleic acids, encoding the full-length, humanized monoclonal antibody of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody. Finally, the present invention provides methods, as described more fully herein, employing these antibodies and nucleic acids in the in vitro and in vivo diagnosis, prevention and therapy of dengue virus disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSignificantly, as is well-known in the art, only a small portion of an antibody molecule, the paratope, is involved in the binding of the antibody to its epitope (see, in general, Clark, W. R. (1986) \nThe Experimental Foundations of Modern Immunology \nWiley & Sons, Inc., New York; Roitt, I. (1991) \nEssential Immunology, \n7th Ed., Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford). The pFc′ and Fc regions, for example, are effectors of the complement cascade but are not involved in antigen binding. An antibody from which the pFc′ region has been enzymatically cleaved, or which has been produced without the pFc′ region, designated an F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment, retains both of the antigen binding sites of a full-length antibody. Similarly, an antibody from which the Fc region has been enzymatically cleaved, or which has been produced without the Fc region, designated an Fab fragment, retains one of the antigen binding sites of a full-length antibody molecule. Proceeding further, Fab fragments consist of a covalently bound antibody light chain and a portion of the antibody heavy chain denoted Fd. The Fd fragments are the major determinant of antibody specificity (a single Fd fragment may be associated with up to ten different light chains without altering antibody specificity) and Fd fragments retain epitope-binding ability in isolation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithin the antigen-binding portion of an antibody, as is well-known in the art, there are complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which directly interact with the epitope of the antigen, and framework regions (FRs), which maintain the tertiary structure of the paratope (see, in general, Clark, 1986, supra; Roitt, 1991, supra). In both the heavy chain Fd fragment and the light chain of IgG immunoglobulins, there are four framework regions (FRI through FR4) separated respectively by three complementarity determining regions (CDR1 through CDR3). The CDRs, and in particular the CDR3 regions, and more particularly the heavy chain CDR3, are largely responsible for antibody specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe complete amino acid sequences of the antigen-binding Fab portion of the 5H2 monoclonal antibody as well as the relevant FR and CDR regions are disclosed herein.

The amino acid sequences of the light chain FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4 regions are disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 90 through SEQ ID NO: 96, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is now well-established in the art that the non-CDR regions of a mammalian antibody may be replaced with similar regions of conspecific or heterospecific antibodies while retaining the epitopic specificity of the original antibody. This is most clearly manifested in the development and use of “humanized” antibodies in which non-human CDRs are covalently joined to human FR and/or Fc/pFc′ regions to produce a functional antibody. Thus, for example, PCT International Publication Number WO 92/04381 teaches the production and use of humanized murine RSV antibodies in which at least a portion of the murine FR regions have been replaced by FR regions of human origin. Such antibodies, including fragments of full-length antibodies with antigen-binding ability, are often referred to as “chimeric” antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the present invention also provides for F(ab′)\n2\n, Fab, Fv and Fd fragments of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody; chimeric antibodies in which the Fc and/or FR and/or CDR1 and/or CDR2 and/or light chain CDR3 regions of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, have been replaced by homologous human or non-human sequences; chimeric F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment antibodies in which the FR and/or CDR1 and/or CDR2 and/or light chain CDR3 regions of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, have been replaced by homologous human or non-human sequences; chimeric Fab fragment antibodies in which the FR and/or CDR1 and/or CDR2 and/or light chain CDR3 regions have been replaced by homologous human or non-human sequences; and chimeric Fd fragment antibodies in which the FR and/or CDR1 and/or CDR2 regions have been replaced by homologous human or non-human sequences. Thus, those skilled in the art may alter the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, by the construction of CDR grafted or chimeric antibodies or antibody fragments containing all, or part thereof, of the disclosed heavy and light chain V-region CDR as sequences (Jones, P. T. et al. 1986. \nNature \n321:522; Verhoeyen, M. et al. 1988 \nScience \n39:1534; and Tempest, P. R. et al. 1991 \nBio/Technology \n9:266), without destroying the specificity of the antibodies for the \ndengue type\n 4 virus epitope. Such CDR grafted or chimeric antibodies or antibody fragments can be effective in prevention and treatment of dengue infection in animals (e.g. cattle) and man.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, the chimeric antibodies of the invention are fully human or humanized chimpanzee monoclonal antibodies including at least the heavy chain CDR3 region of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody. As noted above, such chimeric antibodies may be produced in which some or all of the FR regions of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, have been replaced by other homologous human FR regions. In addition, the Fc portions may be replaced so as to produce IgA or IgM as well as IgG antibodies bearing some or all of the CDRs of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody. Of particular importance is the inclusion of the heavy chain CDR3 region and, to a lesser extent, the other CDRs of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody. Such fully human or humanized chimpanzee monoclonal antibodies will have particular utility in that they will not evoke an immune response against the antibody itself.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible, in accordance with the present invention, to produce chimeric antibodies including non-human sequences. Thus, one may use, for example, murine, ovine, equine, bovine or other mammalian Fc or FR sequences to replace some or all of the Fc or FR regions of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody. Some of the CDRs may be replaced as well. Again, however, it is preferred that at least the heavy chain CDR3 of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, be included in such chimeric antibodies and, to a lesser extent, it is also preferred that some or all of the other CDRs of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, be included. Such chimeric antibodies bearing non-human immunoglobulin sequences admixed with the CDRs of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, are not preferred for use in humans and are particularly not preferred for extended use because they may evoke an immune response against the non-human sequences. They may, of course, be used for brief periods or in immunosuppressed individuals but, again, fully human or humanized chimpanzee monoclonal antibodies are preferred. Because such antibodies may be used for brief periods or in immunosuppressed subjects, chimeric antibodies bearing non-human mammalian Fc and FR sequences but including at least the heavy chain CDR3 of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, are contemplated as alternative embodiments of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor inoculation or prophylactic uses, the antibodies of the present invention are preferably full-length antibody molecules including the Fc region. Such full-length antibodies will have longer half-lives than smaller fragment antibodies (e.g. Fab) and are more suitable for intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intracavity, subcutaneous, or transdermal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, Fab fragments, including chimeric Fab fragments, are preferred. Fabs offer several advantages over F(ab′)\n2 \nand whole immunoglobulin molecules for this therapeutic modality. First, because Fabs have only one binding site for their cognate antigen, the formation of immune complexes is precluded whereas such complexes, can be generated when bivalent F(ab′)\n2 \ns and whole immunoglobulin molecules encounter their target antigen. This is of some importance because immune complex deposition in tissues can produce adverse inflammatory reactions. Second, because Fabs lack an Fc region they cannot trigger adverse inflammatory reactions that are activated by Fc, such as activation of the complement cascade. Third, the tissue penetration of the small Fab molecule is likely to be much better than that of the larger whole antibody. Fourth, Fabs can be produced easily and inexpensively in bacteria, such as \nE. coli, \nwhereas whole immunoglobulin antibody molecules require mammalian cells for their production in useful amounts. The latter entails transfection of immunoglobulin sequences into mammalian cells with resultant transformation. Amplification of these sequences must then be achieved by rigorous selective procedures and stable transformants must be identified and maintained. The whole immunoglobulin molecules must be produced by stably transformed, high expression mammalian cells in culture with the attendant problems of serum-containing culture medium. In contrast, production of Fabs in \nE. coli \neliminates these difficulties and makes it possible to produce these antibody fragments in large fermenters which are less expensive than cell culture-derived products.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to Fabs, smaller antibody fragments and epitope-binding peptides having binding specificity for the epitope defined by the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, are also contemplated by the present invention and can also be used to bind or neutralize the virus. For example, single chain antibodies can be constructed according to the method of U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778, to Ladner et al. Single chain antibodies comprise the variable regions of the light and heavy chains joined by a flexible linker moiety. Yet smaller is the antibody fragment known as the single domain antibody or Fd, which comprises an isolated VH single domain. Techniques for obtaining a single domain antibody with at least some of the binding specificity of the full-length antibody from which they are derived are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is possible to determine, without undue experimentation, if an altered or chimeric antibody has the same specificity as the antibody of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, of the invention by ascertaining whether the former blocks the latter from binding to \ndengue type\n 4 virus. If the monoclonal antibody being tested competes with the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, as shown by a decrease in binding of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, then it is likely that the two monoclonal antibodies bind to the same, or a closely spaced, epitope. Still another way to determine whether a monoclonal antibody has the specificity of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, of the invention is to pre-incubate the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, with \ndengue type\n 4 virus with which it is normally reactive, and then add the monoclonal antibody being tested to determine if the monoclonal antibody being tested is inhibited in its ability to bind \ndengue type\n 4 virus. If the monoclonal antibody being tested is inhibited then, in all likelihood, it has the same, or a functionally equivalent, epitope and specificity as the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, of the invention. Screening of monoclonal antibodies of the invention also can be carried out utilizing \ndengue type\n 4 virus and determining whether the monoclonal antibody neutralizes \ndengue type\n 4 virus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy using the antibodies of the invention, it is now possible to produce anti-idiotypic antibodies which can be used to screen other monoclonal antibodies to identify whether the antibody has the same binding specificity as an antibody of the invention. In addition, such antiidiotypic antibodies can be used for active immunization (Herlyn, D. et al. 1986 \nScience \n232:100). Such anti-idiotypic antibodies can be produced using well-known hybridoma techniques (Kohler, G. and Milstein, C. 1975 \nNature \n256:495). An anti-idiotypic antibody is an antibody which recognizes unique determinants present on the monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line of interest. These determinants are located in the hypervariable region of the antibody. It is this region which binds to a given epitope and, thus, is responsible for the specificity of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn anti-idiotypic antibody can be prepared by immunizing an animal with the monoclonal antibody of interest. The immunized animal will recognize and respond to the idiotypic determinants of the immunizing antibody and produce an antibody to these idiotypic determinants. By using the anti-idiotypic antibodies of the immunized animal, which are specific for the monoclonal antibodies of the invention, it is possible to identify other clones with the same idiotype as the antibody of the hybridoma used for immunization. Idiotypic identity between monoclonal antibodies of two cell lines demonstrates that the two monoclonal antibodies are the same with respect to their recognition of the same epitopic determinant. Thus, by using anti-idiotypic antibodies, it is possible to identify other hybridomas expressing monoclonal antibodies having the same epitopic specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible to use the anti-idiotype technology to produce monoclonal antibodies which mimic an epitope. For example, an anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody made to a first monoclonal antibody will have a binding domain in the hypervariable region which is the image of the epitope bound by the first monoclonal antibody. Thus, the anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody can be used for immunization, since the anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody binding domain effectively acts as an antigen.\n\n\n \nNucleic Acids Encoding Anti-DENV-4 Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nGiven the disclosure herein of the amino acid sequences of the heavy chain Fd and light chain variable domains of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, one of ordinary skill in the art is now enabled to produce nucleic acids which encode this antibody or which encode the various fragment antibodies or chimeric antibodies described above. It is contemplated that such nucleic acids will be operably joined to other nucleic acids forming a recombinant vector for cloning or for expression of the antibodies of the invention. The present invention includes any recombinant vector containing the coding sequences, or part thereof, whether for prokaryotic or eukaryotic transformation, transfection or gene therapy. Such vectors may be prepared using conventional molecular biology techniques, known to those with skill in the art, and would comprise DNA coding sequences for the immunoglobulin. V-regions of the 5H2 antibody, or the 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, 7G4, or 5D9 antibody or \nother dengue type\n 4 virus antibody, including framework and CDRs or parts thereof, and a suitable promoter either with (Whittle, N. et al. 1987 \nProtein Eng. \n1:499 and Burton, D. R. et al. 1994 \nScience \n266:1024) or without (Marasco, W. A. et al. 1993 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n(\nUSA\n) 90:7889 and Duan, L. et al. 1994 \nProc. Natl. Acad, Sci. \n(\nUSA\n) 91:5075) a signal sequence for export or secretion. Such vectors may be transformed or transfected into prokaryotic (Huse, W. D. et al. 1989 \nScience \n246:1275; Ward, S. et al. 1989 \nNature \n341:544; Marks, J. D. et al. 1991 \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222:581; and Barbas, C. F. et al. 1991 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n(\nUSA\n) 88:7987) or eukaryotic (Whittle, N. et al. 1987 \nProtein Eng. \n1:499 and Burton, D. R. et al. 1994 \nScience \n266:1024) cells or used for gene therapy (Marasco, W. A. et al. 1993 \nProc. Natl. Acad, Sci. \n(\nUSA\n) 90:7889 and Duan, L. et al. 1994 \nProc. Natl. Acad, Sci. \n(\nUSA\n) 91:5075) by conventional techniques, known to those with skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression vectors of the present invention include regulatory sequences operably joined to a nucleotide sequence encoding one of the antibodies of the invention. As used herein, the term “regulatory sequences” means nucleotide sequences which are necessary for or conducive to the transcription of a nucleotide sequence which encodes a desired polypeptide and/or which are necessary for or conducive to the translation of the resulting transcript into the desired polypeptide. Regulatory sequences include, but are not limited to, 5′ sequences such as operators, promoters and ribosome binding sequences, and 3′ sequences such as polyadenylation signals. The vectors of the invention may optionally include 5′ leader or signal sequences, 5′ or 3′ sequences encoding fusion products to aid in protein purification, and various markers which aid in the identification or selection of transformants. The choice and design of an appropriate vector is within the ability and discretion of one of ordinary skill in the art. The subsequent purification of the antibodies may be accomplished by any of a variety of standard means known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred vector for screening monoclonal antibodies, but not necessarily preferred for the mass production of the antibodies of the invention, is a recombinant DNA molecule containing a nucleotide sequence that codes for and is capable of expressing a fusion polypeptide containing, in the direction of amino- to carboxy-terminus, (1) a prokaryotic secretion signal domain, (2) a polypeptide of the invention, and, optionally, (3) a fusion protein domain. The vector includes DNA regulatory sequences for expressing the fusion polypeptide, preferably prokaryotic, regulatory sequences. Such vectors can be constructed by those with skill in the art and have been described by Smith, G. P. et al. (1985 \nScience \n228:1315); Clackson, T. et al. (1991 \nNature \n352:624); Kang et al. (1991 in “Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. Vol. 2”; R. A. Lerner and D. R. Burton, ed. Academic Press, NY, pp 111-118); Barbas, C. F. et al. (1991 \nProc, Natl. Acad. Sci. \n(\nUSA\n) 88:7978), Roberts, B. L. et al. (1992 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n(\nUSA\n) 89:2429).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fusion polypeptide may be useful for purification of the antibodies of the invention. The fusion domain may, for example, include a poly-His tail which allows for purification on Ni+ columns or the maltose binding protein of the commercially available vector pMAL (New England BioLabs, Beverly, Mass.). A currently preferred, but by no means necessary, fusion domain is a filamentous phage membrane anchor. This domain is particularly useful for screening phage display libraries of monoclonal antibodies but may be of less utility for the mass production of antibodies. The filamentous phage membrane anchor is preferably a domain of the cpIII or cpVIII coat protein capable of associating with the matrix of a filamentous phage particle, thereby incorporating the fusion polypeptide onto the phage surface, to enable solid phase binding to specific antigens or epitopes and thereby allow enrichment and selection of the specific antibodies or fragments encoded by the phagemid vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe secretion signal is a leader peptide domain of a protein that targets the protein to the membrane of the host cell, such as the periplasmic membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. A preferred secretion signal for \nE. coli \nis a pelB secretion signal. The leader sequence of the pelB protein has previously been used as a secretion signal for fusion proteins (Better, M. et al. 1988 \nScience \n240:1041; Sastry, L. et al. 1989 \nProc, Natl. Acad. Sci \n(\nUSA\n) 86:5728; and Mullinax, R. L. et al., 1990 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n87:8095). Amino acid residue sequences for other secretion signal polypeptide domains from \nE. coli \nuseful in this invention can be found in Neidhard, F. C. (ed.), 1987 \nEscherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium: Typhimurium Cellular and Molecular Biology, \nAmerican Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo achieve high levels of gene expression in \nE. coli, \nit is necessary to use not only strong promoters to generate large quantities of mRNA, but also ribosome binding sites to ensure that the mRNA is efficiently translated. In \nE. coli, \nthe ribosome binding site includes an initiation codon (AUG) and a sequence 3-9 nucleotides long located 3-11 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon (Shine et al. 1975 \nNature \n254:34). The sequence, which is called the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, is complementary to the 3′ end of \nE. coli \n16S rRNA. Binding of the ribosome to mRNA and the sequence at the 3′ end of the mRNA can be affected by several factors: the degree of complementarity between the SD sequence and 3′ end of the 16S rRNA; the spacing lying between the SD sequence and the AUG; and the nucleotide sequence following the AUG, which affects ribosome binding. The 3′ regulatory sequences define at least one termination (stop) codon in frame with and operably joined to the heterologous fusion polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments with a prokaryotic expression host, the vector utilized includes a prokaryotic origin of replication or replicon, i.e., a DNA sequence having the ability to direct autonomous replication and maintenance of the recombinant DNA molecule extrachromosomally in a prokaryotic host cell, such as a bacterial host cell, transformed therewith. Such origins of replication are well known in the art. Preferred origins of replication are those that are efficient in the host organism. A preferred host cell is \nE. coli. \nFor use of a vector in \nE. coli, \na preferred origin of replication is ColEI found in pBR322 and a variety of other common plasmids. Also preferred is the p15A origin of replication found on pACYC and its derivatives. The ColEI and p15A replicons have been extensively utilized in molecular biology, are available on a variety of plasmids and are described by Sambrook. et al. 1989 \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, \n2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, those embodiments that include a prokaryotic replicon preferably also include a gene whose expression confers a selective advantage, such as drug resistance, to a bacterial host transformed therewith. Typical bacterial drug resistance genes are those that confer resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, neomycin/kanamycin or chloramphenicol. Vectors typically also contain convenient restriction sites for insertion of translatable DNA sequences. Exemplary vectors are the plasmids pUC18 and pUC19 and derived vectors such as those commercially available from suppliers such as Invitrogen, (San Diego, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the antibodies of the invention include both heavy chain and light chain sequences, these sequences may be encoded on separate vectors or, more conveniently, may be expressed by a single vector. The heavy and light chain may, after translation or after secretion, form the heterodimeric structure of natural antibody molecules. Such a heterodimeric antibody may or may not be stabilized by disulfide bonds between the heavy and light chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector for expression of heterodimeric antibodies, such as the full-length antibodies of the invention or the F(ab′)\n2\n, Fab or Fv fragment antibodies of the invention, is a recombinant DNA molecule adapted for receiving and expressing translatable first and second DNA sequences. That is, a DNA expression vector for expressing a heterodimeric antibody provides a system for independently cloning (inserting) the two translatable DNA sequences into two separate cassettes present in the vector, to form two separate cistrons for expressing the first and second polypeptides of a heterodimeric antibody. The DNA expression vector for expressing two cistrons is referred to as a di-cistronic expression vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the vector comprises a first cassette that includes upstream and downstream DNA regulatory sequences operably joined via a sequence of nucleotides adapted for directional ligation to an insert DNA. The upstream translatable sequence preferably encodes the secretion signal as described above. The cassette includes DNA regulatory sequences for expressing the first antibody polypeptide that is produced when an insert translatable DNA sequence (insert DNA) is directionally inserted into the cassette via the sequence of nucleotides adapted for directional ligation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dicistronic expression vector also contains a second cassette for expressing the second antibody polypeptide. The second cassette includes a second translatable DNA sequence that preferably encodes a secretion signal, as described above, operably joined at its 3′ terminus via a sequence of nucleotides adapted for directional ligation to a downstream DNA sequence of the vector that typically defines at least one stop codon in the reading frame of the cassette. The second translatable DNA sequence is operably joined at its 5′ terminus to DNA regulatory sequences forming the 5′ elements. The second cassette is capable, upon insertion of a translatable DNA sequence (insert DNA), of expressing the second fusion polypeptide comprising a secretion signal with a polypeptide coded by the insert DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention may additionally, of course, be produced by eukaryotic cells such as CHO cells, human or mouse hybridomas, immortalized B-lymphoblastoid cells, and the like. In this case, a vector is constructed in which eukaryotic regulatory sequences are operably joined to the nucleotide sequences encoding the antibody polypeptide or polypeptides. The design and selection of an appropriate eukaryotic vector is within the ability and discretion of one of ordinary skill in the art. The subsequent purification of the antibodies may be accomplished by any of a variety of standard means known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention may furthermore, of course, be produced in plants. In 1989, Hiatt et al. 1989 \nNature \n342:76 first demonstrated that functional antibodies could be produced in transgenic plants. Since then, a considerable amount of effort has been invested in developing plants for antibody (or “plantibody”) production (for reviews see Giddings, G. et al., 2000 \nNat Biotechnol \n18:1151; Fischer, R. and Emans, N., 2000, \nTransgenic Res \n9:279). Recombinant antibodies can be targeted to seeds, tubers, or fruits, making administration of antibodies in such plant tissues advantageous for immunization programs in developing countries and worldwide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides host cells, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, transformed or transfected with, and therefore including, the vectors of the present invention.\n\n\n \nDiagnostic and Pharmaceutical Anti-DENV-4 Antibody Preparations\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to a method for preparing diagnostic or pharmaceutical compositions comprising the monoclonal antibodies of the invention or polynucleotide sequences encoding the antibodies of the invention or part thereof, the pharmaceutical compositions being used for immunoprophylaxis or immunotherapy of dengue virus disease. The pharmaceutical preparation includes a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such carriers, as used herein, means a non-toxic material that does not interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredients. The term “physiologically acceptable” refers to a non-toxic material that is compatible with a biological system such as a cell, cell culture, tissue, or organism. The characteristics of the carrier will depend on the route of administration. Physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include diluents, fillers, salts, buffers, stabilizers, solubilizers, and other materials which are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred embodiment of the invention relates to monoclonal antibodies whose heavy chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 7, and/or whose light chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 15; whose heavy chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 23, and/or whose light chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 31; whose heavy chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 39, and/or whose light chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 47; whose heavy chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 55, and/or whose light chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 63; whose heavy chairs comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 71, and/or whose light chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 79; whose heavy chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 87, and/or whose light chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 95; and conservative variations of these peptides. Also encompassed by the present invention are certain amino acid sequences that bind to epitopic sequences in prM or E of \ndengue type\n 4 virus and that confer neutralization of \ndengue type\n 4 virus when bound thereto. The term “conservative variation” as used herein denotes the replacement of an amino acid residue by another, biologically similar residue. Examples of conservative variations include the substitution of one hydrophobic residue such as isoleucine, valine, leucine or methionine for another, or the substitution of one polar residue for another, such as the substitution of arginine for lysine, glutamic for aspartic acids, or glutamine for asparagine, and the like. The term “conservative variation” also includes the use of a substituted amino acid in place of an unsubstituted parent amino acid provided that antibodies having the substituted polypeptide also bind or neutralize \ndengue type\n 4 virus. Analogously, another preferred embodiment of the invention relates to polynucleotides which encode the above noted heavy chain polypeptides and to polynucleotide sequences which are complementary to these polynucleotide sequences. Complementary polynucleotide sequences include those sequences that hybridize to the polynucleotide sequences of the invention under stringent hybridization conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nanti-dengue type\n 4 virus antibodies of the invention may be labeled by a variety of means for use in diagnostic and/or pharmaceutical applications. There are many different labels and methods of labeling known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples of the types of labels which can be used in the present invention include enzymes, radioisotopes, fluorescent compounds, colloidal metals, chemiluminescent compounds, and bioluminescent compounds. Those of ordinary skill in the art will know of other suitable labels for binding to the monoclonal antibodies of the invention, or will be able to ascertain such, using routine experimentation. Furthermore, the binding of these labels to the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be done using standard techniques common to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother labeling technique which may result in greater sensitivity consists of coupling the antibodies to low molecular weight haptens. These haptens can then be specifically altered by means of a second reaction. For example, it is common to use haptens such as biotin, which reacts with avidin, or dinitrophenol, pyridoxal, or fluorescein, which can react with specific antihapten antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe materials for use in the assay of the invention are ideally suited for the preparation of a kit. Such a kit may comprise a carrier means being compartmentalized to receive in close confinement one or more container means such as vials, tubes, and the like, each of the container means comprising one of the separate elements to be used in the method. For example, one of the container means may comprise a monoclonal antibody of the invention that is, or can be, detectably labeled. The kit may also have containers containing buffer(s) and/or a container comprising a reporter-means, such as a biotin-binding protein, such as avidin or streptavidin, bound to a reporter molecule, such as an enzymatic or fluorescent label.\n\n\n \nIn Vitro Detection and Diagnostics\n\n\n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies of the invention are suited for in vitro use, for example, in immunoassays in which they can be utilized in liquid phase or bound to a solid phase carrier. In addition, the monoclonal antibodies in these immunoassays can be detectably labeled in various ways. Examples of types of immunoassays which can utilize the monoclonal antibodies of the invention are competitive and non-competitive immunoassays in either a direct or indirect format. Examples of such immunoassays are the radioimmunoassay (RIA) and the sandwich (immunometric) assay. Detection of antigens using the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be done utilizing immunoassays which are run in either the forward, reverse, or simultaneous modes, including immunohistochemical assays on physiological samples. Those of skill in the art will know, or can readily discern, other immunoassay formats without undue experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be bound to many different carriers and used to detect the presence of \ndengue type\n 4 virus. Examples of well-known carriers include glass, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, dextran, nylon, amylase, natural and modified cellulose, polyacrylamide, agarose and magnetite. The nature of the carrier can be either soluble or insoluble for purposes of the invention. Those skilled in the art will know of other suitable carriers for binding monoclonal antibodies, or will be able to ascertain such, using routine experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor purposes of the invention, \ndengue type\n 4 virus may be detected by the monoclonal antibodies of the invention when present in biological fluids and tissues. Any sample containing a detectable amount of \ndengue type\n 4 virus can be used. A sample can be a liquid such as urine, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, serum or the like; a solid or semi-solid such as tissues, feces, or the like; or, alternatively, a solid tissue such as those commonly used in histological diagnosis.\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Detection of DENV-4\n\n\n \n \n \nIn using the monoclonal antibodies of the invention for the in vivo detection of antigen, the detectably labeled monoclonal antibody is given in a dose which is diagnostically effective. The term “diagnostically effective” means that the amount of detectably labeled monoclonal antibody is administered in sufficient quantity to enable detection of the site having the \ndengue type\n 4 virus antigen for which the monoclonal antibodies are specific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concentration of detectably labeled monoclonal antibody which is administered should be sufficient such that the binding to \ndengue type\n 4 virus is detectable compared to the background. Further, it is desirable that the detectably labeled monoclonal antibody be rapidly cleared from the circulatory system in order to give the best target-to-background signal ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a rule, the dosage of detectably labeled monoclonal antibody for in vivo diagnosis will vary depending on such factors as age, sex, and extent of disease of the individual. The dosage of monoclonal antibody can vary from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, most preferably about 0.1 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg. Such dosages may vary, for example, depending on whether multiple injections are given, on the tissue being assayed, and other factors known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor in vivo diagnostic imaging, the type of detection instrument available is a major factor in selecting an appropriate radioisotope. The radioisotope chosen must have a type of decay which is detectable for the given type of instrument. Still another important factor in selecting a radioisotope for in vivo diagnosis is that the half-life of the radioisotope be long enough such that it is still detectable at the time of maximum uptake by the target, but short enough such that deleterious radiation with respect to the host is acceptable. Ideally, a radioisotope used for in vivo imaging will lack a particle emission but produce a large number of photons in the 140-250 keV range, which may be readily detected by conventional gamma cameras.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor in vivo diagnosis, radioisotopes may be bound to immunoglobulin either directly or indirectly by using an intermediate functional group. Intermediate functional groups which often are used to bind radioisotopes which exist as metallic ions are the bifunctional chelating agents such as diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (DTPA) and ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and similar molecules. Typical examples of metallic ions which can be bound to the monoclonal antibodies of the invention are \n111\nIn, \n97\nRu, \n67\nGa, \n68\nGa, \n72\nAs, \n89\nZr and \n201\nTl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies of the invention can also be labeled with a paramagnetic isotope for purposes of in vivo diagnosis, as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or electron spin resonance (ESR). In general, any conventional method for visualizing diagnostic imaging can be utilized. Usually gamma and positron emitting radioisotopes are used for camera imaging and paramagnetic isotopes for MRI. Elements which are particularly useful in such techniques include \n157\nGd, \n55\nMn, \n162\nDy, \n52\nCr and \n56\nFe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be used in vitro and in vivo to monitor the course of dengue virus disease therapy. Thus, for example, by measuring the increase or decrease in the number of cells infected with \ndengue type\n 4 virus or changes in the concentration of \ndengue type\n 4 virus present in the body or in various body fluids, it would be possible to determine whether a particular therapeutic regimen aimed at ameliorating dengue virus disease is effective.\n\n\n \nProphylaxis and Therapy of Dengue Virus Disease\n\n\n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies can also be used in prophylaxis and as therapy for dengue virus disease in humans. The terms, “prophylaxis” and “therapy” as used herein in conjunction with the monoclonal antibodies of the invention denote both prophylactic as well as therapeutic administration and both passive immunization with substantially purified polypeptide products, as well as gene therapy by transfer of polynucleotide sequences encoding the product or part thereof. Thus, the monoclonal antibodies can be administered to high-risk subjects in order to lessen the likelihood and/or severity of dengue virus disease or administered to subjects already evidencing active dengue virus infection. In the present invention, Fab fragments also bind or neutralize \ndengue type\n 4 virus and therefore may be used to treat dengue virus infection but full-length antibody molecules are otherwise preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “prophylactically effective amount” of the monoclonal antibodies of the invention is a dosage large enough to produce the desired effect in the protection of individuals against dengue virus infection for a reasonable period of time, such as one to two months or longer following administration. A prophylactically effective amount is not, however, a dosage so large as to cause adverse side effects, such as hyperviscosity syndromes, pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and the like. Generally, a prophylactically effective amount may vary with the subject's age, condition, and sex, as well as the extent of the disease in the subject and can be determined by one of skill in the art. The dosage of the prophylactically effective amount may be adjusted by the individual physician or veterinarian in the event of any complication. A prophylactically effective amount may vary from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, most preferably from about 0.2 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg, in one or more administrations (priming and boosting).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “therapeutically effective amount” of the monoclonal antibodies of the invention is a dosage large enough to produce the desired effect in which the symptoms of dengue virus disease are ameliorated or the likelihood of infection is decreased. A therapeutically effective amount is not, however, a dosage so large as to cause adverse side effects, such as hyperviscosity syndromes, pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and the like. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount may vary with the subject's age, condition, and sex, as well as the extent of the disease in the subject and can be determined by one of skill in the art. The dosage of the therapeutically effective amount may be adjusted by the individual physician or veterinarian in the event of any complication. A therapeutically effective amount may vary from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, most preferably from about 0.2 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg, in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or several days. Preferred is administration of the antibody for 2 to 5 or more consecutive days in order to avoid “rebound” of virus replication from occurring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be administered by injection or by gradual infusion over time. The administration of the monoclonal antibodies of the invention may, for example, be intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intracavity, subcutaneous, or transdermal. Techniques for preparing injectate or infusate delivery systems containing antibodies are well known to those of skill in the art. Generally, such systems should utilize components which will not significantly impair the biological properties of the antibodies, such as the paratope binding capacity (see, for example, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n18th edition, 1990, Mack Publishing). Those of skill in the art can readily determine the various parameters and conditions for producing antibody injectates or infusates without resort to undue experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers (such as those based on Ringer's dextrose), and the like. Preservatives and other additives may also be present such as, for example, antimicrobials, anti-oxidants, chelating agents, and the like.\n\n\n \nMonoclonal Antibodies that Bind or Neutralize \nDengue Type\n 4 Virus\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo chimpanzees (#1616 and #1618) were intrahepatically transfected with the full-length RNA transcripts of cloned DENV-4 cDNA (Lai, C. J. et al. 1991 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. \n88:5139-5143). Four weeks after inoculation, these chimpanzees showed transient mild serum ALT elevations and became sero-positive for DENV-4, indicating that both animals were infected. At 9 weeks, the antibodies against DENV-4 reached a 50% plaque reduction (PRNT\n50\n) titer of 1/992 and 1/1065, respectively. This level of neutralizing antibodies was comparable to that in rhesus monkeys infected with DENV-4 by a subcutaneous route (Men R., et al. 1996 \nJ. Virol. \n70:3930-3937). To increase the repertoire of dengue virus-specific antibodies, both chimpanzees were inoculated with a mixture of DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3, each at 10\n6 \nPFU/dose, 9.5 months after DENV-4 RNA transfection. Both chimpanzees developed moderate to high PRNT\n50 \ntiters of antibodies against DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3 (Table 1), indicating that the chimpanzees were infected with each of these viruses. Meanwhile, the PRNT\n50 \nantibody titer against DENV-4 increased approximately 2 fold following infection with DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3.\n\n\n \nChimpanzee Combinatorial Fab Antibody Libraries.\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo phagemid libraries were constructed from bone marrow mRNA of chimpanzee #1618 as follows: (i) library D4 was prepared from the chimpanzee after intrahepatic inoculation with DENV-4 RNA, and (ii) library D1-4 was prepared from the same animal after infection with a mixture of the other three dengue serotype viruses. Phage library D4 was panned three successive rounds against DENV-4 virions immobilized directly on an ELISA plate. After the third panning cycle, plasmid was isolated and cleaved with SpeI and NheI for the expression of soluble Fabs. Library D1-4 was panned for three successive rounds against DENV-4 virions captured by chimpanzee antibodies that were used to coat an ELISA plate. In this manner, possible conformational distortions of the DENV-4 virion surface due to direct coating on a solid phase might be minimized. Similarly, after the third panning, plasmid was isolated and cleaved with SpeI and NheI for the expression of soluble Fabs.\n\n\n \nIdentification and Characterization of Chimpanzee Fabs Specific to DENV-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nE. coli \ntransformants were screened for production of soluble Fabs capable of binding to DENV-4. Plasmid containing the Fab insert was analyzed by digestion with BstNI in order to select distinct clones. Sequence analysis of the V\nH \nand V\nL \nDNA inserts identified Fabs 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, and 7G4 in library D4. Fabs 5H2 and 5D9, which varied in the V\nL \nsequences but had a nearly identical V\nH \nsequence (a single amino acid difference in the FR3 region), were recovered from library D1-4 (\nFIG. 2\n). The sequences in the heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) (Wu, T. et al. 1993 \nProteins: Structure, Functions and Genetics \n16:1-7), critical for antigen binding, showed a greater diversity than the sequences in other regions among these Fabs. A sequence similarity search of the available human immunoglobulin genes was conducted to determine the specific germ line origin of these chimpanzee Fab fragments. The chimpanzee V\nH \nand V\nL \nsequences and their most related human immunoglobulin genes of the germ line VH or Vκ families are shown (Table 2). These chimpanzee V\nH \nor V\nL \nsequences and their human homologues shared 88-95% identity, excluding the CDR3 region.\n\n\n \nAntigenic Specificity of Chimpanzee Fab Monoclonal Antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \nFirst, the binding activity of the Fab antibodies to DENV-4 was analyzed by ELISA. All six selected Fabs showed strong binding to DENV-4 virions (Table 3). Chimpanzee Fab 1F2, which was selected from library D4 for its ability to bind anti-human F(ab)′\n2 \nbut not DENV-4, was used as the control. A cross-reactivity to DENV-1, DENV-2 or DENV-3 was detected for Fabs 3E4, 7G4 and 5A7. Fab 3C1 also cross-reacted with DENV-2 at a low titer. Fabs 5H2 and 5D9 showed no detectible cross-reactivity to DENV-1, DENV-2 or DENV-3 virus. Radioimmunoprecipitation using a lysate of DENV-4 infected Vero cells was then performed to determine the antigen-binding specificity (\nFIG. 3A\n). Fab 5A7 selectively precipitated prM. All other Fabs precipitated both E and prM. The amount of prM relative to E precipitated varied, depending on the Fab. Radioimmunoprecipitation was again performed by using labeled E or prM prepared individually in recombinant vaccinia virus-infected cells (\nFIG. 3B\n). Fabs 3E4 and 7G4 precipitated E but not prM. Fab 3C1 precipitated neither E nor prM. Fab 5D9 precipitated E but not prM, whereas Fab 5H2 precipitated E and a trace of prM. When the labeled antigens were mixed, coprecipitation of prM and E was again detected for Fabs 3E4, 7G4, 3C1 and 5H2.\n\n\n \nMapping Fab Antibody-Binding Sites on DENV-4 Virions by Competition ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \nBiotinylated Fabs 3C1, 3E4, 7G4 and 5H2 were each tested for binding to DENV-4 in the presence of an unlabeled, competing Fab. Chimpanzee Fab 1F2, which did not bind DENV-4, was analyzed in parallel. Fab 5D9, which was nearly identical to Fab 5H2, was not tested. The result (\nFIG. 4\n) showed that binding of Fab 3C1 to DENV-4 was competed by Fab 5A7, but not by Fab 3E4, 7G4, 5H2 or 1F2. Thus, the binding site on PrM for Fab 3C1 overlapped with that for Fab 5A7. Fab 3E4 and Fab7G4 also competed with each other for binding to DENV-4, indicating that their binding sites on E overlapped. The binding site on E for Fab 5H2 was unique, as binding competition with other Fabs was not observed.\n\n\n \nDENV-4 and Cross-Serotype Neutralizing Activity of Fab Antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \nAffinity-purified Fabs were used for PRNT\n50 \ndetermination (Table 4). Similar to the Fab 1F2 control, prM-specific Fab 5A7 or 3C1 did not neutralize DENV-4. Fabs 3E4 and 7G4 exhibited a low DENV-4-neutralizing activity with a PRNT\n50 \ntiter at 91 μg/ml or greater. Fab 3E4., which was most cross-reactive to DENV-1, DENV-2 or DENV-3, was used in a cross-serotype neutralization assay. The cross-neutralizing activity against DENV-1, DENV-2 or DENV-3 was lower than that detected for DENV-4. Importantly, Fab 5H2 and Fab 5D9 neutralized DENV-4 efficiently, with a PRNT\n50 \ntiter of 0.24 and 0.58 μg/ml, respectively.\n\n\n \nHumanized Chimpanzee Full-Length IgG1 Antibodies Produced in CHO Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \nProduction of full-length antibodies from the Fab Δ1/κ sequences was achieved with expression vector pFab CMV dhfr, which provides a portion of the hinge and the \nentire C\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 sequences of the human gamma-1 heavy chain (\nFIG. 1\n). A dhfr gene was inserted into the vector for selection of antibody-producing CHO cells with methotrexate and for gene copy amplification. Other modifications of the expression vector included conversion of the chimpanzee-specific hinge sequence to the human counterpart and an A to G substitution at the last nucleotide of the intron between CH\n2 \nand CH\n3 \nexons of the heavy chain sequence. Thus, the product was a full-length, chimeric human-chimpanzee (humanized) IgG1 antibody. Fab 5H2 was chosen for conversion to the whole IgG1 antibody. The full-length IgG1 5H2 was secreted into the culture medium of the transformed CHO cells, and the yield of the affinity-purified product was approximately 1.8 mg per liter. Affinity-purified IgG1 5H2 was compared with Fab 5H2 for binding affinity to DENV-4 by ELISA. The IgG1 5H2 and Fab 5H2 had equilibrium affinity constants (Kd) of 0.24 nM and 0.42 nM, respectively. IgG1 5H2 neutralized three DENV-4 strains from two geographic regions in vitro at a similar high PRNT\n50 \ntiter of 0.03-0.05 μg/ml (\nFIG. 5\n). Humanized IgG1 5H2 represents the first DENV-4-neutralizing monoclonal antibody of primate origin.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSerum neutralizing antibody titers of chimpanzees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInfection\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChim-\n\n\nwith\n\n\nNeutralizing antibody titer against\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npanzee\n\n\nDENV-1-3\n\n\nDENV-4\n\n\nDENV-1\n\n\nDENV-2\n\n\nDENV-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1616\n\n\nPre-\n\n\n1031\n\n\n<10\n\n\n34\n\n\n80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPost-\n\n\n2380\n\n\n327\n\n\n880\n\n\n610\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1618\n\n\nPre-\n\n\n1110\n\n\n23\n\n\n69\n\n\n156\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPost-\n\n\n1654\n\n\n730\n\n\n1787\n\n\n1271\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimpanzees were previously inoculated with DENV-4 RNA intra-hepatically and then infected with a mixture of DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3 nine months later.

Confluent C6/36 cells were infected with DENV-4 at 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) in MEM containing 2% fetal calf serum and incubated at 28° C. The medium from the infected cells was harvested at 7 days and again at 10 days. It was clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm in a JA10 rotor (1,000 g) and then centrifuged at 9,000 rpm in a JA10 rotor (15,000 g) overnight. The DENV-4 pellet was resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for phage panning and for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, DENV-4 grown in C6/36 cells in serum-free medium (VP-SFM, Gibco) was directly used for panning and for ELISA. DENV-1 (Western Pacific strain), DENV-2 (prototype New Guinea C strain) and DENV-3 (strain 1187) were prepared in serum-free medium from infected simian Vero cells.\n\n\n \n \nInoculation of Chimpanzees with Infectious DENV-4 RNA and with DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo dengue virus-seronegative chimpanzees, #1616 and #1618, were intrahepatically inoculated with infectious RNA transcripts made from the full-length cDNA clone of DENV-4 strain 814669 (Lai, C. J. et al. 1991 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. \n88:5139-5143). A blood sample was collected weekly from each animal for analysis of the serum ALT levels and for analysis of antibodies to DENV-4. Eleven weeks after DENV-4 RNA inoculation, bone marrow was aspirated from the iliac crest of each chimpanzee and a combinatorial antibody library (designated library D4) was constructed. Nine and one-half months after inoculation with DENV-4 RNA, each of the chimpanzees was inoculated subcutaneously with a mixture of DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3, each at 10\n6 \nplaque forming units (PFU), in 1 ml of MEM (Gibco) plus 0.25% human serum albumin. Six weeks after inoculation with the dengue virus mixture, serum samples were collected for analysis of antibody response. Twelve Weeks after inoculation with DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3, bone marrow was aspirated again and a second antibody library (designated library D1-4) was constructed. Both libraries were prepared from bone marrow of chimpanzee #1618, which developed slightly higher antibody titers against DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3 than did chimpanzee #1616.\n\n\n \nConstruction of γ1/κ Chimpanzee Fab Antibody Libraries.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe lymphocytes from bone marrow were separated on a Ficoll-Paque gradient by centrifugation and aliquots of approximately 1×10\n7 \ncells/ml in MEM containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 10% fetal calf serum were stored over liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from 3×10\n7 \nlymphocytes using the RNA Extraction Kit (Stratagene) and mRNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo (dT) as primer (ThermoScript RT-PCR System, Invitrogen). The κ light chain DNA was amplified from the cDNA product by PCR with seven pairs of human κ light chain family-specific 5′ primers and a 3′ primer in the constant domain (Barbas, C. F. et al. 1991 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n88:7978-7982; Glamann, J. et al. 1998 \nJ. Virol. \n72:585-592; Persson, M. A. et al. 1991 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n88:2432-2436; Schofield, D. J. et al. 2000 \nJ. Virol. \n74:5548-5555). The γ1 heavy chain Fd cDNA was amplified using nine human γ1 heavy chain family-specific 5′ primers plus a chimpanzee γ1-specific 3′ primer (Glamann, J. et al. 1998 \nJ. Virol. \n72:585-592; Schofield, D. J. et al. 2000 \nJ. Virol. \n74:5548-5555). A thirty-cycle PCR at 94 C for 15 s, 52 C for 50 s and 68 C for 90 s was performed with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmers).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCloning of the chimpanzee κ light chain and γ1 heavy chain DNA fragments into the pComb 3H phage display vector was performed as described (Barbas, C. F. et al. 1991 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n88:7978-7982; Williamson, R. A. I et al. 1993 \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. \n90:41413-4145 [Erratum 91:1193, 1994]). Briefly, amplified κ light chain DNA fragments were pooled, digested with Sac I and XbaI, and then cloned into pComb 3H (Persson, M. A. et al. 1991 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n88:2432-2436) by transformation of electrocompetent \nE. coli \nXL-1 Blue (Stratagene). A plasmid containing the γ1 light chain DNA inserts was prepared from \nE. coli \ntransformants and then cleaved with SpeI and XhoI for insertion with amplified γ1 heavy chain DNA fragments cleaved with the same enzymes. The plasmid containing both the heavy chain and the light chain DNA inserts was used for transformation of \nE. coli \nXL-1 Blue by electroporation. In both electroporation steps, the ligated DNA mixture yielded a library size of 1-3×10\n8 \n \nE. coli \ncolonies.\n\n\n \nPanning of Phage Library and Isolation of DENV-4-Specific Soluble Fabs.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe construction of phage display libraries, recovery and transfer of Fab sequences, and identification of \nE. coli \ntransformants expressing DENV-4-specific soluble Fabs were carried out as described (Glamann, J. et al. 1998 \nJ. Virol. \n72:585-592; Schofield, D. J. et al. 2000 J. Virol. 74:5548-5555). Briefly, approximately 10\n8 \ntransformants were grown in 2YT broth containing 1% glucose, 10 μg/ml tetracycline and 100 μg/ml ampicillin for 3 hr at 37° C. The bacterial culture was then infected with helper phage VSC M13 (Stratagene) at 50 MOI to generate the phage library. The phage library D4 was panned by affinity binding on DENV-4 virions used to coat an ELISA plate that was blocked with 3% nonfat powdered milk in PBS to reduce non-specific binding. The phage library D1-4 was panned by affinity binding on DENV-4 virions captured by a chimpanzee serum immobilized on an ELISA plate to minimize conformational changes of the DENV-4 antigenic structure. Following three cycles of panning, the selected phage mixture was used to infect \nE. coli \nXL-1 Blue, and replicative form DNA (phagemid) was prepared. The phagemid was cleaved with NheI and SpeI and recircularized to remove the phage gene III portion of the fused Fab sequence. \nE. coli \nXL-1 Blue were transformed with the circularized DNA, and colonies that yielded soluble Fab fragments reactive to DENV-4 virus were screened by ELISA.\n\n\n \nDNA Sequencing of DENV-4 Specific Fab Clones.\n\n\n \n \n \nPlasmid from the selected \nE. coli \ntransformants was initially analyzed by BstN1 digestion to identify Fab clones with distinct patterns. Sequence analysis of the Fab V\nH \nand V\nL \nDNA segments was performed on an automated DNA sequencer with a fluorescence dideoxynucleotide terminator cycle sequencing kit with Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The following primers were used: 5′ ACAGCTATCGCGATTGCAGTG (LC-1) (SEQ ID NO: 193) and 5′ CACCTGATCCTCAGATGGCGG (LC-4) (SEQ ID NO: 194) for sequencing the V\nL \nsegment; 5′ ATTGCCTACGGCAGCCGCTGG (HC-1) (SEQ ID NO: 195) and 5′ GGAAGTAGTCCTTGACCAGGC (HC-4) (SEQ ID NO: 196) for sequencing both DNA strands of the V\nH \nsegment (Glamann, J. et al. 1998 \nJ. Virol. \n72:585-592; Schofield, D. J. et al. 2000 \nJ. Virol. \n74:5548-5555). Software Vector NTI (InforMax) was used for sequence analysis. The DNAPLOT software program (MRC Center for Protein Engineering) was used to search for human immunoglobulin homologues in the data base.\n\n\n \nProduction and Purification of Fab Antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \nSelected \nE. coli \ncolonies were grown in 1 liter of L-broth containing 1% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml tetracycline to an early exponential growth phase (optical density at 600 nm approximately 0.2) at 30° C. The bacteria were then transferred to 2 liters of L-broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml tetracycline and grown at 30° C. in the presence of 0.1 mM of inducer isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 5 h. The bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in 20 ml of extraction buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl (Clontech), and 0.1 mM protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzene sulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). After three cycles of freezing and thawing to release the soluble Fab product from the bacterial periplasm, the preparation was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm in a JA-20 rotor (10,000 g) for 60 mm. The histidine-tagged Fab in the supernatant was purified through a column containing a 1-ml bed volume of TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech) using the pH elution procedure as suggested by the manufacturer. The Fab purity was verified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using purified human IgG F(ab′)\n2 \n(Cappel) as a marker. The Fab concentration was determined colorimetrically using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).\n\n\n \nBiotinylation of Purified Fab Fragments and Competition ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \nPurified Fabs were biotinylated with EZ-Link NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) according to the procedure suggested by the supplier. After extensive dialysis against PBS, the biotin-labeled Fab was tested for binding to DENV-4 coated on wells of a microtiter plate. For competition ELISA, a fixed concentration of biotinylated Fab was mixed with a competing Fab in serial dilution and the mixture was added to the DENV-4-coated wells. Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase was used for detection of biotinylated Fab bound to DENV-4.\n\n\n \nRadiolabeling of DENV-4 Antigens and Radio-Immunoprecipitation\n\n\n \n \n \nInfection with DENV-4 or recombinant vaccinia virus and subsequent radiolabeling of infected cells were performed as described (Falgout, B. et al. 1990. \nJ. Virol. \n64:4356-4363). Confluent Vero cells in a T-25 flask were infected with DENV-4 \nstrain\n 814669 at 1 MOI and incubated for 4 days at 37° C. Infected cells were rinsed once, starved for methionine in methionine-free MEM for 30 min and, then labeled with \n35\nS-methionine at 150 μCi/ml (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mM). After a 6-h labeling period, cells were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed in 2 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.5. Confluent CV-1 cells were infected with 5 MOI of recombinant vaccinia virus vDENV-4 PrM (Bray, M., and C. J. Lai. 1991 \nVirology \n185:505-508) or vDENV-4 E (Men, R et al. 1991 \nJ. Virol. \n65:1400-1407) containing the full-length PrM or E coding sequence, respectively, for 15 h at 37° C. Infected cells were rinsed and starved for methionine in methionine-free MEM, placed in the labeling medium for 2 h, and then lysed in RIPA buffer as described. A 20-μl labeled lysate of DENV-4- or recombinant vaccinia virus-infected cells was mixed with 10 μl of the Fab fragment to be tested and 70 μl RIPA buffer, incubated at 4 C overnight, and then mixed with 2 μl of goat anti-human IgG F(ab′)\n2 \nantibody for 2 h. A 100-μl suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads was added to bind the radioimmune complexes. The Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with RIPA buffer prior to separation by SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 37.5:1) electrophoresis. Radiolabeled protein bands on the dried gel were visualized by exposure to an X-ray film.\n\n\n \nConstruction of DNA Recombinants and Expression of Full-Length IgG1 in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe expression vector pFab CMV (Sauna, P. P. et al. 1999 \nImmunotechnology \n4:185-188) was re-engineered for IgG1 production (\nFIG. 1\n). The vector contained a neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo), located between the two human CMV (hCMV) promoters, and a β-lactamase gene (amp), located between the two poly A sites as mapped by restriction digestion and by sequencing. The neo and amp locations differed from the published map. A di-hydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene together with the transcription signals was inserted at the unique NotI site in the original vector as the selecting marker and for gene amplification (Wood, C. R. et al. 1990 \nJ. Immunol. \n145:3011-3016). The dhfr gene insert was the 1.4 kb DNA fragment from Pvu II/Afe I cleavage of pCDHC68B (Ames, R. S. et al. 1995 \nJ. Immunol. Methods. \n184:177-180). The original plasmid vector contained an A at the last nucleotide position of the intron that precedes the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 exon. This variant nucleotide was converted to G to allow proper RNA splicing for full-length IgG1 expression. The Fab 5H2 κ light chain DNA segment cleaved by SacI and XbaI was first inserted into the expression vector. The resulting recombinant was then added with the γ1 heavy chain DNA segment cleaved by XhoI and SpeI, which was regenerated by PCR using the Fab 5H2 DNA template and appropriate primers. The chimpanzee-specific sequence in the hinge region together with the variant sequences introduced during plasmid construction were converted to the human hinge sequence using \npositive strand primer\n 5′ GACAAAACTCAC\nACATGT\nCCACCGTGCCCA (SEQ ID NO: 197), which introduced a Pell site (underlined) with silent mutations (Ehrich, P. H. et al. 1991 \nMol. Immunol. \n28:319-322; Takahashi, N. et al. 1982 \nCell \n29:671-679). Accordingly, the IgG1 antibody product would contain the chimpanzee V\nH \nand \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 sequences and the entire human binge, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCHO/dbfr-(duk-)cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Production of the whole IgG1 in CHO/dhfr-cells was carried out by transfection with RsrII-cleaved recombinant plasmid in the presence of Lipofectamine (Gibco). Two days after transfection, cells in a T25 flask were re-plated in Iscove's modified Dulbecco medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 10\n−7 \nM methotrexate in the absence of hypoxanthine/thymidine as selecting medium (Dorai, H, and G P Moore. 1987. \nJ. Immunol. \n139:4232-4241; Wood, C. R. et al. 1990 \nJ. Immunol. \n145:3011-3016). Transformed CHO cells resistant to 10\n−7 \nM methotrexate appeared approximately two weeks after transfection. Transformed CHO cells producing IgG1 in the medium were identified by ELISA and by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) following sub-cloning in a 96- or 24-well plate. Gene amplification was carried out step-wise by increasing methotrexate concentration to 2×10\n−7 \nM in the selecting medium. CHO cells that produced IgG1 at a high level were selected. The selected CHO cells were adapted to growth in suspension for IgG1 production in serum-free CD CHO medium (Gibco). Medium fluid was concentrated and the IgG1 product was purified through a protein-A affinity column. The full-length IgG1 5H2 antibody was compared with the Fab 5H2 fragment for DENV-4-binding affinity by ELISA. The equilibrium affinity constant (Kd) was calculated as the antibody concentration that gave 50% of maximum binding (Lin, C.-W. and S.-C. Wu. 2003 \nJ. Virol. \n77:2600-2606; Raffai, R. et al. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n275:7109-7116).\n\n\n \nDetermination of DENV-4 Neutralizing Activity of Fab and Whole IgG1 Antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \nAffinity-purified Fab or full-length IgG1 antibodies were analyzed for DENV-4 neutralizing activity by a modification of plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), as described (Okuno, Y. et al. 1985 \nArch. Virol. \n86:129-135). Briefly, approximately 50 focus-forming units of DENV-4 were mixed with a serial dilution of Fab or IgG1 antibodies in 250 μl of MEM. The mixture was incubated at 37° C. for 30 min and then used for infection of Vero cell monolayers in a 24-well plate. The cells were overlaid with a semi-solid medium containing 1% Tragacanth gum (Sigma) and incubated at 37° C. for 4 days.

In the previous study, we described repertoire cloning to recover Fab fragments from bone marrow mRNA of chimpanzees infected with all four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4). In that study we recovered and characterized a humanized IgG1 antibody that efficiently neutralized DENV-4. In this study, the phage library constructed from the chimpanzees was used to recover Fab antibodies against the other three dengue virus serotypes. Serotype-specific neutralizing Fabs were not identified. Instead, we recovered dengue virus-neutralizing Fabs that specifically precipitated the envelope protein and were cross-reactive with all four dengue serotypes. Three of the Fabs competed with each other for binding to DENV-1 and DENV-2, although each of these Fabs contained a distinct CDR3-H sequence. Fabs that shared an identical or nearly identical CDR3-H sequence cross-neutralized DENV-1 and DENV-2 at a similar high 50% plaque reduction (PRNT\n50\n) titer, ranging from 0.26 to 1.33 μg/ml, and neutralized DENV-3 and DENV-4 but at a titer 10-20 fold lower. One of these Fabs, 1A5, also neutralized the West Nile virus most efficiently among other flaviviruses tested. Fab 1A5 was converted to a full-length antibody in combination with human sequences for production in mammalian CHO cells. Humanized IgG1 1A5 proved to be as efficient as Fab 1A5 for cross-neutralization of DENV-1 and DENV-2 at a titer of 0.48 and 0.95 μg/ml, respectively. IgG1 1A5 also neutralized DENV-3, DENV-4 and the West Nile virus at a PRNT\n50 \ntiter of approximately 3.2-4.2 μg/ml. This humanized antibody is envisioned to be useful for prophylactic and therapeutic application against dengue and other flaviviruses-associated diseases.\n\n\n \nDefinitions\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “antibody” means an immunoglobulin molecule or a fragment of an immunoglobulin molecule having the ability to specifically bind to a particular antigen. Antibodies are well known to those of ordinary skill in the science of immunology. As used herein, the term “antibody” means not only full-length antibody molecules but also fragments of antibody molecules retaining antigen binding ability. Such fragments are also well known in the art and are regularly employed both in vitro and in vivo. In particular, as used herein, the term “antibody” means not only full-length immunoglobulin molecules but also antigen binding active fragments such as the well-known active fragments F(ab′)\n2\n, Fab, Fv, and Fd.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “dengue virus disease” means any disease caused, directly or indirectly, by one of the four serotypes of a dengue virus, which is a flavivirus. Dengue is an acute febrile disease characterized by sudden onset, with headache, fever, prostration, joint and muscle pain, lymphadenopathy, and a rash that appears simultaneously, with a temperature rise. A second phase of temperature rise may appear following an afebrile period. Dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome is an acute disease occurring primarily in children characterized by an abrupt febrile onset followed by hemorrhagic manifestations and circulatory collapse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein with respect to polypeptides, the term “substantially pure” means that the polypeptides are essentially free of other substances with which they may be found in nature or in vivo systems to an extent practical and appropriate for their intended use. In particular, the polypeptides are sufficiently pure and are sufficiently free from other biological constituents of their hosts cells so as to be useful in, for example, generating antibodies, sequencing, or producing pharmaceutical preparations. By techniques well known in the art, substantially pure polypeptides may be produced in light of the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences disclosed herein. Because a substantially purified polypeptide of the invention may be admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in a pharmaceutical preparation, the polypeptide may comprise only a certain percentage by weight of the preparation. The polypeptide is nonetheless substantially pure in that it has been substantially separated from the substances with which it may be associated in living systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein with respect to nucleic acids, the term “isolated” means: (1) amplified in vitro by, for example, polymerase chain reaction (PCR); (ii) recombinantly produced by cloning; (iii) purified, as by cleavage and gel separation; or (iv) synthesized by, for example, chemical synthesis. An isolated nucleic acid is one which is readily manipulable by recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art. Thus, a nucleotide sequence contained in a vector in which 5′ and 3′ restriction sites are known or for which polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sequences have been disclosed is considered isolated but a nucleic acid sequence existing in its native state in its natural host is not. An isolated nucleic acid may be substantially purified, but need not be. For example, a nucleic acid that is isolated within a cloning or expression vector is not pure in that it may comprise only a tiny percentage of the material in the cell in which it resides. Such a nucleic acid is isolated, however, as the term is used herein because it is readily manipulable by standard techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a coding sequence and regulatory sequences are said to be “operably joined” when they are covalently linked in such a way as to place the expression or transcription of the coding sequence under the influence or control of the regulatory sequences. If it is desired that the, coding sequences be translated into a functional protein, two DNA sequences are said to be operably joined if induction of a promoter in the 5′ regulatory sequences results in the transcription of the coding sequence and if the nature of the linkage between the two DNA sequences does not (1) result in the introduction of a frame-shift mutation, (2) interfere with the ability of the promoter region to direct the transcription of the coding sequences, or (3) interfere with the ability of the corresponding RNA transcript to be translated into a protein. Thus, a promoter region would be operably joined to a coding sequence if the promoter region were capable of effecting transcription of that DNA sequence such that the resulting transcript might be translated into the desired protein or polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe precise nature of the regulatory sequences needed for gene expression may vary between species or cell types, but shall in general include, as necessary, 5′ non-transcribing and 5′ non-translating sequences involved with initiation of transcription and translation respectively, such as a TATA box, capping sequence, CAAT sequence, and the like. Especially, such 5′ non-transcribing regulatory sequences will include a promoter region which includes a promoter sequence for transcriptional control of the operably joined gene. Regulatory sequences may also include enhancer sequences or upstream activator sequences, as desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “vector” may be any of a number of nucleic acids into which a desired sequence may be inserted by restriction and ligation for transport between different genetic environments or for expression in a host cell. Vectors are typically composed of DNA although RNA vectors are also available. Vectors include, but are not limited to, plasmids and phagemids. A cloning vector is one which is able to replicate in a host cell, and which is further characterized by one or more endonuclease restriction sites at which the vector may be cut in a determinable fashion and into which a desired DNA sequence may be ligated such that the new recombinant vector retains its ability to replicate in the host cell. In the case of plasmids, replication of the desired sequence may occur many times as the plasmid increases in copy number within the host bacterium or just a single time per host before the host reproduces by mitosis. In the case of phage, replication may occur actively during a lytic phase or passively during a lysogenic phase. An expression vector is one into which a desired DNA sequence may be inserted by restriction and ligation such that it is operably joined to regulatory sequences and may be expressed as an RNA transcript. Vectors may further contain one or more marker sequences suitable for use in the identification and selection of cells which have been transformed or transfected with the vector. Markers include, for example, genes encoding proteins which increase or decrease either resistance or sensitivity to antibiotics or other compounds, genes which encode enzymes whose activities are detectable by standard assays known in the art (e.g., B-galactosidase or alkaline phosphatase), and genes which visibly affect the phenotype of transformed or transfected cells, hosts, colonies or plaques. Preferred vectors are those capable of autonomous replication and expression of the structural gene products present in the DNA segments to which they are operably joined.\n\n\n \nNovel Anti-Dengue Virus Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention derives, in part, from the isolation and characterization of novel chimpanzee Fab fragments and their humanized monoclonal antibodies that selectively bind and neutralize \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus and that we have designated 1A5, 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, and 1A10. As described more fully herein, these new monoclonal antibodies have been shown to bind and neutralize the \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus. The paratopes of the 1A5, 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, and 1A10 Fab fragments associated with the neutralization epitopes on the \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus are defined by the amino acid (aa) sequences of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain V-regions depicted in \nFIG. 6\n and, for 1A5, SEQ ID NO: 97 and SEQ ID NO: 105;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nfor 2H7, SEQ ID NO: 113 and SEQ ID NO: 121;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nfor 2H5, SEQ ID NO: 129 and SEQ ID NO: 137;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nfor 3A2, SEQ ID NO: 145 and SEQ ID NO: 153;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nfor 1B2, SEQ ID NO: 161 and SEQ ID NO: 169; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nfor 1A10, SEQ ID NO: 177 and SEQ ID NO: 185.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid sequences coding for these as sequences were identified as described herein, by sequencing the Fab heavy chain and light chain fragments. Due to the degeneracy of the DNA code, the paratope is more properly defined by the derived an sequences depicted in \nFIG. 6\n and SEQ ID NOs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one set of embodiments, the present invention provides the full-length, humanized monoclonal antibody of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody in isolated form and in pharmaceutical preparations. Similarly, as described herein, the present invention provides isolated nucleic acids, host cells transformed with nucleic acids, and pharmaceutical preparations including isolated nucleic acids, encoding the full-length, humanized monoclonal antibody of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody. Finally, the present invention provides methods, as described more fully herein, employing these antibodies and nucleic acids in the in vitro and in vivo diagnosis, prevention and therapy of dengue virus disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSignificantly, as is well-known in the art, only a small portion of an antibody molecule, the paratope, is involved in the binding of the antibody to its epitope (see, in general, Clark, W. R. (1986) \nThe Experimental Foundations of Modern Immunology \nWiley & Sons, Inc., New York; Roitt, I. (1991) \nEssential Immunology, \n7th Ed., Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford). The pFc′ and Fc regions, for example, are effectors of the complement cascade but are not involved in antigen binding. An antibody from which the pFc′ region has been enzymatically cleaved, or which has been produced without the pFc′ region, designated an F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment, retains both of the antigen binding sites of a full-length antibody. Similarly, an antibody from which the Fc region has been enzymatically cleaved, or which has been produced without the Fc region, designated an Fab fragment, retains one of the antigen binding sites of a full-length antibody molecule. Proceeding further, Fab fragments consist of a covalently bound antibody light chain and a portion of the antibody heavy chain denoted Fd. The Fd fragments are the major determinant of antibody specificity (a single Fd fragment may be associated with up to ten different light chains without altering antibody specificity) and Fd fragments retain epitope-binding ability in isolation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithin the antigen-binding portion of an antibody, as is well-known in the art, there are complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which directly interact with the epitope of the antigen, and framework regions (FRs), which maintain the tertiary structure of the paratope (see, in general, Clark, 1986, supra; Roitt, 1991, supra). In both the heavy chain Fd fragment and the light chain of IgG immunoglobulins, there are four framework regions (FRI through FR4) separated respectively by three complementarity determining regions (CDR1 through CDR3). The CDRs, and in particular the CDR3 regions, and more particularly the heavy chain CDR3, are largely responsible for antibody specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe complete amino acid sequences of the antigen-binding Fab portion of the 1A5 monoclonal antibody as well as the relevant FR and CDR regions are disclosed herein.

SEQ ID NO: 137 discloses the amino acid sequence of the light chain of 2H5. The amino acid sequences of the light chain FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4 regions are disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 138 through SEQ ID NO: 144, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe complete amino acid sequences of the antigen-binding Fab portion of the 3A2 monoclonal antibody as well as the relevant FR and CDR regions are disclosed herein.

This is most clearly manifested in the development and use of “humanized” antibodies in which non-human CDRs are covalently joined to human FR and/or Fc/pFc′ regions to produce a functional antibody. Thus, for example, PCT International Publication Number WO 92/04381 teaches the production and use of humanized murine RSV antibodies in which at least a portion of the murine FR regions have been replaced by FR regions of human origin. Such antibodies, including fragments of full-length antibodies with antigen-binding ability, are often referred to as “chimeric” antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the present invention also provides for F(ab′)\n2\n, Fab, Fv and Fd fragments of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or other dengue type 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody; chimeric antibodies in which the Fc and/or FR and/or CDR1 and/or CDR2 and/or light chain CDR3 regions of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or other dengue type 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, have been replaced by homologous human or non-human sequences; chimeric F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment antibodies in which the FR and/or CDR1 and/or CDR2 and/or light chain CDR3 regions of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or other dengue type 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, have been replaced by homologous human or non-human sequences; chimeric Fab fragment antibodies in which the FR and/or CDR1 and/or CDR2 and/or light chain CDR3 regions have been replaced by homologous human or non-human sequences; and chimeric Fd fragment antibodies in which the FR and/or CDR1 and/or CDR2 regions have been replaced by homologous human or non-human sequences. Thus, those skilled in the art may alter the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, by the construction of CDR grafted or chimeric antibodies or antibody fragments containing all, or part thereof, of the disclosed heavy and light chain V-region CDR as sequences (Jones, P.

R. et al. 1991 \nBio/Technology \n9:266), without destroying the specificity of the antibodies for the \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus epitope. Such CDR grafted or chimeric antibodies or antibody fragments can be effective in prevention and treatment of dengue infection in animals (e.g. cattle) and man.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, the chimeric antibodies of the invention are fully human or humanized chimpanzee monoclonal antibodies including at least the heavy chain CDR3 region of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody. As noted above, such chimeric antibodies may be produced in which some or all of the FR regions of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, have been replaced by other homologous human FR regions. In addition, the Fc portions may be replaced so as to produce IgA or IgM as well as IgG antibodies bearing some or all of the CDRs of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody. Of particular importance is the inclusion of the heavy chain CDR3 region and, to a lesser extent, the other CDRs of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody. Such fully human or humanized chimpanzee monoclonal antibodies will have particular utility in that they will not evoke an immune response against the antibody itself.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible, in accordance with the present invention, to produce chimeric antibodies including non-human sequences. Thus, one may use, for example, murine, ovine, equine, bovine or other mammalian Fc or FR sequences to replace some or all of the Fc or FR regions of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody. Some of the CDRs may be replaced as well. Again, however, it is preferred that at least the heavy chain CDR3 of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, be included in such chimeric antibodies and, to a lesser extent, it is also preferred that some or all of the other CDRs of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, be included. Such chimeric antibodies bearing non-human immunoglobulin sequences admixed with the CDRs of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, are not preferred for use in humans and are particularly not preferred for extended use because they may evoke an immune response against the non-human sequences. They may, of course, be used for brief periods or in immunosuppressed individuals but, again, fully human or humanized chimpanzee monoclonal antibodies are preferred. Because such antibodies may be used for brief periods or in immunosuppressed subjects, chimeric antibodies bearing non-human mammalian Fc and FR sequences but including at least the heavy chain CDR3 of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, are contemplated as alternative embodiments of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor inoculation or prophylactic uses, the antibodies of the present invention are preferably full-length antibody molecules including the Fc region. Such full-length antibodies will have longer half-lives than smaller fragment antibodies (e.g. Fab) and are more suitable for intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intracavity, subcutaneous, or transdermal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, Fab fragments, including chimeric Fab fragments, are preferred. Fabs offer several advantages over F(ab′)\n2 \nand whole immunoglobulin molecules for this therapeutic modality. First, because Fabs have only one binding site for their cognate antigen, the formation of immune complexes is precluded whereas such complexes can be generated when bivalent F(ab′)\n2 \ns and whole immunoglobulin molecules encounter their target antigen. This is of some importance because immune complex deposition in tissues can produce adverse inflammatory reactions. Second, because Fabs lack an Fc region they cannot trigger adverse inflammatory reactions that are activated by Fc, such as activation of the complement cascade. Third, the tissue penetration of the small Fab molecule is likely to be much better than that of the larger whole antibody. Fourth, Fabs can be produced easily and inexpensively in bacteria, such as \nE. coli, \nwhereas whole immunoglobulin antibody molecules require mammalian cells for their production in useful amounts. The latter entails transfection of immunoglobulin sequences into mammalian cells with resultant transformation. Amplification of these sequences must then be achieved by rigorous selective procedures and stable transformants must be identified and maintained. The whole immunoglobulin molecules must be produced by stably transformed, high expression mammalian cells in culture with the attendant problems of serum-containing culture medium. In contrast, production of Fabs in \nE. coli \neliminates these difficulties and makes it possible to produce these antibody fragments in large fermenters which are less expensive than cell culture-derived products.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to Fabs, smaller antibody fragments and epitope-binding peptides having binding specificity for the epitope defined by the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, are also contemplated by the present invention and can also be used to bind or neutralize the virus. For example, single chain antibodies can be constructed according to the method of U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778, to Ladner et al. Single chain antibodies comprise the variable regions of the light and heavy chains joined by a flexible linker moiety. Yet smaller is the antibody fragment known as the single domain antibody or Fd, which comprises an isolated VH single domain. Techniques for obtaining a single domain antibody with at least some of the binding specificity of the full-length antibody from which they are derived are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is possible to determine, without undue experimentation, if an altered or chimeric antibody has the same specificity as the antibody of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, of the invention by ascertaining whether the former blocks the latter from binding to \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus. If the monoclonal antibody being tested competes with the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, as shown by a decrease in binding of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, then it is likely that the two monoclonal antibodies bind to the same, or a closely spaced, epitope. Still another way to determine whether a monoclonal antibody has the specificity of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, of the invention is to pre-incubate the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, with \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus with which it is normally reactive, and then add the monoclonal antibody being tested to determine if the monoclonal antibody being tested is inhibited in its ability to bind \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus. If the monoclonal antibody being tested is inhibited then, in all likelihood, it has the same, or a functionally equivalent, epitope and specificity as the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, of the invention. Screening of monoclonal antibodies of the invention also can be carried out utilizing \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus and determining whether the monoclonal antibody neutralizes \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy using the antibodies of the invention, it is now possible to produce anti-idiotypic antibodies which can be used to screen other monoclonal antibodies to identify whether the antibody has the same binding specificity as an antibody of the invention. In addition, such antiidiotypic antibodies can be used for active immunization (Herlyn, D. et al. 1986 \nScience \n232:100). Such anti-idiotypic antibodies can be produced using well-known hybridoma techniques (Kohler, G. and Milstein, C. 1975 \nNature \n256:495). An anti-idiotypic antibody is an antibody which recognizes unique determinants present on the monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line of interest. These determinants are located in the hypervariable region of the antibody. It is this region which binds to a given epitope and, thus, is responsible for the specificity of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn anti-idiotypic antibody can be prepared by immunizing an animal with the monoclonal antibody of interest. The immunized animal will recognize and respond to the idiotypic determinants of the immunizing antibody and produce an antibody to these idiotypic determinants. By using the anti-idiotypic antibodies of the immunized animal, which are specific for the monoclonal antibodies of the invention, it is possible to identify other clones with the same idiotype as the antibody of the hybridoma used for immunization. Idiotypic identity between monoclonal antibodies of two cell lines demonstrates that the two monoclonal antibodies are the same with respect to their recognition of the same epitopic determinant. Thus, by using anti-idiotypic antibodies, it is possible to identify other hybridomas expressing monoclonal antibodies having the same epitopic specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible to use the anti-idiotype technology to produce monoclonal antibodies which mimic an epitope. For example, an anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody made to a first monoclonal antibody will have a binding domain in the hypervariable region which is the image of the epitope bound by the first monoclonal antibody. Thus, the anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody can be used for immunization, since the anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody binding domain effectively acts as an antigen.\n\n\n \nNucleic Acids Encoding Anti-Dengue Virus Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nGiven the disclosure herein of the amino acid sequences of the heavy chain Fd and light chain variable domains of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus, one of ordinary skill in the art is now enabled to produce nucleic acids which encode this antibody or which encode the various fragment antibodies or chimeric antibodies described above. It is contemplated that such nucleic acids will be operably joined to other nucleic acids forming a recombinant vector for cloning or for expression of the antibodies of the invention. The present invention includes any recombinant vector containing the coding sequences, or part thereof, whether for prokaryotic or eukaryotic transformation, transfection or gene therapy. Such vectors may be prepared using conventional molecular biology techniques, known to those with skill in the art, and would comprise DNA coding sequences for the immunoglobulin V-regions of the 1A5 antibody, or the 2H7, 2H5, 3A2, 1B2, or 1A10 antibody or \n \n \nother dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibody, including framework and CDRs or parts thereof, and a suitable promoter either with (Whittle, N. et al. 1987 \nProtein Eng. \n1:499 and Burton, D. R. et al. 1994 \nScience \n266:1024) or without (Marasco, W. A. et al. 1993 \nProc. Natl. Acad, Sci. \n(\nUSA\n) 90:7889 and Duan, L. et al. 1994 \nProc. Natl. Acad, Sci. \n(\nUSA\n) 91:5075) a signal sequence for export or secretion. Such vectors may be transformed or transfected into prokaryotic (Huse, W. D. et al. 1989 \nScience \n246:1275; Ward, S. et al. 1989 \nNature \n341:544; Marks, J. D. et al. 1991 \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222:581; and Barbas, C. F. et al. 1991 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n(\nUSA\n) 88:7987) or eukaryotic (Whittle, N. et al. 1987 \nProtein Eng. \n1:499 and Burton, D. R. et al. 1994 \nScience \n266:1024) cells or used for gene therapy (Marasco, W. A. et al. 1993 \nProc. Natl. Acad, Sci. \n(\nUSA\n) 90:7889 and Duan, L. et al. 1994 \nProc. Natl. Acad, Sci. \n(\nUSA\n) 91:5075) by conventional techniques, known to those with skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression vectors of the present invention include regulatory sequences operably joined to a nucleotide sequence encoding one of the antibodies of the invention. As used herein, the term “regulatory sequences” means nucleotide sequences which are necessary for or conducive to the transcription of a nucleotide sequence which encodes a desired polypeptide and/or which are necessary for or conducive to the translation of the resulting transcript into the desired polypeptide. Regulatory sequences include, but are not limited to, 5′ sequences such as operators, promoters and ribosome binding sequences, and 3′ sequences such as polyadenylation signals. The vectors of the invention may optionally include 5′ leader or signal sequences, 5′ or 3′ sequences encoding fusion products to aid in protein purification, and various markers which aid in the identification or selection of transformants. The choice and design of an appropriate vector is within the ability and discretion of one of ordinary skill in the art. The subsequent purification of the antibodies may be accomplished by any of a variety of standard means known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred vector for screening monoclonal antibodies, but not necessarily preferred for the mass production of the antibodies of the invention, is a recombinant DNA molecule containing a nucleotide sequence that codes for and is capable of expressing a fusion polypeptide containing, in the direction of amino- to carboxy-terminus, (1) a prokaryotic secretion signal domain, (2) a polypeptide of the invention, and, optionally, (3) a fusion protein domain. The vector includes DNA regulatory sequences for expressing the fusion polypeptide, preferably prokaryotic, regulatory sequences. Such vectors can be constructed by those with skill in the art and have been described by Smith, G. P. et al. (1985 \nScience \n228:1315); Clackson, T. et al. (1991 \nNature \n352:624); Kang et al. (1991 in “Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology: Vol. 2”; R. A. Lerner and D. R. Burton, ed. Academic Press, NY, pp 111-118); Barbas, C. F. et al. (1991 \nProc, Natl. Acad. Sci, \n(\nUSA\n) 88:7978), Roberts, B. L. et al. (1992 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n(\nUSA\n) 89:2429).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fusion polypeptide may be useful for purification of the antibodies of the invention. The fusion domain may, for example, include a poly-His tail which allows for purification on Ni+ columns or the maltose binding protein of the commercially available vector pMAL (New England BioLabs, Beverly, Mass.). A currently preferred, but by no means necessary, fusion domain is a filamentous phage membrane anchor. This domain is particularly useful for screening phage display libraries of monoclonal antibodies but may be of less utility for the mass production of antibodies. The filamentous phage membrane anchor is preferably a domain of the cpIII or cpVIII coat protein capable of associating with the matrix of a filamentous phage particle, thereby incorporating the fusion polypeptide onto the phage surface, to enable solid phase binding to specific antigens or epitopes and thereby allow enrichment and selection of the specific antibodies or fragments encoded by the phagemid vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe secretion signal is a leader peptide domain of a protein that targets the protein to the membrane of the host cell, such as the periplasmic membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. A preferred secretion signal for \nE. coli \nis a pelB secretion signal. The leader sequence of the pelB protein has previously been used as a secretion signal for fusion proteins (Better, M. et al. 1988 \nScience \n240:1041; Sastry, L. et al. 1989 \nProc, Natl. Acad. Sci \n(\nUSA\n) 86:5728; and Mullinax, R. L. et. al., 1990 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n(\nUSA\n) 87:8095). Amino acid residue sequences for other secretion signal polypeptide domains from \nE. coli \nuseful in this invention can be found in Neidhard, F. C. (ed.), 1987 \nEscherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium: Typhimurium Cellular and Molecular Biology, \nAmerican Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo achieve high levels of gene expression in \nE. coli, \nit is necessary to use not only strong promoters to generate large quantities of mRNA, but also ribosome binding sites to ensure that the mRNA is efficiently translated. In \nE. coli, \nthe ribosome binding site includes an initiation codon (AUG) and a sequence 3-9 nucleotides long located 3-11 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon (Shine et al. 1975 \nNature \n254:34). The sequence, which is called the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, is complementary to the 3′ end of \nE. coli \n16S rRNA. Binding of the ribosome to mRNA and the sequence at the 3′ end of the mRNA can be affected by several factors: the degree of complementarity between the SD sequence and 3′ end of the 16S rRNA; the spacing lying between the SD sequence and the AUG; and the nucleotide sequence following the AUG, which affects ribosome binding. The 3′ regulatory sequences define at least one termination (stop) codon in frame with and operably joined to the heterologous fusion polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments with a prokaryotic expression host, the vector utilized includes a prokaryotic origin of replication or replicon, i.e., a DNA sequence having the ability to direct autonomous replication and maintenance of the recombinant DNA molecule extrachromosomally in a prokaryotic host cell, such as a bacterial host cell, transformed therewith. Such origins of replication are well known in the art. Preferred origins of replication are those that are efficient in the host organism. A preferred host cell is \nE. coli. \nFor use of a vector in \nE. coli, \na preferred origin of replication is ColEI found in pBR322 and a variety of other common plasmids. Also preferred is the p15A origin of replication found on pACYC and its derivatives. The ColEI and p15A replicons have been extensively utilized in molecular biology, are available on a variety of plasmids and are described by Sambrook. et al. 1989 \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, \n2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, those embodiments that include a prokaryotic replicon preferably also include a gene whose expression confers a selective advantage, such as drug resistance, to a bacterial host transformed therewith. Typical bacterial drug resistance genes are those that confer resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, neomycin/kanamycin or chloramphenicol. Vectors typically also contain convenient restriction sites for insertion of translatable DNA sequences. Exemplary vectors are the plasmids pUC18 and pUC19 and derived vectors such as those commercially available from suppliers such as Invitrogen, (San Diego, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the antibodies of the invention include both heavy chain and light chain sequences, these sequences may be encoded on separate vectors or, more conveniently, may be expressed by a single vector. The heavy and light chain may, after translation or after secretion, form the heterodimeric structure of natural antibody molecules. Such a heterodimeric antibody may or may not be stabilized by disulfide bonds between the heavy and light chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector for expression of heterodimeric antibodies, such as the full-length antibodies of the invention or the F(ab′)\n2\n, Fab or Fv fragment antibodies of the invention, is a recombinant DNA molecule adapted for receiving and expressing translatable first and second DNA sequences. That is, a DNA expression vector for expressing a heterodimeric antibody provides a system for independently cloning (inserting) the two translatable DNA sequences into two separate cassettes present in the vector, to form two separate cistrons for expressing the first and second polypeptides of a heterodimeric antibody. The DNA expression vector for expressing two cistrons is referred to as a di-cistronic expression vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the vector comprises a first cassette that includes upstream and downstream DNA regulatory sequences operably joined via a sequence of nucleotides adapted for directional ligation to an insert DNA. The upstream translatable sequence preferably encodes the secretion signal as described above. The cassette includes DNA regulatory sequences for expressing the first antibody polypeptide that is produced when an insert translatable DNA sequence (insert DNA) is directionally inserted into the cassette via the sequence of nucleotides adapted for directional ligation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dicistronic expression vector also contains a second cassette for expressing the second antibody polypeptide. The second cassette includes a second translatable DNA sequence that preferably encodes a secretion signal, as described above, operably joined at its 3′ terminus via a sequence of nucleotides adapted for directional ligation to a downstream DNA sequence of the vector that typically defines at least one stop codon in the reading frame of the cassette. The second translatable DNA sequence is operably joined at its 5′ terminus to DNA regulatory sequences forming the 5′ elements. The second cassette is capable, upon insertion of a translatable DNA sequence (insert DNA), of expressing the second fusion polypeptide comprising a secretion signal with a polypeptide coded by the insert DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention may additionally, of course, be produced by eukaryotic cells such as CHO cells, human or mouse hybridomas, immortalized B-lymphoblastoid cells, and the like. In this case, a vector is constructed in which eukaryotic regulatory sequences are operably joined to the nucleotide sequences encoding the antibody polypeptide or polypeptides. The design and selection of an appropriate eukaryotic vector is within the ability and discretion of one of ordinary skill in the art. The subsequent purification of the antibodies may be accomplished by any of a variety of standard means known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention may furthermore, of course, be produced in plants. In 1989, Hiatt et al. 1989 \nNature \n342:76 first demonstrated that functional antibodies could be produced in transgenic plants. Since then, a considerable amount of effort has been invested in developing plants for antibody (or “plantibody”) production (for reviews see Giddings, G. et al., 2000 \nNat Biotechnol \n18:1151; Fischer, R. and Emans, N., 2000, \nTransgenic Res \n9:279). Recombinant antibodies can be targeted to seeds, tubers, or fruits, making administration of antibodies in such plant tissues advantageous for immunization programs in developing countries and worldwide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides host cells, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, transformed or transfected with, and therefore including, the vectors of the present invention.\n\n\n \nDiagnostic and Pharmaceutical Anti-Dengue Virus Antibody Preparations\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to a method for preparing diagnostic or pharmaceutical compositions comprising the monoclonal antibodies of the invention or polynucleotide sequences encoding the antibodies of the invention or part thereof, the pharmaceutical compositions being used for immunoprophylaxis or immunotherapy of dengue virus disease. The pharmaceutical preparation includes a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such carriers, as used herein, means a non-toxic material that does not interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredients. The term “physiologically acceptable” refers to a non-toxic material that is compatible with a biological system such as a cell, cell culture, tissue, or organism. The characteristics of the carrier will depend on the route of administration. Physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include diluents, fillers, salts, buffers, stabilizers, solubilizers, and other materials which are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred embodiment of the invention relates to monoclonal antibodies whose heavy chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 103, and/or whose light chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 111; whose heavy chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 119, and/or whose light chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ NO: 127; whose heavy chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 135, and/or whose light chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ NO: 143; whose heavy chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 151, and/or whose light chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 159; whose heavy chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 167, and/or whose light chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 175; whose heavy chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 183, and/or whose light chains comprise in CDR3 the polypeptide having SEQ ID NO: 191; and conservative variations of these peptides. Also encompassed by the present invention are certain amino acid sequences that bind to epitopic sequences in E of \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus and that confer neutralization of \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus when bound thereto. The term “conservative variation” as used herein denotes the replacement of an amino acid residue by another, biologically similar residue. Examples of conservative variations include the substitution of one hydrophobic residue such as isoleucine, valine, leucine or methionine for another, or the substitution of one polar residue for another, such as the substitution of arginine for lysine, glutamic for aspartic acids, or glutamine for asparagine, and the like. The term “conservative variation” also includes the use of a substituted amino acid in place of an unsubstituted parent amino acid provided that antibodies having the substituted polypeptide also bind or neutralize \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus. Analogously, another preferred embodiment of the invention relates to polynucleotides which encode the above noted heavy chain polypeptides and to polynucleotide sequences which are complementary to these polynucleotide sequences. Complementary polynucleotide sequences include those sequences that hybridize to the polynucleotide sequences of the invention under stringent hybridization conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \n \n \nanti-dengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antibodies of the invention may be labeled by a variety of means for use in diagnostic and/or pharmaceutical applications. There are many different labels and methods of labeling known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples of the types of labels which can be used in the present invention include enzymes, radioisotopes, fluorescent compounds, colloidal metals, chemiluminescent compounds, and bioluminescent compounds. Those of ordinary skill in the art will know of other suitable labels for binding to the monoclonal antibodies of the invention, or will be able to ascertain such, using routine experimentation. Furthermore, the binding of these labels to the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be done using standard techniques common to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother labeling technique which may result in greater sensitivity consists of coupling the antibodies to low molecular weight haptens. These haptens can then be specifically altered by means of a second reaction. For example, it is common to use haptens such as biotin, which reacts with avidin, or dinitrophenol, pyridoxal, or fluorescein, which can react with specific antihapten antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe materials for use in the assay of the invention are ideally suited for the preparation of a kit. Such a kit may comprise a carrier means being compartmentalized to receive in close confinement one or more container means such as vials, tubes, and the like, each of the container means comprising one of the separate elements to be used in the method. For example, one of the container means may comprise a monoclonal antibody of the invention that is, or can be, detectably labeled. The kit may also have containers containing buffer(s) and/or a container comprising a reporter-means, such as a biotin-binding protein, such as avidin or streptavidin, bound to a reporter molecule, such as an enzymatic or fluorescent label.\n\n\n \nIn Vitro Detection and Diagnostics\n\n\n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies of the invention are suited for in vitro use, for example, in immunoassays in which they can be utilized in liquid phase or bound to a solid phase carrier. In addition, the monoclonal antibodies in these immunoassays can be detectably labeled in various ways. Examples of types of immunoassays which can utilize the monoclonal antibodies of the invention are competitive and non-competitive immunoassays in either a direct or indirect format. Examples of such immunoassays are the radioimmunoassay (RIA) and the sandwich (immunometric) assay. Detection of antigens using the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be done utilizing immunoassays which are run in either the forward, reverse, or simultaneous modes, including immunohistochemical assays on physiological samples. Those of skill in the art will know, or can readily discern, other immunoassay formats without undue experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be bound to many different carriers and used to detect the presence of \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus. Examples of well-known carriers include glass, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, dextran, nylon, amylase, natural and modified cellulose, polyacrylamide, agarose and magnetite. The nature of the carrier can be either soluble or insoluble for purposes of the invention. Those skilled in the art will know of other suitable carriers for binding monoclonal antibodies, or will be able to ascertain such, using routine experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor purposes of the invention, \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus may be detected by the monoclonal antibodies of the invention when present in biological fluids and tissues. Any sample containing a detectable amount of \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus can be used. A sample can be a liquid such as urine, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, serum or the like; a solid or semi-solid such as tissues, feces, or the like; or, alternatively, a solid tissue such as those commonly used in histological diagnosis.\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Detection of Dengue Virus\n\n\n \n \n \nIn using the monoclonal antibodies of the invention for the in vivo detection of antigen, the detectably labeled monoclonal antibody is given in a dose which is diagnostically effective. The term “diagnostically effective” means that the amount of detectably labeled monoclonal antibody is administered in sufficient quantity to enable detection of the site having the \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus antigen for which the monoclonal antibodies are specific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concentration of detectably labeled monoclonal antibody which is administered should be sufficient such that the binding to \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus is detectable compared to the background. Further, it is desirable that the detectably labeled monoclonal antibody be rapidly cleared from the circulatory system in order to give the best target-to-background signal ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a rule, the dosage of detectably labeled monoclonal antibody for in vivo diagnosis will vary depending on such factors as age, sex, and extent of disease of the individual. The dosage of monoclonal antibody can vary from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, most preferably about 0.1 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg. Such dosages may vary, for example, depending on whether multiple injections are given, on the tissue being assayed, and other factors known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor in vivo diagnostic imaging, the type of detection instrument available is a major factor in selecting an appropriate radioisotope. The radioisotope chosen must have a type of decay which is detectable for the given type of instrument. Still another important factor in selecting a radioisotope for in vivo diagnosis is that the half-life of the radioisotope be long enough such that it is still detectable at the time of maximum uptake by the target, but short enough such that deleterious radiation with respect to the host is acceptable. Ideally, a radioisotope used for in vivo imaging will lack a particle emission but produce a large number of photons in the 140-250 keV range, which may be readily detected by conventional gamma cameras.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor in vivo diagnosis, radioisotopes may be bound to immunoglobulin either directly or indirectly by using an intermediate functional group. Intermediate functional groups which often are used to bind radioisotopes which exist as metallic ions are the bifunctional chelating agents such as diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (DTPA) and ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and similar molecules. Typical examples of metallic ions which can be bound to the monoclonal antibodies of the invention are \n111\nIn, \n97\nRu, \n67\nGa, \n68\nGa, \n72\nAs, \n89\nZr and \n201\nTl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies of the invention can also be labeled with a paramagnetic isotope for purposes of in vivo diagnosis, as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or electron spin resonance (ESR). In general, any conventional method for visualizing diagnostic imaging can be utilized. Usually gamma and positron emitting radioisotopes are used for camera imaging and paramagnetic isotopes for MRI. Elements which are particularly useful in such techniques include \n157\nGd, \n55\nMn, \n162\nDy, \n52\nCr and \n56\nFe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be used in vitro and in vivo to monitor the course of dengue virus disease therapy. Thus, for example, by measuring the increase or decrease in the number of cells infected with \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus or changes in the concentration of \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus present in the body or in various body fluids, it would be possible to determine whether a particular therapeutic regimen aimed at ameliorating dengue virus disease is effective.\n\n\n \nProphylaxis and Therapy of Dengue Virus Disease\n\n\n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies can also be used in prophylaxis and as therapy for dengue virus disease in humans. The terms, “prophylaxis” and “therapy” as used herein in conjunction with the monoclonal antibodies of the invention denote both prophylactic as well as therapeutic administration and both passive immunization with substantially purified polypeptide products, as well as gene therapy by transfer of polynucleotide sequences encoding the product or part thereof. Thus, the monoclonal antibodies can be administered to high-risk subjects in order to lessen the likelihood and/or severity of dengue virus disease or administered to subjects already evidencing active dengue virus infection. In the present invention, Fab fragments also bind or neutralize \n \n \ndengue type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 virus and therefore may be used to treat dengue virus infection but full-length antibody molecules are otherwise preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “prophylactically effective amount” of the monoclonal antibodies of the invention is a dosage large enough to produce the desired effect in the protection of individuals against dengue virus infection for a reasonable period of time, such as one to two months or longer following administration. A prophylactically effective amount is not, however, a dosage so large as to cause adverse side effects, such as hyperviscosity syndromes, pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and the like. Generally, a prophylactically effective amount may vary with the subject's age, condition, and sex, as well as the extent of the disease in the subject and can be determined by one of skill in the art. The dosage of the prophylactically effective amount may be adjusted by the individual physician or veterinarian in the event of any complication. A prophylactically effective amount may vary from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, most preferably from about 0.2 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg, in one or more administrations (priming and boosting).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “therapeutically effective amount” of the monoclonal antibodies of the invention is a dosage large enough to produce the desired effect in which the symptoms of dengue virus disease are ameliorated or the likelihood of infection is decreased. A therapeutically effective amount is not, however, a dosage so large as to cause adverse side effects, such as hyperviscosity syndromes, pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and the like. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount may vary with the subject's age, condition, and sex, as well as the extent of the disease in the subject and can be determined by one of skill in the art. The dosage of the therapeutically effective amount may be adjusted by the individual physician or veterinarian in the event of any complication. A therapeutically effective amount may vary from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, most preferably from about 0.2 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg, in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or several days. Preferred is administration of the antibody for 2 to 5 or more consecutive days in order to avoid “rebound” of virus replication from occurring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be administered by injection or by gradual infusion over time. The administration of the monoclonal antibodies of the invention may, for example, be intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intracavity, subcutaneous, or transdermal. Techniques for preparing injectate or infusate delivery systems containing antibodies are well known to those of skill in the art. Generally, such systems should utilize components which will not significantly impair the biological properties of the antibodies, such as the paratope binding capacity (see, for example, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n18th edition, 1990, Mack Publishing). Those of skill in the art can readily determine the various parameters and conditions for producing antibody injectates or infusates without resort to undue experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers (such as those based on Ringer's dextrose), and the like. Preservatives and other additives may also be present such as, for example, antimicrobials, anti-oxidants, chelating agents, and the like.\n\n\n \n \nMonoclonal Antibodies that Bind or Neutralize \n \n \nDengue Type\n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 Viruses\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4) and several other arthropod-borne flaviviruses, including tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and yellow fever virus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) are important human pathogens. Currently, dengue viruses are the most important in terms of morbidity and geographic distribution (Gubler, D. J. 1998 \nClin. Microbiol. Rev. \n11:480-496; Monath, T. P. 1994 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n91:2395-2400). Patients with dengue usually develop fever, rash, and joint pain, and the disease is self-limited. Occasionally, more severe forms of disease, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue hemorrhagic shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), also occur especially in the dengue endemic regions of Southeast Asia and more recently of Central and South America. It is estimated that 50-100 million dengue infections and several hundred thousand cases of DHF occur every year. \nAedes aegypti \nand \nA. albopictus \nmosquitoes are the principal vectors for human-to-human transmission of dengue viruses. Control of dengue epidemics by spraying of insecticides to reduce the vector mosquito population has proven to be rather ineffective. \nAedes \nmosquito species are also responsible for transmission of WNV, which emerged for the first time in New York in 1999 (Lanciotti, S. et al. 1999 \nScience \n286:2333-2337). Since that time the virus has spread widely to most of the continental U.S. There were several thousand reported WNV infections with mortality of two hundred in 2002 (O'Leary, D. R. et al. 2004 \nVector Borne Zoonotic Dis. \n4:61-70). Prevention of WNV infections has become an important public health issue in the U.S. and many other countries.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDengue infection is thought to induce a life-long immunity against the same serotype of virus. Cross-protection against other dengue virus serotypes (heterotypic immunity) in humans is brief, lasting only 2-9 months (Sabin, A. 13. 1952. \nAm. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. \n1:30-50). Concurrent or sequential infections with different dengue virus serotypes are common (Gubler, D. J. et al. 1985 \nAm. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. \n34:170-173; Laille, M. et al. 1991 \nJ. Med. Virol. \n34:51-54; Wang, W. K. et al. 2003 \nJ. Microbiol. Immunol. Infect. \n36:89-95). Epidemiological data suggest that a subsequent infection with a dengue virus serotype different from the serotype of the previous infection is more frequently associated with severe dengue illness than is the primary dengue infection. This observation has led to the hypothesis that immunopathological mechanisms involving the activities of dengue virus-specific antibodies or cytotoxic T cells contribute to dengue severity (Halstead, S. B. 1979 \nJ. Inf. Dis. \n140:527-533; Halstead, S. B. 1988 \nScience \n239:476-481). However, evidence also indicates that dengue virulence could be in part due to a virus factor, such as replication capacity (Rosen, L. 1996 \nBull. Soc. Pathol. Exot. \n89:91-3; discussion 93-94; Wang, W. K. et al. 2003 \nVirology \n305:330-338). In order to better protect against dengue infection and to minimize the risk of severe dengue, the current immunization strategy favors the use of a tetravalent vaccine against all four dengue serotypes. However, development of a safe and effective vaccine against dengue has been elusive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreviously, we described an alternative strategy for the prevention of dengue fever by passive immunization with humanized antibodies. Repertoire cloning was employed to identify Fab antibody fragments from chimpanzees infected with all four dengue virus serotypes. One of these Fabs, 5H2, efficiently neutralized DENV-4 and was subsequently converted to a full-length IgG antibody containing human IgG sequences. Humanized antibody IgG 5H2 was produced in mammalian CHO cells and shown to neutralize DENV-4 at a 50% plaque reduction (PRNT\n50\n) titer of 0.03-0.05 μg/ml by a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). This success prompted us to employ the phage library constructed from the chimpanzee infected with multiple dengue virus serotypes in an effort to recover Fab fragments against the other three dengue virus serotypes. In this study, we describe identification of Fab fragments that are broadly cross-reactive with all four dengue viruses as well as with other major insect-borne flaviviruses. Several of these Fabs were shown to cross-neutralize DENV-1 and DENV-2 at a similar high titer and DENV-3 or DENV-4 at a reduced titer. A full-length humanized IgG1 antibody, designated IgG 1A5, was produced by combining Fab 1A5 with human IgG1 sequences. Humanized IgG1 1A5 antibody, like Fab 1A5, efficiently neutralized DENV-1 and DENV-2, but less efficiently neutralized DENV-3 and DENV-4 as well as other flaviviruses.\n\n\n \n \nInoculation of Chimpanzees with Multiple Dengue Virus Serotypes and Preparation of Lymphocytes from Bone Marrow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described previously, two chimpanzees (#1616 and #1618) that had been intrahepatically transfected with infectious RNA transcripts of a full-length DENV-4 cDNA clone were infected subcutaneously (sc) nine-and-half months later with a mixture of DENV-1 (Western Pacific strain), DENV-2 (New Guinea C strain, prototype) and DENV-3 (strain H87), each at 10\n6 \nplaque forming units (pfu), diluted in minimal essential medium (MEM) plus 0.25% human serum albumin. Twelve weeks after infection with the multiple dengue virus serotypes, bone marrow was aspirated from each chimpanzee and the lymphocytes were prepared by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Paque gradient.\n\n\n \nConstruction of γ1/κ Chimpanzee Fab Antibody Library.\n\n\n \n \n \nRepertoire cloning of chimpanzee Fab fragments was described earlier. Briefly, approximately 3×10\n7 \nbone marrow lymphocytes from chimpanzee 1618, which developed higher neutralizing antibody titers against DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3 than did chimpanzee #1616, were used for phage library construction. Total RNA from lymphocytes was extracted using the RNA Extraction kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) and reverse-transcribed with oligo dT as primer using the ThermoScript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). Chimpanzee V\nL\n-C\nL \nDNA sequences were amplified by PCR using seven pairs of human κ light chain family-specific primers and a \nconstant domain\n 3′ primer using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmers) (Barbas, C. F. et al. 1991 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n88:7978-7982; Glamann, J. et al. 1998 \nJ. Virol. \n72:585-592; Persson, M. A. et al. 1991 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n88:2432-6; Schofield, D. J. et al. 2000 \nJ. Virol. \n74:5548-55). Chimpanzee V\nH\n-C\nH1 \nDNA sequences were similarly amplified using nine human γ1 heavy chain family-specific 5′ primers and a chimpanzee γ1 specific 3′ primer across the constant domain 1-hinge junction (Glamann, J. et al. 1998 \nJ. Virol. \n72:585-592; Schofield, D. J. et al. 2000 \nJ. Virol. \n74:5548-55).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPooled κ light chain DNA fragments were digested with SacI and XbaI and then cloned into the pComb 311 vector by electroporation of electrocompetent \nE. coli \nXL-1 Blue (Stratagene). The recombinant plasmid was used for cloning of the pooled γ1 heavy chain DNA fragments at the XhoI and Spa sites. A library size of 2-4×10\n8 \ncolonies of transformed \nE. coli \nwas obtained at each cloning.\n\n\n \n \nPreparation of Dengue Viruses from Infected Mosquito C6/36 Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMosquito C6/36 cells were grown in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) plus gentamycin and fungizone. Confluent cells were infected with DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 or DENV-4 of the strain indicated above, each at 0.1 multiple of infection (moi) in MEM containing 2% PBS. DENV-1, prototype Hawaii strain, and DENV-2, New Guinea B strain, were also used. Infected cells were placed in serum-free medium (VP-SFM, Gibco Corp) one day after infection and incubated at 28° C. The culture medium was harvested on \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 6, 8, and 10 after infection and fresh serum-free medium was added after each harvest. The virus titer in the medium was determined by a focus assay on Vero cells and the medium was kept refrigerated for use as panning antigen and for ELISA and neutralization assays.\n\n\n \nPreparation of WNV/DENV-4 Chimera, JEV, and LGTV.\n\n\n \n \n \nVero cells were grown in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS plus gentamycin and fungizone at 37° C. Confluent Vero cell monolayers were infected with 1 moi of Langat virus strain TP 21 (LGTV) or WNV/DENV-4 chimera, and the infected cells were placed in MEM containing 2% fetal calf serum. TEV vaccine strain SA14-14-2 was also propagated in Vero cells. The culture medium was harvested 7 days after infection and titered by focus assay on Vero cells. For use as ELISA antigens, LGTV, JEV and WNV/DENV-4 were grown in serum-free medium as described above. For neutralization assays, each of the above virus stocks was prepared in MEM containing 20% FBS and frozen until use.\n\n\n \nPanning of Phage Library Using DENV-1, DENV-2 or DENV-3 as Antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pComb H DNA library that contained the V\nL\n-C\nL \nand V\nH\n-C\nH1 \ninserts constructed earlier was again used for phage preparation. Identification of Fabs that were recovered from separate pannings against DENV-1, DENV-2 or DENV-3 was performed as described earlier. Briefly, a bacterial culture greater than 2×10\n8 \ndiversity prepared by transformation with the plasmid DNA library was infected with VSC M13 helper phage (Stratagene) at 50 moi to generate a phage display library. The phage library was panned by affinity binding on DENV-1, DENV-2, or DENV-3 virions captured by chimpanzee dengue virus-convalescent sera coated on the wells of an ELISA plate. Following three cycles of panning, the selected phage was used for infection of \nE. coli \nXL-1 to produce phagemid DNA. Phagemid DNA was cleaved with SpeI and NheI to remove the phage gene III segment and circularized prior to use for transformation of \nE. coli \nXL-1. \nE. coli \ncolonies were screened by ELISA to identify clones that yielded soluble Fab fragments reactive with DENV-1, DENV-2 or DENV-3.\n\n\n \nDNA Sequencing of Dengue Virus-Specific Fab Clones.\n\n\n \n \n \nPlasmid from selected \nE. coli \nclones producing soluble Fabs was first analyzed by digestion with BstN1 to identify clones with distinct cleavage patterns. Sequence analysis of the V\nH \nand V\nL \nDNA inserts was performed on an automated DNA sequencer using a Taq fluorescent dideoxynucleotide terminator cycle sequencing kit. The following primers were used: 5′ ACAGCTATCGCGATTGCAGTG (SEQ ID NO: 193) and 5′ CACCTGATCCTCAGATGGCGG (SEQ ID NO: 194) for sequencing the V\nL \nsegments; 5′ ATTGCCTACGGCAGCCGCTGG (SEQ ID NO: 195) and 5′ GGAAGTAGTCCTTGACCAGGC (SEQ ID NO: 196) for sequencing the V\nH \nsegments. Software Vector NTi Suite 7.0 (InforMax) was used for analysis of the sequences. The DNAPLOT software program (MRC Center for Protein Engineering) was used for a homologous sequence search of the human IgG variable segments in the data bank.\n\n\n \nFab Production and Purification\n\n\n \n \n \nSelected \nE. coli \nclones were grown in 2 liters of L-broth containing 1% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml tetracycline to an early log phase at 30° C. The bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in 2 liters of L-broth containing ampicillin and tetracycline plus 0.1 mM inducer isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for growth at 30° C. for 4-5 hr (Glamann, J. et al. 1998 \nJ. Virol. \n72:585-592; Schofield, D. J. et al. 2000 \nJ. Virol. \n74:5548-55). After induction, the bacteria were collected and resuspended in 40 ml of buffer containing 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzene sulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). After three cycles of freezing and thawing to release the soluble Fab product from the bacterial periplasm, clear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm in a Beckman JA-20 rotor for 60 min. The histidine-tagged Fab was affinity-purified through a column of TALON Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech). The purity of the Fab preparation was verified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the Fab concentration determined by ELISA using human IgG F(ab′)\n2 \n(Cappel) as a protein weight standard.\n\n\n \nBiotinylation of Purified Fab Fragments and Competition ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \nPurified Fab was biotinylated with EZ-Link NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) as suggested by the supplier. After extensive dialysis against PBS, the biotin-labeled Fab was analyzed for binding to DENV-1 or DENV-2 coated on wells of a microtiter plate. For competition ELISA, a fixed concentration of biotin-labeled Fab was mixed with the crude or purified preparation of competing Fabs in serial dilutions. The mixture was added to DENV-1 or DENV-2 coated wells and incubated at 37° C. After washing, streptavidin-alkaline phophatase (Pierce) was added for detection of biotinylated Fab reactive to DENV-1 or DENV-2 as described previously.\n\n\n \nWestern Blot Analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \nVirus samples were prepared by mixing approximately 10\n5 \npfu of each virus with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer containing 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 0.03% bromophenol blue. The sample was loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis. The gel was blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane, treated with 5% skim milk, reacted with Fab 1A5 and then with a 1/1000 dilution of goat anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxides (Pierce). The blot was developed with Sigma fast 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich).\n\n\n \nMeasurement of Neutralizing Activity of Chimpanzee Fab Fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \nPurified Fab antibodies were used in PRNT to determine the neutralizing titer against each of the four dengue virus serotypes. Typically, approximately 50 pfu of the dengue virus in 100 μl of MEM was mixed with the same volume of the Fab in serial dilution. The dengue virus-Fab antibody mixture was incubated at 37° C. for 1 h and then 100 μl of the mixture was added to confluent Vero cells in a 24-well plate in duplicate. After an 1-h adsorption period at 37° C., an overlay of MEM containing 2% FCS and 1% Tragacanth gum was added and the plates were placed in a 5% CO\n2\n— incubator at 37° C. for 3-4 days. Virus foci that formed on the cell monolayer were immuno-stained (Okuno, Y, et al. 1985 \nArch. Virol. \n86:129-135). The PRNT\n50 \ntiter in μg/ml was calculated. Neutralization of the BSL-3 flaviviruses TBEV, JEV and WNV was performed with attenuated BSL-2 variants LGTV, the JEV strain SA 14-14-2 and the WNV/DENV-4 chimera, which contains the WNV preM-E structure protein genes on the DENV-4 backbone.\n\n\n \nConstruction of Recombinant Plasmid and Expression of Whole IgG1 Molecules in CHO Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pFab CMV-dhfr vector for full-length IgG1 expression was constructed from plasmid pFab CMV originally obtained from P. Sanna (Scripps Research Institute) (Sanna, P. P. et al. 1999 \nImmunotechnology \n4:185-8). A di-hydrofolate reductase gene (dhfr) along with the transcription signals was inserted at the unique Not I site as a selecting marker and for gene copy amplification. In addition, an A to G substitution at the last nucleotide position of the intron that preceded the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 exon present in the original vector was made to enable full-length IgG1 expression. Fabs 2H7, 1A5, 3A2, and 1B2 were selected for conversion to whole IgG1 antibodies for analysis of their neutralizing activity. The V\nL \nDNA segment of each Fab was inserted into the expression vector at the SacI and XbaI sites. The V\nH \nDNA segment of the Fab, regenerated by PCR, was then added at the XhoI and SpeI sites. The chimpanzee-specific sequences in the hinge region were converted to the human sequence as described previously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProduction of whole IgG molecules in CHO/dhfr-cells (ATCC) was carried out by transfection with RsrII-linearized plasmid in the presence of Lipofectamine (Gibco). Two days after transfection, cells in a T25 flask were re-plated in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco Medium supplemented with 10% FBS plus 10\n−7 \nM methotrexate (MTX) in the absence of hypoxanthine/thymidine as selecting medium (Dorai, H., and G. P. Moore. 1987 \nJ. Immunol. \n139:4232-4241; Wood, C. R. et al. 1990 \nJ. Immunol. \n145:3011-6). Colonies of CHO cells resistant to 2×10\n−7 \nM MTX appeared approximately two weeks after transfection. The transformed CHO cells secreting IgG1 in the medium were identified following cloning in a 96- or 24-well plate. To produce IgG1, the selected CHO cells were adapted to grow in CHO CD medium. The culture medium was concentrated and the IgG1 product was purified through a protein-A affinity column (Pierce). The apparent affinity constant (Kd) for the binding of the IgG to each of the four dengue virus serotypes was calculated as the antibody concentrations that gave 50% maximum binding by ELISA (Lin, C.-W. and S.-C. Wu 2003 \nJ. Virol. \n77:2600-2606; Moore, J. P. et al. 1995 \nJ. Virol. \n69:101-109).\n\n\n \n \nChimpanzee Antibody Library and Identification of Fabs Recovered by Panning with DENV-1, DENV-2 or DENV-3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described earlier, two chimpanzees (#1616 and #1618) that had been intrahepatically transfected with infectious DENV-4 RNA were infected with a mixture of DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3 nine-and-half months later. Each of the chimpanzees developed moderate to high PRNT\n50 \ntiters of antibodies against DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3. The PRNT\n50 \ntiter against DENV-4 also increased appreciably after secondary dengue infection. Chimpanzee 1618 developed slightly higher neutralizing antibody titers against DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3 than did chimpanzee 1616. Previously, we constructed a phage library from bone marrow mRNA of chimpanzee 1618 and identified DENV-4 and dengue-complex specific Fabs following panning of the library against DENV-4. Based on this experience, we reasoned initially that separate panning of the phage library using DENV-1, DENV-2 or DENV-3 would yield dengue type, sub-complex or complex-specific Fab clones that could be further analyzed for their capacity to neutralize DENV-1, DENV-2 or DENV-3 in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) Fabs recovered from panning against DENV-1. Several Fab clones with distinct BstN1 digestion patterns were recovered following panning with DENV-1. PRNT against DENV-1 was carried out to identify the most promising neutralizing Fab antibodies. Fab clones that did not neutralize DENV-1 or only poorly neutralized it, were not studied further. Table 5 shows that Fab 2H7 and Fab 2H5 efficiently neutralized DENV-1 at a PRNT\n50 \ntiter of 0.26 and 0.47 μg/ml, respectively. Unexpectedly, each of these Fabs also neutralized DENV-2 at a titer similar to that detected for DENV-1. The PRNT\n50 \ntiter of these Fabs against DENV-3 or DENV-4 was reduced by 20 fold or more. Fab 2H5 and Fab 2H7 shared similar sequences (see below), but Fab 2H5 neutralized all four dengue viruses at lower titers than did Fab 2H7. Fab 2H5 was therefore not studied further.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) Fabs recovered from panning against DENV-2. Three distinct neutralizing Fabs, i.e., 1A5, 1A10, and 1B2, were identified in this experiment (Table 5). Like Fab 2H7 and Fab 2H5 identified above, Fab 1A5 efficiently neutralized both DENV-1 and DENV-2 at a similar PRNT\n50 \nof 0.49 and 0.77 μg/ml, respectively, and also neutralized DENV-3 and DENV-4, but at a lower titer. Fab 1B2 and Fab 1A10 neutralized DENV-1 more efficiently than DENV-2 and much more efficiently than DENV-3 or DENV-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) Fabs recovered from panning against DENV-3. A large number of Fab clones showing a distinct BstN1 digestion pattern were recovered from the library by panning against DENV-3. Fab 3A2 neutralized DENV-1 and DENV-2 at a titer of 0.37 and 1.33 μg/ml, respectively and also efficiently neutralized DENV-3 at a PRNT\n50 \ntiter of 3.0 μg/ml (Table 5). The ability of Fabs to cross-neutralize DENV-1 and DENV-2 at a similar high titer was a novel characteristic of several monoclonal antibodies, regardless of the dengue virus serotype used as the panning antigen.\n\n\n \nAnalysis of V\nH 4 \nand V\nL \nSequences.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences in the V\nL \nand V\nH \nsegment of six selected Fab antibodies are shown in \nFIGS. 6A and 6B\n. Fabs 2H7, 2H5, 1A5 and 3A2 were closely related, as an identical or nearly identical sequence was present in various framework segments or complementarity determining regions (CDR's) of the light chain or the heavy chain. Nevertheless, minor sequence variations (two or more amino acids) among them were present in other regions of the heavy chain as well as some regions of the light chain. These Fabs contained an identical or nearly identical 16-amino acid sequence, which included two cysteines in the CDR3-H domain principally involved in antigen binding. The sequences of Fab 1B2 and Fab 1A10 were distinct and contained a CDR3-H sequence different from those of Fabs 2H7, 1A5 and 3A2. Table 6 shows the result of a homologous sequence search of human IgG germ line gene segments most related to the V\nH \nor V\nL \nsegments of the selected six chimpanzee Fabs. The germ line origin was the same for Fab 2H7, 2H5, 1A5, or 3A2 and the homology with the most related human sequence was 82-94%, excluding the CDR3-H and CDR3-L regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe V\nH \nand V\nL \nsequences of these Fab antibodies were also compared with the corresponding sequence of the Fab antibodies previously recovered by panning with DENV-4. Interestingly, Fab 1A10 and Fab 3E4 shared an identical V\nH \nsequence with the exception of two amino acids: one in the FR1 region and the other in the CDR3 region (\nFIG. 6B\n). These two Fabs, however, differed appreciably in various regions of the V\nL \nsequence (\nFIG. 6A\n). While the neutralizing activity of Fab 3E4 against DENV-1 and DENV-2 was low (titer greater than 42 μg/ml), Fab 1A10 neutralized DENV-1 and DENV-2 at a titer of 0.94 and 5.26 μg/ml, respectively.\n\n\n \nAntigen Specificity of Chimpanzee Fabs.\n\n\n \n \n \nSoluble Fabs were analyzed for binding activity to each of the four dengue virus serotypes by ELISA. Table 7 shows that each of these Fabs was broadly cross-reactive for all four dengue serotypes and had a similar high binding titer. Surprisingly, none of the Fab antibodies recovered from panning with DENV-1, DENV-2 or DENV-3 reacted in a dengue type-specific manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadio-immunoprecipitation was performed to determine the antigen binding specificity for each of the Fabs using a radio-labeled lysate of Vero cells infected with DENV-1; DENV-2, DENV-3 or DENV-4. \nFIG. 7\n shows a typical auto-radiogram of the immune precipitate separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fab 1A5 and Fab 1A10 specifically precipitated the E protein, migrating as a doublet, of each of the four dengue viruses. Fabs 2H7, 3A2 and 1B2 also precipitated E from the lysate of each of the four dengue virus serotypes.\n\n\n \nAnalysis of Chimpanzee Fabs Binding to DENV-1 or DENV-2 by Competition ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \nFabs 1A5, 2H7 and 3A2 shared an identical or nearly identical CDR3-H sequence, whereas Fab 1A10 and Fab 1B2 each contained a distinct CDR3-H sequence. The relatedness of the binding sites for Fabs 1A5, 1A10 and 1B2 on DENV-1 or DENV-2 was analyzed by competition ELISA. Surprising, binding of affinity-purified, biotinylated Fab 1A10 to DENV-1 was competed by the unlabeled crude preparation of Fab 1B2 and Fab 1A5 (\nFIG. 8A\n). Similarly, binding of biotinylated Fab 1A5 to DENV-1 was competed by Fab 1B2 and Fab 1A10 and binding of Fab 1B2 was competed by Fab 1A5 and Fab 1A10 (\nFIGS. 8B and 8C\n). When DENV-2 was tested, the binding competition patterns among these three Fabs were essentially identical to that seen with DENV-1 (\nFIGS. 8D\n, \n8\nE, and \n8\nF). As a control, chimpanzee Fab 1F2, which did not bind either DENV-1 or DENV-2, failed to compete any of the labeled Fabs. Thus, the site that was occupied by Fab 1A5 overlapped with the site occupied by Fab 1B2 and Fab 1A10 on DENV-1, and on DENV-2 E. The Fab 1A5 binding site (epitope) on the DENV-2 E protein was mapped in a separate study (see herein).\n\n\n \nCross-Reactivity of Chimpanzee Fabs to WNV and Other Flaviviruses.\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the course of this study, we found that the Fabs recovered in this study also reacted with the WNV/DENV-4 chimera at a high titer as detected by ELISA. Fab 1A5 was selected for analysis of binding to the four dengue viruses and other major flaviviruses. Western blot analysis (\nFIG. 9\n) showed that Fab 1A5 reacted relatively strongly with each of the four dengue viruses and WNV/DENV-4. By comparison, Fab 1A5 bound weakly to JEV SA14-14-2 and LGTV TP 21. The reduced binding activity of Fab1A5 to the JEV SA14-14-2 and LGTV TP21 reflected the low PRNT\n50 \ntiter (greater than 70 μg/ml) of Fab 1A5 against these two viruses. Interestingly, Fab 1A5 neutralized WNV/DENV-4 chimera at a PRNT\n50 \ntiter of 4.8 μg/ml, similar to that measured for DENV-3 and DENV-4.\n\n\n \nProduction and Characterization of Full-Length Humanized IgG1 Antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \nWith the exception of Fab 1A10, the Fab fragments were each converted to the full-length IgG1 antibody in combination with the human IgG1 sequence using the expression vector pFab CMV-dhfr for transformation of CHO cells. Among these antibodies, IgG1 1A5 was produced in the highest yield, approximately 2 μg/10\n6 \ncells per day in the medium of the transformed CHO cells. IgG1 1A5 was selected to determine the PRNT\n50 \nagainst each of the four dengue viruses (\nFIG. 10\n). IgG1 1A5 neutralized DENV-1 and DENV-2 at a PRNT\n50 \ntiter of 0.48 and 0.95 μg/ml, respectively. IgG1 1A5 also neutralized DENV-3 and DENV-4 at a PRNT\n50 \ntiter of 3.2 and 4.3 μg/ml, respectively. The apparent affinity constants determined by ELISA, termed ELSA Kd, were calculated at 0.50, 0.60, 0.67 and 0.82 nM for DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4, respectively, in the same decreasing order as the PRNT\n50 \ntiters against these viruses. Humanized IgG1 1A5 was also tested for neutralization of WNV/DENV-4, JEV strain SA14-14-2 and LGT strain TP21 by PRNT. The PRNT\n50 \ntiter against WNV/DENV-4 was −3.8 μg/ml, whereas the PRNT\n50 \ntiter against JEV strain SA14-14-2 and LGTV strain TP21 was 21 and 28 μg/ml, respectively (\nFIG. 10\n).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDengue virus cross-neutralizing activities of Fabs identified\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby panning against DENV-1, DENV-2, or DENV-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPanning\n\n\nPRNT\n50 \ntiter (μg/ml) against\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFab\n\n\nantigen\n\n\nDENV-1\n\n\nDENV-2\n\n\nDENV-3\n\n\nDENV-4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2H7\n\n\n\n\nDENV-1\n\n\n0.26\n\n\n0.33\n\n\n5.92\n\n\n7.26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2H5\n\n\n\n\nDENV-1\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n0.53\n\n\n20.8\n\n\n9.26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1A5\n\n\n\n\nDENV-2\n\n\n0.49\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n3.49\n\n\n4.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1A10\n\n\nDENV-2\n\n\n0.94\n\n\n5.26\n\n\n26.3\n\n\n12.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1B2\n\n\nDENV-2\n\n\n0.50\n\n\n3.13\n\n\n>100\n\n\n29.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3A2\n\n\n\n\nDENV-3\n\n\n0.37\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n2.99\n\n\n4.71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3E4*\n\n\nDENV-4\n\n\n42.7\n\n\n>100\n\n\n>100\n\n\n40.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFabs which are underlined shared a similar VH sequence or VL sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Fab 3E4 was recovered from the chimpanzee after primary infection by panning against DENV-4 as described previously.

Data are presented as log10 of the reciprocal dilution that gave an OD reading 2 fold or higher than the background. Dengue virus cross-reactive Fab 3E4 and DENV-4 specific Fab 5H2 were described previously. The starting concentration of each Fab was approximately 140 μg/ml.\n \n \n \n \n \n*Chimpanzee Fab 1F2 was used as negative control.\n \n \n \n \n \n\nEpitope of Monoclonal Antibody that \nNeutralizes Dengue Type\n 1 and \nType\n 2 Viruses\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe epitope determinants of chimpanzee Fab antibody 1A5, which had been shown to be broadly reactive to flaviviruses and efficient for cross-neutralization of \ndengue type\n 1 and \ntype\n 2 viruses (DENV-1 and DENV-2), were studied by analysis of DENV-2 antigenic variants. Sequence analysis showed that one antigenic variant contained a Gly-to-Val substitution at \nposition\n 106 within the flavivirus-conserved fusion peptide loop of the envelope protein (E) and another variant contained a His-to-Gln substitution at \nposition\n 317 in E. Substitution of Gly\n106\nVal in DENV-2 E reduced the binding affinity of Fab 1A5 by approximately 80 fold, whereas substitution of His\n317\nGln had little or no effect on antibody binding as compared to the parental virus. Treatment of DENV-2 with (3 mercaptoethanol abolished binding of Fab 1A5, indicating that disulfide bridges were required for the structural integrity of the Fab 1A5 epitope. Binding of Fab 1A5 to DENV-2 was competed by an oligopeptide containing the fusion peptide sequence as shown by competition ELISA. Both DENV-2 antigenic variants were shown to be attenuated or at least similar to the parental virus, when evaluated for growth in cultured cells or for neurovirulence in mice. Fab 1A5 inhibited low pH-induced membrane fusion of mosquito C6/36 cells infected with DENV-1 or DENV-2, as detected by reduced syncytium formation. Both substitutions in DENV-2 E lowered the pH threshold for membrane fusion, as measured by fusion-from-within assay. In the 3-D structure of E, Gly\n106 \nin domain II and His\n317 \nin domain III of the opposite E monomer were spatially close. From the locations of these amino acids, Fab 1A5 is concluded to recognize a novel epitope that has not been mapped before with a flavivirus monoclonal antibody.\n\n\n \nIntroduction.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe flavivirus genome contains a positive strand RNA with one open reading frame coding for a polyprotein. The polyprotein is processed to produce the three structural proteins, i.e., the capsid (C), precursor membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins, plus seven nonstructural proteins, designated as NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5. The E protein is responsible for viral attachment to the putative cell surface receptor(s), fusion with the endosomal membranes upon entry, and mediating protective immune responses in the infected host. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the E proteins of most major flaviviruses have been identified (Heinz, F. X. 1986 \nAdv. Virus Res. \n31:103-168; Roehrig, J. T. 2003 \nAdv. Virus Res. \n59:141-175). Studies using these monoclonal antibodies have allowed identification of flavivirus group-, complex- and type-specific epitopes on the flavivirus E proteins. With few exceptions, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are flavivirus type- or subtype-specific, consistent with the flavivirus classification determined with the polyclonal sera (Calisher, C. H. et al. 1989 \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n70:37-43).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 3-D structure of the flat homodimeric E glycoprotein that is organized in a direction parallel to the viral membrane has been determined for TBEV (Rey, F. A. et al. 1995 \nNature \n375:291-298) and DENV-2 (Modis, Y. et al. 2003 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n100:6986-6991). The E subunit, approximately 500 amino acids in length, is folded into three structurally distinct domains, termed domains I, II and III. Domain I organizes the entire E structure and contains a flavivirus-conserved glycosylated asparagine. Domain II is folded into an elongated structure containing at its distal end the fusion peptide sequence, commonly called the fusion loop, which is conserved among the flaviviruses. The outward glycan unit in domain I protrudes to cover the fusion loop of the other subunit. There is an extensive interface contact between domain II and each of the three domains of the neighboring subunit. Domain III is an immunoglobulin-like region and lies at the end of the subunit. The dimeric E structure realigns to become trimeric when triggered by lowering the pH, while the three domains remain intact structurally (Bressanelli, S. et al. 2004 \nEMBO. J. \n23:728-738; Modis, Y. et al. 2004 \nNature \n427:313-319). During the transition, the fusion loop becomes exposed and re-oriented outward, making it available for membrane contact.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigenic determinants ants of flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies have been mapped to domain II, whereas determinants of subtype- and type-specific antibodies have been assigned to domains I and III (Heinz, F. X. 1986 \nAdv. Virus Res. \n31:103-168; Mandl, C. W. et al. 1989 \nJ. Virol. \n63:564-571; Roehrig, J. T. 2003 \nAdv. Virus Res. \n59:141-175; Roehrig, J. T. et al. 1998 \nVirology \n246:317-328). Most epitopes of neutralizing antibodies have been placed on the outer surface of the E glycoprotein, consistent with their accessibility to antibody binding. Mutations present in variant viruses that have escaped neutralization by antibodies blocking virus adsorption to Vero cells have been assigned to the lateral side of E in domain III (Crill, W. D., and J. T. Roehrig 2001 \nJ. Virol. \n75:7769-7773). Similarly, the mutations of antigenic variants that affect mouse neurovirulence have been mapped to this domain (Cecilia, D., and E. A. Gould 1991 \nVirology \n181:70-77; Holzmann, H. et al. 1997 \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n78:31-37; Jiang, W. R. et al. 1993 \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n74:931-935). These findings have suggested that the sequence in domain III may mediate viral attachment to the receptor on susceptible cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antigenic model of flavivirus E proteins established thus far from studies with the large repertoire of mouse monoclonal antibodies has provided much information about serological specificities and functional activities (Heinz, F. X. 1986 \nAdv. Virus Res. \n31:103-168; Roehrig, J. T. 2003 \nAdv. Virus Res. \n59:141-175). The question remains whether these antigenic epitopes are mouse-specific or whether in fact, they represent immuno-dominant sites on E recognized by the immune systems of other host species as well. Unfortunately, there is a lack of flavivirus monoclonal antibodies from other host species, especially higher primates or humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe have recently turned to the identification of chimpanzee Fab fragments by repertoire cloning and construction of full-length humanized IgG antibodies in an effort to develop a passive immunization strategy for prevention of dengue virus infection. We have described a DENV-4 specific chimpanzee Fab fragment and a derived full-length humanized IgG antibody highly efficient for neutralization of DENV-4. We have also identified chimpanzee Fab fragments, including 1A5, that exhibited a broad cross-reactivity to members of the flavivirus group and cross-neutralized DENV-1 and DENV-2 efficiently. The current study describes mapping the epitope determinants of Fab 1A5 by analysis of DENV-2 antigenic variants. A determinant critically involved in Fab 1A5 antibody binding and neutralization mapped to Gly\n106 \nwithin the flavivirus-conserved fusion loop in domain II of E. Another determinant affecting antibody neutralization, but not antibody binding, mapped to His\n317 \nin domain III of the neighboring E monomer. Amino acid substitutions in these DENV-2 variants lowered the pH threshold for membrane fusion of the infected cells. From the locations of these amino acids in the 3-D structure, the Fab 1A5 antibody is indicated to recognize a novel epitope on E.\n\n\n \nDengue Viruses and Cultured Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \nSimian Vero cells and mosquito C6/36 cells were grown in minimum essential medium (MEM) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.05 mg/ml gentamycin, and 2.5 units/ml fungizone. Mouse-adapted DENV-2 New Guinea B (NGB) and New Guinea C (NGC) strains were used for selection of antigenic variants. Stocks of the dengue viruses were prepared from infected C6/36 cells grown in VP-SFM medium (Invitrogen). The titers of these viruses were approximately 1×10\n7 \nplaque-forming units (pfu)/ml, determined on Vero cell monolayers.\n\n\n \nAntibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \nChimpanzee Fab 1A5 was identified by panning of a phage library using DENV-2 as described herein. Poly-histidine tagged Fab 1A5, expressed in \nE. coli, \nwas affinity-purified using TALON affinity resin (Clontech). The concentration of Fab was determined colorimetrically using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Hyper-immune mouse ascites fluid (HMAF) raised against DENV-2 and DENV-4 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Mouse monoclonal antibody Mab 3H5, specific to DENV-2, was kindly provided by R. Putnak (Hiramatsu, K. et al. 1996 \nVirology \n224:437-445).\n\n\n \nPlaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT).\n\n\n \n \n \nApproximately 50 pfu of DENV-2, or other viruses to be tested, were mixed with Fab 1A5 serially diluted in 250 μl of MEM. The mixture was incubated at 37° C. for 1 h prior to use for infection of Vero cells or C6/36 cells in duplicate wells of a 24-well plate. Infected Vero cells were added with a medium overlay containing 1% gum tragacanth (Sigma) and incubated at 37° C. for 3 days. Infected C6/36 cells were overlaid with medium containing 0.8% methyl cellulose and incubated at 32° C. for 5 days. Foci of infected cells were visualized by immuno-staining, using HMAF and anti-mouse IgG peroxidase (Pierce). The Fab titer in μg/ml that produced 50% reduction of foci (PRNT\n50\n) was calculated from at least 3 experiments.\n\n\n \nSelection of DENV-2 Antigenic Variants.\n\n\n \n \n \nAffinity-purified Fab 1A5 was used for selection of antigenic variants from mouse-passaged DENV-2 NGB and DENV-2 NGC, both of which had been previously sequenced in the C-prM-E region (Bray, M. et al. 1998 \nJ. Virol. \n72:1647-1651). Parental DENV-2 NGB or DENV-2 NGC, approximately 1×10\n7 \npfu, was mixed with Fab 1A5 at 25 μg/ml (equivalent to 100 PRNT\n50 \ntiters) in MEM and incubated at 37° C. for 1 h. The mixture was added to the Vero cell monolayer in a 35-mm culture plate for adsorption at 37° C. for 1 h. The monolayer was rinsed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 3 ml of MEM containing 2% FBS plus 5 μg/ml of Fab 1A5 was added and then the cells were incubated at 37° C. for 7 days. Progeny virus in the culture medium was collected for neutralization with Fab 1A5, followed by infection of Vero cells again. The neutralization cycle was repeated and the Fab 1A5-resistance phenotype of progeny virus monitored. Fab 1A5-resistant variants were isolated by plaque-to-plaque purification three times on Vera cells prior to amplification in C6/36 cells in the absence of the antibody.\n\n\n \nSequence Analysis of Antigenic Variants.\n\n\n \n \n \nGenomic RNA of each antigenic variant following amplification in C6/36 cells was extracted using Trizol solution (Life Technologies). Reverse transcription of RNA with primer AGTCTTGTTACTGAGCGGATTCC (SEQ ID NO: 198) at nucleotide positions 2587 to 2565 in DENV-2 NS1 was carried out using the Superscript kit (Life Technologies). Amplification of C-prM-E DNA with appropriate primers by PCR was performed, using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The DNA product was sequenced using primers spanning the DNA segment in an ABI sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems). The sequences of eight to ten plaque-purified isolates from each variant were analyzed. Sequence assembly was performed using Vector NTI Suite (InforMax). Structural modeling of the mutant E protein was performed using SwissModel and the crystal coordinates of DENV-2 (1OAN.pdb) as the template (Guex, N., and M. C. Peitsch 1997 \nElectrophoresis \n18:2714-2723; Modis, Y. et al. 2003 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n100:6986-6991). Swiss-Pdb Viewer was used for graphical development.\n\n\n \nConstruction of DENV-2/DENV-4 Chimeras.\n\n\n \n \n \nConstruction of chimeric cDNA containing the C-prM-E sequence of parental DENV-2 NGB, DENV-2 NGC or their antigenic variants on the DENV-4 background was as described (Bray, M., and C. J. Lai. 1991 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n88:10342-10346). Briefly, parental or variant DENV-2 C-prM-E DNA was generated by reverse transcription of virion RNA and PCR amplification. The DNA product was digested with BglII and XhoI and then cloned into plasmid p5′-2, replacing the corresponding DENV-4 sequence. The ClaI-XhoI fragment of p5′-2 DNA containing the DENV-2 C-prM-E sequence was then used to replace the corresponding fragment of full-length DENV-4 DNA, generating full-length chimeric DENV-2/DENV-4 DNA. Confluent C6/36 cells were transfected with the RNA transcripts of the chimeric DENV-2/DENV-4 DNA construct as described (Bray, M., and C. J. Lai. 1991 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n88:10342-10346; Lai, C. J. et al. 1991 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n88:5139-5143). Three weeks after transfection, the culture medium had a titer greater than 10\n6 \npfu/ml determined by focus assay on C6/36 cells. The C-prM-E DNA segment of progeny virus was prepared for sequence verification.\n\n\n \nConstruction of DENV-4 Variants.\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo silent mutations, A to C at nucleotide 378 and C to T at nucleotide 381 near the fusion loop encoding sequence in E, were first introduced to create a unique AgeI site in fall-length DENV-4 DNA (Lai, C. S. et al. 1991 \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n88:5139-5143). Site-directed mutagenesis by PCR was performed using a forward primer GTTTGACAGCTTATCATCGATAAGC (SEQ ID NO: 199) corresponding to nucleotides 8-32 of pBR322 and a reverse primer containing the AgeI cleavage sequence and following nucleotide substitution(s) in E: G to C at nucleotide 310 and G to A at nucleotide 311 for generating Gly\n104\nHis substitution; G to T at \nnucleotide\n 317 for Gly\n106\nVal substitution; and G to C at nucleotide 321 for Leu\n107\nPhe substitution. The PCR products, digested with ClaI and AgeI, were each cloned into full-length DENV-4 DNA. RNA transcription and transfection of C6/36 cells and recovery of virus were performed as described above.\n\n\n \nPolyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting.\n\n\n \n \n \nDengue virus was mixed with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer (2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.02% bromophenol blue) with or without 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol. The virus mixture was boiled for 10 min prior to loading for separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein gel was blot-transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane electrophoretically. The protein blot was treated with 5% skim milk and reacted with Fab 1A5 or Mab 3H5 for 1 h. The blot was then washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 three times and reacted with goat anti-human IgG or anti-mouse IgG peroxidase (Pierce) at room temperature for 1 h. The protein blot was developed with Sigma \n \nfast™\n \n 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich).\n\n\n \nAntibody Binding Affinity Assay.\n\n\n \n \n \nELISA was performed to determine the binding affinity of Fab 1A5 to parental DENV-2 and its antigenic variants (Lin, C.-W. and S.-C. Wu. 2003 \nJ. Virol. \n77:2600-2606; Moore, J. P. 1995 \nJ. Virol. \n69:101-109; Raffai, R. et al. 2000 \nJ. Biol Chem. \n275:7109-7116). Briefly, Mab 3H5-coated wells of a microtiter plate were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and then each virus was added to separate wells. Following incubation at 37° C. for 1 h, affinity-purified Fab 1A5 in serial dilution was added and the plate incubated at 37° C. for 1 h. Fab 1A5 bound to DENV-2 on the microtiter plate was detected using goat anti-human IgG alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). The apparent affinity constant, termed ELISA Kd, was calculated for the Fab 1A5 concentration in nM that produced 50% of maximum binding.\n\n\n \nBinding of Fab 1A5 to Oligopeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \nThree oligopeptides were analyzed: \ncontrol peptide\n 1, GAMHSALAGATEVD (SEQ ID NO: 200) and \ncontrol peptide\n 2, WWWQTFDAR (SEQ ID NO: 201) (Thullier, P. 2001 \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n82:1885-1982); and fusion peptide, DRGWGNGSGLFGKGG (SEQ ID NO: 202). The control peptides contained sequences unrelated to the fusion sequence and the fusion peptide contained the entire fusion sequence with a Ser substitution for Cys. In a direct binding assay, each of the oligopeptides was coated on a 96-well microtiter plate at 5 μg/well in 0.1 M carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. After washing with PBS containing 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 and then blocking with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), Fab 1A5 in PBS containing 1% BSA was added. Fab 1A5 bound to the oligopeptides was detected using goat anti-human IgG-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). The competition binding assay was performed essentially as described (Thullier, P. 2001 \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n82:1885-1982). Briefly, purified Fab 1A5 at 0.05 μg/ml was pre-incubated with each of the oligopeptides in serial dilution at 37° C. for 2 h. The reaction mixture was added to the wells of a microtiter plate coated with 25 μl of DENV-2 at 10\n5 \npfu/ml in PBS plus 1% BSA. Fab 1A5 bound to DENV-2 was detected as described.\n\n\n \nPlaque Morphology and Growth Analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \nVero cells in a 6-well plate were infected with parental DENV-2 NGB, DENV-2 NGC, or an antigenic variant and overlaid with medium containing 1% gum tragacanth. After incubation at 37° C. for 5 days, viral plaques were visualized by immuno-staining. The diameter of 20 plaques from each virus was measured on a digital image using Adobe Photoshop. For growth analysis, confluent monolayers of Vero cells or C6/36 cells in a 24-well plate were infected with each C6/36 cell-amplified virus at 0.01 multiplicity of infection (moi) in duplicate. Infected Vero cells were incubated at 37° C. and C6/36 cells at 32° C., and the culture medium was collected daily for 7 days. The virus sample was clarified by centrifugation and the titer determined by focus assay on Vero cells.\n\n\n \nMouse Neurovirulence.\n\n\n \n \n \nNeurovirulence of parental DENV-2 NGB and its antigenic variants was evaluated in outbred Swiss mice. Three-day-old suckling mice, in groups of 8 to 11, were inoculated by the intracranial (ic) route with 100, 10, or 1 pfu of each virus in 20 μl MEM containing 0.25% human serum albumin. Inoculated mice were observed for symptoms of encephalitis, including ruffled hair, hunched back, paralysis and death. Paralyzed, moribund mice were euthanized and scored during the four-week observation period. Student's t-Test was used to compare the LD\n50 \nin pfu between parental DENV-2 and its antigenic variants.\n\n\n \nFusion Activity Assay.\n\n\n \n \n \nFusion-from-within (FFWI) assays were performed for the DENV-2 parent and its antigenic variants as described (Randolph, V. B., and V. Stoliar 1990 \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n71:1845-1850). C6/36 cell monolayers in a 24-well plate were infected with each virus at 0.2 moi in MEM plus 10% FBS, buffered with 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) at pH 7.7 and incubated at 32° C. Four to five days after infection, the infected cell monolayer was rinsed once with PBS and fusion medium (MEM plus 20 mM HEPES for pH 7.0 to 7.8 or 20 mM 2-morpholinoethanesulonic acid (MES) for pH 5.4 to 6.6 was added before incubation at 40° C. for 2 hr. The infected cells were stained using the Diff-Quik Stain Set (Dade Behring) and examined for syncytium formation microscopically. The fusion index defined as (1−[number of cells/number of nuclei]) was calculated by counting 300 nuclei for each virus in at least five microscopic fields. The percentage of infected cells was determined by immunofluorescence assay using HMAF. Fusion inhibition by Fab 1A5 was performed as described (Guirakhoo, F. et al. 1991 \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n72:1323-1329). In brief, DENV-1 or DENV-2 infected C6/36 cells were incubated with Fab 1A5 at 37° C. for 1 h prior to exposure to the low pH medium. Infected cells were also incubated with Mab 3H5 in parallel as the control.\n\n\n \nSelection of DENV-2 Antigenic Variants Using Fab 1A5.\n\n\n \n \n \nMouse-adapted, neurovirulent DENV-2 NGB and DENV-2 NGC were used for selection of antigenic variants resistant to Fab 1A5 by neutralization in vitro. One DENV-2 NGB antigenic variant, designated as NGB-V1, was isolated after 8 cycles of neutralization and Vero cell passage. The PRNT\n50 \ntiter of NGB-V1 was 12.0 μg/ml, compared to that of parental DENV-2 NGB, which was 0.74 μg/ml (\nFIG. 11A\n). A second antigenic variant, designated NGB-V2, was isolated after 11 rounds of neutralization. NGB-V2 was completely resistant to neutralization by Fab 1A5 (>70 μg/ml). In parallel, selection of DENV-2 NGC variants of Fab 1A5 was also performed to provide additional information. This effort yielded one antigenic variant, termed NGC-V2. The PRNT\n50 \ntiter of NGC-V2 was >70 μg/ml, compared to that of parental DENV-2 NGC, which was 0.89 μg/ml (\nFIG. 11B\n).\n\n\n \nSequence Analysis of DENV-2 Antigenic Variants.\n\n\n \n \n \nTo map the Fab 1A5 epitope, the C-prM-E genes of antigenic variants NGB-V1, NGB-V2 and NGC-V2, and the parental viruses were sequenced. Variant NGB-V1 contained five nucleotide mutations in E, compared to the sequence of parental DENV-2 NGB (Table 8). Only the mutation at nucleotide 951 resulted in an amino acid substitution, Gln for His, at \nposition\n 317 in E, whereas other nucleotide changes were silent mutations. The E sequence of variant NGB-V2 contained two nucleotide changes: a silent mutation of C to T at nucleotide 222, which was also present in NGB-V1, and a G to T mutation at \nposition\n 317 that resulted in substitution of Val for, Gly at \nposition\n 106. Nucleotide changes were not found in the C-prM genes of variant NGB-V1 or NGB-V2. Variant NGC-V2 contained only a G to T change at \nnucleotide\n 317 in E that resulted in substitution of Val for Gly at \nposition\n 106, identical to that found in NGB-V2. \nFIG. 12\n shows alignment of the flavivirus E sequences surrounding Gly\n106 \n(panel A) and His\n317 \n(panel B). Gly\n106 \nis located within the 12-amino acid fusion peptide sequence (positions 98-109) that is nearly conserved among the arthropod-borne flaviviruses. His\n317 \nin E is also conserved among flaviviruses, although the surrounding sequences varied. In the 3-D structure, Gly\n106 \nis located in the cd loop at the tip of domain II and His\n317 \nis located between β-sheets A and B in domain III (\nFIGS. 13A and 13B\n). Despite their locations in different domains, Gly\n106 \nand His\n317 \nof the opposite E monomer are spatially close, approximately 16 Å apart, calculated with Swiss Model (Guex, N., and M. C. Peitsch 1997 \nElectrophoresis \n18:2714-2723).\n\n\n \nNeutralization of DENV-2/DENV-4 Chimeras by Fab 1A5.\n\n\n \n \n \nSequence analysis of antigenic variants indicated that Fab 1A5 appeared to recognize a novel epitope involving two closely spaced amino acids in different domains and from two interacting homodimers of DENV-2 E. The antigenic variants containing these mutations differed from the parent viruses in their Fab 1A5 neutralization titer. To provide additional evidence, we constructed DENV-2/DENV-4 chimeras composed of the parental DENV-2 NGB C-prM-E sequence or the variant C-prM-E sequence specifying the His\n317\n-Gln or Gly\n106\n-Val substitution present in NGB-\nV\n 1 and NGB-V2, respectively, on the DENV-4 genetic background. As predicted, Fab 1A5 neutralized the chimeric DENV-2 (NGB-P)/DENV-4 at a PRNT\n50 \ntiter of 0.64 μg/ml similar to that measured for parental DENV-2 NGB. Substitution of Gly\n106\nVal or His\n317\nGln in DENV-2 E of these chimeras conferred resistance to neutralization by Fab 1A5. The chimera containing Gly\n106\nVal had a PRNT\n50 \ntiter of >70 μg/ml and the chimera containing His\n317\nGln had a PRNT\n50 \ntiter of 31.7 μg/ml, similar to that measured for NGB-V2 and NGB-V1, respectively.\n\n\n \nBinding Affinity of Fab 1A5 to Antigenic Variants.\n\n\n \n \n \nTo gain an insight into the neutralizing mechanism, the Fab 1A5 binding activity of the DENV-2 NGB parent virus and its variants was first analyzed by Western blotting. Mab 3H5, which had been shown to recognize an epitope at or near positions 383-385 of DENV-2 E (Hiramatsu, K. et al. 1996 \nVirology \n224:437-445), was used for comparison. Mab 3H5 reacted to the DENV-2 NGB parent, variant NGB-V1, NGB-V2, and each of the chimeras similarly. Under the same conditions, Fab 1A5 reacted with the DENV-2 NGB parent and variant NGB-V1, but not with variant NGB-V2 (\nFIG. 14A\n, top panel). Similarly, binding of Fab 1A5 to the DENV-2 NGB-V1/DENV-4 chimera, but not the DENV-2 NGB-V2/DEN4 chimera was observed (\nFIG. 14A\n, bottom panel).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn ELISA was performed to semi-quantify the binding affinity of Fab 1A5 for DENV-2 NGB and its two variants (\nFIG. 14B\n and Table 9). The apparent binding affinity ELISA Kd of Fab 1A5 for highly resistant variant NGB-V2 was the lowest among the three viruses. Thus, Gly\n106 \nrepresented a major determinant of the Fab 1A5 epitope on the DENV-2 E. On the other hand, the binding affinity of Fab 1A5 for variant NGB-V1 was not appreciably reduced, compared to that for the DENV-2 NGB parent. It is possible that His\n317 \nrepresented a minor determinant of the Fab 1A5 epitope and affected Fab 1A5 neutralization through a steric effect.\n\n\n \nDisulfide Bridge Dependency of the Fab 1A5 Epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the DENV-2 E sequence, Fab 1A5 epitope determinant Gly\n106 \nis followed by Cys\n105\n, which forms a disulfide bridge with Cys\n74\n. It was of interest to provide data in support of the requirements of this and other disulfide bridges for functional integrity of the Fab 1A5 epitope. Treatment of DENV-2 NGB with β-mercaptoethanol abolished binding of Fab 1A5, as determined by Western blot analysis. Mab 3H5, which recognizes a conformational epitope on DENV-2 E also failed to bind DENV-2 NGB that was similarly treated.\n\n\n \nReactivity of Fab 1A5 to an Oligopeptide Containing the Fusion Peptide Sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo separate assays were performed to detect the reactivity of Fab 1A5 with oligopeptides bearing the fusion peptide sequence or unrelated sequences. Binding of Fab 1A5 to each of these oligopeptides immobilized on wells of a microliter plate was not detected. Competition binding was then performed in which Fab 1A5 was allowed to bind the individual oligopeptides in solution prior to testing for binding to DENV-2. The result in \nFIG. 15\n indicates that binding of Fab 1A5 to DENV-2 was competed by the fusion peptide sequence at the 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.17 mM, whereas each of the two control peptides containing unrelated sequences failed to compete, or only poorly. The concentration of Fab 1A5 used in the inhibition assay was as low as 1.04 nM. One interpretation of this result is that the oligopeptide in solution was able to assume the conformation that is required for binding to Fab 1A5, but rather inefficiently.\n\n\n \nGrowth Analysis of DENV2 NGB Antigenic Variants.\n\n\n \n \n \nFour days after infection of Vero cells, parental DENV-2 NGB, DENV-2 NGC and variant NGB-V-1 containing His\n317\nGln substitution produced plaques similar in size, averaging 1.2±0.2, 1.3±0.1, and 1.1±0.2 mm, respectively. Under the same conditions, variant NGB-V2 and NGC-V2 containing the Gly\n106\nVal substitution produced plaques of 0.4±0.1 and 0.6±0.1 mm, respectively, appreciably smaller than their parental virus. The growth kinetics of variant NGB-V1 and its parental virus were similar in C6/36 cells and in Vero cells (\nFIGS. 16A and 16B\n). On the other hand, variant NGB-V2 consistently yielded a titer ten-fold lower than its parental virus in C6/36 cells and in Vero cells during the log-phase period, i.e., at 3, 4 and 5 days after infection. Similarly, Gly\n106\nVal substitution reduced replication of DENV-2/DENV-4 chimeras in C6/36 and Vero cells (\nFIGS. 16C and 16D\n). The chimera containing His\n317\nGln replicated to a level that was comparable to that of NGB-V1 in C6/36 cells. For reasons not understood, the chimeras containing His\n317\nGln failed to replicate in Vero cells. Thus, Fab 1A5 selected antigenic variants that were attenuated, or at least, similar to the parental virus for growth in mammalian or insect cells.\n\n\n \nMouse Neurovirulence of DENV-2 Antigenic Variants.\n\n\n \n \n \nMouse neurovirulence of the DENV-2 NGB antigenic variants was evaluated by intracranial inoculation of three-day-old outbred Swiss mice. Mice infected with the DENV-2 NGB parent developed symptoms of encephalitis and eventually succumbed to infection. Table 10 shows that the LD\n50 \nof variant NGB-V1 was 8.9 pfu, not significantly different from the LD\n50 \nof 4.5 pfu calculated for the parental virus. The LD\n50 \nof variant NGB-V2 at 16.4 pfu was significantly lower than that of the parental virus, indicating that the variant containing Gly\n106\nVal substitution was attenuated.\n\n\n \nFusion Activity of DENV-2 Antigenic Variants.\n\n\n \n \n \nSince the mutation site of variant NGB-V2 was mapped within the flavivirus-conserved fusion peptide loop, the attenuating phenotype of the variant might be associated with alteration of membrane fusion. Initially, the fusion activity of the DENV-2 NGB parent and its variants was examined on infected C6/36 cells. Syncytium formation of the cell monolayer was evident 2 days after infection with parental DENV-2 NGB. At 4 to 5 days after infection, cells of the entire monolayer formed syncytia and the cytopathic effect was extensive. In contrast, formation of syncytium was not observed on cells infected with either NGB-V1 or NGB-V2 under the same conditions, and the cytopathic effect was not seen till 7 days of infection. Reduced fusion of C6/36 cells infected with the DENV-2/DENV-4 chimeras containing the amino acid substitution present in NGB-V1 or NBG-V2 was also evident, compared to cells infected with the chimera containing the parental sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also studied fusion of C6/36 cells infected with DENV-2 NGB and its antigenic variants at various pH's using the FFWI assay. Little or no fusion was observed at pH 7.0, 7.4 and 7.8. At pH 6.8, approximately 84% of the cells infected with parental DENV-2 formed syncytia. In contrast, 37% of cells infected with variant NGB-V1 and 46% of cells infected with variant NGB-V2 formed syncytia. \nFIG. 17\n shows the fusion activity in terms of the index (FI) for the DENV-2 NGB parent and its variants determined at various pH's. Accordingly, the DENV-2 NGB parent had a pH threshold for 50% maximum fusion activity (FI=0.5) at pH 6.77; variant NGB-V1 at pH 6.55; and variant NGB-V2 at pH 6.41.\n\n\n \nNeutralizing Activity of Fab 1A5 Against DENV-4 Mutants Containing Gly\n106\nVal or Leu\n107\nPhe Substitution in the Fusion Loop.\n\n\n \n \n \nAlignment of the flavivirus fusion sequences indicates JEV SA 14-14-2 contains a substitution of Phe for Leu at position 107, and Langat virus (LGTV) a His substituting for Gly at position 104 (\nFIG. 12\n). The neutralizing activity of Fab 1A5 against JEV SA 14-14-2 and LGTV was the lowest among the flaviviruses tested (Crill, W. D., and J. T. Roehrig 2001 \nJ. Virol. \n75:7769-7773). We questioned if substitution of Leu\n107\nPhe or Gly\n104\nHis contributed to the resistance of these viruses to Fab 1A5 neutralization. The question of whether Gly\n106 \nrepresented a determinant of the Fab 1A5 epitope on DENV-4 E was also raised.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo address the above questions in aggregate, full-length DENV-4 DNA was used to construct mutants containing various substitutions in the fusion peptide for analysis. DENV-4 mutants containing either Gly\n106\nVal or Leu\n107\nPhe were successfully constructed, however, a DENV-4 mutant containing the Gly\n104\nHis substitution was apparently not viable. \nFIG. 18A\n shows the binding of Fab 1A5 to the DENV-4 parent and mutants containing a Leu\n107\nPhe or Gly\n106\nVal substitution. Fab 1A5 for the DENV-4 mutant containing Gly\n106\nVal had a binding affinity of ELISA Kd>40 nM, significantly reduced as compared to the DENV-4 parent (ELISA Kd=0.65 nM; P<0.0001). Similarly, substitution of Leu\n107\nPhe in DENV-4 lowered the binding affinity of Fab 1A5 to an ELISA Kd at 3.07±0.27 nM, p<0.001. \nFIG. 18B\n presents Fab 1A5 neutralization of the DENV-4 parent and mutants.

Since angiogenesis also can be a normal biological process, inhibition of unwanted angiogenesis is preferably accomplished with selectivity for a pathological tissue, which preferably requires selective delivery of therapeutic molecules to the pathological tissue using targeted nanoparticles. The present invention provides compositions and methods to control angiogenesis through selective inhibition of the Ang-Tie biochemical pathway by nucleic acid molecules that induce RNA interference (RNAi), including inhibition of Ang-Tie pathway gene expression and inhibition localized at pathological angiogenic tissues. The present invention also provides compositions of and methods for using a tissue-targeted nanoparticle composition comprising polymer conjugates and further comprising nucleic acid molecules that induce RNAi.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is described here in detail, but one skilled in the art will appreciate the full extent of the invention.\n\n\n \nNucleic Acid Molecules for Ang/Tie2Pathway Gene Inhibition\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides nucleic acid molecules with a variety of physicochemical structures for targeting and silencing genes in the Ang/Tie2 pathway by RNAi. In one embodiment, the present invention provides nucleic acid molecules that result in a reduction in Ang-1, Ang-2, or Tie2 mRNA or protein levels of at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100%. This reduction may result up to 24 hours, up to 36 hours, up to 48 hours, up to 60 hours, or up to 72 hours post administration of the nucleic acid molecules. The nucleic acid molecules that result in this reduction may be administered at 10 nM siRNA, 5 nM siRNA, 2 nM, 1 nM, 0.5 nM, or 0.2 nM quantities. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules may have an IC50 for reducing Ang-2 protein levels of 0.75 nM or less, 0.5 nM or less, or 0.4 nM or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid molecules of the invention may be dsRNA or ssRNA. In one embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acid molecules are siRNA. The nucleic acid molecules may comprise 15-50, 15-30, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 or 25 base pairs. The nucleic acid molecules may comprise 5′- or 3′-single-stranded overhangs. In a certain embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules are blunt-ended. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is a double-stranded siRNA of 25 basepairs with blunt ends. Exemplary siRNA sequences of the invention targeting Ang/Tie2 pathway genes are shown in Tables 2-10. (For all sequences listed in Tables 2-10, the position is labeled such that the “A” of the ATG codon is considered to be \nposition\n 1.) siRNAs with 25 basepair double-stranded RNA with blunt ends were previously found to be some of the most potent inhibitors with the greatest duration of inhibition (WO 06/110813). Additionally, incorporation of non-naturally occurring chemical analogues may be useful in some embodiments of the invention. Such analogues include, but are not limited to, 2′-O-Methyl ribose analogues of RNA, DNA, LNA and RNA chimeric oligonucleotides, and other chemical analogues of nucleic acid oligonucleotides. In some embodiments, the siRNA targets both a human mRNA as well as the homologous or analogous mRNA in other non-human mammalian species such as primates, mice or rats.\n\n\n \n

present invention provides methods for inhibition of individual or combinations of genes active in the Ang-Tie pathway. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting or reducing angiogenesis in a tissue associated with undesired angiogenesis comprising administering to the tissue siRNA molecules that target Tie2 so that expression of Tie2 is decreased. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting or reducing angiogenesis in a tissue associated with undesired angiogenesis comprising administering to the tissue siRNA molecules that target Ang-1 so that expression of Ang-1 is decreased. In further embodiments, the invention provides a method of inhibiting or reducing angiogenesis in a tissue associated with undesired angiogenesis comprising administering to the tissue siRNA molecules that target Ang-2 so that expression of Ang-2 is decreased. In one embodiment, the tissue is a tumor.\n\n\n \nCombined Ang/Tie2 Pathway Gene Inhibition\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compositions and methods of the present invention for inhibition of angiogenesis are based on several fundamental aspects. First, pathological angiogenesis is a complex process and results from interactions of multiple proteins which are abnormally expressed or over-expressed in diseased tissues. Second, nucleic acid agents that activate RNAi are highly selective in a sequence specific manner. Third, inhibition of angiogenesis by modulation of protein activity can be operative by many methods, including but not limited to an inhibition of protein function (antagonists), stimulation of protein function (agonists), reduction of protein expression levels, and post transcriptional modification of proteins. Importantly, it may be desirable in the treatment of disease to effectively shut down a particular biological pathway that is critical for disease progression, by simultaneously blocking functions of ligands and their receptors, simultaneously blocking receptor activity and the activity of down stream signaling proteins, and/or simultaneously blocking redundant elements of a pathway. Such methods may be used for treating angiogenesis-related diseases including those that involve the Ang/Tie2 pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough clinical studies have demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacies, the toxicities of higher dosage and long term safety are major concerns, due to the different origins, different manufacturing processes and different chemistry properties of the components.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo overcome these problems, aspects of the present invention provide compositions of and methods of using nucleic acid molecules, including siRNA oligonucleotides, to provide a unique advantage, i.e., to achieve combinatorial effects with a combination of nucleic acid molecules, including siRNAs, that target multiple disease causing genes or target different sequences in the same gene in the same treatment. One advantage of the compositions and methods of the present invention is that all siRNA oligonucleotides are very similar chemically, pharmacologically, and can be produced from the same source and using the same manufacturing process. Another advantage provided by the present invention is that multiple siRNA oligonucleotides can be formulated in a single preparation such as a nanoparticle preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, an aspect of the present invention is to combine nucleic acid molecules, including siRNAs, so as to achieve specific and selective silencing of multiple genes in the Ang/Tie2 pathway and as a result achieve an inhibition of angiogenesis-related disease and a better clinical benefit. The present invention provides for combinations of siRNA targets including combinations of two or more targets selected from: Tie2, Ang-1 and Ang-2. The present invention also provides for combinations of siRNAs targeting one or more sequences within the same gene in the Ang/Tie2 pathway. Exemplary siRNA sequences silencing these mRNAs are listed in Tables 2-10. Such siRNA compositions may also be combined with siRNA that targets other angiogenic pathways such as the VEGF pathway, PDGF and EGF and their receptors, downstream signaling factors including RAF and AKT, and transcription factors including NFκB. Such siRNA compositions may also be combined with siRNA that target genes downstream of Tie2, Ang-1 and Ang-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment a combination of siRNA inhibiting Tie2 and two of its ligands Ang-1 and Ang-2 is used. In some embodiments, a combination of siRNA molecules that target Tie2 and siRNA molecules that target Ang-1 is used so that expression of both Tie2 and Ang-1 is decreased. In some embodiments, a combination of siRNA molecules that target Tie2 and siRNA molecules that target Ang-2 is used so that expression of both Tie2 and Ang-2 is decreased. In some embodiments, a combination of siRNA molecules that target Ang-1 and siRNA molecules that target Ang-2 is used so that expression of both Ang-1 and Ang-2 is decreased.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting or reducing angiogenesis in a tissue associated with undesired angiogenesis comprising administering to the tissue siRNA molecules that target Tie2 and siRNA molecules that target Ang-1 so that expression of Tie2 and Ang-1 is decreased. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting or reducing angiogenesis in a tissue associated with undesired angiogenesis comprising administering to the tissue siRNA molecules that target Tie2 and siRNA molecules that target Ang-2 so that expression of Tie2 and Ang-2 is decreased. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting or reducing angiogenesis in a tissue associated with undesired angiogenesis comprising administering to the tissue siRNA molecules that target Ang-1 and siRNA molecules that target Ang-2 so that expression of Ang-1 and Ang-2 is decreased. In further embodiments, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting or reducing angiogenesis in a tissue associated with undesired angiogenesis comprising administering to the tissue siRNA molecules that target Tie2, siRNA molecules that target Ang-1 and siRNA molecules that target Ang-2 so that expression of Tie2, Ang-1 and Ang-2 is decreased. In one embodiment, the tissue is a tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the invention is a combination of siRNA inhibiting Tie2, Ang-1 and Ang-2, PDGF and its receptors, and EGF and its receptors. Yet another embodiment is a combination of siRNA inhibiting the Tie2, Ang-1, and Ang-2 genes and their downstream signaling genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe siRNA oligonucleotides can be combined as a therapeutic for the treatment of angiogenesis-related disease. In one embodiment of the present invention they can be mixed together as a cocktail and in another embodiment they can be administered sequentially by the same route or by different routes and formulations and in yet another embodiment some can be administered as a cocktail and some administered sequentially. Other combinations of siRNA and methods for their combination will be understood by one skilled in the art to achieve treatment of angiogenesis-related diseases.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Methods of Use\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides methods for the treatment of angiogenesis-related diseases and conditions in a subject.

In further embodiments, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject afflicted with a disease or condition associated with undesired angiogenesis comprising administering to the subject siRNA molecules that target Ang-2 so that expression of Ang-2 is decreased.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject afflicted with a disease or condition associated with undesired angiogenesis comprising administering to the subject siRNA molecules that target Tie2 and siRNA molecules that target Ang-1 so that expression of Tie2 and Ang-1 is decreased. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject afflicted with a disease or condition associated with undesired angiogenesis comprising administering to the subject siRNA molecules that target Tie2 and siRNA molecules that target Ang-2 so that expression of Tie2 and Ang-2 is decreased.

The angiogenesis-related diseases include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, such as breast, ovarian, stomach, endometrial, salivary gland, lung, kidney, colon, colorectum, esophageal, thyroid, pancreatic, prostate and bladder carcinomas and other neoplastic diseases, such as melanoma, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, glioma, hepatocellular (liver) carcinoma, sarcoma, head and neck cancers, mesothelioma, biliary (cholangiocarcinoma), small bowel adenocarcinoma, pediatric malignancies and glioblastoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntagonizing these molecules is expected to inhibit pathophysiological processes, and thereby act as a potent therapy for various angiogenesis-dependent diseases. Besides solid tumors and their metastases, haematologic malignancies, such as leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma, are also angiogenesis-dependent. Excessive vascular growth contributes to numerous non-neoplastic disorders. These non-neoplastic angiogenesis-dependent diseases include: atherosclerosis, haemangioma, haemangioendothelioma, angiofibroma, vascular malformations (e.g. Hereditary Hemorrhagic Teleangiectasia (HHT), or Osler-Weber syndrome), warts, pyogenic granulomas, excessive hair growth, Kaposis' sarcoma, scar keloids, allergic oedema, psoriasis, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, follicular cysts, ovarian hyperstimulation, endometriosis, respiratory distress, ascites, peritoneal sclerosis in dialysis patients, adhesion formation result from abdominal surgery, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, synovitis, osteomyelitis, pannus growth, osteophyte, hemophilic joints, inflammatory and infectious processes (e.g. hepatitis, pneumonia, glomerulonephritis), asthma, nasal polyps, liver regeneration, pulmonary hypertension, retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, leukomalacia, neovascular glaucoma, corneal graft neovascularization, trachoma, thyroiditis, thyroid enlargement, and lymphoproliferative disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the subject treated is a human.\n\n\n \nCompositions and Methods of Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another aspect, this invention provides compositions comprising the nucleic acid molecules, including siRNA, of the invention. The siRNA of the composition may be targeted to mRNA from the Ang-Tie pathway. The compositions may comprise the nucleic acid molecules and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, for example, a saline solution or a buffered saline solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, this invention provides “naked” nucleic acid molecules or nucleic acid molecules in a vehicle which can be a naturally occurring or synthetic vector, such as a viral vector, a liposome, polylysine, or a cationic polymer. In one embodiment, the composition may comprise the siRNA of the invention and a complex-forming agent, such as a cationic polymer. The cationic polymer may be a histidine-lysine (HK) copolymer or a polyethyleneimine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the cationic polymer is an HK copolymer. This HK copolymer is a copolymer of histidine and lysine. In certain embodiments, the HK copolymer is synthesized from any appropriate combination of polyhistidine, polylysine, histidine and/or lysine. In certain embodiments, the HK copolymer is linear. In certain preferred embodiments, the HK copolymer is branched.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain preferred embodiments, the branched HK copolymer comprises a polypeptide backbone. Preferably, the polypeptide backbone comprises 1-10 amino acid residues, and more preferably 2-5 amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain preferred embodiments, the polypeptide backbone consists of lysine amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain preferred embodiments, the number of branches on the branched HK copolymer is one greater than the number of backbone amino acid residues. In certain preferred embodiments, the branched HK copolymer contains 1-11 branches. In certain more preferred embodiments, the branched HK copolymer contains 2-5 branches. In certain even more preferred embodiments, the branched HK copolymer contains 4 branches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the branch of the branched HK copolymer comprises 10-100 amino acid residues. In certain preferred embodiments, the branch comprises 10-50 amino acid residues. In certain more preferred embodiments, the branch comprises 15-25 amino acid residues. In certain embodiments, the branch of the branched HK copolymer comprises at least 3 histidine amino acid residues in every subsegment of 5 amino acid residues. In certain other embodiments, the branch comprises at least 3 histidine amino acid residues in every subsegment of 4 amino acid residues. In certain other embodiments, the branch comprises at least 2 histidine amino acid residues in every subsegment of 3 amino acid residues. In certain other embodiments, the branch comprises at least 1 histidine amino acid residues in every subsegment of 2 amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, at least 50% of the branch of the HK copolymer comprises units of the sequence KHHH. In certain preferred embodiments, at least 75% of the branch comprises units of the sequence KHHH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the HK copolymer branch comprises an amino acid residue other than histidine or lysine. In certain preferred embodiments, the branch comprises a cysteine amino acid residue, wherein the cysteine is a N-terminal amino acid residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the HK copolymer has the structure (KHHHKHHHKHHHHKHHHK)\n4\n-KKK. In certain other embodiments, the HK copolymer has the structure (CKHHHKHHHKHHHHKHHHK)\n4\n-KKK.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome suitable examples of HK copolymers can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,692,911 and 7,163,695, which are both incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the compositions of the invention may comprise the siRNA of the invention and a complex-forming agent that is used to make a nanoparticle. The nanoparticle may optionally comprise a steric polymer and/or a targeting moiety. The targeting moiety may be a peptide, an antibody, or an antigen-binding portion. The targeting moiety may serve as a means for targeting vascular endothelial cells, such as a peptide comprising the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). Such a peptide may be cyclic or linear. In one embodiment, this peptide is RGDFK. In a certain embodiment, this peptide is cyclo (RGD-D-FK).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid molecules, compositions, and therapeutic methods of the invention can be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents and modalities including targeted therapeutics and including Ang-Tie pathway antagonists, such as monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors, and targeted therapeutics inhibiting EGF and its receptor, PDGF and its receptors, or MEK or Bcr-Abl, and other immunotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic agents, such as EGFR inhibitors VECTIBIX® (panitumumab) and TARCEVA® (erlotinib), Her-2-targeted therapy HERCEPTIN® (trastuzumab), or anti-angiogenesis drugs such as AVASTIN® (bevacizumab) and SUTENT® (sunitinib malate). The nucleic acid molecules, compositions, and methods also may be combined therapeutically with other treatment modalities including radiation, laser therapy, surgery and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of administration for the nucleic acids and compositions of the invention are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Administration may be intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intracavity, subcutaneous, cutaneous, or transdermal. In one embodiment, administration may be systemic. In a further embodiment, administration may be local. For example, the nucleic acid molecules of the invention may be delivered via direct injections into tumor tissue and directly into or near angiogenic tissue or tissue with undesirable neovasculature. For certain applications, the nucleic acid molecules and compositions may be administered with application of an electric field. In certain embodiments, this invention provides for administration of “naked” siRNA.\n\n\n \nPreparation of Nanoparticles Containing Nucleic Acid Molecules Modulating Expression of Ang/Tie2 Pathway Genes\n\n\n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention provides compositions and methods for nanoparticle preparations of anti-Ang/Tie2 pathway nucleic acid molecules, including siRNAs. The nanoparticles may comprise one or more of a histidine-lysine copolymer, polyethylene glycol, or polyethyleneimine. In one embodiment of the invention, RGD-mediated ligand-directed nanoparticles may be prepared. In one method for the manufacture of RGD-mediated tissue-targeted nanoparticles containing siRNA, the targeting ligand, an RGD-containing peptide, is conjugated to a steric polymer such as polyethylene glycol, or other polymers with similar properties. This ligand-steric polymer conjugate is further conjugated to a polycation such as polyethyleneimine or other effective material such as a histidine-lysine copolymer. The conjugation can be by covalent or non-covalent bonds and the covalent bonds can be non-cleavable or they can be cleavable such as by hydrolysis or by reducing agents. A solution comprising the polymer conjugate, or comprising a mixture of a polymer conjugate with other polymer, lipid, or micelle such as materials comprising a ligand or a steric polymer or fusogen, is mixed with a solution comprising the nucleic acid, in one embodiment an siRNA targeted against specific mRNA of interest, in desirable ratios to obtain nanoparticles that contain siRNA. Such ratios may produce nanoparticles of a desired size, stability, or other characteristics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, nanoparticles are formed by layered nanoparticle self-assembly comprising mixing the polymer conjugate with excess polycation and the nucleic acid. Non-covalent electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and the positively charged segment of the polymer conjugate drive the self-assembly process that leads to formation of nanoparticles. This process involves simple mixing of the solutions where one of the solutions containing the nucleic acid is added to another solution containing the polymer conjugate and excess polycation followed by or concurrently with stirring. In one embodiment, the ratio between the positively charged components and the negatively charged components in the mixture is determined by appropriately adjusting the concentrations of each solution or by adjusting the volume of solution added. In another embodiment, the two solutions are mixed under continuous flow conditions using mixing apparatus such as static mixer. In this embodiment, two or more solutions are introduced into a static mixer at rates and pressures giving a ratio of the solutions, where the streams of solutions get mixed within the static mixer. Arrangements are possible for mixers to be arranged in parallel or in series.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention, thus generally described, will be understood more readily by reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention.

Expression in HUVEC Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nA reverse transfection based high-through-put (HTP) method was used to screen 48 human Ang-2 siRNAs (Table 11) for their potency in inhibiting Ang-2 expression in HUVEC cells. Briefly, 10 nM of siRNA duplex was spotted onto the bottom of a 96-well plate followed by addition of 0.25 μl of Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). A luciferase specific 25-mer siRNA was used as the negative control. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10-20 minutes, and 7,500 HUVEC cells in 100 ul growth medium was added to each wells. The plate was mixed gently by rocking the plate back and forth, and then incubated for 24-48 hours at 37° C. in a CO\n2 \nincubator. The effect of siRNA mediated Ang-2 knockdown was monitored by measuring the concentration of Ang-2 protein in the medium using a human Ang-2 ELISA kit (R&D). The cell viability of the transfected cells was measured using a WST-1 assay kit (Roche) for normalization of Ang-2 concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSignificant inhibition of Ang-2 protein level expression in transfected HUVEC cells was observed at 24 hours post transfection with a majority of the 48 Ang-2 siRNA candidates tested (\nFIG. 1\n). At \n48\n hours post transfection, the inhibition effects were more profound (\nFIG. 2\n), with about 50% of the Ang-2 siRNA candidates showing a greater than 80% inhibition of Ang-2 expression compared to cells transfected with control Luc-siRNA (\nFIG. 3\n). There was no cytotoxicity in the transfected HUVEC cells that associated with knockdown of Ang-2 expression (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\n \nExample 3 \n\n\nConfirmation of Ang-2 Gene Expression Knockdown in HUVEC Cells Transfected with 2 nM Ang-2 siRNA\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a separate experiment, 38 Ang-2 siRNA candidates that demonstrated a high percentage of Ang-2 knockdown in previous HTP screening (\nFIG. 1-3\n) were further examined for their potency in inhibiting Ang-2 expression in HUVEC cells using a reverse transfection method. Briefly, 2 nM of siRNA duplex was spotted onto the bottom of a 96-well plate followed by addition of 0.25 μl of Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). A negative control (Ctrl-) siRNA, which has a 19-nt double-stranded region with \ndTdT\n 3′-overhangs on both strands and does not has a significant homologous sequence with any known human gene, was used as the negative control. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10-20 minutes, and 7,500 HUVEC cells in 100 μl growth medium was added to each well. The plate was mixed gently by rocking the plate back and forth, and then incubated for 48 hours at 37° C. in a CO\n2 \nincubator. The effect of siRNA mediated Ang-2 knockdown was monitored by measuring the concentration of Ang-2 protein in the medium using a human Ang-2 ELISA kit (R&D). The cell viability of the transfected cells was measured using a WST-1 assay kit (Roche) for normalization of Ang-2 concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSignificant inhibition (>90%) of Ang-2 protein level expression in transfected HUVEC cells was observed at 48 hours post transfection with a majority of the 38 Ang-2 siRNA candidates tested (\nFIG. 5\n), including many siRNA candidates with a greater than 90% knockdown of Ang-2 protein level expression (\nFIG. 6\n). In addition, 3 siRNA that target both human and mouse Ang-2 also demonstrated high potency in knocking down human Ang-2 expression (\nFIGS. 5 and 6\n). Finally, there was no cytotoxicity in the transfected HUVEC cells that associated with knockdown of Ang-2 expression (\nFIG. 7\n).\n\n\n \nExample 4 \n\n\nFinal Selection of Ang-2 siRNA Based on Ang-2 Gene Expression Knockdown in HUVEC Cells Transfected with 0.2 nM\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another experiment, 18 Ang-2 siRNA candidates that demonstrated a higher than 94% knockdown of Ang-2 expression in a previous experiment (\nFIG. 6) and 3\n human/mouse Ang-2 siRNA were further examined for their potency in inhibiting Ang-2 expression in HUVEC cells using a reverse transfection method with a lower dose of siRNA. Briefly, 0.2 nM of siRNA duplex was spotted onto the bottom of a 96-well plate followed by addition of 0.25 μl of Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). A negative control (Ctrl-) siRNA, which has a 19-nt double-stranded region with \ndTdT\n 3′-overhangs on both strands and does not has a significant homologous sequence with any known human gene, was used as the negative control. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10-20 minutes, and 7,500 HUVEC cells in 100 μl growth medium was added to each well. The plate was mixed gently by rocking the plate back and forth, and then incubated for 48 hours at 37° C. in a CO\n2 \nincubator. The effect of siRNA mediated Ang-2 knockdown was monitored by measuring the concentration of Ang-2 protein in the medium using a human Ang-2 ELISA kit (R&D). The cell viability of the transfected cells was measured using a WST-1 assay kit (Roche) for normalization of Ang-2 concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen transfected with only 0.2 nM of siRNA, significant inhibition (30-50%) of Ang-2 protein level expression in transfected HUVEC cells was observed at 48 hours post transfection with a majority of the 38 Ang-2 siRNA candidates tested (\nFIG. 8\n), including one siRNA which targets both human and mouse Ang-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree Ang-2 siRNA, #10 (Ang-2-25-10), #14 (Ang-2-25-14), and #31 (Ang-2-25-31) were selected for further experiments as Ang-2 siRNA. In addition, #25 (Ang-2-25-25) and #45 (Ang-2-25-45) were selected for further experiments as human/mouse Ang-2 siRNA.\n\n\n \nExample 5 \n\n\nDetermination of IC50 Values of Ang-2 siRNA\n\n\n \n \n \nUpon the confirmation of Ang-2 siRNA candidates, experiments were conducted to determine the IC50 value of Ang-2 siRNA (Ang-2-25-10, Ang-2-25-14, and Ang-2-25-31) in HUVEC cells. Briefly, 10 dilutions of each siRNA duplex were spotted onto the bottom of a 96-well plate followed by addition of 0.25 μl of Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). The siRNA dilutions were 0.076 pM, 0.31 pM, 1.2 pM, 4.9 pM, 19.5 pM, 78.1 pM, 312.5 pM, 1.25 nM, 5 nM, and 20 nM. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10-20 minutes, and 7,500 HUVEC cells in 100 μl growth medium was added to each well. The plate was mixed gently by rocking the plate back and forth, and then incubated for 48 hours at 37° C. in a CO\n2 \nincubator.

The IC50 of Ang-2-25-10 was 0.363 nM, the IC50 of Ang-2-25-14 was 0.494 nM, and the IC50 of Ang-2-25-31 was 0.398 nM (\nFIG. 9\n and Table 12).\n\n\n \nExample 6 \n\n\nDetermination of IC50 Values of Human/Mouse Ang-2 siRNA\n\n\n \n \n \nUpon the confirmation of human/mouse Ang-2 siRNA candidates that target both human and mouse Ang-2 mRNA, experiments were conducted to determine the IC50 value of human/mouse Ang-2 siRNA (Ang-2-25-25 and Ang-2-25-45) in HUVEC cells.

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/018,019, filed on Dec. 20, 2004, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/549,652, filed on Mar. 3, 2004, and Swedish Application No. 0303480-8, filed on Dec. 19, 2003. The entire content of each of these prior applications is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates generally to modulating serotonin 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nObesity is a condition characterized by an increase in body fat content resulting in excess body weight above accepted norms. Obesity is among the important nutritional disorders in the western world and can represent a major health problem in industrialized countries. This disorder can lead to increased mortality due to increased incidences of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, digestive disease, respiratory disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes. Searching for compounds, which reduce body weight has been ongoing. One line of research has included activation of serotoninergic systems, either by direct activation of serotonin receptor subtypes or by inhibiting serotonin reuptake.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT), a transmitter of the peripheral and central nervous system, is believed to modulate a wide range of physiological and pathological functions, including anxiety, sleep regulation, aggression, feeding and depression. Multiple serotonin receptor subtypes have been identified and cloned. One of these, the 5-HT6 receptor, displays affinity for antidepressants such as clozapine and is believed to be positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase. The effect of 5-HT6 antagonist and 5-HT6 antisense oligonucleotides is believed to be involved in the reduction of food intake in rats. Compounds believed to have enhanced affinity and selectivity for the 5-HT6 receptor have also been identified.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nIt has surprisingly been found that the compounds according to the present invention show affinity for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor as antagonists at nanomolar range. Compounds according to the present invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts have 5-HT6 receptor antagonist, agonist and partial agonist activity and are believed to be of potential use in the treatment or prophylaxis of obesity and type 2 diabetes, to achieve reduction of body weight and of body weight gain, as well as in the treatment or prophylaxis of disorders of the central nervous system such as anxiety, depression, panic attacks, memory disorders, cognitive disorders, epilepsy, sleep disorders, migraine, anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, psychoses, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea and/or schizophrenia, panic attacks, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), withdrawal from drug abuse, neurodegenerative diseases characterized by impaired neuronal growth, and pain. The reduction of body weight and of body weight gain (e.g. treating body-weight disorders) is achieved inter alia by reduction of food intake. As used herein, the term “body weight disorders” refers to the disorders caused by an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, resulting in abnormal (e.g., excessive) body weight. Such body weight disorders include obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, this invention relates to compounds of the Formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nP is selected from a substituent of Formula (II)-(VII):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nx, y and j are each

Exemplary acids include inorganic acids, such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen iodide, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid; and organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propanoic acid, hydroxyacetic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, glycolic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, oxalic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid, pamoic acid, benzoic acid, ascorbic acid and the like. Exemplary base addition salt forms are the sodium, potassium, calcium salts, and salts with pharmaceutically acceptable amines such as, for example, ammonia, alkylamines, benzathine, and amino acids, such as, e.g. arginine and lysine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, sulfonamide derivatives of Formula (I) wherein P is selected from a substituent of Formula (II) and (III) and wherein R\n2 \nis hydrogen may be converted into their corresponding potassium, sodium or calcium salts, or salts of other alkali metals or alkaline earth metals. The term addition salt as used herein also comprises solvates which the compounds and salts thereof are able to form, such as, for example, hydrates, alcoholates and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor clinical use, the compounds of the invention are formulated into pharmaceutical formulations for oral, rectal, parenteral or other mode of administration. Pharmaceutical formulations are usually prepared by mixing the active substance, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with conventional pharmaceutical excipients. Examples of excipients are water, gelatin, gum arabicum, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, sodium starch glycolate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, magnesium stearate, talcum, colloidal silicon dioxide, and the like. Such formulations may also contain other pharmacologically active agents, and conventional additives, such as stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, flavouring agents, buffers, and the like. Usually, the amount of active compounds is between 0.1-95% by weight of the preparation, preferably between 0.2-20% by weight in preparations for parentral use and more preferably between 1-50% by weight in preparations for oral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations can be further prepared by known methods such as granulation, compression, microencapsulation, spray coating, etc. The formulations may be prepared by conventional methods in the dosage form of tablets, capsules, granules, powders, syrups, suspensions, suppositories or injections. Liquid formulations may be prepared by dissolving or suspending the active substance in water or other suitable vehicles. Tablets and granules may be coated in a conventional manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect the invention relates to methods of making compounds of any of the formulae herein comprising reacting any one or more of the compounds of the formulae delineated herein, including any processes delineated herein. The compounds of the formula (I) above may be prepared by, or in analogy with, conventional methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe processes described above may be carried out to give a compound of the invention in the form of a free base or as an acid addition salt. A pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt may be obtained by dissolving the free base in a suitable organic solvent and treating the solution with an acid, in accordance with conventional procedures for preparing acid addition salts from base compounds. Examples of addition salt forming acids are mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) may possess one or more chiral carbon atoms, and they may therefore be obtained in the form of optical isomers, e.g. as a pure enantiomer, or as a mixture of enantiomers (racemate) or as a mixture containing diastereomers. The separation of mixtures of optical isomers to obtain pure enantiomers is well known in the art and may, for example; be achieved by fractional crystallization of salts with optically active (chiral) acids or by chromatographic separation on chiral columns.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chemicals used in the synthetic routes delineated herein may include, for example, solvents, reagents, catalysts, and protecting group and deprotecting group reagents. The methods described above may also additionally include steps, either before or after the steps described specifically herein, to add or remove suitable protecting groups in order to ultimately allow synthesis of the compounds. In addition, various synthetic steps may be performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the desired compounds. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing applicable compounds are known in the art and include, for example, those described in R. Larock, \nComprehensive Organic Transformations\n, VCH Publishers (1989); T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, \nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis, \n3\nrd \nEd., John Wiley and Sons (1999); L. Fieser and M. Fieser, \nFieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis\n, John Wiley and Sons (1994); and L. Paquette, ed., \nEncyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis\n, John Wiley and Sons (1995) and subsequent editions thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe necessary starting materials for preparing the compounds of formula (I) are either known or may be prepared in analogy with the preparation of known compounds. The dose level and frequency of dosage of the specific compound will vary depending on a variety of factors including the potency of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the patient's age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the condition to be treated, and the patient undergoing therapy. The daily dosage may, for example, range from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kilo of body weight, administered singly or multiply in doses, e.g. from about 0.01 mg to about 25 mg each. Normally, such a dosage is given orally but parenteral administration may also be chosen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention will now be further illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specific examples below are to be construed as merely illustrative, and not limitative of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever. Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, based on the description herein, utilize the present invention to its fullest extent.

Costar, N.Y., USA). Samples were incubated in Packard Optiplate (Packard Instruments B. V., Groningen, The Netherlands). The total amount of added radioligand was measured in Packard 24-well Barex plates (Packard Instruments B. V., Groningen, The Netherlands) in the presence of Microscint™ 20 scintillation fluid (Packard Bioscience, Meriden, Conn., USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBuffer\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding buffer consisted of 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, and 1 mM, EDTA, pH 7.4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMembrane Preparation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells were grown to approximately 90% confluence on 24.5×24.5 mm culture dishes. The medium was aspirated, and after rinsing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were scraped off using 25 mL Tris buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4) and a window scraper. The cells were then broken with a Polytron homogeniser, and remaining particulate matter was removed by low-speed centrifugation, 1000×g for 5 mM. Finally, the membranes were collected by high-speed centrifugation (20 000×g), suspended in binding buffer, and frozen in aliquots at −70° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadioligand Binding\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrozen cell membranes were thawed, immediately rehomogenized with a Polytron homogenizer, and coupled to SPA wheat germ agglutinin beads (Amersham Life Sciences, Cardiff, England) for 30 mM under continuous shaking of the tubes. After coupling, the beads were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1000 g, and subsequently suspended in 20 mL of binding buffer per 96-well plate The binding reaction was then initiated by adding radioligand and test compounds to the bead-membrane suspension. Following incubation at room temperature, the assay plates were subjected to scintillation counting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe original SPA method was followed except for that membranes were prepared from HEK293 cells expressing the human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor instead of from HeLa cells (Dinh D M, Zaworski P G; Gill G S, Schlachter S K, Lawson C F, Smith M W. Validation of human 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors expressed in HeLa cell membranes: saturation binding studies, pharmacological profiles of standard CNS agents and SPA development. (The Upjohn Company Technical Report 7295-95-064 1995; 27 Dec.). The specific binding of [\n3\nH]-LSD was saturable, while the non-specific binding increased linearly with the concentration of added radioligand. [\n3\nH]-LSD bound with high affinity to 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors. The K\nd \nvalue was estimated to 2.6±0.2 nM based on four separate experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe total binding at 3 nM of [\n3\nH]-LSD, the radioligand concentration used in the competition experiments, was typically 6000 dpm, and the specific binding more than 70%. 5-HT caused a concentration dependent inhibition of [\n3\nH]-LSD binding with an over all average K\ni \nvalue of 236 nM when tested against two different membrane preparations. The inter assay variability over three experiments showed a CV of 10% with an average K\ni \nvalues of 173 nM (SD 30) and a Hill coefficient of 0.94 (SD 0.09). The intra assay variation was 3% (n=4). All unlabelled ligands displaced the specific binding of [\n3\nH]-LSD in a concentration-dependent manner, albeit at different potencies. The rank order of affinity for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor of reference compounds was methiothepin (Ki 2 nM)>mianserin (190 nM) (236 nM)>methysergide (482 nM)>mesulergine (1970 nM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein Determination\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein concentrations were determined with BioRad Protein Assay (Bradford MM.

Bovine serum albumin was used as standard.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScintillation Counting\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe radioactivity was determined in a Packard TopCount™ scintillation counter (Packard Instruments, Meriden, Conn., USA) at a counting efficiency of approximately 20%. The counting efficiency was determined in separate sets of experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSaturation Experiments\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt least 6 concentrations in duplicates of radioligand (0.1-20 nM of [\n3\nH]-LSD) were used in saturation experiments. The specific binding was calculated as the difference between total binding and non-specific binding, which was determined as the binding of radioligand in the presence of 5 μM lisuride.

Briefly, HEK293/5-HT\n6 \ncells were seeded in polylysine coated 96-well plates at a density of 25,000/well and grown in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) (without phenol-red) containing 5% dialyzed Foetal Bovine Serum for 48 h at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2 \nincubator. The medium was then aspirated and replaced by 0.1 mL assay medium (Hanks Balance Salt Solution containing 20 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin). After addition of test substances, 50 μl dissolved in assay medium, the cells were incubated for 10 mM at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2 \nincubator. The medium was again aspirated and the cAMP content was determined using a radioactive cAMP kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, BIOTRAK RPA559). The potency of antagonists was quantified by determining the concentration that caused 50% inhibition of 5-HT (at [5-HT]=8 times EC\n50\n) evoked increase in cAMP, using the formula fKi=IC\n50\n/(1+[5HT]/EC\n50\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds in accordance with the invention have a selective affinity to 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors with K\ni \nand IC\n50,corr \nvalues between 0.5 nM and 5 μM or display a inhibition of [\n3\nH]-LSD≧20% at 50 nM and are antagonists, agonists or partial agonists at 5-HT\n6\n.

The amount of food consumed during 15 hours of infusion of compounds is recorded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMale mice (obese C57BL/6JBom-Lep\nob \nand lean wild-type C57BL/6JBom; Bomholtsgaard, Denmark) 8-9 weeks with an average body weight of 50 g (obese) and 25 g (lean) are used in all the studies. The animals are housed singly in cages at 23±1° C., 40-60% humidity and have free access to water and standard laboratory chow. The 12/12-h light/dark cycle is set to lights off at 5 p.m. The animals are conditioned for at least one week before start of study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe test compounds are dissolved in solvents suitable for each specific compound such as cyclodextrin, cyclodextrin/methane sulphonic acid, polyethylene glycol/methane sulphonic acid, saline.

Alzet osmotic minipumps (Model 2001D; infusion rate 8 μl/h) are used and loaded essentially as recommended by the Alzet technical information manual (Alza Scientific Products, 1997; Theeuwes, F. and Yam, S. I. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 4(4). 343-353, 1976). Continuous subcutaneous infusion with 24 hours duration is used. The minipumps are either filled with different concentrations of test compounds dissolved in vehicle or with only vehicle solution and maintained in vehicle pre-warmed to 37° C. (approx. 1 h). The minipumps are implanted subcutaneously in the neck/back region under short acting anesthesia (metofane/enflurane).
