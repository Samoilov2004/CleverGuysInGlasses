No. 11/541,145, filed Sep. 28, 2006, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/259,232, filed Oct. 25, 2005, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/489,394, filed Jan. 21, 2000, which is a non-provisional application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b)(1), claiming priority under 35 USC 119(e) to provisional application No. 60/116,787, filed Jan. 21, 1999, the contents of which non-provisional and provisional applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application relates to the field of antibody fragments derivatized with polymers, and in particular to the use of such derivatization to increase the circulation half-lives of antibody fragment-polymer conjugates. This application also relates to the use of such antibody fragment-polymer conjugates in the treatment of diseases.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nModification of proteins with polyethylene glycol (“PEGylation”) has the potential to increase residence time and reduce immunogenicity in vivo. For example, Knauf et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n263: 15064-15070 (1988) reported a study of the pharmacodynamic behavior in rats of various polyoxylated glycerol and polyethylene glycol modified species of interleukin-2. Despite the known advantage of PEGylation, PEGylated proteins have not been widely exploited for clinical applications. In the case of antibody fragments, PEGylation has not been shown to extend serum half-life to useful levels. Delgado et al., \nBr. J. Cancer, \n73: 175-182 (1996), Kitamura et al., \nCancer Res., \n51: 4310-4315 (1991), Kitamura et al., \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., \n171: 1387-1394 (1990), and Pedley et al., \nBr. J. Cancer, \n70: 1126-1130 (1994) reported studies characterizing blood clearance and tissue uptake of certain anti-tumor antigen antibodies or antibody fragments derivatized with low molecular weight (5 kD) PEG. Zapata et al., \nFASEB J., \n9: A1479 (1995) reported that low molecular weight (5 or 10 kD) PEG attached to a sulfhydryl group in the hinge region of a Fab′ fragment reduced clearance compared to the parental Fab′ molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is now well established that angiogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders. These include solid tumors, intraocular neovascular syndromes such as proliferative retinopathies or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis (Folkman et al. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n267:10931-10934 (1992); Klagsbrun et al. \nAnnu. Rev. Physiol. \n53:217-239 (1991); and Garner A, \nVascular diseases. In: Pathobiology of ocular disease. A dynamic approach\n. Garner A, Klintworth G K, Eds. 2nd Edition Marcel Dekker, NY, pp 1625-1710 (1994)). In the case of solid tumors, the neovascularization allows the tumor cells to acquire a growth advantage and proliferative autonomy compared to the normal cells. Accordingly, a correlation has been observed between density of microvessels in tumor sections and patient survival in breast cancer as well as in several other tumors (Weidner et al. \nN Engl J Med \n324:1-6 (1991); Horak et al. \nLancet \n340:1120-1124 (1992); and Macchiarini et al. \nLancet \n340:145-146 (1992)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWork done over the last several years has established the key role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the regulation of normal and abnormal angiogenesis (Ferrara et al. \nEndocr. Rev. \n18:4-25 (1997)). The finding that the loss of even a single VEGF allele results in embryonic lethality points to an irreplaceable role played by this factor in the development and differentiation of the vascular system (Ferrara et al.). Furthermore, VEGF has been shown to be a key mediator of neovascularization associated with tumors and intraocular disorders (Ferrara et al.). The VEGF mRNA is overexpressed by the majority of human tumors examined (Berkman et al. \nJ Clin Invest \n91:153-159 (1993); Brown et al. \nHuman Pathol. \n26:86-91 (1995); Brown et al. \nCancer Res. \n53:4727-4735 (1993); Mattern et al. \nBrit. J. Cancer. \n73:931-934 (1996); and Dvorak et al. \nAm J. Pathol. \n146:1029-1039 (1995)). Also, the concentration of VEGF in eye fluids are highly correlated to the presence of active proliferation of blood vessels in patients with diabetic and other ischemia-related retinopathies (Aiello et al. \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n331:1480-1487 (1994)). Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated the localization of VEGF in choroidal neovascular membranes in patients affected by AMD (Lopez et al. \nInvest. Ophialmo. Vis. Sci. \n37:855-868 (1996)). Anti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies suppress the growth of a variety of human tumor cell lines in nude mice (Kim et al. \nNature \n362:841-844 (1993); Warren et al. \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n95:1789-1797 (1995); Borgstrom et al. \nCancer Res. \n56:4032-4039 (1996); and Melnyk et al. \nCancer Res. \n56:921-924 (1996)) and also inhibit intraocular angiogenesis in models of ischemic retinal disorders (Adamis et al. \nArch. Ophthalmol. \n114:66-71 (1996)). Therefore, anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies or other inhibitors of VEGF action are promising candidates for the treatment of solid tumors and various intraocular neovascular disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProto-oncogenes that encode growth factors and growth factor receptors have been identified to play important roles in the pathogenesis of various human malignancies, including breast cancer. It has been found that the human erbB2 gene (also known as HER2, or c-erbB-2), which encodes a 185-kd transmembrane glycoprotein receptor (p185\nHER2\n) related to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is overexpressed in about 25% to 30% of human breast cancer (Slamon et al., \nScience \n235:177-182 [1987]; Slamon et al., \nScience \n244:707-712 [1989]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral lines of evidence support a direct role for ErbB2 in the pathogenesis and clinical aggressiveness of ErbB2-overexpressing tumors. The introduction of ErbB2 into non-neoplastic cells has been shown to cause their malignant transformation (Hudziak et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n84:7159-7163 [1987]; DiFiore et al., \nScience \n237:78-182 [1987]). Transgenic mice that express HER2 were found to develop mammary tumors (Guy et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n89:10578-10582 [1992]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies directed against human erbB2 protein products and proteins encoded by the rat equivalent of the erbB2 gene (neu) have been described. Drebin et al., \nCell \n41:695-706 (1985) refer to an IgG2a monoclonal antibody which is directed against the rat neu gene product. T his antibody called 7.16.4 causes down-modulation of cell surface p185 expression on B104-1-1 cells (NIH-3T3 cells transfected with the neu protooncogene) and inhibits colony formation of these cells. In Drebin et al. \nPNAS \n(\nUSA\n) 83:9129-9133 (1986), the 7.16.4 antibody was shown to inhibit the tumorigenic growth of neu-transformed NIH-3T3 cells as well as rat neuroblastoma cells (from which the neu oncogene was initially isolated) implanted into nude mice. Drebin et al. in \nOncogene \n2:387-394 (1988) discuss the production of a panel of antibodies against the rat neu gene product. All of the antibodies were found to exert a cytostatic effect on the growth of neu-transformed cells suspended in soft agar. Antibodies of the IgM, IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes were able to mediate significant in vitro lysis of neu-transformed cells in the presence of complement, whereas none of the antibodies were able to mediate high levels of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of the neu-transformed cells. Drebin et al. \nOncogene \n2:273-277 (1988) report that mixtures of antibodies reactive with two distinct regions on the p185 molecule result in synergistic anti-tumor effects on neu-transformed NIH-3T3 cells implanted into nude mice. Biological effects of anti-neu antibodies are reviewed in Myers et al., \nMeth. Enzym. \n198:277-290 (1991). See also WO94/22478 published Oct. 13, 1994.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHudziak et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol. \n9(3):1165-1172 (1989) describe the generation of a panel of anti-ErbB2 antibodies which were characterized using the human breast tumor cell line SKBR3. Relative cell proliferation of the SKBR3 cells following exposure to the antibodies was determined by crystal violet staining of the monolayers after 72 hours. Using this assay, maximum inhibition was obtained with the antibody called 4D5 which inhibited cellular proliferation by 56%. Other antibodies in the panel, including 7C2 and 7F3, reduced cellular proliferation to a lesser extent in this assay. Hudziak et al. conclude that the effect of the 4D5 antibody on SKBR3 cells was cytostatic rather than cytotoxic, since SKBR3 cells resumed growth at a nearly normal rate following removal of the antibody from the medium. The antibody 4D5 was further found to sensitize p185erbB2-overexpressing breast tumor cell lines to the cytotoxic effects of TNF-α. See also WO89/06692 published Jul. 27, 1989. The anti-ErbB2 antibodies discussed in Hudziak et al. are further characterized in Fendly et al. \nCancer Research \n50:1550-1558 (1990); Kotts et al. In Vitro 26(3):59A (1990); Sarup et al. \nGrowth Regulation \n1:72-82 (1991); Shepard et al. \nJ. Clin. Immunol. \n11(3):117-127 (1991); Kumar et al. \nMol. Cell.

Chem. \n269(20):14661-14665 (1994); Scott et al. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n266:14300-5 (1991); and D'souza et al. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n91:7202-7206 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTagliabue et al. \nInt. J. Cancer \n47:933-937 (1991) describe two antibodies which were selected for their reactivity on the lung adenocarcinoma cell line (Calu-3) which overexpresses ErbB2. One of the antibodies, called MGR3, was found to internalize, induce phosphorylation of ErbB2, and inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMcKenzie et al. \nOncogene \n4:543-548 (1989) generated a panel of anti-ErbB2 antibodies with varying epitope specificities, including the antibody designated TA1. This TA1 antibody was found to induce accelerated endocytosis of ErbB2 (see Maier et al. \nCancer Res. \n51:5361-5369 (1991)). Bacus et al. \nMolecular Carcinogenesis \n3:350-362 (1990) reported that the TA1 antibody induced maturation of the breast cancer cell lines AU-565 (which overexpresses the erbB2 gene) and MCF-7 (which does not). Inhibition of growth and acquisition of a mature phenotype in these cells was found to be associated with reduced levels of ErbB2 receptor at the cell surface and transient increased levels in the cytoplasm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStancovski et al. \nPNAS \n(\nUSA\n) 88:8691-8695 (1991) generated a panel of anti-ErbB2 antibodies, injected them i.p. into nude mice and evaluated their effect on tumor growth of murine fibroblasts transformed by overexpression of the erbB2 gene. Various levels of tumor inhibition were detected for four of the antibodies, but one of the antibodies (N28) consistently stimulated tumor growth. Monoclonal antibody N28 induced significant phosphorylation of the ErbB2 receptor, whereas the other four antibodies generally displayed low or no phosphorylation-inducing activity. The effect of the anti-ErbB2 antibodies on proliferation of SKBR3 cells was also assessed. In this SKBR3 cell proliferation assay, two of the antibodies (N12 and N29) caused a reduction in cell proliferation relative to control. The ability of the various antibodies to induce cell lysis in vitro via complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-mediated cell-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) was assessed, with the authors of this paper concluding that the inhibitory function of the antibodies was not attributed significantly to CDC or ADCC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBacus et al. \nCancer Research \n52:2580-2589 (1992) further characterized the antibodies described in Bacus et al. (1990) and Stancovski et al. of the preceding paragraphs. Extending the i.p. studies of Stancovski et al., the effect of the antibodies after i.v. injection into nude mice harboring mouse fibroblasts overexpressing human ErbB2 was assessed. As observed in their earlier work, N28 accelerated tumor growth whereas N12 and N29 significantly inhibited growth of the ErbB2-expressing cells. Partial tumor inhibition was also observed with the N24 antibody. Bacus et al. also tested the ability of the antibodies to promote a mature phenotype in the human breast cancer cell lines AU-565 and MDA-MB453 (which overexpress ErbB2) as well as MCF-7 (containing low levels of the receptor). Bacus et al. saw a correlation between tumor inhibition in vivo and cellular differentiation; the tumor-stimulatory antibody N28 had no effect on differentiation, and the tumor inhibitory action of the N12, N29 and N24 antibodies correlated with the extent of differentiation they induced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nXu et al. \nInt. J. Cancer \n53:401-408 (1993) evaluated a panel of anti-ErbB2 antibodies for their epitope binding specificities, as well as their ability to inhibit anchorage-independent and anchorage-dependent growth of SKBR3 cells (by individual antibodies and in combinations), modulate cell-surface ErbB2, and inhibit ligand stimulated anchorage-independent growth. See also WO94/00136 published Jan. 6, 1994 and Kasprzyk et al. \nCancer Research \n52:2771-2776 (1992) concerning anti-ErbB2 antibody combinations. Other anti-ErbB2 antibodies are discussed in Hancock et al. \nCancer Res. \n51:4575-4580 (1991); Shawver et al. \nCancer Res. \n54:1367-1373 (1994); Arteaga et al. \nCancer Res. \n54:3758-3765 (1994); and Harwerth et al. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n267:15160-15167 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA recombinant humanized anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody (a humanized version of the murine anti-ErbB2 antibody 4D5, referred to as rhuMAb HER2 or HERCEPTIN®) has been clinically active in patients with ErbB2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancers that had received extensive prior anticancer therapy. (Baselga et al., \nJ. Clin. Oncol. \n14:737-744 [1996]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nErbB2 overexpression is commonly regarded as a predictor of a poor prognosis, especially in patients with primary disease that involves axillary lymph nodes (Slamon et al., [1987] and [1989], supra; Ravdin and Chamness, \nGene \n159:19-27 [1 995]; and Flynes and Stern, \nBiochim Biophys Acta \n1198:165-184 [1994]), and has been linked to sensitivity and/or resistance to hormone therapy and chemotherapeutic regimens, including CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluoruracil) and anthracyclines (Baselga et al., \nOncology \n11(3 Suppl 1):43-48 [1997]). However, despite the association of ErbB2 overexpression with poor prognosis, the odds of HER2-positive patients responding clinically to treatment with taxanes were greater than three times those of HER2-negative patients (Ibid). rhuMab HER2 was shown to enhance the activity of paclitaxel (TAXOL®) and doxorubicin against breast cancer xenografts in nude mice injected with BT-474 human breast adenocarcinoma cells, which express high levels of HER2 (Baselga et al., \nBreast Cancer, Proceedings of ASCO\n, Vol. 13, Abstract 53 [1994]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLymphocyte adherence to endothelium is a key event in the process of inflammation. There are at least three known pathways of lymphocyte adherence to endothelium, depending on the activation state of the T cell and the endothelial cell. T cell immune recognition requires the contribution of the T cell receptor as well as adhesion receptors, which promote attachment of T cells to antigen-presenting cells and transduce regulatory signals for T cell activation. The lymphocyte function associated (LFA) antigen-1 (LFA-1, CD11a, α-chain/CD18, β-chain) has been identified as the major integrin receptor on lymphocytes involved in these cell adherence interactions leading to several pathological states. ICAM-1, the endothelial cell immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecule, is a known ligand for LFA-1 and is implicated directly in graft rejection, psoriasis, and arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLFA-1 is required for a range of leukocyte functions, including lymphokine production of helper T cells in response to antigen-presenting cells, killer T cell-mediated target cell lysis, and immunoglobulin production through T cell-B cell interactions. Activation of antigen receptors on T cells and B cells allows LFA-1 to bind its ligand with higher affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against LFA-1 led to the initial identification and investigation of the function of LFA-1. Davignon et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n127: 590 (1981). LFA-1 is present only on leukocytes [Krenskey et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n131: 611 (1983)], and ICAM-1 is distributed on activated leukocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and endothelium. Dustin et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n137: 245 (1986).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrevious studies have investigated the effects of anti-CD11a MAbs on many T-cell-dependent immune functions in vitro and a limited number of immune responses in vivo. In vitro, anti-CD11a MAbs inhibit B-cell activation [Kuypers et al., \nRes. Immunol., \n140: 461 (1989)], T-cell-dependent B-cell proliferation and differentiation [Davignon et al., supra; Fischer et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n136: 3198 (1986)], target cell lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes [Krensky et al., supra], formation of immune conjugates (Sanders et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n137: 2395 (1986); Mentzer et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n135: 9 (1985)), and the adhesion of T-cells to vascular endothelium. Lo et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n143: 3325 (1989). Also, the antibody 5C6 directed against CD11b/CD18 was found to prevent intra-islet infiltration by both macrophages and T cells and to inhibit development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitis in mice. Hutchings et al., \nNature, \n348: 639 (1990).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIgE is a member of the immunoglobulin family that mediates allergic responses such as asthma, food allergies, and other type I hypersensitivity reactions. IgE is secreted by and expressed on the surface of B-cells or B-lymphocytes. IgE binds to B-cells (as well as monocytes, eosinophils and platelets) through its Fc region to a low affinity IgE receptor (Fc\nε\nRII). Upon exposure of a mammal to an allergen, B-cells bearing a membrane-bound IgE antibody specific for the antigen are activated to form IgE-secreting plasma cells. The allergen-specific, soluble IgE secreted by plasma cells circulates through the bloodstream and binds to the surface of mast cells in tissues and basophils in the blood, through the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc\nε\nRI). The mast cells and basophils thereby become sensitized for the allergen. Subsequent exposure to the allergen results in cross linking of allergen-specific IgE bound to basophilic and mast cellular Fc\nε\nRI, which induces a release of histamine, leukotrienes and platelet activating factors, eosinophil and neutrophil chemotactic factors and the cytokines IL-3, IL-4, IL-5 and GM-CSF, which are responsible for clinical hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pathological condition hypersensitivity is characterized by an excessive immune response to (an) allergen(s) resulting in gross tissue changes if the allergen is present in relatively large amounts or if the humoral and cellular immune state is at a heightened level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhysiological changes in anaphylactic hypersensitivity can include intense constriction of the bronchioles and bronchi of the lungs, contraction of smooth muscle and dilation of capillaries. Predisposition to this condition appears to result from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Common environmental allergens which induce anaphylactic hypersensitivity are found in pollen, foods, house dust mites, animal danders, fungal spores and insect venoms. Atopic allergy is associated with anaphylactic hypersensitivity and includes disorders such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis (hay fever), eczema, urticaria and food allergies. Anaphylactic shock, a dangerous life-threatening condition that can occur in the progression of anaphylaxis, is usually provoked by insect stings or parenteral medication.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, a treatment strategy has been pursued for \nType\n 1 hypersensitivity or anaphylactic hypersensitivity which blocks IgE from binding to the high-affinity receptor (Fc\nε\nRI) found on basophils and mast cells, and thereby prevents the release of histamine and other anaphylactic factors resulting in the pathological condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterleukin-8 (IL-8) is neutrophil chemotactic peptide secreted by a variety of cells in response to inflammatory mediators (for a review see Hebert et al. \nCancer Investigation \n11(6):743 (1993)). IL-8 can play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multiple organ failure. Immune therapy for such inflammatory disorders can include treatment of an affected patient with anti-IL-8 antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSticherling et al. (\nJ.

Definitions\n\n\n \n \n \nIn general, the following words or phrases have the indicated definition when used in the description, examples, and claims.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Polymerase chain reaction” or “PCR” refers to a procedure or technique in which minute amounts of a specific piece of nucleic acid, RNA and/or DNA, are amplified as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195 issued 28 Jul. 1987. Generally, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond needs to be available, such that oligonucleotide primers can be designed; these primers will be identical or similar in sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. The 5′ terminal nucleotides of the two primers can coincide with the ends of the amplified material. PCR can be used to amplify specific RNA sequences, specific DNA sequences from total genomic DNA, and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA, bacteriophage or plasmid sequences, etc. See generally Mullis et al., \nCold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. \n51:263 (1987); Erlich, ed., \nPCR Technology \n(Stockton Press, NY, 1989). As used herein, PCR is considered to be one, but not the only, example of a nucleic acid polymerase reaction method for amplifying a nucleic acid test sample comprising the use of a known nucleic acid as a primer and a nucleic acid polymerase to amplify or generate a specific piece of nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Antibodies” (Abs) and “immunoglobulins” (Igs) are glycoproteins having the same structural characteristics. While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen, immunoglobulins include both antibodies and other antibody-like molecules which lack antigen specificity. Polypeptides of the latter kind are, for example, produced at low levels by the lymph system and at increased levels by myelomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Native antibodies and immunoglobulins” are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (V\nH\n) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (V\nL\n) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light- and heavy-chain variable domains (Clothia et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n186:651 (1985); Novotny and Haber, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n82:4592 (1985)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “variable” refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions both in the light-chain and the heavy-chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a β-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the β-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest\n, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPapain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called “Fab′ fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual “Fc” fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Fv” is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. In a two-chain Fv species, this region consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv species (scFv), one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a “dimeric” structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site. For a review of scFv see Pluckthun, in \nThe Pharmacology of Monoclonal Anibodies\n, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab′ fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab′-SH is the designation herein for Fab′ in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab′)\n2 \nantibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab′ fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “light chains” of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (k) and lambda (l), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these can be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, IgG\n4\n, IgA\n1\n, and IgA\n2\n. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called α, δ, ε, γ(, and μ, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antibody” is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers single monoclonal antibodies (including agonist and antagonist antibodies) and antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Antibody fragment”, and all grammatical variants thereof, as used herein are defined as a portion of an intact antibody comprising the antigen binding site or variable region of the intact antibody, wherein the portion is free of the constant heavy chain domains (i.e. CH2, CH3, and CH4, depending on antibody isotype) of the Fe region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab′, Fab′-SH, F(ab′)\n2\n, and Fv fragments; diabodies; any antibody fragment that is a polypeptide having a primary structure consisting of one uninterrupted sequence of contiguous amino acid residues (referred to herein as a “single-chain antibody fragment” or “single chain polypeptide”), including without limitation (1) single-chain Fv (scFv) molecules (2) single chain polypeptides containing only one light chain variable domain, or a fragment thereof that contains the three CDRs of the light chain variable domain, without an associated heavy chain moiety and (3) single chain polypeptides containing only one heavy chain variable region, or a fragment thereof containing the three CDRs of the heavy chain variable region, without an associated light chain moiety; and multispecific or multivalent structures formed from antibody fragments. In an antibody fragment comprising one or more heavy chains, the heavy chain(s) can contain any constant domain sequence (e.g. CH1 in the IgG isotype) found in a non-Fc region of an intact antibody, and/or can contain any hinge region sequence found in an intact antibody, and/or can contain a leucine zipper sequence fused to or situated in the hinge region sequence or the constant domain sequence of the heavy chain(s). Suitable leucine zipper sequences include the jun and fos leucine zippers taught by Kostelney et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n148: 1547-1553 (1992) and the GCN4 leucine zipper described in the Examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless specifically indicated to the contrary, the term “conjugate” as described and claimed herein is defined as a heterogeneous molecule formed by the covalent attachment of one or more antibody fragment(s) to one or more polymer molecule(s), wherein the heterogeneous molecule is water soluble, i.e. soluble in physiological fluids such as blood, and wherein the heterogeneous molecule is free of any structured aggregate. In the context of the foregoing definition, the term “structured aggregate” refers to (1) any aggregate of molecules in aqueous solution having a spheroid or spheroid shell structure, such that the heterogeneous molecule is not in a micelle or other emulsion structure, and is not anchored to a lipid bilayer, vesicle or liposome; and (2) any aggregate of molecules in solid or insolubilized form, such as a chromatography bead matrix, that does not release the heterogeneous molecule into solution upon contact with an aqueous phase. Accordingly, the term “conjugate” as defined herein encompasses the aforementioned heterogeneous molecule in a precipitate, sediment, bioerodible matrix or other solid capable of releasing the heterogeneous molecule into aqueous solution upon hydration of the solid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless specifically indicated to the contrary, the terms “polymer”, “polymer molecule”, “nonproteinaceous polymer”, and “nonproteinaceous polymer molecule” are used interchangeably and are defined as a molecule formed by covalent linkage of two or more monomers, wherein none of the monomers is contained in the group consisting of alanine (Ala), cysteine (Cys), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), phenylalanine (Phe), glycine (Gly), histidine (His), isoleucine (Ile), lysine (Lys), leucine (Leu), methionine (Met), asparagine (Asn), proline (Pro), glutamine (Gln), arginine (Arg), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), valine (Val), tryptophan (Trp), and tyrosine (Tyr) residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody” (mAb) as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each mAb is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they can be synthesized by hybridoma culture, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., \nNature, \n256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 to Cabilly et al.). The “monoclonal antibodies” also include clones of antigen-recognition and binding-site containing antibody fragments (Fv clones) isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., \nNature, \n352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n222:581-597 (1991), for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein include hybrid and recombinant antibodies produced by splicing a variable (including hypervariable) domain of an anti-IL-8 antibody with a constant domain (e.g. “humanized” antibodies), or a light chain with a heavy chain, or a chain from one species with a chain from another species, or fusions with heterologous proteins, regardless of species of origin or immunoglobulin class or subclass designation, as well as antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, F(ab′)\n2\n, and Fv), so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 to Cabilly et al.; Mage and Lamoyi, in \nMonoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications\n, pp. 79-97 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987).)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (Cabilly et al., supra; Morrison et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n81:6851 (1984)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Humanized” forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are specific chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary-determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies can comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and maximize antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.

Biol. \n2:593 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “human vascular endothelial growth factor”, “vascular endothelial growth factor”, “human VEGF” and “VEGF” are used interchangeably herein to refer to the 165-amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factor polypeptide, and related 121-, 189-, and 206-amino acid vascular endothelial cell growth factor polypeptides, described by Leung et al., \nScience \n246:1306 (1989), and Houck et al., \nMol. Endocrin. \n5:1806 (1991), together with the naturally occurring allelic and processed forms of such growth factor polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “human VEGF receptor”, “VEGF receptor”, “human VEGFr” and “VEGFr” are used interchangeably herein to refer to a cellular receptor for VEGF, ordinarily a cell-surface receptor found on vascular endothelial cells, as well as variants thereof which retain the ability to bind human VEGF. One example of a VEGF receptor is the fms-like tyrosine kinase (flt), a transmembrane receptor in the tyrosine kinase family. DeVries et al., \nScience \n255:989 (1992); Shibuya et al., \nOncogene \n5:519 (1990). The flt receptor comprises an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain with tyrosine kinase activity. The extracellular domain is involved in the binding of VEGF, whereas the intracellular domain is involved in signal transduction. Another example of a VEGF receptor is the flk-1 receptor (also referred to as KDR). Matthews et al., \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. \n88:9026 (1991); Terman et al., \nOncogene \n6:1677 (1991); Terman et al., \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. \n187:1579 (1992). Binding of VEGF to the flt receptor results in the formation of at least two high molecular weight complexes, having apparent molecular weight of 205,000 and 300,000 Daltons. The 300,000 Dalton complex is believed to be a dimer comprising two receptor molecules bound to a single molecule of VEGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “human p185 receptor-like tyrosine kinase”, “c-Erb-B2”, “ErbB2”, “HER2”, and “HER2 receptor” are used interchangeably to refer to the c-Erb-B2 polypeptide described in Yamamoto et al., \nNature, \n319: 230-234 (1986) (Genebank accession number X03363).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “human CD20” and “CD20” refer to the B1 cell-surface antigen (CD20) polypeptide described in Tedder et al., \nProc.

The anti-CD11a antibodies include, e.g., MHM24 [Hildreth et al., \nEur. J. Immunol., \n13: 202-208 (1983)], R3.1 (IgG1) [R. Rothlein, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridgefield, Conn.], 25-3 (or 25.3), an IgG1 available from Immunotech, France [Olive et al., in Feldmann, ed., Human T cell Clones. A new Approach to Immune Regulation, Clifton, N.J., Humana, 1986 p. 173], KBA (IgG2a) [Nishimura et al., \nCell.

Grafts include such diverse material as, for example, isolated cells such as islet cells, tissue such as the amniotic membrane of a newborn, bone marrow, hematopoietic precursor cells, and organs such as skin, heart, liver, spleen, pancreas, thyroid lobe, lung, kidney, tubular organs (e.g., intestine, blood vessels, or esophagus), etc. The tubular organs can be used to replace damaged portions of esophagus, blood vessels, or bile duct. The skin grafts can be used not only for burns, but also as a dressing to damaged intestine or to close certain defects such as diaphragmatic hernia. The graft is derived from any mammalian source, including human, whether from cadavers or living donors. Preferably the graft is bone marrow or an organ such as heart and the donor of the graft and the host are matched for HLA class II antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “donor” as used herein refers to the mammalian species, dead or alive, from which the graft is derived. Preferably, the donor is human. Human donors are preferably volunteer blood-related donors that are normal on physical examination and of the same major ABO blood group, because crossing major blood group barriers possibly prejudices survival of the allograft. It is, however, possible to transplant, for example, a kidney of a type O donor into an A, B or AB recipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “transplant” and variations thereof refers to the insertion of a graft into a host, whether the transplantation is syngeneic (where the donor and recipient are genetically identical), allogeneic (where the donor and recipient are of different genetic origins but of the same species), or xenogeneic (where the donor and recipient are from different species). Thus, in a typical scenario, the host is human and the graft is an isograft, derived from a human of the same or different genetic origins. In another scenario, the graft is derived from a species different from that into which it is transplanted, such as a baboon heart transplanted into a human recipient host, and including animals from phylogenically widely separated species, for example, a pig heart valve, or animal beta islet cells or neuronal cells transplanted into a human host.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Treatment” refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those prone to have the disorder or those in which the disorder is to be prevented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Mammal” for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, cats, cows, etc. Preferably, the mammal herein is human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, protein, peptide and polypeptide are used interchangeably to denote an amino acid polymer or a set of two or more interacting or bound amino acid polymers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “inflammatory disorders” refers to pathological states resulting in inflammation, typically caused by neutrophil chemotaxis. Examples of such disorders include inflammatory skin diseases including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis; systemic scleroderma and sclerosis; responses associated with inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis); ischemic reperfusion disorders including surgical tissue reperfusion injury, myocardial ischemic conditions such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, reperfusion after cardiac surgery and constriction after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, stroke, and abdominal aortic aneurysms; cerebral edema secondary to stroke; cranial trauma; hypovolemic shock; asphyxia; adult respiratory distress syndrome; acute lung injury; Behcet's Disease; dermatomyositis; polymyositis; multiple sclerosis; dermatitis; meningitis; encephalitis; uveitis; osteoarthritis; lupus nephritis; autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjorgen's syndrome, vasculitis; diseases involving leukocyte diapedesis; central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory disorder, multiple organ injury syndrome secondary to septicaemia or trauma; alcoholic hepatitis; bacterial pneumonia; antigen-antibody complex mediated diseases including glomerulonephritis; sepsis; sarcoidosis; immunopathologic responses to tissue/organ transplantation; inflammations of the lung, including pleurisy, alveolitis, vasculitis, pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, diffuse panbronchiolitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and cystic fibrosis; etc. The preferred indications include acute lung injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome, ischemic reperfusion (including surgical tissue reperfusion injury, myocardial ischemia, and acute myocardial infarction), hypovolemic shock, asthma, bacterial pneumonia and inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “LFA-1-mediated disorder” refers to pathological states caused by cell adherence interactions involving the LFA-1 receptor on lymphocytes. Examples of such disorders include T cell inflammatory responses such as inflammatory skin diseases including psoriasis; responses associated with inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis); adult respiratory distress syndrome; dermatitis; meningitis; encephalitis; uveitis; allergic conditions such as eczema and asthma and other conditions involving infiltration of T cells and chronic inflammatory responses; skin hypersensitivity reactions (including poison ivy and poison oak); atherosclerosis; leukocyte adhesion deficiency; autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, Reynaud's syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, Sjorgen's syndrome, juvenile onset diabetes, and immune responses associated with delayed hypersensitivity mediated by cytokines and T-lymphocytes typically found in tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, polymyositis, granulomatosis and vasculitis; pernicious anemia; diseases involving leukocyte diapedesis; CNS inflammatory disorder, multiple organ injury syndrome secondary to septicaemia or trauma; autoimmune haemolytic anemia; myethemia gravis; antigen-antibody complex mediated diseases; all types of transplantations, including graft vs. host or host vs. graft disease; etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “IgE-mediated disorder” means a condition or disease which is characterized by the overproduction and/or hypersensitivity to the immunoglobulin IgE. Specifically it should be construed to include conditions associated with anaphylactic hypersensitivity and atopic allergies, including for example: asthma, allergic rhinitis & conjunctivitis (hay fever), eczema, urticaria and food allergies. However, the serious physiological condition of anaphylactic shock, usually caused by bee or snake stings or parental medication is also encompassed under the scope of this term.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “cancer” and “cancerous” refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma and various types of head and neck cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “allergy” and “atopy” and all their grammatical variants are used synonymously herein to refer to any disease mediated by a Type I (Gell & Coombs classification) hypersensitivity reaction, including allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, anaphylaxis, allergic asthma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “asthma”, “asthmatic disorder”, “asthmatic disease”, and “bronchial asthma” refer to a condition of the lungs in which there is widespread narrowing of lower airways. “Atopic asthma” and “allergic asthma” refer to asthma that is a manifestation of an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction in the lower airways, including, e.g., moderate or severe chronic asthma, such as conditions requiring the frequent or constant use of inhaled or systemic steroids to control the asthma symptoms. A preferred indication is allergic asthma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “allergic rhinitis” as used herein refers to any allergen-induced nasal symptoms, including itching, sneezing, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, and symptoms associated with nasal mucosal inflammation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “thrombotic disorder” and “prothrombotic disorder” as used interchangeably herein to refer to pathological conditions in which the blood coagulation cascade is activated (see, generally, Hoffbrand & Pettit, \nEssential Haematology\n, Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford (1980)). Such conditions include peripheral arterial obstruction, acute myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, dissecting aneurysm, transient ischemic attack, restenosis, stroke and other occlusive disease or disorders such as unstable angina, disseminated intravascular coagulation, sepsis, surgical or infective shock, postoperative and post-delivery trauma, angioplasty, cardiopulmonary bypass and coronary bypass, incompatible blood transfusion, amotio placentae, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, asthma, chronic or acute renal disease, diabetes, inflammations, atherosclerosis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, symmetric peripheral necrosis, and allograft rejection in mammals including human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “hydrodynamic size”, “apparent size”, “apparent molecular weight”, “effective size” and “effective molecular weight” of a molecule are used synonymously herein refer to the size of a molecule as determined by comparison to a standard curve produced with globular protein molecular weight standards in a size exclusion chromatography system, wherein the standard curve is created by mapping the actual molecular weight of each standard against its elution time observed in the size exclusion chromatography system. Thus, the apparent size of a test molecule is derived by using the molecule's elution time to extrapolate a putative molecular weight from the standard curve. Preferably, the molecular weight standards used to create the standard curve are selected such that the apparent size of the test molecule falls within the linear portion of the standard curve.\n\n\n \nII. Modes for Carrying Out the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one part, the invention arises from the surprising and unexpected discovery that antibody fragment-polymer conjugates having an effective or apparent size significantly greater than the antibody fragment-polymer conjugates described in the art confers an increase in serum half-life, an increase in mean residence time in circulation (MRT), and/or a decrease in serum clearance rate over underivatized antibody fragment which far exceed the modest changes in such biological property or properties obtained with the art-known antibody fragment-polymer conjugates. The present inventors have determined for the first time that increasing the effective size of an antibody fragment to at least about 500,000 D, or increasing the effective size of an antibody fragment by at least about 8 fold over the effective size of the parental antibody fragment, or derivatizing an antibody fragment with a polymer of at least about 20,000 D in molecular weight, yields a molecule with a commercially useful pharmacokinetic profile. The greatly extended serum half-life, extended MRT, and/or reduced serum clearance rate of the conjugates of the invention makes such conjugates viable alternatives to intact antibodies used for therapeutic treatment of many disease indications. Antibody fragments provide significant advantages over intact antibodies, notably the fact that recombinant antibody fragments can be made in bacterial cell expression systems. Bacterial cell expression systems provide several advantages over mammalian cell expression systems, including reduced time and cost at both the research and development and manufacturing stages of a product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another part, the present invention also arises from the humanization of the 6G4.2.5 murine anti-rabbit IL-8 monoclonal antibody (“6G4.2.5”) described in WO 95/23865 (PCT/US95/02589 published Sep. 8, 1995), the entire disclosure of which is specifically incorporated herein by reference. The hybridoma producing antibody 6G4.2.5 was deposited on Sep. 28, 1994 with the American Type Culture Collection and assigned ATCC Accession No. HB 11722 as described in the Examples below. In one aspect, the invention provides a humanized derivative of the 6G4.2.5 antibody, variant 11 (referred to herein as “6G4.2.5v11”), in which the murine CDRs of 6G4.2.5 are grafted onto a consensus framework for \nhuman light chain\n 61 and human IgG1 heavy chain subgroup III, followed by importing three framework residues from the murine 6G4.2.5 parent heavy chain variable domain sequence into analogous sites in the heavy chain variable domain of the human template sequence, as described in the Examples below. In another aspect, the invention provides variants of the 6G4.2.5v11 antibody with certain amino acid substitution(s) yielding increased affinity for human IL-8 and/or promoting greater efficiency in recombinant manufacturing processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood that in the context of this Section (II) and all subsections thereof, every reference to “an antibody fragment” or “the antibody fragment” contained in a conjugate shall be a reference to one or more antibody fragment(s) in the conjugate (consistent with the definition of the term “conjugate” set forth in Section (I) above), except where the number of antibody fragment(s) in the conjugate is expressly indicated. It will be understood that in the context of this Section (II) and all subsections thereof, every reference to “a polymer”, “a polymer molecule”, “the polymer”, or “the polymer molecule” contained in a conjugate shall be a reference to one or more polymer molecule(s) in the conjugate (consistent with the definition of the term “conjugate” set forth in Section (I) above), except where the number of polymer molecule(s) in the conjugate is expressly indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Large Effective Size Antibody Fragment-Polymer Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides an antibody fragment covalently attached to a polymer to form a conjugate having an effective or apparent size of at least about 500,000 Daltons (D). In another aspect, the invention provides an antibody fragment covalently attached to a polymer to form a conjugate having an apparent size that is at least about 8 fold greater than the apparent size of the parental antibody fragment. In yet another aspect, the invention provides an antibody fragment covalently attached to a polymer of at least about 20,000 D in molecular weight (MW). It will be appreciated that the unexpectedly and surprisingly large increase in antibody fragment serum half-life, increase in MRT, and/or decrease in serum clearance rate can be achieved by using any type of polymer or number of polymer molecules which will provide the conjugate with an effective size of at least about 500,000 D, or by using any type of polymer or number of polymer molecules which will provide the conjugate with an effective size that is at least about 8 fold greater than the effective size of the parental antibody fragment, or by using any type or number of polymers wherein each polymer molecule is at least about 20,000 D in MW. Thus, the invention is not dependent on the use of any particular polymer or molar ratio of polymer to antibody fragment in the conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the beneficial aspects of the invention extend to antibody fragments without regard to antigen specificity.

Research, Inc., Hamilton, Mont.), at multiple sites. Two weeks later the animals are boosted. 7 to 14 days later animals are bled and the serum is assayed for anti-antigen titer. Animals are boosted until titer plateaus. Sera are harvested from animals, and polyclonal antibodies are isolated from sera by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures, such as protein A-Sepharose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel filtration, dialysis, or antigen affinity chromatography. The desired antibody fragments can be generated from purified polyclonal antibody preparations by conventional enzymatic methods, e.g. F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments are produced by pepsin cleavage of intact antibody, and Fab fragments are produced by briefly digesting intact antibody with papain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(iii) Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, antibody fragments are derived from monoclonal antibodies generated against the desired antigen. Monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., \nNature, \n256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster or macaque monkey, is immunized as hereinabove described to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, \nMonoclonal Antibodies. Principles and Practice\n, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOP-21 and M.C.-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, \nJ. Immunol., \n133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., \nMonoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications\n, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCulture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al., \nAnal. Biochem., \n107:220 (1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, \nMonoclonal Antibodies. Principles and Practice\n, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, anti-human VEGF monoclonal antibody is obtained as described in WO 98/45331 (published Oct. 15, 1998) (International Application No. PCT/US98/06604 filed Apr. 3, 1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody is obtained as described in U.S. Pat.

No. 5,714,338.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, anti-human Apo-2 receptor monoclonal antibody is obtained as described in WO 98/51793 (published Nov. 19, 1998) (International Application No. PCT/US98/09704 filed May 14, 1998). In a further embodiment, the invention contemplates the use of anti-human Apo-2 receptor monoclonal antibody capable of activating the human Apo-2 receptor. Such anti-Apo-2 monoclonal antibodies can be selected and identified by any convenient screening method, such as an assay for induction of Apo-2 mediated 9D cell apoptosis as described in Example 10 of WO 98/51793.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, anti-human TNF-α monoclonal antibody is obtained as described in U.S. Pat.

No. 4,515,893 (issued May 7, 1985).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, anti-human TAC monoclonal antibody is obtained as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762 (issued Dec. 2, 1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the monoclonal antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as \nE. coli \ncells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of antibody-encoding DNA include Skerra et al., \nCurr. Opinion in Immunol., \n5: 256 (1993) and Pluckthun, \nImmunol. Revs., \n130: 151 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the antibody fragment is derived from a humanized antibody. Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as “import” residues, which are typically taken from an “import” variable domain. It will be appreciated that variable domain sequences obtained from any non-human animal phage display library-derived Fv clone or from any non-human animal hybridoma-derived antibody clone provided as described herein can serve as the “import” variable domain used in the construction of the humanized antibodies of the invention. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al., \nNature, \n321: 522 (1986); Riechmann et al., \nNature, \n332: 323 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., \nScience, \n239: 1534 (1988)), by substituting non-human animal, e.g. rodent, CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such “humanized” antibodies are chimeric antibodies (Cabilly et al., supra), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in non-human animal, e.g. rodent, antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called “best-fit” method, the sequence of the variable domain of a non-human animal, e.g. rodent, antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the non-human animal is then accepted as the human framework (FR) for the humanized antibody (Sims et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n151: 2296 (1993); Chothia and Lesk, \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n196: 901 (1987)). Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup light or heavy chains. The same framework can be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, \n89: 4285 (1992); Presta et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n151: 2623 (1993)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind to its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, antibody fragments for use herein can be derived from human monoclonal antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies against the antigen of interest can be made by the hybridoma method. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described, for example, by Kozbor \nJ. Immunol., \n133: 3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., \nMonoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications\n, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987); and Boerner et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n147: 86 (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g. mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (JH) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n90: 2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., \nNature, \n362: 255 (1993); Bruggermann et al., \nYear in Immunol., \n7: 33 (1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, phage display technology (McCafferty et al., \nNature \n348:552 (1990)) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats; for their review see, e.g., Johnson et al., \nCurrent Opinion in Structural Biology \n3:564 (1993). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al., \nNature \n352:624 (1991) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222:581 (1991), or Griffith et al., \nEMBO J. \n12:725 (1993). In a natural immune response, antibody genes accumulate mutations at a high rate (somatic hypermutation). Some of the changes introduced will confer higher affinity, and B cells displaying high-affinity surface immunoglobulin are preferentially replicated and differentiated during subsequent antigen challenge. This natural process can be mimicked by employing the technique known as “chain shuffling” (Marks et al., \nBio/Technol. \n10:779 (1992)). In this method, the affinity of “primary” human antibodies obtained by phage display can be improved by sequentially replacing the heavy and light chain V region genes with repertoires of naturally occurring variants (repertoires) of V domain genes obtained from unimmunized donors. This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the nM range. A strategy for making very large phage antibody repertoires has been described by Waterhouse et al., \nNucl. Acids Res. \n21:2265 (1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from non-human, e.g. rodent, antibodies, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting non-human antibody. According to this method, which is also called “epitope imprinting”, either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non-human antibody fragment obtained by phage display techniques as described above is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating a population of non-human chain/human chain scFv or Fab chimeras. Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non-human chain/human chain chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed upon removal of the corresponding non-human chain in the primary phage display clone, i.e. the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of the human chain partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining non-human chain, a human antibody is obtained (see PCT WO 93/06213 published Apr. 1, 1993). Unlike traditional humanization of non-human antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies, which have no FR or CDR residues of non-human origin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also encompasses the use of bispecific and heteroconjugate antibody fragments having specificities for at least two different antigens. Bispecific and heteroconjugate antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or as antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab′)\n2 \nbispecific antibody fragments). Antibody fragments having more than two valencies (e.g. trivalent or higher valency antibody fragments) are also contemplated for use herein. Bispecific antibodies, heteroconjugate antibodies, and multi-valent antibodies can be prepared as described in Section (II)(3)(C) below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, DNA encoding the monoclonal antibody or antibody fragment of interest can be isolated from its hybridoma or phage display clone of origin, and then manipulated to create humanized and/or affinity matured constructs. In addition, known techniques can be employed to introduce an amino acid residue or residues into any desired location on the polypeptide backbone of the antibody fragment, e.g. a cysteine residue placed in the hinge region of the heavy chain, thereby providing a site for specific attachment of polymer molecule(s). In one embodiment, the native cysteine residue in either the light or heavy chain of the antibody fragment that would ordinarily form the disulfide bridge linking the light and heavy chains is substituted with another amino acid, such as serine, in order to leave the partner cysteine residue in the opposite chain with a free sulfhydryl for specific attachment of polymer molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon construction of the desired antibody or antibody fragment-encoding clone, the clone can be used for recombinant production of the antibody fragment as described in Section (II)(4) below. Finally, the antibody or antibody fragment product can be recovered from host cell culture and purified as described in Section (II)(4)(F) below. In the case of embodiments utilizing an antibody fragment engineered to lack a cysteine residue that ordinarily forms the disulfide bridge between the light and heavy chains as described above, preferred recombinant production systems include bacterial expression and product recovery procedures utilizing the low pH osmotic shock method described in the “Alternative Fab′-SH Purification” section of Example T below. If a full length antibody is produced, the desired antibody fragment can be obtained therefrom by subjecting the intact antibody to enzymatic digestion according to known methods, e.g. as described in Section (II)(4)(G) below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb. Construction of Antibody Fragment-Polymer Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody fragment-polymer conjugates of the invention can be made by derivatizing the desired antibody fragment with an inert polymer. It will be appreciated that any inert polymer which provides the conjugate with the desired apparent size or which has the selected actual MW as taught herein is suitable for use in constructing the antibody fragment-polymer conjugates of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany inert polymers are suitable for use in pharmaceuticals. See, e.g., Davis et al., \nBiomedical Polymers Polymeric Materials and Pharmaceuticals for Biomedical Use\n, pp. 441-451 (1980). In all embodiments of the invention, a non-proteinaceous polymer is used. The nonproteinaceous polymer ordinarily is a hydrophilic synthetic polymer, i.e., a polymer not otherwise found in nature. However, polymers which exist in nature and are produced by recombinant or in vitro methods are also useful, as are polymers which are isolated from native sources. Hydrophilic polyvinyl polymers fall within the scope of this invention, e.g. polyvinylalcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Particularly useful are polyalkylene ethers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG); polyoxyalkylenes such as polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene, and block copolymers of polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene (Pluronics); polymethacrylates; carbomers; branched or unbranched polysaccharides which comprise the saccharide monomers D-mannose, D- and L-galactose, fucose, fructose, D-xylose, L-arabinose, D-glucuronic acid, silica acid, D-galacturonic acid, D-mannuronic acid (e.g. polymannuronic acid, or alginic acid), D-glucosamine, D-galactosamine, D-glucose and neuraminic acid including homopolysaccharides and heteropolysaccharides such as lactose, amylopectin, starch, hydroxyethyl starch, amylose, dextrane sulfate, dextran, dextrins, glycogen, or the polysaccharide subunit of acid mucopolysaccharides, e.g. hyaluronic acid; polymers of sugar alcohols such as polysorbitol and polymannitol; heparin or heparon. The polymer prior to cross-linking need not be, but preferably is, water soluble, but the final conjugate must be water soluble. Preferably, the conjugate exhibits a water solubility of at least about 0.01 mg/ml, and more preferably at least about 0.1 mg/ml, and still more preferably at least about 1 mg/ml. In addition, the polymer should not be highly immunogenic in the conjugate form, nor should it possess viscosity that is incompatible with intravenous infusion or injection if the conjugate is intended to be administered by such routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the polymer contains only a single group which is reactive. This helps to avoid cross-linking of protein molecules. However, it is within the scope herein to maximize reaction conditions to reduce cross-linking, or to purify the reaction products through gel filtration or ion exchange chromatography to recover substantially homogenous derivatives. In other embodiments, the polymer contains two or more reactive groups for the purpose of linking multiple antibody fragments to the polymer backbone. Again, gel filtration or ion exchange chromatography can be used to recover the desired derivative in substantially homogeneous form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe molecular weight of the polymer can range up to about 500,000 D, and preferably is at least about 20,000 D, or at least about 30,000 D, or at least about 40,000 D. The molecular weight chosen can depend upon the effective size of the conjugate to be achieved, the nature (e.g. structure, such as linear or branched) of the polymer, and the degree of derivatization, i.e. the number of polymer molecules per antibody fragment, and the polymer attachment site or sites on the antibody fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymer can be covalently linked to the antibody fragment through a multifunctional crosslinking agent which reacts with the polymer and one or more amino acid residues of the antibody fragment to be linked. However, it is also within the scope of the invention to directly crosslink the polymer by reacting a derivatized polymer with the antibody fragment, or vice versa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe covalent crosslinking site on the antibody fragment includes the N-terminal amino group and epsilon amino groups found on lysine residues, as well as other amino, imino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, hydroxyl or other hydrophilic groups. The polymer may be covalently bonded directly to the antibody fragment without the use of a multifunctional (ordinarily bifunctional) crosslinking agent. Covalent binding to amino groups is accomplished by known chemistries based upon cyanuric chloride, carbonyl diimidazole, aldehyde reactive groups (PEG alkoxide plus diethyl acetal of bromoacetaldehyde; PEG plus DMSO and acetic anhydride, or PEG chloride plus the phenoxide of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, activated succinimidyl esters, activated dithiocarbonate PEG, 2,4,5-trichlorophenylcloroformate or P-nitrophenylcloroformate activated PEG.) Carboxyl groups are derivatized by coupling PEG-amine using carbodiimide. Sulfhydryl groups are derivatized by coupling to maleimido-substituted PEG (e.g. alkoxy-PEG amine plus sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) as described in WO 97/10847 published Mar. 27, 1997, or PEG-maleimide commercially available from Shearwater Polymers, Inc., Huntsville, Ala.). Alternatively, free amino groups on the antibody fragment (e.g. epsilon amino groups on lysine residues) can be thiolated with 2-imino-thiolane (Traut's reagent) and then coupled to maleimide-containing derivatives of PEG as described in Pedley et al., \nBr. J. Cancer, \n70: 1126-1130 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymer will bear a group which is directly reactive with an amino acid side chain, or the N- or C-terminus of the polypeptide linked, or which is reactive with the multifunctional cross-linking agent. In general, polymers bearing such reactive groups are known for the preparation of immobilized proteins. In order to use such chemistries here, one should employ a water soluble polymer otherwise derivatized in the same fashion as insoluble polymers heretofore employed for protein immobilization. Cyanogen bromide activation is a particularly useful procedure to employ in crosslinking polysaccharides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Water soluble” in reference to the starting polymer means that the polymer or its reactive intermediate used for conjugation is sufficiently water soluble to participate in a derivatization reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe degree of substitution with such a polymer will vary depending upon the number of reactive sites on the antibody fragment, the molecular weight, hydrophilicity and other characteristics of the polymer, and the particular antibody fragment derivatization sites chosen. In general, the conjugate contains from 1 to about 10 polymer molecules, but greater numbers of polymer molecules attached to the antibody fragments of the invention are also contemplated. The desired amount of derivatization is easily achieved by using an experimental matrix in which the time, temperature and other reaction conditions are varied to change the degree of substitution, after which the level of polymer substitution of the conjugates is determined by size exclusion chromatography or other means known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymer, e.g. PEG, is cross-linked to the antibody fragment by a wide variety of methods known per se for the covalent modification of proteins with nonproteinaceous polymers such as PEG. Certain of these methods, however, are not preferred for the purposes herein. Cyanuronic chloride chemistry leads to many side reactions, including protein cross-linking. In addition, it may be particularly likely to lead to inactivation of proteins containing sulfhydryl groups. Carbonyl diimidazole chemistry (Beauchamp et al., \nAnal Biochem. \n131, 25-33 [1983]) requires high pH (>8.5), which can inactivate proteins. Moreover, since the “activated PEG” intermediate can react with water, a very large molar excess of “activated PEG” over protein is required. The high concentrations of PEG required for the carbonyl diimidazole chemistry also led to problems in purification, as both gel filtration chromatography and hydrophilic interaction chromatography are adversely affected. In addition, the high concentrations of “activated PEG” may precipitate protein, a problem that per se has been noted previously (Davis, U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337). On the other hand, aldehyde chemistry (Royer, U.S. Pat. No. 4,002,531) is more efficient since it requires only a 40-fold molar excess of PEG and a 1-2 hr incubation. However, the manganese dioxide suggested by Royer for preparation of the PEG aldehyde is problematic “because of the pronounced tendency of PEG to form complexes with metal-based oxidizing agents” (Harris et al., \nJ. Polym. Sci. Polym. Chem. Ed. \n22, 341-52 [1984]). The use of a Moffatt oxidation, utilizing DMSO and acetic anhydride, obviates this problem. In addition, the sodium borohydride suggested by Royer must be used at high pH and has a significant tendency to reduce disulfide bonds. In contrast, sodium cyanoborohydride, which is effective at neutral pH and has very little tendency to reduce disulfide bonds is preferred. In another preferred embodiment, maleimido-activated PEG is used for coupling to free thiols on the antibody fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFunctionalized PEG polymers to modify the antibody fragments of the invention are available from Shearwater Polymers, Inc. (Huntsville, Ala.). Such commercially available PEG derivatives include, but are not limited to, amino-PEG, PEG amino acid esters, PEG-hydrazide, PEG-thiol, PEG-succinate, carboxymethylated PEG, PEG-propionic acid, PEG amino acids. PEG succinimidyl succinate, PEG succinimidyl propionate, succinimidyl ester of carboxymethylated PEG, succinimidyl carbonate of PEG, succinimidyl esters of amino acid PEGs, PEG-oxycarbonylimidazole, PEG-nitrophenyl carbonate, PEG tresylate, PEG-glycidyl ether, PEG-aldehyde, PEG vinylsulfone, PEG-maleimide, PEG-orthopyridyl-disulfide, heterofunctional PEGs, PEG vinyl derivatives, PEG silanes, and PEG phospholides. The reaction conditions for coupling these PEG derivatives will vary depending on the protein, the desired degree of PEGylation, and the PEG derivative utilized. Some factors involved in the choice of PEG derivatives include: the desired point of attachment (such as lysine or cysteine R-groups), hydrolytic stability and reactivity of the derivatives, stability, toxicity and antigenicity of the linkage, suitability for analysis, etc. Specific instructions for the use of any particular derivative are available from the manufacturer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugates of this invention are separated from the unreacted starting materials by gel filtration or ion exchange HPLC. Heterologous species of the conjugates are purified from one another in the same fashion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugates may also be purified by ion-exchange chromatography. The chemistry of many of the electrophilically activated PEG's results in a reduction of amino group charge of the PEGylated product. Thus, high resolution ion exchange chromatography can be used to separate the free and conjugated proteins, and to resolve species with different levels of PEGylation. In fact, the resolution of different species (e.g. containing one or two PEG residues) is also possible due to the difference in the ionic properties of the unreacted amino acids. In one embodiment, species with difference levels of PEGylation are resolved according to the methods described in WO 96/34015 (International Application No. PCT/US96/05550 published Oct. 31, 1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the conjugate is generated by utilizing the derivatization and purification methods described in Section (T) of the Examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides any of the above-described conjugates formed by its component parts, i.e. one or more antibody fragment(s) covalently attached to one or more polymer molecule(s), without any extraneous matter in the covalent molecular structure of the conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc. Other Derivatives of Large Effective Size Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, any of the above-described conjugates can be modified to contain one or more component(s) in addition to the antibody fragment component(s) and polymer component(s) that form the conjugate, wherein the modification does not alter the essential functional property of the conjugate, namely, the substantially improved serum half-life, MRT and/or serum clearance rate as compared to that of the parental antibody fragment from which the conjugate is derived. In one embodiment, the invention provides any of the above-described conjugates modified to incorporate one or more nonproteinaceous functional group(s). For example, the conjugate can be modified to incorporate nonproteinaceous labels or reporter molecules, such as radiolabels, including any radioactive substance used in medical treatment or imaging or used as an effector function or tracer in an animal model, such as radioisotopic labels \n99\nTc, \n90\nY, \n111\nIn, \n32\nP, \n14\nC, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, \n131\nI, \n11\nC, \n15\nO, \n13\nN, \n18\nF, \n35\nS, \n51\nCr, \n57\nTo, \n226\nRa, \n60\nCo, \n59\nFe, \n75\nSe, \n52\nEu, \n67\nCU, \n217\nCi, \n211\nAt, \n212\nPb, \n47\nSc, \n109\nPd, \n234\nTh \n40\nK, and the like, non-radioisotopic labels such as \n157\nGd, \n55\nMn, \n52\nTr, \n56\nFe, etc., fluorescent or chemiluminescent labels, including fluorophores such as rare earth chelates, fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, isothiocyanate, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaladehyde, fluorescamine, \n152\nEu, dansyl, umbelliferone, luciferin, luminal label, isoluminal label, an aromatic acridinium ester label, an imidazole label, an acridimium salt label, an oxalate ester label, an aequorin label, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, biotin/avidin, spin labels, stable free radicals, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConventional methods are available to bind these labels covalently to the polypeptide antibody fragment or polymer component of the conjugate. In one aspect, any conjugate of the invention is modified by derivatizing the antibody fragment component with any of the above-described non-proteinaceous labels, wherein the label is directly or indirectly (through a coupling agent) attached to the antibody fragment, and wherein such derivatization of the antibody fragment does not contribute or introduce any polymer moiety into the molecular structure of the conjugate. For instance, coupling agents such as dialdehydes, carbodiimides, dimaleimides, bis-imidates, bis-diazotized benzidine, and the like can be used to tag the antibody fragment with the above-described fluorescent or chemiluminescent labels. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,940,475 (fluorimetry), Morrison, \nMeth. Enzymol., \n32b, 103 (1974), Svyanen et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n284, 3762 (1973), and Bolton and Hunter, \nBiochem. J., \n133, 529 (1973).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of embodiments utilizing radiolabels, both direct and indirect labeling can be used to incorporate the selected radionuclide into the conjugate. As used herein in the context of radiolabeling, the phrases “indirect labeling” and “indirect labeling approach” both mean that a chelating agent is covalently attached to the antibody fragment moiety or polymer moiety of the conjugate and at least one radionuclide is inserted into the chelating agent. Preferred chelating agents and radionuclides are set forth in Srivagtava, S. C. and Mease, R. C., “Progress in Research on Ligands, Nuclides and Techniques for Labeling Monoclonal Antibodies,” \nNucl. Med. Bio., \n18(6): 589-603 (1991). A particularly preferred chelating agent is 1-isothiocycmatobenzyl-3-methyldiothelene triaminepent acetic acid (“MX-DTPA”). As used herein in the context of radiolabeling, the phrases “direct labeling” and “direct labeling approach” both mean that a radionuclide is covalently attached directly to the antibody fragment moiety (typically via an amino acid residue) or to the polymer moiety of the conjugate. Preferred radionuclides for use in direct labeling of conjugate are provided in Srivagtava and Mease, supra. In one embodiment, the conjugate is directly labeled with \n131\nI covalently attached to tyrosine residues. In another embodiment, the antibody fragment component of the conjugate is directly or indirectly labeled with any of the above-described radiolabels, wherein such labeling of the antibody fragment does not contribute or introduce any polymer moiety into the molecular structure of the conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the conjugate can be modified to incorporate one or more small molecule toxins, such as a calicheamicin, a maytansine (U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020, expressly incorporated herein by reference), palytoxin, a trichothene, and CC1065. For example, the conjugate of the invention can be derivatized with one or more maytansine molecules (e.g. about 1 to about 10 maytansine molecules per antibody molecule). Maytansine can be converted to May-ss-Me, which can be reduced to May-SH3 and reacted with modified antibody fragment to generate a maytansinoid-derivatized antibody fragment moiety in the conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the antibody fragment in the conjugate is derivatized with one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include, but are not limited to, \n1\n \nI\n, \n2\n \nI\n, \n3\n \nI\n, N-acetyl-\n1\n \nI\n, PSAG and \nI\n \n1 \n(Hinman et al., \nCancer R. \n53:3336-3342 [1993]; and Lode et al., \nCancer R. \n58:2925-2928 [1998]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nd.

The humanized heavy chain variable domain comprising the CDRs of 6G4.2.5HV or the CDRs of a 6G4.2.5HV CDRs variant can also contain some FR residues that are substituted by residues from analogous sites in the murine 6G4.2.5 antibody heavy chain variable domain. The complete amino acid sequence of 6G4.2.5HV is set out as amino acids 1-122 of the amino acid sequence of \nFIG. 25\n (SEQ ID NO: 37).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies and antibody fragments is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called “best-fit” method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework (FR) for the humanized antibody (Sims et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n151: 2296 (1993); Chothia and Lesk, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901 (1987)). Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework can be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n89:4285 (1992); Presta et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n151:2623 (1993)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also important that the antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention be humanized with retention of high affinity for human IL-8 and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, the humanized antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and parental sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny and all humanized light chain variable domain amino acid sequences which comprise the CDRs of 6G4.2.5LV are collectively referred to herein as “hu6G4.2.5LV”.\n\n\n \n \n

Constant domain sequence can be added to the heavy chain and/or light chain sequence(s) to form species with full or partial length heavy and/or light chain(s). It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE constant regions, and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species. Preferably, the constant domain sequence is human in origin. Suitable human constant domain sequences can be obtained from Kabat et al. (supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the humanized antibody or antibody fragment comprises a 6G4.2.5HV11A variant in a heavy chain that is fused to or contains a leucine zipper sequence. The leucine zipper can increase the affinity or production efficiency of the antibody or antibody fragment of interest. Suitable leucine zipper sequences include the jun and fos leucine zippers taught by Kostelney et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n148: 1547-1553 (1992) and the GCN4 leucine zipper described in the Examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC. Bispecific Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies are monoclonal, preferably human or humanized, antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present case, one of the binding specificities is for IL-8, the other one is for any other antigen. For example, bispecific antibodies specifically binding a IL-8 and neurotrophic factor, or two different types of IL-8 polypeptides are within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities (Milstein and Cuello, \nNature \n305:537 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829 published 13 May 1993, and in Traunecker et al., \nEMBO J. \n10:3655 (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a different and more preferred approach, antibody-variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant-domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1), containing the site necessary for light-chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the maximum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the production of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance. In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. This asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies, see, for example, Suresh et al., \nMethods in Enzymology \n121:210 (1986).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another approach, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory “cavities” of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies include cross-linked or “heteroconjugate” antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO 91/00360, WO 92/00373, and EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., \nScience, \n229: 81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab′ fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab′-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab′-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab′-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab′-SH fragments from \nE. coli\n, which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., \nJ. Exp. Med., \n175: 217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecule. Each Fab′ fragment was separately secreted from \nE. coli \nand subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab′ portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The “diabody” technology described by Hollinger et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n152:5368 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n147: 60 (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4. Production of Humanized Anti-IL-8 6G4.2.5 Monoclonal Antibody, Antibody Fragments, and Variants\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention can be produced using any convenient antibody manufacturing process known in the art. Typically, the antibody or antibody fragment is made using recombinant expression systems. A multiple polypeptide chain antibody or antibody fragment species can be made in a single host cell expression system wherein the host cell produces each chain of the antibody or antibody fragment and assembles the polypeptide chains into a multimeric structure to form the antibody or antibody fragment in vivo, followed by recovery of the antibody or antibody fragment from the host cell. For example, suitable recombinant expression systems for the production of complete antibody or antibody fragment are described in Lucas et al., \nNucleic Acids Res., \n24: 1774-1779 (1996). Alternatively, the separate polypeptide chains of the desired antibody or antibody fragment can be made in separate expression host cells, separately recovered from the respective host cells, and then mixed in vitro under conditions permitting the formation of the multi-subunit antibody or antibody fragment of interest. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 to Cabilly et al. and Carter et al., \nBio/Technology, \n10: 163-167 (1992) provide methods for recombinant production of antibody heavy and light chains in separate expression hosts followed by assembly of antibody from separate heavy and light chains in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following discussion of recombinant expression methods applies equally to the production of single chain antibody polypeptide species and multi-subunit antibody and antibody fragment species. All recombinant procedures for the production of antibody or antibody fragment provided below shall be understood to describe: (1) manufacture of single chain antibody species as the desired end-product; (2) manufacture of multi-subunit antibody or antibody fragment species by production of all subunits in a single host cell, subunit assembly in the host cell, optionally followed by host cell secretion of the multi-subunit end-product into the culture medium, and recovery of the multi-subunit end-product from the host cell and/or culture medium; and (3) manufacture of multi-subunit antibody or antibody fragment by production of subunits in separate host cells (optionally followed by host cell secretion of subunits into the culture medium), recovery of subunits from the respective host cells and/or culture media, followed by in vitro subunit assembly to form the multi-subunit end-product. In the case of a multi-subunit antibody or antibody fragment produced in a single host cell, it will be appreciated that production of the various subunits can be effected by expression of multiple polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid sequences carried on a single vector or by expression of polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid sequences carried on multiple vectors contained in the host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA. Construction of DNA Encoding Humanized 6G4.2.5 Monoclonal Antibodies, Antibody, Fragments, and Variants\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing the selection of the humanized antibody or antibody fragment of the invention according to the methods described above, the practitioner can use the genetic code to design DNAs encoding the desired antibody or antibody fragment. In one embodiment, codons preferred by the expression host cell are used in the design of a DNA encoding the antibody or antibody fragment of interest. DNA encoding the desired antibody or antibody fragment can be prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, chemical synthesis by any of the methods described in Engels et al., \nAgnew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. \n28: 716-734 (1989), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, such as the triester, phosphite, phosphoramidite and H-phosphonate methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variation on the above procedures contemplates the use of gene fusions, wherein the gene(s) encoding the antibody or antibody fragment is associated, in the vector, with a gene encoding another protein or a fragment of another protein. This results in the antibody or antibody fragment being produced by the host cell as a fusion with another protein. The “other” protein is often a protein or peptide which can be secreted by the cell, making it possible to isolate and purify the desired protein from the culture medium and eliminating the necessity of destroying the host cells which arises when the desired protein remains inside the cell. Alternatively, the fusion protein can be expressed intracellularly. It is advantageous to use fusion proteins that are highly expressed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of gene fusions, though not essential, can facilitate the expression of heterologous proteins in \nE. coli \nas well as the subsequent purification of those gene products (Harris, T. J. R. in \nGenetic Engineering\n, Williamson, R., Ed., Academic, London, Vol. 4, p. 127 (1983); Uhlen, M. & Moks, T., \nMethods Enzymol. \n185:129-143 (1990)). Protein A fusions are often used because the binding of protein A, or more specifically the Z domain of protein A, to IgG provides an “affinity handle” for the purification of the fused protein (Nilsson, B. & Abrahmsen, L. \nMethods Enzymol. \n185:144-161 (1990)). It has also been shown that many heterologous proteins are degraded when expressed directly in \nE. coli\n, but are stable when expressed as fusion proteins (Marston, F. A. O., \nBiochem J. \n240:1 (1986)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion proteins can be cleaved using chemicals, such as cyanogen bromide, which cleaves at a methionine, or hydroxylamine, which cleaves between an Asn and Gly. Using standard recombinant DNA methodology, the nucleotide base pairs encoding these amino acids may be inserted just prior to the 5′ end of the antibody or antibody fragment gene(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, one can employ proteolytic cleavage of fusion proteins, which has been recently reviewed (Carter, P. (1990) in \nProtein Purification. From Molecular Mechanisms to Large\n-\nScale Processes\n, Ladisch, M. R., Willson, R. C., Painton, C. C., and Builder, S. E., eds., American Chemical Society Symposium Series No. 427, Ch 13, 181-193).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProteases such Factor Xa, thrombin, subtilisin and mutants thereof, have been successfully used to cleave fusion proteins. Typically, a peptide linker that is amenable to cleavage by the protease used is inserted between the “other” protein (e.g., the Z domain of protein A) and the protein of interest, such as humanized anti-IL-8 antibody or antibody fragment. Using recombinant DNA methodology, the nucleotide base pairs encoding the linker are inserted between the genes or gene fragments coding for the other proteins. Proteolytic cleavage of the partially purified fusion protein containing the correct linker can then be carried out on either the native fusion protein, or the reduced or denatured fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques are also available which may now be employed to produce variant humanized antibodies or antibody fragments, which encodes for additions, deletions, or changes in amino acid sequence of the resultant protein(s) relative to the parent humanized antibody or antibody fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of illustration, with expression vectors encoding humanized antibody or antibody fragment in hand, site specific mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., \nMethods Enzymol. \n204:125-139 (1991); Carter, P., et al., \nNucl. Acids. Res. \n13:4331 (1986); Zoller, M. J. et al., \nNucl. Acids Res. \n10:6487 (1982)), cassette mutagenesis (Wells, J. A., et al., \nGene \n34:315 (1985)), restriction selection mutagenesis (Wells, J. A., et al., \nPhilos. Trans\n, R. Soc. London SerA 317, 415 (1986)) or other known techniques may be performed on the antibody or antibody fragment DNA. The variant DNA can then be used in place of the parent DNA by insertion into the aforementioned expression vectors. Growth of host bacteria containing the expression vectors with the mutant DNA allows the production of variant humanized antibodies or antibody fragments, which can be isolated as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. Insertion of DNA into a Cloning Vehicle\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA encoding the antibody or antibody fragment is inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. Many vectors are available, and selection of the appropriate vector will depend on (1) whether it is to be used for DNA amplification or for DNA expression, (2) the size of the DNA to be inserted into the vector, and (3) the host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components depending on its function (amplification of DNA or expression of DNA) and the host cell for which it is compatible. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) Signal Sequence Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, a signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a part of the antibody or antibody fragment DNA that is inserted into the vector. Preferably, a heterologous signal sequence selected and fused to the antibody or antibody fragment DNA such that the signal sequence in the corresponding fusion protein is recognized, transported and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) in the host cell's protein secretion system. In the case of prokaryotic host cells, the signal sequence is selected, for example, from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, lpp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders. In a preferred embodiment, the STII signal sequence is used as described in the Examples below. For yeast secretion the native signal sequence may be substituted by, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, a factor leader (including \nSaccharomyces \nand \nKluyveromyces \nα-factor leaders), or acid phosphatase leader, the \nC. albicans \nglucoamylase leader, or the signal described in WO 90/13646. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) Origin of Replication Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally, in cloning vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA, and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2: plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors (the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost expression vectors are “shuttle” vectors, i.e. they are capable of replication in at least one class of organisms but can be transfected into another organism for expression. For example, a vector is cloned in \nE. coli \nand then the same vector is transfected into yeast or mammalian cells for expression even though it is not capable of replicating independently of the host cell chromosome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA may also be amplified by insertion into the host genome. This is readily accomplished using \nBacillus \nspecies as hosts, for example, by including in the vector a DNA sequence that is homologous to a sequence found in \nBacillus \ngenomic DNA. Transfection of \nBacillus \nwith this vector results in homologous recombination with the genome and insertion of the antibody or antibody fragment DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(iii) Selection Gene Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression and cloning vectors should contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. This gene encodes a protein necessary for the survival or growth of transformed host cells grown in a selective culture medium. Host cells not transformed with the vector containing the selection gene will not survive in the culture medium. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g. ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g. the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene express a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin (Southern et al., \nJ. Molec. Appl. Genet., \n1: 327 (1982)), mycophenolic acid (Mulligan et al., \nScience, \n209: 1422 (1980)) or hygromycin (Sugden et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol., \n5: 410-413 (1985)). The three examples given above employ bacterial genes under eukaryotic control to convey resistance to the appropriate drug (G418 or neomycin (geneticin), xgpt (mycophenolic acid), and hygromycin, respectively.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody or antibody fragment nucleic acid, such as dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or thymidine kinase. The mammalian cell transformants are placed under selection pressure which only the transformants are uniquely adapted to survive by virtue of having taken up the marker. Selection pressure is imposed by culturing the transformants under conditions in which the concentration of selection agent in the medium is successively changed, thereby leading to amplification of both the selection gene and the DNA that encodes the antibody or antibody fragment. Amplification is the process by which genes in greater demand for the production of a protein critical for growth are reiterated in tandem within the chromosomes of successive generations of recombinant cells. Increased quantities of the antibody or antibody fragment are synthesized from the amplified DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity, prepared and propagated as described by Urlaub and Chasin, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n77: 4216 (1980). The transformed cells are then exposed to increased levels of methotrexate. This leads to the synthesis of multiple copies of the DHFR gene, and, concomitantly, multiple copies of other DNA comprising the expression vectors, such as the DNA encoding the antibody or antibody fragment. This amplification technique can be used with any otherwise suitable host, e.g., ATCC No. CCL61 CHO-K1, notwithstanding the presence of endogenous DHFR if, for example, a mutant DHFR gene that is highly resistant to Mtx is employed (EP 117,060). Alternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR) transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding the antibody or antibody fragment, wild-type DHFR protein, and another selectable marker such as \naminoglycoside\n 3′ phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,199.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7. Stinchcomb et al., \nNature, \n282: 39 (1979); Kingsman et al., \nGene, \n7: 141 (1979); or Tschemper et al., \nGene, \n10: 157 (1980). The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example, ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1. Jones, \nGenetics, \n85: 12 (1977). The presence of the trp1 lesion in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. Similarly, Leu2-deficient yeast strains (ATCC 20,622 or 38,626) are complemented by known plasmids bearing the Leu2 gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(iv) Promoter Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the antibody or antibody fragment nucleic acid. Promoters are untranslated sequences located upstream (5′) to the start codon of a structural gene (generally within about 100 to 1000 bp) that control the transcription and translation of a particular nucleic acid sequence, such as the antibody or antibody fragment encoding sequence, to which they are operably linked. Such promoters typically fall into two classes, inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoters are promoters that initiate increased levels of transcription from DNA under their control in response to some change in culture conditions, e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature. At this time a large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPromoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the β-lactamase and lactose promoter systems (Chang et al., \nNature, \n275: 615 (1978); and Goeddel et al., \nNature, \n281: 544 (1979)), alkaline phosphatase, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system (Goeddel, \nNucleic Acids Res., \n8: 4057 (1980) and EP 36,776) and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter (deBoer et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n80: 21-25 (1983)). However, other known bacterial promoters are suitable. Their nucleotide sequences have been published, thereby enabling a skilled worker to operably ligate them to DNA encoding the antibody or antibody fragment (Siebenlist et al., \nCell, \n20: 269 (1980)) using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also generally will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding the antibody or antibody fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (Hitzeman et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n255: 2073 (1980)) or other glycolytic enzymes (1-less et al., \nJ. Adv. Enzyme Reg., \n7: 149 (1968); and Holland, \nBiochemistry, \n17: 4900 (1978)), such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phospho fructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for \nalcohol dehydrogenase\n 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, metallothionein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in Hitzeman et al., EP 73,657A. Yeast enhancers also are advantageously used with yeast promoters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPromoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CXCAAT region where X may be any nucleotide. At the 3′ end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3′ end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into mammalian expression vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVector driven transcription of antibody or antibody fragment encoding DNA in mammalian host cells can be controlled by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus (UK 2,211,504 published 5 Jul. 1989), adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and most preferably Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g. the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, and from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. Fiers et al., \nNature, \n273: 113 (1978); Mulligan and Berg, \nScience, \n209: 1422-1427 (1980); Pavlakis et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n78: 7398-7402 (1981). The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. Greenaway et al., \nGene, \n18: 355-360 (1982). A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,978. See also Gray et al., \nNature, \n295: 503-508 (1982) on expressing cDNA encoding immune interferon in monkey cells, Reyes et al., \nNature, \n297: 598-601 (1982) on expression of human-interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus, Canaani and Berg, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n79: 5166-5170 (1982) on expression of the human interferon I gene in cultured mouse and rabbit cells, and Gorman et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n79: 6777-6781 (1982) on expression of bacterial CAT sequences in CV-1 monkey kidney cells, chicken embryo fibroblasts, Chinese hamster ovary cells, HeLa cells, and mouse NIH-3T3 cells using the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat as a promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(v) Enhancer Element Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTranscription of a DNA encoding antibody or antibody fragment by higher eukaryotic host cells is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually about from 10-300 bp, that act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Enhancers are relatively orientation and position independent having been found 5′ (Laimins et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n78: 993 (1981)) and 3′ (Lusky et al., \nMol. Cell Bio., \n3: 1108 (1983)) to the transcription unit, within an intron (Banerji et al., \nCell, \n33: 729 (1983)) as well as within the coding sequence itself (Osborne et al., \nMol. Cell Bio., \n4: 1293 (1984)). Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, -fetoprotein and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv, \nNature, \n297: 17-18 (1982) on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a \nposition\n 5′ or 3′ to the antibody or antibody fragment DNA, but is preferably located at a \nsite\n 5′ from the promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(vi) Transcription Termination Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) can also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5′ and, occasionally 3′ untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding the antibody or antibody fragment. The 3′ untranslated regions also include transcription termination sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable vectors containing one or more of the above listed components and the desired coding and control sequences are constructed by standard ligation techniques. Isolated plasmids or DNA fragments are cleaved, tailored, and religated in the form desired to generate the plasmids required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor analysis to confirm correct sequences in plasmids constructed, the ligation mixtures are used to transform \nE. Coli \nK12 strain 294 (ATCC 31,446) and successful transformants selected by ampicillin or tetracycline resistance where appropriate. Plasmids from the transformants are prepared, analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion, and/or sequenced by the method of Messing et al., \nNucleic Acids Res., \n9: 309 (1981) or by the method of Maxam et al., \nMethods in Enzymology, \n65: 499 (1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly useful in the practice of this invention are expression vectors that provide for the transient expression in mammalian cells of DNA encoding the antibody or antibody fragment. In general, transient expression involves the use of an expression vector that is able to replicate efficiently in a host cell, such that the host cell accumulates many copies of the expression vector and, in turn, synthesizes high levels of a desired polypeptide encoded by the expression vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther methods, vectors, and host cells suitable for adaptation to the synthesis of the antibody or antibody fragment in recombinant vertebrate cell culture are described in Gething et al., \nNature, \n293: 620-625 (1981); Mantei et al., \nNature, \n281: 40-46 (1979); Levinson et al., EP 117,060; and EP 117,058. A particularly useful plasmid for mammalian cell culture expression of the IgE peptide antagonist is pRK5 (EP pub. no. 307,247) or pSVI6B (PCT pub. no. WO 91/08291 published 13 Jun. 1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC. Selection and Transformation of Host Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable host cells for cloning or expressing the vectors herein are the prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryote cells described above. Suitable prokaryotes include eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for example, \nE. coli\n, Bacilli such as \nB. subtilis, Pseudomonas \nspecies such as \nP. aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium\n, or \nSerratia marcescens\n. One preferred \nE. coli \ncloning host is \nE. coli \n294 (ATCC 31,446), although other strains such as \nE. coli \nB, \nE. coli \n1776 (ATCC 31,537), and \nE. coli \nW3110 (ATCC 27,325) are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Preferably the host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes. In a preferred embodiment, the \nE. coli \nstrain 49D6 is used as the expression host as described in the Examples below. Review articles describing the recombinant production of antibodies in bacterial host cells include Skerra et al., \nCurr. Opinion in Immunol., \n5: 256 (1993) and Pluckthun, \nImmunol. Revs., \n130: 151 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable hosts for vectors containing antibody or antibody fragment DNA. \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n, or common baker's yeast, is the most commonly used among lower eukaryotic host microorganisms. However, a number of other genera, species, and strains are commonly available and useful herein, such as \nS. pombe \n(Beach and Nurse, \nNature, \n290: 140 (1981)), \nKluyveromyces lactis \n(Louvencourt et al., \nJ. Bacteriol., \n737 (1983)), \nyarrowia \n(EP 402,226), \nPichia pastoris \n(EP 183,070), \nTrichoderma reesia \n(EP 244,234), \nNeurospora crassa \n(Case et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n76: 5259-5263 (1979)), and \nAspergillus \nhosts such as \nA. nidulans \n(Ballance et al., \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., \n112: 284-289 (1983); Tilburn et al., \nGene, \n26: 205-221 (1983); Yelton et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n81: 1470-1474 (1984)) and \nA. niger \n(Kelly and Hynes, \nEMBO J., \n4: 475-479 (1985)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells derived from multicellular organisms can also be used in the recombinant production of antibody or antibody fragment. Such host cells are capable of complex processing and glycosylation activities. In principle, any higher eukaryotic cell culture is workable, whether from vertebrate or invertebrate culture. Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as \nSpodoptera frugiperda \n(caterpillar), \nAedes aegypti \n(mosquito), \nAedes albopictus \n(mosquito), \nDrosophila melanogaster \n(fruitfly), and \nBombyx mori \nhost cells have been identified. See, e.g., Luckow et al., \nBio/Technology, \n6: 47-55 (1988); Miller et al., in \nGenetic Engineering\n, Setlow, J. K. et al., 8: 277-279 (Plenum Publishing, 1986), and Maeda et al., \nNature, \n315: 592-594 (1985). A variety of such viral strains are publicly available, e.g., the L-1 variant of \nAulographa californica \nNPV and the Bm-5 strain of \nBombyx mori \nNPV, and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention, particularly for transfection of \nSpodoptera frugiperda \ncells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlant cell cultures of cotton, corn, potato, soybean, petunia, tomato, and tobacco can be utilized as hosts. Typically, plant cells are transfected by incubation with certain strains of the bacterium \nAgrobacterium tumefaciens\n, which has been previously manipulated to contain the antibody or antibody fragment DNA. During incubation of the plant cell culture with \nA. tumefaciens\n, the DNA encoding antibody or antibody fragment is transferred to the plant cell host such that it is transfected, and will, under appropriate conditions, express the antibody or antibody fragment DNA. In addition, regulatory and signal sequences compatible with plant cells are available, such as the nopaline synthase promoter and polyadenylation signal sequences. Depicker et al., \nJ. Mol. Appl. Gen., \n1: 561 (1982). In addition, DNA segments isolated from the upstream region of the T-DNA 780 gene are capable of activating or increasing transcription levels of plant-expressible genes in recombinant DNA-containing plant tissue. See EP 321,196 published 21 Jun. 1989.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVertebrate cell culture is preferred for the recombinant production of full length antibodies. The propagation of vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure in recent years (\nTissue Culture\n, Academic Press, Kruse and Patterson, editors (1973)). Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., \nJ. Gen Virol., \n36: 59 (1977)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/−DHFR (CHO, Urlaub and Chasin, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n77: 4216 (1980)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, \nBiol. Reprod., \n23\n: \n243\n \n-251 (1980)); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (Mather et al., \nAnnals N.Y. Acad. Sci., \n383: 44-68 (1982)); MRC 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma cell line (Hep G2). Preferred host cells are human embryonic kidney 293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein are also useful host cells for the recombinant production of full length antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells are transfected and preferably transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors of this invention and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransfection refers to the taking up of an expression vector by a host cell whether or not any coding sequences are in fact expressed. Numerous methods of transfection are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, for example, CaPO\n4 \nprecipitation and electroporation. Successful transfection is generally recognized when any indication of the operation of this vector occurs within the host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformation means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride, as described in section 1.82 of Sambrook et al., supra, is generally used for prokaryotes or other cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers. Infection with \nAgrobacterium tumefaciens \nis used for transformation of certain plant cells, as described by Shaw et al., \nGene, \n23: 315 (1983) and WO 89/05859 published 29 Jun. 1989. For mammalian cells without such cell walls, the calcium phosphate precipitation method described in sections 16.30-16.37 of Sambrook et al., supra, is preferred. General aspects of mammalian cell host system transformations have been described by Axel in U.S. Pat. No. 4,399,216 issued 16 Aug. 1983. Transformations into yeast are typically carried out according to the method of Van Solingen et al., \nJ. Bact., \n130: 946 (1977) and Hsiao et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci\n. (\nUSA\n), 76: 3829 (1979). However, other methods for introducing DNA into cells such as by nuclear injection, electroporation, or by protoplast fusion may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nD. Culturing the Host Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProkaryotic cells used to produce the antibody or antibody fragment are cultured in suitable media as described generally in Sambrook et al., supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mammalian host cells used to produce the antibody or antibody fragment can be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host-cells. In addition, any of the media described in Ham and Wallace, \nMeth. Enz., \n58: 44 (1979), Barnes and Sato, \nAnal. Biochem., \n102: 255 (1980), U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; or 4,560,655; WO 90/03430; WO 87/00195; U.S. Pat. Re. No. 30,985; or U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,469, the disclosures of all of which are incorporated herein by reference, may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleosides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as Gentamycin™ drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe host cells referred to in this disclosure encompass cells in in vitro culture as well as cells that are within a host animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nE. Detecting Gene Amplification/Expression\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene amplification and/or expression may be measured in a sample directly, for example, by conventional Southern blotting, northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA (Thomas, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n77: 5201-5205 (1980)), dot blotting (DNA analysis), or in situ hybridization, using an appropriately labeled probe, based on the sequences provided herein. Various labels may be employed, most commonly radioisotopes, particularly \n32\nP. However, other techniques may also be employed, such as using biotin-modified nucleotides for introduction into a polynucleotide. The biotin then serves as the site for binding to avidin or antibodies, which may be labeled with a wide variety of labels, such as radionuclides, fluorescers, enzymes, or the like. Alternatively, antibodies may be employed that can recognize specific duplexes, including DNA duplexes, RNA duplexes, and DNA-RNA hybrid duplexes or DNA-protein duplexes. The antibodies in turn may be labeled and the assay may be carried out where the duplex is bound to a surface, so that upon the formation of duplex on the surface, the presence of antibody bound to the duplex can be detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene expression, alternatively, may be measured by immunological methods, such as immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections and assay of cell culture or body fluids, to quantitate directly the expression of gene product. With immunohistochemical staining techniques, a cell sample is prepared, typically by dehydration and fixation, followed by reaction with labeled antibodies specific for the gene product, where the labels are usually visually detectable, such as enzymatic labels, fluorescent labels, luminescent labels, and the like. A particularly sensitive staining technique suitable for use in the present invention is described by Hsu et al., \nAm. J. Clin. Path., \n75: 734-738 (1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nF. Purification of the Antibody or Antibody Fragment\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of a host cell secretion system, the antibody or antibody fragment is recovered from the culture medium. Alternatively, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, or produced in the periplasmic space of a bacterial host cell. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the host cells are lysed, and the resulting particulate debris is removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al., \nBio/Technology \n10:163-167 (1992) describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of \nE. coli\n. Briefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fe domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human (1, (2, or (4 heavy chains (Lindmark et al., \nJ. Immunol. Meth. \n62:1-13 (1983)). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human γ3 (Guss et al., \nEMBO J. \n5:15671575 (1986)). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX™ resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin Sepharose chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations (e.g. from about 0-0.25M salt).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG. Production of Antibody Fragments\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques have been developed for the production of the humanized antibody fragments of the invention, including Fab, Fab′, Fab′-SH, or F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., \nJournal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods \n24:107-117 (1992) and Brennan et al., \nScience, \n229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. For example, Fab′-SH fragments can be directly recovered from \nE. coli \nand chemically coupled to form F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments (Carter et al., \nBio/Technology, \n10:163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5. Uses of Anti-IL-8 Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA. Diagnostic Uses\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor diagnostic applications requiring the detection or quantitation of IL-8, the antibodies or antibody fragments of the invention typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety. The detectable moiety can be any one which is capable of producing, either directly or indirectly, a detectable signal. For example, the detectable moiety can be a radioisotope, such as \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, or \n125\nI; a fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, or luciferin; radioactive isotopic labels, such as, e.g., \n125\nI, \n32\nP, \n14\nC, or \n3\nH; or an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or horseradish peroxidase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny method known in the art for separately conjugating the antibody or antibody fragment to the detectable moiety can be employed, including those methods described by Hunter et al., \nNature \n144:945 (1962); David et al., \nBiochemistry \n13:1014 (1974); Pain et al., \nJ. Immunol. Meth. \n40:219 (1981); and Nygren, \nJ. Histochem. and Cytochem. \n30:407 (1982).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies and antibody fragments of the present invention can be employed in any known assay method, such as competitive binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays. For example, see Zola, \nMonoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques\n, pp. 147-158 (CRC Press, Inc., 1987).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetitive binding assays rely on the ability of a labeled standard (which can be a IL-8 or an immunologically reactive portion thereof) to compete with the test sample analyte (IL-8) for binding with a limited amount of antibody or antibody fragment. The amount of IL-8 in the test sample is inversely proportional to the amount of standard that becomes bound to the antibodies. To facilitate determining the amount of standard that becomes bound, the antibodies or antibody fragments generally are insolubilized before or after the competition, so that the standard and analyte that are bound to the antibodies can conveniently be separated from the standard and analyte which remain unbound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSandwich assays involve the use of two antibodies, each capable of binding to a different antigenic portion, or epitope, of the protein (IL-8) to be detected. In a sandwich assay, the test sample analyte is bound by a first antibody which is immobilized on a solid support, and thereafter a second antibody binds to the analyte, thus forming an insoluble three-part complex (U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110). The second antibody can itself be labeled with a detectable moiety (direct sandwich assays) or can be measured using an anti-immunoglobulin antibody that is labeled with a detectable moiety (indirect sandwich assay). For example, one type of sandwich assay is an ELISA assay, in which case the detectable moiety is an enzyme (e.g., horseradish peroxidase).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL-8 antibodies and antibody fragments also are useful for the affinity purification of IL-8 from recombinant cell culture or natural sources. For example, these antibodies can be fixed to a solid support by techniques well known in the art so as to purify IL-8 from a source such as culture supernatant or tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. Therapeutic Compositions and Administration of Anti-IL-8 Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe humanized anti-IL-8 antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention are useful in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, including inflammations of the lung, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and any stage of acute lung injury in the pathogenesis of ARDS described in Bernard et al., \nAm. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., \n149: 818-824 (1994), bacterial pneumonia, hypovolemic shock, ischemic reperfusion disorders such as surgical tissue reperfusion injury, myocardial ischemic conditions such as myocardial infarction, reperfusion after cardiac surgery, cardiac arrest, and constriction after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, inflammatory bowel disorders such is ulcerative colitis, and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the humanized anti-IL-8 antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention are useful in the treatment of asthmatic diseases, such as allergic asthma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic formulations of the humanized anti-IL-8 antibodies and antibody fragments are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody or antibody fragment having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers (\nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\n, supra), in the form of lyophilized cake or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as Tween. Pluronics or polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. The humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment ordinarily will be stored in lyophilized form or in solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe route of humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment administration is in accord with known methods, e.g., inhalation, injection or infusion by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial, or intralesional routes, by enema or suppository, or by sustained release systems as noted below. Preferably the antibody is given systemically or at a site of inflammation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides for the treatment of asthmatic diseases by administration of humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment to the respiratory tract. The invention contemplates formulations comprising humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment for use in a wide variety of devices that are designed for the delivery of pharmaceutical compositions and therapeutic formulations to the respiratory tract. In one aspect, humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment is administered in aerosolized or inhaled form. The humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment, combined with a dispersing agent, or dispersant, can be administered in an aerosol formulation as a dry powder or in a solution or suspension with a diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable dispersing agents are well known in the art, and include but are not limited to surfactants and the like. Surfactants are generally used in the art to reduce surface induced aggregation of protein caused by atomization of the solution forming the liquid aerosol. Examples of such surfactants include polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters and alcohols, and polyexyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters. Amounts of surfactants used will vary, being generally within the range of about 0.001 to 4% by weight of the formulation. In a specific aspect, the surfactant is polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate or sorbitan trioleate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid aerosol formulations contain the humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment and a dispersing agent in a physiologically acceptable diluent. The dry powder formulations of the invention consist of a finely divided solid form of the humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment and a dispersing agent, and optionally a bulking agent, such as lactose, sorbitol, sucrose, or mannotil, and the like, to facilitate dispersal of the powder. With either the liquid or dry powder aerosol formulation, the formulations must be aerosolized. It must be broken down into liquid or solid particles in order to ensure that the aerosolized dose actually reaches the bronchii and/or alveoli, as desired. For example, in the methods for treatment of asthma provided herein, it is preferable to deliver aerosolized humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment to the bronchii. In other embodiments, such as the present methods for treating ARDS and any stage of acute lung injury in the pathogenesis of ARDS, it is preferable to deliver aerosolized humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment to the alveoli. In general, the mass median dynamic diameter will be 5 micrometers (:m) or less to ensure that the drug particles reach the lung bronchii or alveoli (Wearly, L. L., 1991, Crit. Rev. in Ther. Drug Carrier Systems, 8:333).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to construction of the delivery device, any form of aerosolization known in the art, including but not limited to nebulization, atomization or pump aerosolization of a liquid formulation, and aerosolization of a dry powder formulation, can be used in the practice of the invention. A delivery device that is uniquely designed for administration of solid formulations is envisioned. Often, the aerosolization of a liquid or a dry powder formulation will require a propellent. The propellent can be any propellent generally used in the art. Examples of useful propellants include chlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and hydrocarbons, including trifluoromethane, dichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethanol, and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred aspect of the invention, the device for aerosolization is a metered dose inhaler. A metered dose inhaler provides a specific dosage when administered, rather than a variable dose depending on administration. Such a metered dose inhaler can be used with either a liquid or a dry powder aerosol formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSystems of aerosol delivery, such as the pressurized metered dose inhaler and the dry powder inhaler are disclosed in Newman, S. P., \nAerosols and the Lung\n, Clarke, S. W. and Davia, D. editors, pp. 197-22 and can be used in connection with the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSustained release systems can be used in the practice of the methods of the invention. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919, EP 58,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., \nBiopolymers \n22:547 (1983)), poly (2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (Langer et al., \nJ. Biomed. Mater. Res. \n15:167 (1981) and Langer, \nChem. Tech. \n12:98 (1982)), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra) or poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988). Sustained-release humanized anti-IL-8 antibody or antibody fragment compositions also include liposomally entrapped antibody or antibody fragment. Liposomes containing an antibody or antibody fragment are prepared by methods known per se: DE 3,218,121; Epstein et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n82:3688 (1985); Hwang et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n77:4030 (1980); EP 52,322; EP 36,676; EP 88,046; EP 143,949; EP 142,641; Japanese patent application 83-118008; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545; and EP 102,324. Ordinarily the liposomes are of the small (about 200-800 Angstroms) unilamelar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mole percent cholesterol, the selected proportion being adjusted for the most efficacious antibody or antibody fragment therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “effective amount” of the humanized anti-IL-8 antibody or antibody fragment to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic objectives, the route of administration, and the condition of the patient. Accordingly, it will be necessary for the therapist to titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. Typically, the clinician will administer the humanized anti-IL-8 antibody or antibody fragment until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the treatment and prevention of an inflammatory disorder or asthmatic disorder with a humanized anti-IL-8 antibody or antibody fragment of the invention, the antibody composition will be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the antibody, the particular type of antibody, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The “therapeutically effective amount” of antibody to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat the inflammatory disorder, including treating acute or chronic respiratory diseases and reducing inflammatory responses. Such amount is preferably below the amount that is toxic to the host or renders the host significantly more susceptible to infections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a general proposition, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of the antibody or antibody fragment administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of antibody used being 0.3 to 20 mg/kg/day, more preferably 0.3 to 15 mg/kg/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, using systemic administration, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount will be in the range of about 2 to 5 mg/kg/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor methods of the invention using administration by inhalation, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount will be in the range of about 1 microgram (:g)/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides for both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of inflammatory disorders. Without intending to limit the methods of the invention to a particular mechanism of action or a particular disease intervention strategy, it is noted that in some indications it is beneficial to treat the disease in question prior to or early on in the stage of the underlying disease that involves neutrophil activation, recruitment and infiltration at sites of inflammation. Accordingly, it may be advantageous to utilize the humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment in a prophylactic treatment regimen for an inflammatory disease indication in order to attenuate or eliminate a pathogenic neutrophil response that may or will arise during the course of the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn patients at risk of developing acute lung injury with possible or likely progression to ARDS, it is desirable to employ a prophylactic course of treatment in order to ameliorate or prevent the deterioration of lung function and the pathogenesis of associated disease sequelae (which may greatly increase patient morbidity and mortality) prior to the onset of such conditions. Certain biological parameters, such as IL-8 levels in bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and ferritin levels in serum, can be used for prognosis of acute lung injury and ARDS in patients who are predisposed to such disease progression, i.e. patients suffering from diseases or other insults that commonly precipitate acute lung injury and ARDS, such as aspiration, diffuse pulmonary infection, near-drowning, toxic inhalation, lung contusion, multiple trauma, pancreatitis, perforated bowel, sepsis, and the like. In one embodiment, acute lung injury and ARDS at-risk patients presenting BAL fluid IL-8 concentrations of at or above 0.2 ng/ml are selected for prophylactic treatment according to the methods of the invention. Any suitable method for assay of IL-8 in patient BAL fluid may be employed, such as the method described in Donnelly et al., \nLancet, \n341: 643-647 (1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, acute lung injury/ARDS at-risk female and male patients presenting ferritin serum concentrations of at or above 270 ng/ml and 680 ng/ml, respectively, are selected for prophylactic treatment according to the methods of the invention. Any suitable method for assay of ferritin in patient serum may be employed, such as the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,679,532 for “Serum Ferritin as a Predictor of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome” to Repine issued on Oct. 21, 1997.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn patients presenting ischemic conditions or undergoing surgical procedures that generate ischemic conditions in tissue and concomitant risk of tissue injury upon reperfusion, it is desirable to employ a course of treatment wherein the humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment is administered to the patient prior to the reperfusion of ischemic tissue, or prior to or as soon as possible after the onset of an inflammatory response following reperfusion of ischemic tissue. In the patients presenting acute myocardial infarction, for example, it is advantageous to employ a course of treatment wherein the humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment is administered to the patient prior to or concomitant with recanalization therapy, including pharmaceutical recanalization therapies such as the administration of tissue plasminogen activators, streptokinase, or other thrombolytic drugs with or without anti-clotting agents such as platelet-fibrin binding antagonists (e.g. anti-IIbIIa integrin antibody), blood thinning agents such as heparin, or other anti-reocclusion agents such as aspirin, and the like, and including mechanical recanalization therapies such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or wherein the humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment is administered to the patient prior to or as soon as possible after the onset of an inflammatory response following reperfusion of ischemic myocardium. In yet another embodiment, the humanized anti-IL-8 mAb or antibody fragment of the invention can be employed in the methods of treating acute myocardial infarction with anti-IL-8 antibody described in WO 97/40215 published Oct. 30, 1997.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides for both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of asthma with humanized anti-IL-8 mAb and antibody fragment. In the case of prophylactic treatment for allergic asthma with the antibodies or antibody fragments of the invention, it is desirable to administer about 0.1 to 10 mg/kg of the antibody agent to the patient up to about 24 hours prior to anticipated exposure to allergen or prior to onset of allergic asthma. In the case of therapeutic treatment for acute asthma, including allergic asthma, it is desirable to treat the asthmatic patient as early as possible following onset of an asthma attack. In one embodiment, an episode of acute asthma is treated within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms by administration of about 0.1 to 10 mg/kg of an anti-IL-8 antibody agent. However, it will be appreciated that the methods of the invention can be used to ameliorate symptoms at any point in the pathogenesis of asthmatic disease. Additionally, the methods of the invention can be used to alleviate symptoms of chronic asthmatic conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody or antibody fragment need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the inflammatory disorder or asthmatic disease in question. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, the antibody can be given in conjunction with a glucocorticosteroid. In the case of treating asthmatic diseases with anti-IL-8 antibody or antibody fragment, the invention contemplates the coadministration of antibody or antibody fragment and one or more additional agents useful in treating asthma, such as bronchodilators, antihistamines, epinephrine, and the like. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody or antibody fragment present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99% of the heretofore employed dosages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. The disclosures of all references cited in the specification, and the disclosures of all citations in such references, are expressly incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nA. Generation and Characterization of Monoclonal Antibodies Against Human IL-8\n\n\n \n \n \nBalb/c mice were immunized in each hind footpad or intraperitoneally with 10 :g of recombinant human IL-8 (produced as a fusion of (ser-IL-8)\n72 \nwith ubiquitin (Hebert et al. \nJ. Immunology \n145:3033-3040 (1990)); IL-8 is available commercially from PeproTech, Inc., Rocky Hill, N.J.) resuspended in MPL/TDM (Ribi Immunochem. Research Inc., Hamilton, Mont.) and boosted twice with the same amount of IL-8. In these experiments, “IL-8” is intended to mean (ser-IL-8)\n72 \nunless otherwise specified. A final boost of 10 μg of IL-8 was given 3 days before the fusion. Spleen cells or popliteal lymph node cells were fused with mouse myeloma P3X63Ag8U.1 (ATCC CRL1597), a non-secreting clone of the myeloma P3X63Ag8, using 35% polyethylene glycol as described before. Ten days after the fusion, culture supernatant was screened for the presence of monoclonal antibodies to IL-8 by ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ELISA was performed as follows. Nunc 96-well immunoplates (Flow Lab, McLean, Va.) were coated with 50 μl/well of 2 μg/ml IL-8 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4° C. The remaining steps were carried out at room temperature. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 hour (hr). Plates were then incubated with 50 :l/well of hybridoma culture supernatants from 672 growing parental fusion wells for 1 hr, followed by the incubation with 50 μl/well of 1:1000 dilution of a 1 mg/ml stock solution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Tago Co., Foster City, Calif.) for 1 hr. The level of enzyme-linked antibody bound to the plate was determined by the addition of 100:μ/well of 0.5 mg/ml of r-nitrophenyl phosphate in sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The color reaction was measured at 405 nm with an ELISA plate reader (Titertrek Multiscan, Flow Lab, McLean, Va.). Between each step, plates were washed three times in PBS containing 0.05\n% Tween\n 20.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCulture supernatants which promoted 4-fold more binding of IL-8 than did control medium were selected as positives. According to this criterion, 16 of 672 growing parental fusion wells (2%) were positive. These positive hybridoma cell lines were cloned at least twice by using the limiting dilution technique.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeven of the positive hybridomas were further characterized as follows. The isotypes of the monoclonal antibodies were determined by coating Nunc 96-well immunoplates (Flow Lab, McLean, Va.) with IL-8 overnight, blocking with BSA, incubating with culture supernatants followed by the addition of predetermined amount of isotype-specific alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Fisher Biotech, Pittsburgh, Pa.). The level of conjugated antibodies bound to the plate was determined by the addition of r-nitrophenyl phosphate as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll the monoclonal antibodies tested belonged to either IgG\n1 \nor IgG\n2 \nimmunoglobulin isotype. Ascites fluid containing these monoclonal antibodies had antibody titers in the range of 10,000 to 100,000 as determined by the reciprocal of the dilution factor which gave 50% of the maximum binding in the ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assess whether these monoclonal antibodies bound to the same epitopes, a competitive binding ELISA was performed. At a ratio of biotinylated mAb to unlabeled mAb of 1:100, the binding of biotinylated mAb 5.12.14 was significantly inhibited by its homologous mAb but not by mAb 4.1.3, while the binding of biotinylated mAb 4.1.3 was inhibited by mAb 4.1.3 but not by mAb 5.12.14. Monoclonal antibody 5.2.3 behaved similarly to mAb 4.1.3, while monoclonal antibodies 4.8 and 12.3.9 were similar to mAb 5.12.14. Thus, mAb 4.1.3 and mAb 5.2.3 bind to a different epitope(s) than the epitope recognized by monoclonal antibodies 12.3.9, 4.8 and 5.12.14.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunodot blot analysis was performed to assess antibody reactivity to IL-8 immobilized on nitrocellulose paper. All seven antibodies recognized IL-8 immobilized on paper, whereas a control mouse IgG antibody did not.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of these monoclonal antibodies to capture soluble \n125\nI-IL-8 was assessed by a radioimmune precipitation test (RIP). Briefly, tracer \n125\nI-IL-8 (4×10\n4 \ncpm) was incubated with various dilutions of the monoclonal anti-IL-8 antibodies in 0.2 ml of PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 (assay buffer) for 1 hr at room temperature. One hundred microliters of a predetermined concentration of goat anti-mouse Ig antisera (Pel-Freez, Rogers, Ark.) were added and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. Immune complexes were precipitated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 6% polyethylene glycol (M.W. 8000) kept at 4° C. After centrifugation at 2,000×g for 20 min at 4° C., the supernatant was removed by aspiration and the radioactivity remaining in the pellet was counted in a gamma counter. Percent specific binding was calculated as (precipitated cpm−background cpm)/(total cpm−background cpm). Monoclonal antibodies 4.1.3, 5.2.3, 4.8, 5.12.14 and 12.3.9 captured \n125\nI-IL-8 very efficiently, while antibodies 9.2.4 and 8.9.1 were not able to capture soluble \n125\nI-IL-8 in the RIP even though they could bind to IL-8 coated onto ELISA plates (Table 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dissociation constants of these monoclonal antibodies were determined using a competitive binding RIP assay. Briefly, competitive inhibition of the binding each antibody to \n125\nI-IL-8 (20,000-40,000 cpm per assay) by various amounts of unlabeled IL-8 was determined by the RIP described above. The dissociation constant (affinity) of each mAb was determined by using Scatchard plot analysis (Munson, et al., \nAnal. Biochem. \n107:220 (1980)) as provided in the VersaTerm-PRO computer program (Synergy Software, Reading, Pa.).The K\nd\n's of these monoclonal antibodies (with the exception of 9.2.4. and 8.9.1) were in the range from 2×10\n−8 \nto 3×10\n−10 \nM. Monoclonal antibody 5.12.14 with a K\nd \nof 3×10\n−10 \nM showed the highest affinity among all the monoclonal antibodies tested (Table 3).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacterization of Anti-IL-8 Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n% Specific Binding\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\nto IL-8\n\n\nK\nd\n(M)\n\n\nIsotype\n\n\npI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3\n\n\n58\n\n\n2 × 10\n−9\n \n\n\nIgG\n1\n \n\n\n4.3-6.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3\n\n\n34\n\n\n2 × 10\n−8\n \n\n\nIgG\n1\n \n\n\n5.2-5.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.4\n\n\n1\n\n\n—\n\n\nIgG\n1\n \n\n\n7.0-7.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.9.1\n\n\n2\n\n\n—\n\n\nIgG\n1\n \n\n\n6.8-7.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.8\n\n\n62\n\n\n3 × 10\n−8\n \n\n\nIgG\n2a\n \n\n\n6.1-7.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.12.14\n\n\n98\n\n\n3 × 10\n−10\n \n\n\nIgG\n2a\n \n\n\n6.2-7.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3.9\n\n\n86\n\n\n2 × 10\n−9\n \n\n\nIgG\n2a\n \n\n\n6.5-7.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assess the ability of these monoclonal antibodies to neutralize IL-8 activity, the amount of \n125\nI-IL-8 bound to human neutrophils in the presence of various amounts of culture supernatants and purified monoclonal antibodies was measured. Neutrophils were prepared by using Mono-Poly Resolving Medium (M-PRM) (Flow Lab. Inc., McLean, Va.). Briefly fresh, heparinized human blood was loaded onto M-PRM at a ratio of blood to medium, 3.5:3.0, and centrifuged at 300×g for 30 min at room temperature. Neutrophils enriched at the middle layer were collected and washed once in PBS. Such a preparation routinely contained greater than 95% neutrophils according to the Wright's Giemsa staining. The receptor binding assay was done as follows. 50 :l of \n125\nI-IL-8 (5 ng/ml) was incubated with 50:1 of unlabeled IL-8 (100 :g/ml) or monoclonal antibodies in PBS containing 0.1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was then incubated with 100:1 of neutrophils (10\n7 \ncells/ml) for 15 min at 37° C. The \n125\nI-IL-8 bound was separated from the unbound material by loading mixtures onto 0.4 ml of PBS containing 20% sucrose and 0.1% BSA and by centrifugation at 300×g for 15 min. The supernatant was removed by aspiration and the radioactivity associated with the pellet was counted in a gamma counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies 4.1.3, 5.2.3, 4.8, 5.12.14, and 12.3.9 inhibited greater than 85% of the binding of IL-8 to human neutrophils at a 1:25 molar ratio of IL-8 to mAb. On the other hand, monoclonal antibodies 9.2.4 and 8.9.1 appeared to enhance the binding of IL-8 to its receptors on human neutrophils. Since a control mouse IgG also enhanced the binding of IL-8 on neutrophils, the enhancement of IL-8 binding to its receptors by mAb 9.2.4 and 8.9.1 appears to be nonspecific. Thus, monoclonal antibodies, 4.1.3, 5.1.3, 4.8, 5.12.14, and 12.3.9 are potential neutralizing monoclonal antibodies while monoclonal antibodies 8.9.1 and 9.2.4 are non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of the anti-IL-8 antibodies to block neutrophil chemotaxis induced by IL-8 was tested as follows. Neutrophil chemotaxis induced by IL-8 was determined using a Boyden chamber method (Larsen, et al. \nScience \n243:1464 (1989)). One hundred μl of human neutrophils (10\n6 \ncells/ml) resuspended in RPMI containing 0.1% BSA were placed in the upper chamber and 29 μl of the IL-8 (20 nM) with or without monoclonal antibodies were placed in the lower chamber. Cells were incubated for 1 hr at 37° C. Neutrophils migrated into the lower chamber were stained with Wright's Giemsa stain and counted under the microscope (100× magnification). Approximately 10 different fields per experimental group were examined. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies 5.12.14 and 4.1.3 blocked almost 70% of the neutrophil chemotactic activity of IL-8 at 1:10 ratio of IL-8 to mAb.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe isoelectric focusing (IEF) pattern of each mAb was determined by applying purified antibodies on an IEF polyacrylamide gel (pH 3-9, Pharmacia) using the Fast gel system (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.). The IEF gel was pretreated with pharmalyte containing 1% Triton X100 (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) for 10 min before loading the samples. The IEF pattern was visualized by silver staining according to the instructions from the manufacturer. All of the monoclonal antibodies had different IEF patterns, confirming that they originated from different clones. The pI values for the antibodies are listed in Table 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll these monoclonal antibodies bound equally well to both (ala-IL-8)77 and (ser-IL-8)72 forms of IL-8. Because IL-8 has greater than 30% sequence homology with certain other members of the platelet factor 4 (PF4) family of inflammatory cytokines such as ∃-TG (Van Damme et al., \nEur. J. Biochem. \n181:337 (1989); Tanaka et al., \nFEB \n236(2):467 (1988)) and PF4 (Deuel et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n74:2256 (1977)), they were tested for possible cross reactivity to β-TG and PF4, as well as to another neutrophil activating factor, C5a. No detectable binding to any of these proteins was observed, with the exception of mAb 4.1.3, which had a slight cross reactivity to β-TG.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of the antibodies, mAb 5.12.14, was further studied to determine whether it could block the IL-8 mediated release of elastase by neutrophils. Briefly, human neutrophils were resuspended in Hanks balanced salt solution (Gibco, Grand Island, N.Y.) containing 1.0% BSA, Fraction V (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), 2 mg/ml alpha-D-glucose (Sigma), 4.2 mM sodium bicarbonate (Sigma) and 0.01 M HEPES, pH 7.1 (JRH Bioscience, Lenexa, Kans.). A stock of cytochalasin B (Sigma) was prepared (5 mg/ml in dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma) and stored at 2-8° C. Cytochalasin B was added to the neutrophil preparation to produce a final concentration of 5 :g/ml, and incubated for 15 min at 37° C. Human IL-8 was incubated with mAb 5.12.14 (20:1), or a negative control antibody, in 1 ml polypropylene tubes (DBM Scientific, San Fernando, Calif.) for 30 min at 37° C. The final assay concentrations of IL-8 were 50 and 500 nM. The monoclonal antibodies were diluted to produce the following ratios (IL-8:Mab): 1:50, 1:10, 1:2, 1:1, and 1:0.25. Cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils were added (100 μl/tube) and incubated for 2 hours at 25° C. The tubes were centrifuged (210×g, 2-8° C.) for 10 min, and supernatants were transferred to 96 well tissue culture plates (30 μl/well). Elastase substrate stock, 10 mM methoxysuccinyl-alanyl-alanyl-propyl-valyl-p-nitroanilide (Calbiochem, La Jolla, Calif.) in DMSO was prepared and stored at 2-8° C. Elastase substrate solution (1.2 mM substrate, 1.2 M NaCl (Mallinckrodt, Paris, Ky.), 0.12 M HEPES pH 7.2 in distilled water) was added (170 :l/well) to the supernatants and incubated for 0.5 to 2 hours at 37° C. (until control O.D. of 1.0 was reached). Absorbance was measured at 405 nm (SLT 340 ATTC plate reader, SLT Lab Instruments, Austria).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are shown in \nFIG. 1\n. At a 1:1 ratio of IL-8 to mAb 5.12.14, the antibody was able to effectively block the release of elastase from neutrophils.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hybridoma producing antibody 5.12.14 was deposited on Feb. 15, 1993 with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md., U.S.A. (ATCC) and assigned ATTC Accession No. HB 11553.\n\n\n \nB. Generation and Characterization of Monoclonal Antibodies Against Rabbit IL-8\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies against rabbit IL-8 were generated in essentially the same process as anti-human IL-8 antibodies using rabbit IL-8 as immunogen (kindly provided by C. Broaddus; see also Yoshimura et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n146:3483 (1991)). The antibody was characterized as described above for binding to other cytokines coated onto ELISA plates; no measurable binding was found to MGSA, fMLP, C5a, b-TG, TNF, PF4, or IL-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hybridoma producing antibody 6G4.2.5 was deposited on Sep. 28, 1994, with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md., U.S.A. (ATCC) and assigned ATTC Accession No. HB 11722.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant human-murine chimeric Fabs for 5.12.14 and 6G4.2.5 were constructed as described below. A chimeric 6G.4.25 Fab is compared with a chimeric 5.12.14 Fab in detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Inhibition of IL-8 Binding to Human Neutrophils by 5.12.14-Fab and 6G4 2.5-Fab\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of the two chimeric Fabs, 5.12.14-Fab and 6G4.2.5-Fab, to efficiently bind IL-8 and prevent IL-8 from binding to IL-8 receptors on human neutrophils was determined by performing a competition binding assay which allows the calculation of the IC\n50\n— concentration required to achieve 50% inhibition of IL-8 binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman neutrophils (5×10\n5\n) were incubated for 1 hour at 4° C. with 0.5 nM \n125\nI-IL-8 in the presence of various concentrations (0 to 300 nM) of 5.12.14-Fab, 6G4.2.5-Fab, an isotype control (4D5-Fab) or unlabeled IL-8. After the incubation, the unbound \n125\nI-IL-8 was removed by centrifugation through a solution of 20% sucrose and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline and the amount of \n125\nI-IL-8 bound to the cells was determined by counting the cell pellets in a gamma counter. \nFIG. 2\n demonstrates the inhibition of \n125\nI-IL-8 binding to neutrophils by unlabeled IL-8. \nFIG. 3\n demonstrates that a negative isotype matched Fab does not inhibit the binding of \n125\nI-IL-8 to human neutrophils. Both the anti-IL-8 Fabs, 5.12.14 Fab (\nFIG. 4\n) and 6G.4.25 Fab (\nFIG. 5\n) were able to inhibit the binding of \n125\nI-IL-8 to human neutrophils with an average IC\n50 \nof 1.6 nM and 7.5 nM, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Inhibition of IL-8-Mediated Neutrophil Chemotaxis by 5.12.14-Fab and 6G4.2.5-Fab\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman neutrophils were isolated, counted and resuspended at 5×10\n6 \ncells/ml in Hank's balanced salt solution (abbreviated HBSS; without calcium and magnesium) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The neutrophils were labeled by adding calcein AM (Molecular Probe, Eugene, Oreg.) at a final concentration of 2.0 μM. Following a 30 minute incubation at 37° C., cells were washed twice with HBSS-BSA and resuspended at 5×10\n6 \ncells/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemotaxis experiments were carried out in a Neuro Probe (Cabin John, Md.) 96-well chamber, model MBB96. Experimental samples (buffer only control, IL-8 alone or IL-8+Fabs) were loaded in a Polyfiltronics 96-well View plate (Neuro Probe Inc.) placed in the lower chamber. 100 μl of the calcein AM-labeled neutrophils were added to the upper chambers and allowed to migrate through a 5 micrometer porosity PVP free polycarbonate framed filter (Neuro Probe Inc.) toward the bottom chamber sample. The chemotaxis apparatus was then incubated for 40 to 60 minutes at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2\n. At the end of the incubation, neutrophils remaining in the upper chamber were aspirated and upper chambers were washed three times with PBS. Then the polycarbonate filter was removed, non-migrating cells were wiped off with a squeegee wetted with PBS, and the filter was air dried for 15 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe relative number of neutrophils migrating through the filter (Neutrophil migration index) was determined by measuring fluorescence intensity of the filter and the fluorescence intensity of the contents of the lower chamber and adding the two values together. Fluorescence intensity was measured with a CytoFluor 2300 fluorescent plate reader (Millipore Corp. Bedford, Mass.) configured to read a Corning 96-well plate using the 485-20 nm excitation filter and a 530-25 emission filter, with the sensitivity set at 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are shown in \nFIGS. 6 and 7\n. \nFIG. 6\n demonstrates the inhibition of human IL-8 mediated neutrophil chemotaxis by chimeric 6G4.2.5 and 5.12.14 Fabs. \nFIG. 7\n demonstrates the relative abilities of chimeric 6G4.2.5 and 5.12.14 Fabs to inhibit rabbit IL-8 mediated neutrophil chemotaxis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3. Inhibition of IL-8-Mediated Neutrophil Elastase Release by Various Concentrations of 6G4.2.5 and 5.12.14 Fabs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood was drawn from healthy male donors into heparinized syringes. Neutrophils were isolated by dextran sedimentation, centrifugation over Lymphocyte Separation Medium (Organon Teknika, Durham, N.C.), and hypotonic lysis of contaminating red blood cells as described by Berman et al. (\nJ. Cell Biochem. \n52:183 (1993)). The final neutrophil pellet was suspended at a concentration of 1×10\n7 \ncells/ml in assay buffer, which consisted of Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (GIBCO, Grand Island, N.Y.) supplemented with 1.0% BSA (fraction V, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), 2 mg/ml glucose, 4.2 mM sodium bicarbonate, and 0.01 M HEPES, pH 7.2. The neutrophils were stored at 4° C. for not longer than 1 hr.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL-8 (10 μl) was mixed with anti-IL-8 Fab, an isotype control Fab, or buffer (20 μl) in 1 ml polypropylene tubes and incubated in a 37° C. water bath for 30 min. IL-8 was used at final concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1000 nM in dose response studies (\nFIG. 8\n) and at a final concentration of 100 nM in the experiments addressing the effects of the Fabs on elastase release (\nFIGS. 9 and 10\n). Fab concentrations ranged from approximately 20 nM to 300 nM, resulting in Fab:IL-8 molar ratios of 0.2:1 to 3:1. Cytochalasin B (Sigma) was added to the neutrophil suspension at a concentration of 5:g/ml (using a 5 mg/ml stock solution made up in DMSO), and the cells were incubated for 15 min in a 37° C. water bath. Cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils (100 μl) were then added to the IL-8/Fab mixtures. After a 3 hr incubation at room temperature, the neutrophils were pelleted by centrifugation (200×g for 5 min), and aliquots of the cell-free supernatants were transferred to 96 well plates (30 μl/well). The elastase substrate, methoxysuccinyl-alanyl-alanyl-prolyl-valyl-p-nitroanilide (Calbiochem, La Jolla, Calif.), was prepared as a 10 mM stock solution in DMSO and stored at 4° C. Elastase substrate working solution was prepared just prior to use (1.2 mM elastase substrate, 1.2 M NaCl, 0.12 M HEPES, pH 7.2), and 170 μl was added to each sample-containing well. The plates were placed in a 37° C. tissue culture incubator for 30 min or until an optical density reading for the positive controls reached at least 1.0. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm using an SLT 340 plate reader (SLT Lab Instruments, Austria).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 9\n demonstrates the ability of the chimeric anti-IL-8 Fabs to inhibit elastase release from human neutrophils stimulated by human IL-8; \nFIG. 10\n demonstrates the relative abilities of the chimeric anti-IL-8 Fabs to inhibit elastase release from human neutrophils stimulated by rabbit IL-8.\n\n\n \nC. Molecular Cloning of the Variable Light and Heavy Regions of the Murine 5.12.14 (Anti-IL-8) Monoclonal Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nTotal RNA was isolated from 1×10\n8 \ncells (hybridoma cell line ATCC HB-11722) using the procedure described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (\nAnal. Biochem. \n162:156 (1987)). First strand cDNA was synthesized by specifically priming the mRNA with synthetic DNA oligonucleotides designed to hybridize with regions of the murine RNA encoding the constant region of the kappa light chain or the IgG2a heavy chain (the DNA sequence of these regions are published in \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest\n, Kabat, E. A. et al. (1991) NIH Publication 91-3242, V 1-3.). Three primers (SEQ ID NOS: 1-6) were designed for each of the light and heavy chains to increase the chances of primer hybridization and efficiency of first strand cDNA synthesis (\nFIG. 13\n). Amplification of the first strand cDNA to double-stranded (ds) DNA was accomplished using two sets of synthetic DNA oligonucleotide primers: one forward primer (SEQ ID NOS: 7-9) and one reverse primer (SEQ ID NO: 10) for the light chain variable region amplification (\nFIG. 14\n) and one forward primer (SEQ ID NOS: 11-14) and one reverse primer (SEQ ID NOS: 11, 15, 14 and 13) for the heavy chain variable region amplification (\nFIG. 15\n). The N-terminal sequence of the first eight amino acids of either the light or heavy chains of 5.12.14 was used to generate a putative murine DNA sequence corresponding to this region. (A total of 29 amino acids was sequenced from the N-terminus of both the light chain and heavy chain variable regions using the Edman degradation protein sequencing technique.) This information was used to design the forward amplification primers which were made degenerate in the third position for some codons to increase the chances of primer hybridization to the natural murine DNA codons and also included the unique restriction site, MluI for both the light chain variable region forward primer and the heavy chain variable region forward primer to facilitate ligation to the 3′ end of the STII element in the cloning vector. The reverse amplification primers were designed to anneal with the murine DNA sequence corresponding to a portion of the constant region of the light or heavy chains near the variable/constant junction. The light chain variable region reverse primer contained a unique BstBI restriction site and the heavy chain variable region reverse primer contained a unique ApaI restriction site for ligation to the 5′ end of either the human IgG1 constant light or IgG1 constant heavy regions in the vectors, pB13.1 (light chain) and pB14 (heavy chain). The polymerase chain reaction using these primer sets yielded DNA fragments of approximately 400 bp. The cDNA encoding the 5.12.14 light chain variable region was cloned into the vector pB13.1, to form pA51214VL and the 5.12.14 heavy chain variable region was cloned into the vector, pB14, to form pA51214VH. The cDNA inserts were characterized by DNA sequencing and are presented in the DNA sequence (SEQ ID NO: 16) and amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 17) of \nFIG. 16\n (murine light chain variable region) and in the DNA sequence (SEQ ID NO: 18) and amino acid (SEQ ID NO: 19) of \nFIG. 17\n (murine heavy chain variable region).\n\n\n \nD. Construction of a 5.12.14 Fab Vector\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the initial construct, pA51214VL, the amino acids between the end of the 5.12.14 murine light chain variable sequence and the unique cloning site, BstBI, in the human IgG1 constant light sequence were of murine origin corresponding to the first 13 amino acids of the murine IgG1 constant region (\nFIG. 16\n). Therefore, this plasmid contained a superfluous portion of the murine constant region separating the 5.12.14 murine light chain variable region and the human light chain IgG1 constant region. This intervening sequence would alter the amino acid sequence of the chimera and most likely produce an incorrectly folded Fab. This problem was addressed by immediately truncating the cDNA clone after A109 and re-positioning the BstBI site to the variable/constant junction by the polymerase chain reaction. \nFIG. 18\n shows the amplification primers used to make these modifications. The forward primer, VL.front (SEQ ID NO: 20), was designed to match the last five amino acids of the STII signal sequence, including the MluI cloning site, and the first 4 amino acids of the 5.12.14 murine light chain variable sequence. The sequence was altered from the original cDNA in the third position of the first two codons D1 (T to C) and I2 (C to T) to create a unique EcoRV cloning site which was used for later constructions. The reverse primer, VL.rear (SEQ ID NO: 21), was designed to match the first three amino acids of the human IgG1 constant light sequence and the last seven amino acids of the 5.12.14 light chain variable sequence which included a unique BstBI cloning site. In the process of adding the BstBI site, the nucleotide sequence encoding several amino acids were altered: L106 (TTG to CTT), K107 (AAA to CGA) resulting in a conservative amino acid substitution to arginine, and R108 (CGG to AGA). The PCR product encoding the modified 5.12.14 light chain variable sequence was then subcloned into pB13.1 in a two-part ligation. The MluI-BstBI digested 5.12.14 PCR product encoding the light chain variable region was ligated into MluI-BstBI digested vector to form the plasmid, pA51214VL′. The modified cDNA was characterized by DNA sequencing. The coding sequence for the 5.12.14 light chain is shown in \nFIG. 19\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, the DNA sequence between the end of the heavy chain variable region and the unique cloning site, ApaI, in the human IgG1 heavy chain constant domain of pA51214VH was reconstructed to change the amino acids in this area from murine to human. This was done by the polymerase chain reaction. Amplification of the murine 5.12.14 heavy chain variable sequence was accomplished using the primers shown in \nFIG. 18\n. The forward PCR primer (SEQ ID NO: 22) was designed to match nucleotides 867-887 in pA51214VH upstream of the STII signal sequence and the putative cDNA sequence encoding the heavy chain variable region and included the unique cloning site SpeI. The reverse PCR primer (SEQ ID NO: 23) was designed to match the last four amino acids of the 5.12.14 heavy chain variable sequence and the first six amino acids corresponding to the human IgG1 heavy constant sequence which also included the unique cloning site, ApaI. The PCR product encoding the modified 5.12.14 heavy chain variable sequence was then subcloned to the expression plasmid, pMHM24.2.28 in a two-part ligation. The vector was digested with SpeI-ApaI and the SpeI-ApaI digested 5.12.14 PCR product encoding the heavy chain variable region was ligated into it to form the plasmid, pA51214VH′. The modified cDNA was characterized by DNA sequencing. The coding sequence for the 5.12.14 heavy chain is shown in the DNA sequence (SEQ ID NO: 26) and amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 27) of \nFIGS. 20A-20B\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe first expression plasmid, pantiIL-8.1, encoding the chimeric Fab of 5.12.14 was made by digesting pA51214VH′ with EcoRV and \nBpuI\n 1021 to replace the EcoRV-\nBpuI\n 1021 fragment with a EcoRV-\nBpuI\n 1021 fragment encoding the murine 5.12.14 light chain variable region of pA51214VL′. The resultant plasmid thus contained the murine-human variable/constant regions of both the light and heavy chains of 5.12.14.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreliminary analysis of Fab expression using pantiIL-8.1 showed that the light and heavy chains were produced intracellularly but very little was being secreted into the periplasmic space of \nE. coli\n. To correct this problem, a second expression plasmid was constructed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe second expression plasmid, pantiIL-8.2, was constructed using the plasmid, pmy187, as the vector. Plasmid pantiIL-8.2 was made by digesting pmy187 with MluI and SphI and the MluI (partial)-SphI fragment encoding the murine 5.12.14 murine-human chimeric Fab of pantiIL-8.1 was ligated into it. The resultant plasmid thus contained the murine-human variable/constant regions of both the light and heavy chains of 5.12.14.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe plasmid pantiIL-8.2 was deposited on Feb. 10, 1995 with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md., U.S.A. (ATCC) and assigned ATTC Accession No. ATCC 97056.\n\n\n \nE. Molecular Cloning of the Variable Light and Heavy Regions of the Murine 6G4.2.5 Monoclonal Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nTotal RNA was isolated from 1×10\n8 \ncells (hybridoma cell line 6G4.2.5) using the procedure described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (\nAnal. Biochem. \n162:156 (1987)). First strand cDNA was synthesized by specifically priming the mRNA with synthetic DNA oligonucleotides designed to hybridize with regions of the murine RNA encoding the constant region of the kappa light chain or the IgG2a heavy chain (the DNA sequence of these regions are published in \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest\n, Kabat et al. (1991) NIH Publication 91-3242, V 1-3). Three primers (SEQ ID NOS: SEQ ID NOS: 1-6) were designed for each the light and heavy chains to increase the chances of primer hybridization and efficiency of first strand cDNA synthesis (\nFIG. 21\n). Amplification of the first strand cDNA to double-stranded (ds) DNA was accomplished using two sets of synthetic DNA oligonucleotide primers: one forward primer (SEQ ID NOS: 28-30) and one reverse primer (SEQ ID NO: 31) for the light chain variable region amplification (\nFIG. 22\n) and one forward primer (SEQ ID NOS: 32-33) and one reverse primer (SEQ ID NOS: 11, 15, 14 and 13) for the heavy chain variable region amplification (\nFIG. 23\n). The N-terminal sequence of the first eight amino acids of either the light or heavy chains of 6G4.2.5 was used to generate a putative murine DNA sequence corresponding to this region. (A total of 29 amino acids were sequenced from the N-terminus of both the light chain and heavy chain variable regions using the Edman degradation protein sequencing technique.) This information was used to design the forward amplification primers which were made degenerate in the third position for some codons to increase the chances of primer hybridization to the natural murine DNA codons and also included the unique restriction site, NsiI, for the light chain variable region forward primer and the unique restriction site, MluI, for the heavy chain variable region forward primer to facilitate ligation to the 3′ end of the STII element in the vector, pchimFab. The reverse amplification primers were designed to anneal with the murine DNA sequence corresponding to a portion of the constant region of the light or heavy chains near the variable/constant junction. The light chain variable region reverse primer contained a unique MunI restriction site and the heavy chain variable region reverse primer contained a unique ApaI restriction site for ligation to the 5′ end of either the human IgG1 constant light or IgG1 constant heavy regions in the vector, pchimFab. The polymerase chain reaction using these primer sets yielded DNA fragments of approximately 400 bp and were cloned individually into the vector, pchimFab, to form p6G425VL and p6G425VH. The cDNA inserts were characterized by DNA sequencing and are presented in the DNA sequence (SEQ ID NO: 34) and amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 35) of \nFIG. 24\n (murine light chain variable region) and the DNA sequence (SEQ ID NO: 36) and amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 37) of \nFIG. 25\n (murine heavy chain variable region).\n\n\n \nF. Construction of a 6G4.2.5 chimeric Fab Vector\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the initial construct, p6G425VL, the amino acids between the end of the 6G4.2.5 murine light chain variable sequence and the unique cloning site, MunI, in the human IgG1 constant light sequence were of murine origin. These amino acids must match the human IgG1 amino acid sequence to allow proper folding of the chimeric Fab. Two murine amino acids, D115 and S121, differed dramatically from the amino acids found in the loops of the β-strands of the human IgG1 constant domain and were converted to the proper human amino acid residues, V115 and F121, by site-directed mutagenesis using the primers (SEQ ID NOS: 38, 39, 40) shown in \nFIG. 26\n. These specific mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing and the modified plasmid named p6G425VL′. The coding sequence is shown in the DNA sequence (SEQ ID NO: 41) and amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 42) of \nFIGS. 27A-27B\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, the DNA sequence between the end of the heavy chain variable region and the unique cloning site, ApaI, in the human IgG1 heavy chain constant domain of p6G425VH was reconstructed to change the amino acids in this area from murine to human. This process was facilitated by the discovery of a BstEII site near the end of the heavy chain variable region. This site and the ApaI site were used for the addition of a synthetic piece of DNA encoding the corresponding IgG human amino acid sequence. The synthetic oligo-nucleotides shown in \nFIG. 26\n were designed as complements of one another to allow the formation of a 27 bp piece of ds DNA. The construction was performed as a three-part ligation because the plasmid, p6G425V11, contained an additional BstEII site within the vector sequence. A 5309 bp fragment of p6G425VH digested with MluI-ApaI was ligated to a 388 bp fragment carrying the 6G4.2.5 heavy chain variable region and a 27 bp synthetic DNA fragment encoding the first six amino acids of the human IgG1 constant region to form the plasmid, p6G425VH′. The insertion of the synthetic piece of DNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The coding sequence is shown in the DNA sequence (SEQ ID NO: 43) and amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 44) of \nFIGS. 28A-28B\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression plasmid, p6G425chim2, encoding the chimeric Fab of 6G4.2.5 was made by digesting p6G425chimVL′ with MluI and ApaI to remove the STII-murine HPC4 heavy chain variable region and replacing it with the MluI-ApaI fragment encoding the STII-murine 6G4.2.5 heavy chain variable region of p6G425chimVH′. The resultant plasmid thus contained the murine-human variable/constant regions of both the light and heavy chains of 6G4.2.5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe plasmid p6G425chim2 was deposited on Feb. 10, 1995 with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md., U.S.A. (ATCC) and assigned ATTC Accession No. 97055.\n\n\n \nG. Construction of Humanized Versions of Anti-IL-8 Antibody 6G4.2.5\n\n\n \n \n \nThe murine cDNA sequence information obtained from the hybridoma cell line, 6G4.2.5, was used to construct recombinant humanized variants of the murine anti-IL-8 antibody. The first humanized variant, F(ab)-1, was made by grafting synthetic DNA oligonucleotide primers encoding the murine CDRs of the heavy and light chains onto a phagemid vector, pEMX1 (Werther et al., \nJ. Immunol, \n157: 4986-4995 (1996)), which contains a human 6-subgroup I light chain and a human IgG1 subgroup III heavy chain (\nFIG. 29\n). Amino acids comprising the framework of the antibody that were potentially important for maintaining the conformations necessary for high affinity binding to IL-8 by the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) were identified by comparing molecular models of the murine and humanized 6G4.2.5 (F(ab)-1) variable domains using methods described by Carter et al., PNAS 89:4285 (1992) and Eigenbrot, et. al., J. Mol. Biol. 229:969 (1993). Additional humanized framework variants (F(ab) 2-9) were constructed from the information obtained from these models and are presented in Table 2 below. In these variants, the site-directed mutagenesis methods of Kunkel, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA\n), 82:488 (1985) were utilized to exchange specific human framework residues with their corresponding 6G4.2.5 murine counterparts. Subsequently, the entire coding sequence of each variant was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of each F(ab) variant was performed as previously described by Werther et. al., supra, with the exception that hen egg white lysozyme was omitted from the purification protocol. The variant antibodies were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, electrospray mass spectroscopy and amino acid analysis.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumanized 6G425 Variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC50\nc\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariant\n\n\nVersion\n\n\nTemplate\n\n\nChanges\na\n \n\n\nPurpose\nb\n \n\n\nMean\n\n\nS.D.\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF(ab)-1\n\n\n \nversion\n 1\n\n\n \n\n\nCDR Swap\n\n\n \n\n\n63.0\n\n\n12.3\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF(ab)-2\n\n\nversion 2\n\n\nF(ab)-1\n\n\nPheH67\n \n\n\npackaging w/ CDR H2\n\n\n106.0\n\n\n17.0\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF(ab)-3\n\n\nversion 3\n\n\nF(ab)-1\n\n\nArgH71\n \n\n\npackaging w/ CDRs H1, H2\n\n\n79.8\n\n\n42.2\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF(ab)-4\n\n\nversion 6\n\n\nF(ab)-1\n\n\nIleH69\n \n\n\npackaging w/ CDR H2\n\n\n44.7\n\n\n9.0\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF(ab)-5\n\n\nversion 7\n\n\nF(ab)-1\n\n\nLeuH78\n \n\n\npackaging w/ CDRs H1, H2\n\n\n52.7\n\n\n31.0\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF(ab)-6\n\n\nversion 8\n\n\nF(ab)-1\n\n\nIleH69\n \n\n\ncombine F(ab)-4 and -5\n\n\n34.6\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLeuH78\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nF(ab)-7\n\n\nversion 16\n\n\nF(ab)-6\n\n\nLeuH80\n \n\n\npackaging w/ CDR H1\n\n\n38.4\n\n\n9.1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF(ab)-8\n\n\nversion 19\n\n\nF(ab)-6\n\n\nArgH38\n \n\n\npackaging w/ CDR H2\n\n\n14.0\n\n\n5.7\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF(ab)-9\n\n\nversion 11\n\n\nF(ab)-6\n\n\nGluH6\n \n\n\npackaging w/ CDR H3\n\n\n19.0\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimeric\nd\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.4\n\n\n7.0\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF(ab)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrhu4D5\ne\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n>200:M\n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF(ab)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nAmino acid changes made relative to the template used.

When the purified F(ab) was tested for its ability to inhibit \n125\nI-IL-8 binding to human neutrophils according to the methods described in Section (B)(1) above, a 5.5 fold reduction in binding affinity was evident as shown in Table 4 above. Subsequent versions of F(ab)-1 were engineered to fashion the 3-dimensional structure of the CDR loops into a more favorable conformation for binding IL-8. The relative affinities of the F(ab) variants determined from competition binding experiments using human neutrophils as described in Section (B)(1) above are presented in Table 4 above. A slight decrease in IL-8 binding (<2 fold) was observed for F(ab)-2-3 while only slight increases in IL-8 binding were noted for F(ab)3-5. Variant F(ab)-6 had the highest increase in affinity for IL-8 (approximately 2 fold), exhibiting an IL-8 binding affinity of 34.6 nM compared to the F(ab)-11L-8 binding affinity of 63 nM. The substitutions of murine Leu for Ile at H69 and murine Ala for Leu at H78 are predicted to influence the packing of CDRs H1 and H2. Further framework substitutions using the F (ab)-6 variant as template were made to bring the binding affinity closer to that of the chimeric F(ab). In-vitro binding experiments revealed no change in affinity for F(ab)-7 (38.4 nM) but a significant improvement in affinity for F(ab)-8/9 of 14 nM and 19 nM, respectively. By analysis of a 3-D computer-generated model of the anti-IL-8 antibody, it was hypothesized that the substitution of murine Lys for Arg at H38 in F(ab)-8 influences CDR-H2 while a change at 1-16 of murine Gln for Glu in F(ab)-9 affects CDR-H3. Examination of the human antibody sequences with respect to amino acid variability revealed that the frequency of Arg at residue H38 is >99% whereas residue H6 is either Gln ˜20% or Glu ˜80% (Kabat et. al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. (1991)). Therefore, to reduce the likelihood of causing an immune response to the antibody, F(ab)-9 was chosen over F(ab)-8 for further affinity maturation studies. Variant F(ab)-9 was also tested for its ability to inhibit IL-8-mediated chemotaxis (\nFIG. 30\n). This antibody was able to block neutrophil migration induced by wild-type human IL-8, human monomeric IL-8 and Rhesus IL-8 with IC\n50\n=s of approximately 12 nM, 15 nM, and 22 nM, respectively, in IL-8 mediated neutrophil chemotaxis inhibition assays performed as described in Section (B)(2) above. The amino acid sequence for variant F(ab)-8 is provided in \nFIG. 31\n \nc\n. The F(ab)-8 was found to block human and rhesus IL-8-mediated chemotaxis with IC\n50\n=s of 12 nM and 10 nM, respectively, in IL-8 mediated neutrophil chemotaxis inhibition assays performed as described in Section (B)(2) above.\n\n\n \nH. Construction of an Anti-IL-8-Gene III Fusion Protein for Phage Display and Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis\n\n\n \n \n \nAn expression plasmid, pPh6G4.V11, encoding a fusion protein (heavy chain of the humanized 6G4.2.5 \nversion\n 11 antibody and the M13 phage gene-III coat protein) and the light chain of the humanized 6G4.2.5 \nversion\n 11 antibody was assembled to produce a monovalent display of the anti-IL-8 antibody on phage particles. The construct was made by digesting the plasmid, pFPHX, with EcoRV and ApaI to remove the existing irrelevant antibody coding sequence and replacing it with a 1305 bp EcoRV-ApaI fragment from the plasmid, p6G4.V11, encoding the humanized 6G4.2.5 \nversion\n 11 anti-IL-8 antibody. The translated sequence of the humanized 6G4.2.5 \nversion\n 11 heavy chain (SEQ ID NO: 52), peptide linker and gene III coat protein (SEQ ID NO: 53) is shown in \nFIG. 31A\n. The pFPHX plasmid is a derivative of phGHam-3 which contains an in-frame amber codon (TAG) between the human growth hormone and gene-III DNA coding sequences. When transformed into an amber suppressor strain of \nE. coli\n, the codon (TAG) is read as Glutamate producing a growth hormone (hGH)-gene III fusion protein. Likewise, in a normal strain of \nE. coli\n, the codon (TAG) is read as a stop preventing translational read-through into the gene-III sequence and thus allowing the production of soluble hGH. The pGHam-3 plasmid is described in \nMethods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology, \n3:205 (1991). The final product, pPh6G4.V11, was used as the template for the alanine scanning mutagenesis of the CDRs and for the construction of randomized CDR libraries of the humanized 6G4.V11 antibody.\n\n\n \nI. Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis of Humanized Antibody 6G4.2.5 \nVersion\n 11\n\n\n \n \n \nThe solvent exposed amino acid residues in the CDRs of the humanized anti-IL-8 6G4.2.5 \nversion\n 11 antibody (h6G4V11) were identified by analysis of a 3-D computer-generated model of the anti-IL-8 antibody. In order to determine which solvent exposed amino acids in the CDRs affect binding to interleukin-8, each of the solvent exposed amino acids was individually changed to alanine, creating a panel of mutant antibodies wherein each mutant contained an alanine substitution at a single solvent exposed residue. The alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed as described by Leong et. al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n269: 19343 (1994)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IC\n50\n's (relative affinities) of h6G4V11 wt and mutated antibodies were established using a Competition Phage ELISA Assay described by Cunningham et. al., (EMBO J. 13:2508 (1994)) and Lee et. al., (Science 270:1657 (1995)). The assay measures the ability of each antibody to bind IL-8 coated onto a 96-well plate in the presence of various concentrations of free IL-8 (0.2 to 1 uM) in solution. The first step of the assay requires that the concentrations of the phage carrying the wild type and mutated antibodies be normalized, allowing a comparison of the relative affinities of each antibody. The normalization was accomplished by titering the phage on the IL-8 coated plates and establishing their EC\n50\n. Sulfhydryl coated 96-well binding plates (Corning-Costar; Wilmington, Mass.) were incubated with a 0.1 mg/ml solution of K64C IL-8 (\nLysine\n 64 is substituted with Cysteine to allow the formation of a disulfide bond between the free thiol group of K64C IL-8 and the sulfhydryl coated plate, which results in the positioning of the IL-8 receptor binding domains towards the solution interface) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 6.5 containing 1 mM EDTA for 1 hour at 25° C. followed by three washes with PBS and a final incubation with a solution of PBS containing 1.75 mg/ml of L-cysteine-HCl and 0.1 M NaHCO\n3 \nto block any free reactive sulfhydryl groups on the plate. The plates were washed once more and stored covered at 4° C. with 200 ul of PBS/well. Phage displaying either the reference antibody, h6G4V11, or the mutant h6G4V11 antibodies were grown and harvested by PEG precipitation. The phage were resuspended in 500 \nul\n 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA and 100 mM NaCl and held at 4° C. for no longer than 3 hours. An aliquot of each phage was diluted 4-fold in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (BioRad, Richmond, Calif.) and 0.5% BSA RIA grade (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) (PBB) and added to IL-8 coated plates blocked for at least 2 hours at 25° C. with 50 mg/ml skim milk powder in 25 mM Carbonate Buffer pH 9.6. The phage were next serially diluted in 3 fold steps down the plate from well A through H. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at 25° C. followed by nine quick washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST). The plates were then incubated with a 1:3200 dilution of rabbit anti-phage antibody and a 1:1600 dilution of secondary goat-anti-rabbit Fc HRP-conjugated antibody for 15 minutes at 25° C. followed by nine quick washes with PBST. The plates were developed with 80 ul/well of 1 mg/ml OPD (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) in Citrate Phosphate buffer pH 5.0 containing 0.015% H\n2\nO\n2 \nfor 4 minutes at 25° C. and the reaction stopped with the addition of 40 ul of 4.5M H\n2\nSO\n4\n. The plates were analyzed at wavelength 8492 in a SLT model 340ATTC plate reader (SLT Lab Instruments). The individual EC\n50\n=s were determined by analyzing the data using the program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, Pa.) and a 4-parameter fit equation. The phage held at 4° C. were then immediately diluted in PBB to achieve a final concentration corresponding to their respective EC\n50 \nor target OD\n492 \nfor the competition segment of the experiment, and dispensed into a 96 well plate containing 4-fold serial dilutions of soluble IL-8 ranging from 1 uM in well A and ending with 0.2 uM in well H. Using a 12-channel pipet, 100 ul of the phage/IL-8 mixture was transferred to an IL-8 coated 96-well plate and executed as described above. Each sample was done in triplicate −3 columns/sample.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative Affinities (IC50) for Alanine-scan Anti-IL-8 6G4V11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR Mutants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDR\n\n\nAmino Acid Residue\n\n\nAvg IC50 (nM)\n\n\nStd Dev\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV11\n\n\nReference\n\n\n11.5\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDR-L1\n\n\nS26\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQ27\n\n\n10.2\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nS28\n\n\n14.2\n\n\n5.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nV30\n\n\n29.1\n\n\n12.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nH31\n\n\n580.3\n\n\n243.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nI33\n\n\n64.2\n\n\n14.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nN35\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nT36\n\n\n138.0\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nY37\n\n\nNDB\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDR-L2\n\n\nK55\n\n\n24.2\n\n\n14.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nV56\n\n\n15.5\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nS57\n\n\n12.4\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nN58\n\n\n17.6\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nR59\n\n\nnd\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDR-L3\n\n\nS96\n\n\n10.8\n\n\n4.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nT97\n\n\n70.6\n\n\n55.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nH98\n\n\n8.0\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nV99\n\n\n19.6\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDR-H1\n\n\nS28\n\n\n8.6\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nS30\n\n\nnd\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nS31\n\n\n7.8\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nH32\n\n\n13.3\n\n\n5.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nY53\n\n\n48.2\n\n\n15.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDR-H2\n\n\nY50\n\n\n35.6\n\n\n13.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nD52\n\n\n13.3\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nS53\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nN54\n\n\n96.0\n\n\n5.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nE56\n\n\n15.8\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nT57\n\n\n8.4\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nT58\n\n\n11.3\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nY59\n\n\n9.1\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQ61\n\n\n12.6\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nK64\n\n\n18.5\n\n\n12.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDR-H3\n\n\nD96\n\n\nNDB\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nY97\n\n\nNDB\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nR98\n\n\n36.6\n\n\n15.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nY99\n\n\n199.5\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nN100\n\n\n278.3\n\n\n169.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nD102\n\n\n159.2\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nW103\n\n\nNDB\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nF104\n\n\nNDB\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nF105\n\n\n209.4\n\n\n72.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nD106\n\n\n25.3\n\n\n21.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEach sample performed in triplicate/experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNDB = No Detectable Binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nnd = value not determined*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResidue numbering is according to Kabat et al.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the alanine-scan are summarized in Table 5 above. The alanine substitutions in of many of the mutant antibodies had little or no adverse effects (<3 fold) on the binding affinity for IL-8. Mutants that were found to exhibit no detectable binding of IL-8 (NDB) presumably contained disruptions in the conformational structure of the antibody conferred by crucial structural or buried amino acids in the CDR. Based on the results of the scan, CDR-H3 (heavy chain, 3rd CDR) was identified as the dominant binding epitope for binding IL-8. Alanine substitutions in this CDR resulted in a 3 to >26 fold decrease in binding affinity. The amino acids, Y597, Y599 and D602 are of particular interest because it was determined from the computer generated model of the anti-IL-8 antibody that these residues are solvent exposed and that these residues might participate in hydrogen bonding or charge interactions with IL-8 or other amino acids of the antibody that influence either binding to IL-8 or the conformation of the CDR-H3 loop structure. (See the model depicted in \nFIG. 32\n). Unexpected increases in binding affinity (1.8>2.7 fold) were noted for S528 and S531 of CDR-H1 and S553 of CDR-H2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly, a significant increase in binding affinity was observed in the alanine mutant N35A located in CDR-L1 (light chain, 1st CDR). A 3-6 fold increase in affinity was observed compared to the wild-type h6G4V11 antibody. This augmentation of IL-8 binding could be the result of the close proximity of N35A to CDR-H3. The alanine substitution may have imparted a slight change in the conformation of CDR-L1 which alters the packing interaction of neighboring amino acid residues on CDR-H3, thereby tweaking the loop of CDR-H3 into a conformation that facilitates more appropriate contacts with IL-8. Similarly, N35A may also influence the orientation of amino acids in CDR-L1 or its interaction directly with IL-8. Unexpected increases in affinity (˜2 fold) were also observed for S26 of CDR-L1 and H98 of CDR-L3.\n\n\n \nJ. Characterization of Humanized Anti-IL-8 Antibody 6G4V11N35A\n\n\n \n \n \nSoluble 6G4V11N35A Fab antibody was made by transforming an amber non-suppressor strain of \nE. coli, \n34B8, with pPh6G4.V11 and growing the culture in low phosphate medium for 24 hours. The periplasmic fraction was collected and passed over a Hi-Trap Protein-G column (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) followed by a desalting and concentration step. The protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. The protein had the correct size and amino acid composition (\nFIG. 35\n). The 6G4V11N35A Fab was tested for its ability to inhibit \n125\nI-IL-8 binding to human neutrophils and to inhibit IL-8 mediated neutrophil chemotaxis as described in Section (B)(1) and (B)(2) above. As shown in \nFIG. 33\n, hybridoma-derived intact murine antibody (6G4 murine mAB), recombinant 6G4 murine-human chimera Fab, recombinant humanized \n \nFab versions\n \n 1 and 11, and 6G4V11N35A Fab were found to inhibit \n125\nI-IL-8 binding to human neutrophils with an average IC\n50 \nof 5 nM, 8 nM, 40 nM, 10 nM and 3 nM, respectively. The 6G4V11N35A Fab had at least a 2-fold higher affinity than the 6G4.2.5 chimera Fab and a 3-fold higher affinity than 6G4V11. As shown in \nFIG. 34\n, the 6G4V11N35A Fab was found to inhibit IL-8 mediated neutrophil chemotaxis induced by both wild type and monomeric human IL-8, and by two different animal species of IL-8, namely, rabbit and rhesus. The irrelevant isotype control Fab (4D5) did not inhibit neutrophil migration. The average IC\n50 \nvalues were 3 nM (wt IL-8), 1 nM (monomeric IL-8), 5 nM (Rabbit IL-8), and 10 nM (Rhesus IL-8).\n\n\n \nK. Construction of a 6G4V11N35A F(ab′)\n2 \nLeucine Zipper\n\n\n \n \n \nProduction of a F(ab′)\n2 \nversion of the humanized anti-IL-8 6G4V11N35A Fab was accomplished by constructing a fusion protein with the yeast GCN4 leucine zipper. The expression plasmid p6G4V11N35A.F(ab′)\n2 \nwas made by digesting the plasmid p6G425chim2.fab2 with the restriction enzymes bsaI and apaI to remove the DNA sequence encoding the 6G4.2.5 murine-human chimeric Fab and replacing it with a 2620 bp bsaI-apaI fragment from pPh6G4.V11N35A. The plasmid p6G425chim2.fab2 is a derivative of pS1130 which encodes a fusion protein (the GCN4 leucine zipper fused to the heavy chain of anti-CD18) and the light chain of anti-CD18 antibody. The expression plasmid p6G4V11N35A.F(ab′)\n2 \nwas deposited on Feb. 20, 1996 with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md., U.S.A. (ATCC) and assigned ATCC Accession No. 97890. A pepsin cleavage site in the hinge region of the antibody facilitates the removal of the leucine zipper leaving the two immunoglobin monomers joined by the cysteines that generate the interchain disulfide bonds. The DNA and protein sequence of the h6G4V11N35A.F(ab′)\n2 \nare depicted in \nFIGS. 35-37\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn expression host cell was obtained by transforming \nE. coli \nstrain 49D6 with p6G4V11N35A.F(ab′)\n2 \nessentially as described in Section (II)(3)(C) above. The transformed host \nE. coli \n49D6 (p6G4V11N35A.F(ab′)\n2\n) was deposited on Feb. 20, 1997 at the ATCC and assigned ATCC Accession No. 98332. Transformed host cells were grown in culture, and the 6G4V11N35A F(ab′)\n2 \nproduct was harvested from the host cell periplasmic space essentially as described in Section (II)(3)(F) above.\n\n\n \nL. Characterization of the Humanized 6G4V11N35A F(ab′)\n2 \nLeucine Zipper\n\n\n \n \n \nThe 6G4V11N35A Fab and F(ab′)\n2 \nwere tested for their ability to inhibit \n125\nI-IL-8 binding to neutrophils according to the procedures described in Section (B)(1) above. The displacement curves from a representative binding experiment performed in duplicate is depicted in \nFIG. 38\n. Scatchard analysis of this data shows that 6G4V11N35A F(ab′)\n2 \ninhibited \n125\nI-IL-8 binding to human neutrophils with an average IC\n50 \nof 0.7 nM (+/−0.2). This is at least a 7 fold increase in affinity compared to the hybridoma-derived intact murine antibody (average IC\n50 \nof 5 nM) and at least a 2.8 fold increase in affinity over the Fab version (average IC\n50 \nof 2 nM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 6G4V11N35A F(ab′)\n2 \nwas also tested for its ability to inhibit IL-8 mediated neutrophil chemotaxis according to the procedures described in Section (B)(2) above. The results of a representative chemotaxis experiment performed in quadruplicate are depicted in \nFIG. 39\n. As shown in \nFIG. 39\n, the 6G4V11N35A F(ab′)\n2 \ninhibited human IL-8 mediated neutrophil chemotaxis. The 6G4V11N35A F(ab′)\n2 \nexhibited an average IC\n50 \nvalue of 1.5 nM versus 2.7 nM for the 6G4V11N35A Fab, which represents an approximately 2 fold improvement in the antibody's ability to neutralize the effects of IL-8. The irrelevant isotype control Fab (4D5) did not inhibit neutrophil migration. Furthermore, the 6G4V11N35A F(ab′)\n2 \nantibody retained its ability to inhibit IL-8 mediated neutrophil chemotaxis by monomeric IL-8 and by two different animal species of IL-8, namely rabbit and rhesus, in neutrophil chemotaxis experiments conducted as described above. An individual experiment is shown in \nFIG. 40\n. The average IC\n50 \nvalues were 1 nM (monomeric IL-8), 4 nM (Rabbit IL-8), and 2.0 nM (Rhesus IL-8).\n\n\n \nM. Random Mutagenesis of Light Chain Amino acid (N35A) in CDR-L1 of Humanized Antibody 6G4V11\n\n\n \n \n \nA 3-fold improvement in the IC\n50 \nfor inhibiting \n125\nI-IL-8 binding to human neutrophils was observed when alanine was substituted for asparagine at \nposition\n 35 in CDR-L1 (light chain) of the humanized 6G4V11 mAb as described in Section (I) above. This result might be attributed to an improvement in the contact between the antigen-antibody binding interfaces as a consequence of the replacement of a less bulky nonpolar side chain (R-group) that may have altered the conformation of CDR-L1 or neighboring CDR-H3 (heavy chain) to become more accessible for antigen docking. The acceptance of alanine at \nposition\n 35 of CDR-L1 suggested that this position contributed to improved affinity and that an assessment of the re-modeling of CDR loops/antigen-binding region(s) by other amino acids at this location was warranted. Selection of an affinity matured version of the humanized 6G4.V11 mAB (Kunkel, T. A., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n82:488 (1995)) was accomplished by randomly mutagenizing \nposition\n 35 of CDR-L1 and constructing an antibody-phage library. The codon for Asparagine (N) at \nposition\n 35 of CDR-L1, was targeted for randomization to any of the 20 known amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInitially, a stop template, pPh6G4.V11-stop, was made to eliminate contaminating wild-type N35 sequence from the library. This was accomplished by performing site-directed mutagenesis (Muta-Gene Kit, Biorad, Ricmond, Calif.) of pPH6G4V11 (described in Section (H) above) to replace the codon (AAC) for N35 with a stop codon (TAA) using the primer SL.97.2 (SEQ ID NO:63)(\nFIG. 42\n). The incorporation of the stop codon was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Subsequently, uracil containing single-stranded DNA derived from \nE. coli \nCJ236 transformed with the stop template was used to generate an antibody-phage library following the method described by Lowman (\nMethods in Molecular Biology, \n87 Chapter 25:1-15 (1997). The variants generated from this library were predicted to produce a collection of antibodies containing one of the 20 known amino acids at position N35 in CDR-L1. The amino acid substitutions were accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis using the degenerate oligonucleotide primer (SL.97.3) with the sequence NNS(N=A/G/T/C; S=G/C;) (SEQ ID NO: 64) (\nFIG. 42\n). This codon usage should allow for the expression of any of the 20 amino acids—including the amber stop codon (TAG). The collection of antibody-phage variants was transfected into \nE. coli \nstrain XL-1 blue (Stratagene, San Diego, Calif.) by electroporation and grown at 37° C. overnight to amplify the library. Selection of tight binding humanized 6G4V11 Fab's were accomplished by panning the library on IL-8 coated 96-well plates as described in Section (I) above. Prior to panning, the number of phage/library was normalized to 1.1×10\n13 \nphage/ml (which produces a maximum OD\n270 \nreading=1 OD unit) and IL-8 coated plates were incubated with blocking solution (25 mN Carbonate buffer containing 50 mg/ml skim milk) for 2 hours before the addition of phage (each sort used eight IL-8 coated wells/library). After the blocking and washing steps, every sort began with the addition of 100 ul of antibody-phage (titered at 1.1×10\n13 \nphage/ml) to each of eight IL-8 coated wells followed by an 1 hour incubation at 25° C. The non-specifically bound antibody-phage were removed by 10 quick washes with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-Tween). For \nsort #\n1, a low stringency wash (100 ul PBS-Tween/well for 10 minutes at 25° C.) was employed to capture the small proportion of tight binding antibody-phage bound to the immobilized IL-8. The antibody-phage variants specifically bound to IL-8 were eluted with 100 ul/well of 200 mM Glycine pH 2.0 for 5 minutes at 25° C. The eluted antibody-phage variants from the 8 wells were then pooled and neutralized with 1M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (⅓ the elution volume). The phage were titered and propagated as described in Section (I) above. The stringency of the washes were successively increased with each round of panning depending upon the percent recovery of phage at the end of a sort. The wash conditions were as follows: sort #2 (4×15 minute intervals; total time=60 minutes) and sort #3 (either #3a: 8×15 minute intervals or #3b: 12×10 minute intervals; total time=120 minutes). The total number of phage recovered was progressively reduced after each sort suggesting that non- or weak-binders were being selected against. The recovery of the negative control (the antibody-phage stop variant) was constant throughout the panning (approximately 0.0001 to 0.00001 percent).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEighteen random variants from \nsort #\n3 were analyzed by DNA sequencing to look for an amino acid consensus at \nposition\n 35 of CDR-L1. The data presented in \nFIG. 43A\n showed that Glycine occupied \nposition\n 35 in 33% of the variants sequenced. However, after correcting for the number of NNS codon combinations/amino acid, the frequency of Glycine was reduced to 16.6%. Glutamic Acid was represented with the highest frequency (22%) followed by Aspartic Acid and Glycine (16.6%). The frequencies of recovery of the wild-type Asparagine and substituted Alanine were only 5.6%. Interestingly, the high frequency of Glycine may suggest that a much wider range of conformations might be allowed for the loop of CDR-L1 which may be attributed to the reduction in steric hindrance of bond angle (φ-ψ) pairing as a result of the single hydrogen atom as the side chain. Conversely, Glutamic Acid at \nposition\n 35 might restrict the flexibility of the loop by imposing less freedom of rotation imposed by the more rigid and bulky charged polar side chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSoluble Fab's of the affinity matured variants (N35G, N35D, N35E and N35A) were made as described in Section (J) above for evaluating their ability to block IL-8 binding. As shown in \nFIG. 43B\n, variants N35A, N35D, N35E and N35G were found to inhibit \n125\nI-IL-8 binding to human neutrophils with an approximate IC\n50 \nof 0.2 nM, 0.9 nM, 0.1 nM and 3.0 nM, respectively. All of the affinity matured variants showed an improvement in binding IL-8 ranging from 3-100 fold compared to the humanized 6G4V11 mAb. The affinity-matured variant, 6G4V11N35E, was 2-fold more potent in blocking IL-8 binding to human neutrophils than the alanine-scan variant, 6G4V11N35A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEquilibrium and kinetic measurements of variants 6G4V11N35A and 6G4V11N35E were determined using KinEXA™ automated immunoassay system (Sapidyne Instruments Inc., Id. City, Id.) as described by Blake et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n271: 27677 (1996). The procedure for preparing the antigen-coated particles was modified as follows: 1 ml of activated agarose beads (Reacti-Gel 6X; Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) were coated with antigen in 50 mM Carbonate buffer pH 9.6 containing 20 ug/ml of human IL-8 and incubated with gentle agitation on a rocker overnight at 25° C. The IL-8 coated beads were then washed twice with 1M Tris-HCl pH 7.5 to inactivate any unreactive groups on the beads and blocked with Superblock (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) for 1 hour at 25° C. to reduce non-specific binding. The beads were resuspended in assay buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) to a final volume of 30 ml. A 550 ul aliquot of the IL-8 coated bead suspension was used each time to pack a fresh 4 mm high column in the KinEXA observation cell. The amount of unbound antibody from the antibody-antigen mixtures captured by the IL-8-coated beads in both the equilibrium and kinetic experiments was quantified using a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. Murine 6G4.2.5 was detected with a R-PE AffiniPure F(ab′)\n2 \ngoat anti-mouse IgG, Fc fragment specific 2° antibody (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.) and humanized affinity matured N35A (Fab and F(ab′)\n2\n) and N35E Fab were detected with a R-PE AffiniPure F(ab′)\n2 \ndonkey anti-human IgG (H+L) 2° antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.); both at a 1:1000 dilution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEquilibrium measurements were determined by incubating a constant amount of anti-IL-8 antibody (0.005 ug/ml) with various concentrations of human IL-8 (0, 0.009, 0.019, 0.039, 0.078, 0.156, 0.312, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5 nM). The antibody-antigen mixture was incubated for 2 hours at 25° C. to allow the molecules to reach equilibrium. Subsequently, each sample was passed over a naive IL-8 coated bead pack in the KinEXA observation cell at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/minute for a total of 9 minutes/sample. The equilibrium constant (Kd) was calculated using the software provided by Sapidyne Instruments Inc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRates of association (ka) and dissociation (kd) were determined by incubating together a constant amount of antibody and antigen, and measuring the amount of uncomplexed anti-IL-8 bound to the IL-8 coated beads over time. The concentration of antibody used in the kinetic experiments was identical to that used in the equilibrium experiment described above. Generally, the amount of human IL-8 used was the concentration derived from the binding curves of the equilibrium experiment that resulted in 70% inhibition of anti-IL-8 binding to the IL-8 coated beads. Measurements were made every 15 minutes to collect approximately nine data points. The ka was calculated using the software provided by Sapidyne Instruments, Inc. The off rate was determined using the equation: kd=Kd/ka.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 44\n shows the equilibrium constants (Kd) for the affinity matured variants 6G4V11N35E and 6G4V11N35A Fab's were approximately 54 pM and 114 pM, respectively. The improvement in affinity of 6G4V11N35E Fab for IL-8 can be attributed to a 2-fold faster rate of association (K\non\n) of 4.7×10\n6 \nfor 6G4V11N35E Fab versus 2.0×10\n6 \nfor 6G4V11N35A F(ab′)\n2\n. (The Kd of the 6G4V11N35A F(ab′)2 and 6G4V11N35A Fab are similar.) The dissociation rates (K\noff\n) were not significantly different. Molecular modeling suggests that substitution of Aspargine with Glutamic Acid might either affect the antibody's interaction with IL-8 directly or indirectly by neutralizing the charge of neighboring residues R98 (CDR-H3) or K50 (CDR-L2) in the CDR's to facilitate contact with IL-8. Another effect might be the formation of a more stable loop conformation for CDR-L1 that could have facilitated more appropriate contacts of other CDR-L1 loop residues with IL-8. The DNA (SEQ ID NO: 65) and amino acid (SEQ ID NO:62) sequences of p6G4V11N35E.Fab showing the Asparagine to Glutamic Acid substitution in the light chain are presented in \nFIG. 45\n.\n\n\n \nN. Characterization of Humanized Anti-IL-8 Variant 6G4V11N35E Fab\n\n\n \n \n \nThe affinity matured Fab variant, 6G4V11N35E, was tested for its ability to inhibit IL-8 mediated neutrophil chemotaxis as described in Section (B)(2) above. The reuseable 96-well chemotaxis chamber described in Section (B)(2) was replaced with endotoxin-free disposable chemotaxis chambers containing 5-micron PVP-free polycarbonate filters (ChemoTx101-5, Neuro Probe, Inc. Cabin John, Md.). As illustrated in \nFIG. 46\n, variant N35E effectively blocks IL-8 mediated neutrophil chemotaxis induced by a 2 nM stimulus of either rabbit or human IL-8. In fact, the level of inhibition at antibody concentrations between 3.7 nM-33 nM was not significantly different from the buffer control indicating variant N35E could completely inhibit this response. The IC\n50\n's for both rabbit and human IL-8 were approximately 2.8 nM and 1.2 nM, respectively. The irrelevant isotype control Fab (4D5) did not inhibit neutrophil migation indicating the results observed for the affinity matured variant, N35E, is IL-8 specific.\n\n\n \nO. Construction of humanized 6G4V11N35E F(ab′)\n2 \nLeucine Zipper\n\n\n \n \n \nA F(ab′)\n2 \nexpression plasmid for 6G4V11N35E was constructed using methods similar to those described in Section (K) above. The expression plasmid, p6G4V11N35E.F(ab′)\n2\n, was made by digesting the plasmid p6G4V11N35A.F(ab′)\n2 \n(described in Section (K) above) with the restriction enzymes ApaI and NdeI to isolate a 2805 bp fragment encoding the heavy chain constant domain—GCN4 leucine zipper and ligating it to a 3758 bp ApaI-NdeI fragment of the pPH6G4V11N35E phage display clone (encoding 6G4V11N35E Fab) obtained as described in Section (M) above. The integrity of the entire coding sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing.\n\n\n \nP. Construction of the full length humanized 6G4V11N35A IgG Expression Plasmid\n\n\n \n \n \nThe full length IgG\n1 \nversion of the humanized anti-IL8 variant 6G4V11N35A was made using a dicistronic DHFR-Intron expression vector (Lucas et al., \nNucleic Acids Res., \n24: 1774-1779 (1996)) which contained the full length recombinant murine-human chimera of the 6G4.2.5 anti-IL8 mAb. The expression plasmid encoding the humanized variant 6G4V11N35A was assembled as follows. First an intermediate plasmid (pSL-3) was made to shuttle the sequence encoding the variable heavy chain of humanized anti-IL-8 variant 6G4V11N35A to pRK56G4chim.2Vh—which contains the variable heavy region of the chimeric 6G4.5 anti-IL8 antibody. The vector pRK56G4chim.Vh was digested with PvuII and ApaI to remove the heavy chain variable region of the chimeric antibody and religated with an 80 bp PvuII-XhoI synthetic oligonucleotide (encoding Leu4 to Phe29 of 6G4V11N35A) (\nFIG. 47\n) and a 291 bp XhoI-ApaI fragment from p6G4V11N35A.7 carrying the remainder of the variable heavy chain sequence of 6G4V11N35A to create pSL-3. This intermediate plasmid was used in conjunction with 2 other plasmids, p6G4V11N35A.F(ab′)\n2 \nand p6G425chim2.choSD, to create the mammalian expression plasmid, p6G4V11N35AchoSD.9 (identified as p6G425V11N35A.choSD in a deposit made on Dec. 16, 1997 with the ATCC and assigned ATCC Accession No. 209552). This expression construct was assembled in a 4-part ligation using the following DNA fragments: a 5,203 bp ClaI-BipI fragment encoding the regulatory elements of the mammalian expression plasmid (p6G425 chim2.choSD), a 451 bp ClaI-ApaI fragment containing the heavy chain variable region of the humanized 6G4V11N35A antibody (pSL-3), a 1,921 bp ApaI-EcoRV fragment carrying the heavy chain constant region of 6G4V11N35A (p6G425chim2.choSD) and a 554 bp EcoRV-BlpI fragment encoding the light chain variable and constant regions of 6G4V11N35A (p6G4V11N35A.F(ab′)\n2\n). The DNA sequence (SEQ ID NO: 68) of clone p6G4V11N35A.choSD.9 was confirmed by DNA sequencing and is presented in \nFIG. 48\n.\n\n\n \nQ. Construction of the full length humanized 6G4V11N35E IgG Expression Plasmid\n\n\n \n \n \nA mammalian expression vector for the humanized 6G4V11N35E was made by swapping the light chain variable region of 6G4V11N35A with 6G4V11N35E as follows: a 7,566 bp EcoRV-BlpI fragment (void of the 554 bp fragment encoding the light chain variable region of 6G4V11N35A) from p6G4V11N35A.choSD.9 was ligated to a 554 bp EcoRV-BlpI fragment (encoding the light chain variable region of 6G4V11N35E) from pPH6G4V11N35E.7. The mutation at position N35 of the light chain of p6G4V11N35E.choSD.10 was confirmed by DNA sequencing.\n\n\n \nR. Stable Cho Cell Lines for Variants N35A and N35E\n\n\n \n \n \nFor stable expression of the final humanized IgG1 variants (6G4V11N35A and 6G4V11N35E), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) DP-12 cells were transfected with the above-described dicistronic vectors (p6G4V11N35A.choSD.9 and p6G4V11N35E.choSD.10, respectively) designed to coexpress both heavy and light chains (Lucas et al., \nNucleic Acid Res. \n24:1774-79 (1996)). Plasmids were introduced into CHO DP12 cells via lipofection and selected for growth in GHT-free medium (Chisholm, V. High efficiency gene transfer in mammalian cells. In: Glover, D M, Hames, B \nD. \nDNA Cloning\n \n \n \n4\n. Mammalian systems\n. Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford pp 1-41 (1996)). Approximately 20 unamplified clones were randomly chosen and reseeded into 96 well plates. Relative specific productivity of each colony was monitored using an ELISA to quantitate the full length human IgG accumulated in each well after 3 days and a fluorescent dye, Calcien AM, as a surrogate marker of viable cell number per well. Based on these data, several unamplified clones were chosen for further amplification in the presence of increasing concentrations of methotrexate. Individual clones surviving at 10, 50, and 100 nM methotrexate were chosen and transferred to 96 well plates for productivity screening. One clone for each antibody (clone/1933 aIL8.92 NB 28605/12 for 6G4V11N35A; clone#1934 aIL8.42 NB 28605/14 for 6G4V11N35E), which reproducibly exhibited high specific productivity, was expanded in T-flasks and used to inoculate a spinner culture. After several passages, the suspension-adapted cells were used to inoculate production cultures in GHT-containing, serum-free media supplemented with various hormones and protein hydrolysates. Harvested cell culture fluid containing recombinant humanized anti-IL8 was purified using protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. The purity after this step was approximately 99%. Subsequent purification to homogeneity was carried out using an ion exchange chromatography step. Production titer of the humanized 6G4V11N35E IgG1 antibody after the first round of amplification and 6G4V11N35A IgG1 after the second round of amplification were 250 mg/L and 150 mg/L, respectively.\n\n\n \nS. Characterization of the humanized 6G4V11N35A/E IgG Variants\n\n\n \n \n \nThe humanized full length IgG variants of 6G4.2.5 were tested for their ability to inhibit \n125\nI-IL-8 binding and to neutralize activation of human neutrophils; the procedures are described in Sections (B)(1) and (B)(2) above. As shown in \nFIG. 49\n, the full length IgG1 forms of variants 6G4V11N35A and 6G4V11N35E equally inhibited 125I-IL-8 binding to human neutrophils with approximate IC\n50\n's of 0.3 nM and 0.5 nM, respectively. This represents a 15-25 fold improvement in blocking binding of IL-8 compared to the full length murine mAb (IC\n50\n=7.5 nM). Similarly, the two anti-IL-8 variants showed equivalent neutralizing capabilities with respect to inhibiting IL-8 mediated human neutrophil chemotaxis (\nFIGS. 50A-50B\n). The IC\n50\n's of 6G4V11N35A IgG1 and 6G4V11N35E IgG1 for human IL-8 were 4.0 nM and 6.0 nM, respectively, and for rabbit IL-8 were 4.0 nM and 2.0 nM, respectively. The irrelevant isotype control Fab (4D5) did not inhibit neutrophil migration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe affinity for IL-8 of these variants relative to the murine 6G4.2.5 mAb was determined using KinExA as described in Section (M). \nFIG. 51\n shows the equilibrium constant (Kd) for the full length affinity matured variants 6G4V11N35E IgG1 and 6G4V11N35A IgG1 were approximately 49 pM and 88 pM, respectively. The Kd for 6G4V11N35A IgG1 was determined directly from the kinetic experiment. As reported with their respective Fabs, this improvement in affinity might be attributed to an approximate 2-fold increase in the on-rate of 6G4V11N35E IgG1 (ka=3.0×10\n6\n) compared to that of 6G4V11N35A IgG1 (ka=8.7×10\n5\n). In addition, these results were confirmed by a competition radio-immune assay using iodinated human IL-8. 50 pM of 6G4V11N35A IgG1 or 6G4V11N35E IgG1 was incubated for 2 hours at 25° C. with 30-50 pM of \n125\nI-IL-8 and varying concentrations (0 to 100 nM) of unlabeled IL-8. The antibody-antigen mixture was then incubated for 1 hour at 4° C. with 10 ul of a 70% slurry of Protein-A beads (pre-blocked with 0.1% BSA). The beads were briefly spun in a microcentrifuge and the supernatant discarded to remove the unbound \n125\nI-IL-8. The amount of \n125\nI-IL-8 specifically bound to the anti-IL-8 antibodies was determined by counting the protein-A pellets in a gamma counter. The approximate Kd values were similar to those determined by KinEXA. The average Kd for 6G4V11N35A IgG1 and 6G4V11N35E IgG1 were 54 pM (18-90 pM) and 19 pM (5-34 pM), respectively (\nFIG. 52\n).\n\n\n \nT. Construction of humanized 6G4V11N35A/E Fab's for modification by Polyethylene Glycol\n\n\n \n \n \nA Fab′ expression vector for 6G4V11N35A was constructed by digesting p6G4V11N35A.F(ab′)\n2 \nwith the restriction enzymes ApaI and NdeI to remove the 2805 bp fragment encoding the human IgG\n1 \nconstant domain fused with the yeast GCN4 leucine zipper and replacing it with the 2683 bp ApaI-NdeI fragment from the plasmid pCDNA.18 described in Eigenbrot et al., \nProteins: Struct. Funct. Genet., \n18: 49-62 (1994). The pCDNA.18 ApaI-NdeI fragment carries the coding sequence for the human constant IgG1 heavy domain, including the free cysteine in the hinge region that was used to attach the PEG molecule. The 3758 bp ApaI-NdeI fragment (encodes the light chain and heavy variable domain of 6G4V11N35A) isolated from p6G4V11N35A.F(ab′)\n2 \nwas ligated to the 2683 bp ApaI-NdeI fragment of pCDNA.18 to create p6G4V11N35A.PEG-1. The integrity of the entire coding sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The nucleotide and translated amino acid sequences of heavy chain constant domain with the cysteine in the hinge are presented in \nFIG. 53\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Fab′ expression plasmid for 6G4V11N35E was made similarly by digesting pPH6G4V11N35E (from Section (O) above) with the restriction enzymes ApaI and NdeI to isolate the 3758 bp ApaI-NdeI DNA fragment carrying the intact light chain and heavy variable domain of 6G4V11N35E and ligating it to the 2683 bp ApaI-NdeI DNA fragment from p6G4V11N35A.PEG-1 to create p6G4V11N35E.PEG-3. The integrity of the entire coding sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IL-8 6G4V11N35A Fab′ variant was modified with 20 kD linear methoxy-PEG-maleimide, 30 kD linear methoxy-PEG-maleimide, 40 kD linear methoxy-PEG-maleimide, or 40 kD branched methoxy-PEG-maleimide as described below. All PEG's used were obtained commercially from Shearwater Polymers, Inc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \na. Materials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFab′-SH Purification\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Fab′-SH antibody fragment of the affinity matured antibody 6G4V11N35A was expressed in \nE. coli \ngrown to high cell density in the fermentor as described by Carter et al., \n \nBioTechnology\n \n10, 163-167 (1992). Preparation of Fab′-SH fragments was accomplished by protecting the Fab′-SH fragments with 4′,4′-dithiodipyridine (PDS), partially purifying the protected Fab′-PDS fragments, deprotect the Fab′-PDS with dithiothreitol (DTT) and finally isolate the free Fab′-SH by using gel permeation chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtection of Fab′-SH with PDS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFermentation paste samples were dissolved in 3 volumes of 20 mM MES, 5 mM EDTA, pH 6.0 containing 10.7 mg of 4′,4′-dithiodipyridine per gram fermentation paste, resulting in a suspension with a pH close to 6.0 The suspension was passed through a homogenizer followed by addition of 5% PEI (w/v), \npH\n 6 to the homogenate to a final concentration of 0.25%. The mixture was then centrifuged to remove solids and the clear supernatant was conditioned to a conductivity of less than 3 mS by the addition of cold water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPartial Purification of the Fab′-SH Molecule Using Ion Exchange Chromatography\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conditioned supernatant was loaded onto an ABX (Baker) column equilibrated in 20 mM MES, pH 6.0. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer followed by elution of the Fab′-SH with a 15 column volume linear gradient from 20 mM MES, pH 6.0 to 20 mM MES, 350 mM sodium chloride. The column was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm, and the eluate was collected in fractions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDeprotection of the Fab′-SH antibody fragments with DTT\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pH of the ABX pool was adjusted to 4.0 by the addition of dilute HCl. The pH adjusted solution was then deprotected by adding DTT to a final concentration of 0.2 mM. The solution was incubated for about 30 minutes and then applied to a gel filtration Sephadex G25 column, equilibrated with 15 mM sodium phosphate, 25 mM MES, pH 4.0. After elution, the pH of the pool was raised to pH 5.5 and immediately flash frozen at −70° C. for storage or derivatized with PEG-MAL as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternative Fab′-SH Purification\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively Fab′-SH fragments can be purified using the following procedure. 100 g fermentation paste is thawed in the presence of 200 \nml\n 50 mM acetic acid, pH 2.8, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF. After mixing vigorously for 30 min at room temperature, the extract is incubated with 100 mg hen egg white lysozyme. DEAE fast flow resin (approximately 100 mL) is equilibrated with 10 mM MES, pH 5.5, 1 mM EDTA on a sintered glass funnel. The osmotic shock extract containing the Fab′-SH fragment is then filtered through the resin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA protein G Sepharose column is equilibrated with 10 mM MES, pH 5.5, 1 mM EDTA and then loaded with the DEAE flow-through sample. The column is washed followed by three 4 column volume washes with 10 mM MES, pH 5.5, 1 mM EDTA. The Fab′-SH antibody fragment containing a free thiol is eluted from the column with 100 mM acetic acid, pH 2.8, 1 mM EDTA. After elution, the pH of the pool is raised to pH 5.5 and immediately flash frozen at −70° C. for storage or derivatized with PEG-MAL as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of Fab′-S-PEG\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe free thiol content of the Fab′-SH preparation obtained as described above was determined by reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) analysis according to the method of Creighton in \nProtein Structure: A Practical Approach\n, Creighton, T. E., ed, IRL Press (Oxford, UK: 1990), pp. 155-167. The concentration of free thiol was calculated from the increase on absorbance at 412 nm, using e\n412\n=14,150 cm\n−1\nM\n−1 \nfor the thionitrobenzoate anion and a M\nr\n=48,690 and e\n280\n=1.5 for the Fab′-SH antibody. To the Fab′-SH protein G Sepharose pool, or the deprotected Fab′-SH gel permeation pool, 5 molar equivalents of PEG-MAL were added and the pH was immediately adjusted to pH 6.5 with 10% NaOH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fab′-S-PEG was purified using a 2.5×20 cm cation exchange column (Poros 50-HS). The column was equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mM MES, pH 5.5. The coupling reaction containing the PEGylated antibody fragment was diluted with deionized water to a conductivity of approximately 2.0 mS. The conditioned coupling reaction was then loaded onto the equilibrated \nPoros\n 50 HS column. Unreacted PEG-MAL was washed from the column with 2 column volumes of 20 mM MES, pH 5.5. The Fab′-S-PEG was eluted from the column using a linear gradient from 0 to 400 mM NaCl, in 20 mM MES pH 5.5, over 15 column volumes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively a Bakerbond ABX column can be used to purify the Fab′-S-PEG molecule. The column is equilibrated with 20 mM MES, pH 6.0 (Buffer A). The coupling reaction is diluted with deionized water until the conductivity equaled that of the Buffer A (approximately 2.0 mS) and loaded onto the column. Unreacted PEG-MAL is washed from the column with 2 column volumes of 20 mM MES, pH 6.0. The Fab′-S-PEG is eluted from the column using a linear gradient from 0 to 100 mM (NH\n4\n)\n2\nSO\n4\n, in 20 mM MES pH 6.0, over 15 column volumes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSize Exclusion Chromatography\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hydrodynamic or effective size of each molecule was determined using a Pharmacia Superose-6 \nHR\n 10/30 column (10×300 mm). The mobile phase was 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.0. Flow rate was at 0.5 ml/min and the column was kept at ambient temperature. Absorbance at 280 nm was monitored where PEG contributed little signal. Biorad MW standards containing cyanocobalamin, myoglobin, ovalbumin, IgG, Thyroglobulin monomer and dimer were used to generate a standard curve from which the effective size of the pegylated species was estimated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb. Results\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSize Exclusion Chromatography\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective size of each modified species was characterized using size exclusion chromatography. The results are shown in \nFIG. 60\n below. The theoretical molecular weight of the anti-IL8 Fab fragments modified with \nPEG\n 5 kD, 10 kD, 20 kD, 30 kD, 40 kD (linear), 40 kD (branched) or 100,000 kD is shown along with the apparent molecular weight of the PEGylated fragments obtained by HPLC size exclusion chromatography. When compared to the theoretical molecular weight of the Fab′-S-PEG fragments, the apparent molecular weight (calculated by size exclusion HPLC) increases dramatically by increasing the size of the PEG attached to the fragments. Attachment of a small molecular weight PEG, for example PEG 10,000 D only increases the theoretical molecular weight of the PEGylated antibody fragment (59,700 D) by 3 fold to an apparent molecular weight of 180,000D. In contrast attachment of a larger molecular weight PEG for example 100,000 D PEG to the antibody fragment increases the theoretical molecular weight of the PEGylated antibody fragment (158,700 D) by 12 fold to an apparent molecular weight of 2,000,000D.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSDS-PAGE\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nFIG. 61\n, the upper panel shows the size of the anti-IL-8 Fab fragments modified with PEG of \nmolecular weight\n 5 kD (linear), 10 kD (linear), 20 kD (linear), 30 kD (linear), kD (linear), 40 kD (branched) or 100 kD (linear) under reduced conditions. The unmodified Fab is shown in \nlane\n 2 from right to left. Both the heavy and light chains of the Fab had a molecular weight of approximately 30 kD as determined by PAGE. Each PEGylated fragment sample produced two bands: (1) a first band (attributed to the light chain) exhibiting a molecular weight of 30 kD; and (2) a second band (attributed to the heavy chain to which the PEG is attached specifically at the hinge SH) exhibiting increasing molecular weights of 40, 45, 70, 110, 125, 150 and 300 kD. This result suggested that PEGylation was specifically restricted to the heavy chain of the Fab's whereas the light chain remained unmodified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lower panel is non-reduced PAGE showing the size of the anti-IL-8 Fab fragments modified with PEG of \nmolecular weight\n 5 kD (linear), 20 kD (linear), 30 kD (linear), 40 kD (linear), 40 kD (branched), or 100 kD (linear). The PEGylated fragments exhibited molecular weights of approximately 70 kD, 115 kD, 120 kD, 140 kD, 200 kD and 300 kD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe SDS PAGE gels confirm that all Fab′-S-PEG molecules were purified to homogeneity and that the molecules differed only with respect to the size of the PEG molecule attached to them.\n\n\n \nU. Amine Specific Pegylation of Anti-IL-8 F(ab′)\n2 \nFragments\n\n\n \n \n \nPegylated F(ab′)\n2 \nspecies were generated by using large MW or branched PEGs in order to achieve a large effective size with minimal protein modification which might affect activity. Modification involved N-hydroxysuccinamide chemistry which reacts with primary amines (lysines and the N-terminus). To decrease the probability of modifying the N-terminus, which is in close proximity to the CDR region, a reaction pH of 8, rather than the commonly used pH of 7, was employed. At pH 8.0, the amount of the reactive species (charged NH\n3\n \n+\n) would be considerably more for the ε-NH2 group of lysines (pK\na\n=10.3) than for the α-NH2 group (pK\na \nof approximately 7) of the amino-terminus. For the linear PEGs, a methoxy-succinimidyl derivative of an NHS-PEG was used because of the significantly longer half-life in solution (17 minutes at 25° C. at pH 8.0) compared to the NHS esters of PEGs (which have 5-7 minute half life under the above conditions). By using a PEG that is less prone to hydrolysis, a greater extent of modification is achieved with less PEG. Branched PEGs were used to induce a large increase in effective size of the antibody fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \na. Materials\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll PEG reagents were purchased from Shearwater Polymers and stored at −70° C. in a desiccator: branched N-hydroxysuccinamide-PEG (PEG2-NHS-40 KDa) has a 20 kDa PEG on each of the two branches, methoxy-succinimidyl-propionic acid-PEG (M-SPA-20000) is a linear PEG molecule with 20 kDa PEG.

Baker Wide-Pore Carboxy-sulfone (CSX), 5 micron, 7.75×100 mm HPLC column was used for fractionation of the different pegylated products, taking advantage of the difference in charge as the lysines are modified. The column was heated at 40° C. A gradient as shown in Table 7 below was used where Buffer A was 25 mM sodium Borate/25 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.0, and Buffer B was 1 M ammonium sulfate, and Buffer C was 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTime (min)\n\n\n% B\n\n\n% C\n\n\nflow mL/\nmin\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n10\n\n\n10\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n18\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n25\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n70\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n70\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n10\n\n\n10\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n10\n\n\n10\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSEC-HPLC: The hydrodynamic or effective size of each molecule was determined using a Pharmacia Superose-6 \nHR\n 10/30 column (10×300 mm). The mobile phase was 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.0. Flow rate was at 0.5 ml/min and the column was kept at ambient temperature. Absorbance at 280 nm was monitored where PEG contributed little signal. Biorad MW standards containing cyanocobalamin, myoglobin, ovalbumin, IgG, Thyroglobulin monomer and dimer were used to generate a standard curve from which the effective size of the pegylated species was estimated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSEC-HPLC-Light Scattering: For determination of the exact molecular weight, this column was connected to an on-line light scattering detector (Wyatt Minidawn) equipped with three detection angles of 50°, 90°, and 135° C. A refractive index detector (Wyatt) was also placed on-line to determine concentration. All buffers were filtered with Millipore 0.11 filters; in additional 0.02\nμ Whatman Anodisc\n 47 was placed on-line prior to the column.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intensity of scattered light is directly proportional to the molecular weight (M) of the scattering species, independent of shape, according to:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nM=R\n\n\n0\n\n\n/K·c \n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere R\n0 \nis the Rayleigh ratio, K is an optical constant relating to the refractive index of the solvent, the wavelength of the incident light, and dn/dc, the differential refractive index between the solvent and the solute with respect to the change in solute concentration, c. The system was calibrated with toluene (R\n0 \nof 1.406×10\n−5 \nat 632.8 nm); a dn/dc of 0.18, and an extinction coefficient of 1.2 was used. The system had a mass accuracy of 5%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSDS-PAGE: 4-12% Tris-Glycine Novex minigels were used along with the Novex supplied Tris-Glycine running buffers. 10-20 ug of protein was applied in each well and the gels were run in a cold box at 150 mV/gel for 45 minutes. Gels were then stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Novex) and then washed with water for a few hours and then preserved and dried in drying buffer (Novex)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of a linear(1)20 KDa-(N)-(Fab′)2: A 4 mg/ml solution of anti-IL8 formulated initially in a pH 5.5 buffer was dialyzed overnight against a pH 8.0 sodium phosphate buffer. 5 mL protein was mixed at a molar ratio of 3:1. The reaction was carried out in a 15 ml polypropylene Falcon tube and the PEG was added while vortexing the sample at low speed for 5 seconds. It was then placed on a nutator for 30 minutes. The extent of modification was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. The whole 5 ml reaction mixture was injected on the IEX for removal of any unreacted PEG and purification of singly or doubly pegylated species. The above reaction generated a mixture of 50% singly-labeled anti-IL8. The other 50% unreacted anti-IL8 was recycled through the pegylation/purification steps. The pooled pegylated product was dialyzed against a pH 5.5 buffer for in vitro assays and animal PK studies. Endotoxin levels were measured before administration to animals or for the cell based assays. Levels were below 0.5 eu/ml. The fractions were also run on SDS-PAGE to confirm homogeneity. Concentration of the final product was assessed by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.34, as well as by amino acid analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of a Branched(1)40 KDa-(N)-(Fab′)2: A 4 mg/mL solution of anti-IL8 (Fab′)\n2 \nformulated in a pH 5.5 buffer was dialyzed overnight against a pH 8.0 phosphate buffer. Solid PEG powder was added to 5 mL protein in two aliquots to give a final PEG:protein molar ratio of 6:1. Each solid PEG aliquot was added to the protein in a 15 mL polypropylene Falcon tube while vortexing at low speed for 5 sec, and then placing the sample on a nutator for 15 minutes. The extent of modification was evaluated by SDS-PAGE using a 4-12% Tris-Glycine (Novex) gel and stained with colloidal Coomasie blue (Novex). The 5 mL PEG-protein mixture was injected on the ion exchange column for removal of any unreacted PEG. The above reaction generated a mixture of unreacted (37%), singly-labelled (45%), doubly and triply-labeled (18%) species. These were the optimal conditions for obtaining the greatest recovery of the protein with only 1 PEG per antibody rather than the higher molecular weight adducts. The unmodified anti-IL8 was recycled. The pegylated products were separated and fractionated in falcon tubes and then dialyzed against a pH 5.5 buffer for assays and animal PK studies. Endotoxin levels were below 0.5 eu/ml. The fractions were also run on SDS-PAGE to confirm homogeneity. The concentration of the final product was assessed by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.34, as well as by amino acid analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of branched(2)-40 KDa-(N)(Fab′)2: This molecule was most efficiently made by adding three times in 15 minute intervals a 3:1 molar ratio of PEG to the already modified branched(1)-40 KDa-(N)-(Fab′)\n2\n. The molecule was purified on IEX as 50% branched(2)-40 KDa-(N)-(Fab′)\n2\n. The unmodified molecule was recycled until ˜20 mg protein was isolated for animal PK studies. The product was characterized by SEC-light scattering and SDS-PAGE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc. Results\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPEGs increased the hydrodynamic or effective size of the product significantly as determined by gel filtration (SEC-HPLC). \nFIG. 62\n shows the SEC profile of the pegylated F(ab′)\n2 \nspecies with UV detection at 280 nm. The hydrodynamic size of each molecule was estimated by reference to the standard MW calibrators. As summarized in \nFIG. 62\n, the increase in the effective size of (Fab′)\n2 \nwas about 7-fold by adding one linear 20 kDa PEG molecule and about 11-fold by adding one branched (“Br(1)”) 40 kDa PEG molecule, and somewhat more with addition of two branched (“Br(2)”) PEG molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLight scattering detection gave the exact molecular weight of the products and confirmed the extent of modification (\nFIG. 63\n). The homogeneity of the purified material was shown by SDS-PAGE (\nFIG. 64\n). Underivatized F(ab′)\n2 \nmigrated as a 120 kDa species, the linear(1)20 KD-(N)-F(ab′)\n2 \nmigrated as a band at 220 kDa, the Br(1)-40 KD(N)-F(ab′)\n2 \nmigrated as one major band at 400 kDa, and the Br(2)-40 KD-(N)-F(ab′)\n2 \nmigrated as a major band at around 500 kDa. The proteins appeared somewhat larger than their absolute MW due to the steric effect of PEG.\n\n\n \nV. In vitro Activity Characterization of PEG Modified Fab′ Fragments of 6G4V11N35A (Maleimide Chemical Coupling Method)\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-IL-8 6G4V11N35A Fab′ variants modified with 5-40 kD linear PEG molecules and a 40 kD branched PEG molecule were tested for their ability to inhibit both IL-8 binding and activation of human neutrophils; the procedures were described in Sections (B)(1), (B)(2) and (B)(3) above. The binding curves and IC\n50\n's for PEG-maleimide modified 6G4V11N35A Fab′ molecules are presented in \nFIGS. 54A-54C\n. The IC\n50 \nof the 5 kD pegylated Fab′ (350 pM) and the average IC\n50 \nof the Fab control (366 pM) were not significantly different, suggesting that the addition of a 5 kD MW PEG did not affect the binding of IL-8 to the modified Fab′ (\nFIG. 54A\n). However, a decrease in the binding of IL-8 to the 10 kD and 20 kD pegylated Fab′ molecules was observed as depicted by the progressively higher IC\n50\n's (537 pM and 732 pM, respectively) compared to the average IC\n50 \nof the native Fab. These values represent only a minimal loss of binding activity (between 1.5- and 2.0-fold). A less pronounced difference in IL-8 binding was observed for the 30 kD and 40 kD linear PEG antibodies (\nFIG. 54B\n). The IC\n50\n's were 624 pM and 1.1 nM, respectively, compared to the 802 pM value of the Fab control. The 40 kD branched PEG Fab′ showed the largest decrease in IL-8 binding (2.5 fold) relative to the native Fab (\nFIG. 54C\n). Nevertheless, the reduction in binding of IL-8 by these pegylated Fab's is minimal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of the pegylated antibodies to block IL-8 mediated activation of human neutrophils was demonstrated using the PMN chemotaxis (according to the method described in Section B(2) above) and β-glucuronidase release (according to the method described in Lowman et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n271: 14344 (1996)) assays. The IC\n50\n's for blocking IL-8 mediated chemotaxis are shown in \nFIGS. 55A-55C\n. The 5-20 kD linear pegylated Fab′ antibodies were able to block IL-8 mediated chemotaxis within 2-3 fold of the unpegylated Fab control (\nFIG. 55A\n). This difference is not significant because the inherent variation can be up to 2 fold for this type of assay. However, a significant difference was detected for the 30 kD and 40 kD linear pegylated Fab′ antibodies as illustrated by the higher IC\n50\n's of the 30 kD linear PEG-Fab′ (2.5 nM) and 40 kD linear PEG-Fab′ (3.7 nM) compared to the Fab control (0.8 nM) (\nFIG. 55B\n). The ability of the 40 kD branched PEG Fab′ molecule to block IL-8 mediated chemotaxis was similar to that of the 40 kD linear PEG Fab′ (\nFIG. 55C\n). At most, the ability of the pegylated Fab′ antibodies to block IL-8 mediated chemotaxis was only reduced 2-3 fold. Furthermore, release of β-glucuronidase from the granules of neutrophils was used as another criteria for assessing IL-8 mediated activation of human PMNs. \nFIG. 56A\n (depicting results obtained with 5 kD, 10 kD and 20 kD linear PEGs), \nFIG. 56B\n (depicting results obtained with 30 kD and 40 kD linear PEGs), and \nFIG. 56C\n (depicting results obtained with 40 kD branched PEG) show that all the pegylated Fab′ antibodies were able to inhibit IL-8 mediated release of β-glucuronidase as well as or better than the unpegylated Fab control. The data collectively shows that the pegylated Fab′ variants are biological active and are capable of inhibiting high amounts of exogenous IL-8 in in-vitro assays using human neutrophils.\n\n\n \nW. In Vitro Activity Characterization of PEG Modified F(ab′)\n2 \nFragments of 6G4V11N35A (Succinimidyl Chemical Coupling Method)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-8 variant 6G4V11N35A F(ab′)\n2 \nmodified with (a) a single 20 kD linear PEG molecule per F(ab′)\n2\n, (b) a single 40 kD branched PEG molecule per F(ab′)\n2\n, (c) with three, four, or five 20 kD linear PEG molecules per F(ab′)\n2 \n(a mixture of: (1) species having three 20 kD linear PEG molecules per F(ab′)\n2\n; (2) species having four 20 kD linear PEG molecules per F(ab′)\n2\n; and (3) species having five 20 kD linear PEG molecules per F(ab′)\n2\n; denoted as “20 kD linear PEG (3,4,5) F(ab′)\n2\n”), or (d) with two 40 kD branched PEG molecules per F(ab′)\n2 \n(denoted as “40 kD branch PEG (2) F(ab′)\n2\n”), were tested for their ability to inhibit \n125\nI-IL-8 binding and to neutralize activation of human neutrophils. The procedures used are described in Sections (B)(1), (B)(2) and (B)(3) above. The binding curves for pegylated F(ab′)\n2 \nvariants are shown in \nFIGS. 57A-57B\n. No significant differences were observed amongst the F(ab′)\n2 \ncontrol, the single 20 kD linear PEG-modified F(ab′)\n2\n, and the single 40 kD branched PEG-modified F(ab′)\n2 \n(\nFIG. 57A\n). However, the F(ab′)\n2 \nvariants containing multiple PEG molecules showed a slight reduction (less than 2-fold) in their ability to bind IL-8. The IC\n50\n's of the kD linear PEG (3,4,5) F(ab′)\n2 \nand 40 kD branch PEG (2) F(ab′)\n2 \nvariants were 437 pM and 510 pM, respectively, compared to 349 pM of the F(ab′)\n2 \ncontrol (\nFIG. 57B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of these pegylated F(ab′)\n2 \nvariants to block IL-8 mediated neutrophil chemotaxis is presented in \nFIGS. 58A-58B\n. Consistent with the PMN binding data, the single linear and branched PEG F(ab′)\n2 \nvariants were able to block IL-8 mediated chemotaxis similar to the unpegylated F(ab′)\n2 \ncontrol (\nFIG. 58A\n). The ability of the 40 kD branch PEG (2) F(ab′)\n2 \nvariant to inhibit PMN chemotaxis was identical to the control F(ab′)\n2 \nwhile the 20 kD linear PEG (3,4,5) F(ab′)\n2 \nmixture was able to inhibit within 3-fold of the control antibody (\nFIG. 58B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nShown in \nFIGS. 59A and 59B\n are the results of the β-glucuronidase release assay which is a measure of degranulation by IL-8 stimulated human neutrophils. The single 20 kD linear PEG-modified F(ab′)\n2 \nand the single 40 kD branched PEG-modified F(ab′)\n2 \nvariants were able to inhibit release of ∃-glucuronidase as well as the F(ab′)\n2 \ncontrol (\nFIG. 59A\n). The 40 kD branch PEG (2) F(ab′)\n2 \ninhibited this response within 2-fold of the F(ab′)\n2 \ncontrol (\nFIG. 59B\n). The 20 kD linear PEG (3,4,5) molecule was not tested. Overall, the F(ab′)\n2 \npegylated anti-IL-8 antibodies were biologically active and effectively prevented IL-8 binding to human neutrophils and the signaling events leading to cellular activation.\n\n\n \nX. Pharmacokinetic and Safety Study of Eight Constructs of Pegylated Anti-IL-8 (Humanized) F(ab′)2 And Fab′ Fragments in Normal Rabbits Following Intravenous Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of pegylation on the pharmacokinetics and safety of six pegylated humanized anti-IL-8 constructs (pegylated 6G4V11N35A.Fab′ and pegylated 6G4V11N35A.F(ab′)\n2 \nobtained as described in Sections (T) and (U) above) relative to the non-pegylated fragments in normal rabbits. Eight groups of two/three male rabbits received equivalent protein amounts of pegylated 6G4V11N35A.Fab′ or pegylated 6G4V11N35A.F(ab′)\n2 \nconstructs (2 mg/kg) via a single intravenous (IV) bolus dose of one anti-IL8 construct.

METHODS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree male New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits per group (with exception to \nGroup\n 7, n=2) received an equivalent amount of 6G4V11N35A protein (Fab′ or F(ab′)\n2\n) construct at 2 mg/kg via an IV bolus dose in a marginal ear vein. Amino acid composition analysis and absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 1.26 for 6G4V11N35A Fab′ constructs and 1.34 for 6G4V11N35A F(ab′)\n2 \nconstructs were performed to determine the protein concentration. Whole blood samples were collected via an ear artery cannulation (ear opposing dosing ear) at the above time points. Samples were harvested for serum and assayed for free G4V11N35A Fab′ or F(ab′)\n2 \nconstructs using an IL-8 Binding ELISA. Assays were conducted throughout the study as samples became available. All animals were sacrificed following the last blood draw, and necropsies were performed on all animals in \nGroups\n 1, 4-8. Due to the development of antibodies against the 6G4V11N35A constructs, non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted on concentration versus time data only up to 168 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb. Results\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn four animals (Animals B, P, Q, V), interference to rabbit serum in the ELISA assay was detected (i.e. measurable concentrations of anti-IL8 antibodies at pre-dose). However, because these values were at insignificant levels and did not effect the pharmacokinetic analysis, the data were not corrected for this interference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne animal (Animal G; Group 3) was exsanguinated before the termination of the study and was excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis. At 4 hours, the animal showed signs of a stroke that was not believed to be drug related, as this can occur in rabbits following blood draws via ear artery cannulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mean concentration-time profiles of the eight anti-IL8 constructs in normal rabbits are depicted in \nFIG. 65\n, and the pharmacokinetic parameters for the eight constructs are summarized in Table 9 below. Significant antibodies to the anti-IL-8 constructs were present at Day 13/14 in all dose groups except Group 1 (Fab′ control).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMolecule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFab′\n\n\nF(ab′)\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup No.\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n8\n\n\n3\n\n\n6\n\n\n5\n\n\n4\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPEG structure\n\n\n—\n\n\nlinear\n\n\nlinear\n\n\nlinear\n\n\nbranched\n\n\n—\n\n\nbranched\n\n\nbranched\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of PEGs\n\n\n—\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n—\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPEG MW\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n \n \n20K\n \n \n \n \n30K\n \n \n\n\n40K\n \n \n\n\n40K\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n40K\n \n\n\n40K\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDose (mg/kg)\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nc \n(mL/kg)\na\n \n\n\n58 ± 3\n\n\n36 ± 3\n\n\n35 ± 1\n\n\n34\n\n\n44 ± 1\n\n\n45 ± 5\n\n\n36 ± 1\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nss \n(mL/kg)\nb\n \n\n\n68 ± 8\n\n\n80 ± 8\n\n\n110 ± 15\n\n\n79\n\n\n 88 ± 21\n\n\n59 ± 4\n\n\n50 ± 3\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCmax (μg/mL)\nc\n \n\n\n35 ± 1\n\n\n58 ± 3\n\n\n57 ± 1\n\n\n60\n\n\n45 ± 1\n\n\n45 ± 6\n\n\n56 ± 2\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTmax (min)\nd\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n1/2 \nterm (hr)\ne\n \n\n\n 3.0 ± 0.9\n\n\n44 ± 2\n\n\n43 ± 7\n\n\n50\n\n\n105 ± 11\n\n\n 8.5 ± 2.1\n\n\n45 ± 3\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUC\n0-8 \n(hr · μg/mL)\nf\n \n\n\n18 ± 3\n\n\n 80 ± 74\n\n\n 910 ± 140\n\n\n1600\n\n\n 3400 ± 1300\n\n\n140 ± 3 \n\n\n2200 ± 77 \n\n\n2500\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCL (mL/hr/kg)\ng\n \n\n\n110 ± 17\n\n\n 2.5 ± 0.2\n\n\n 2.2 ± 0.4\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n 0.63 ± 0.20\n\n\n14 ± 0\n\n\n 0.92 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.83\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRT (hr)\nh\n \n\n\n 0.61 ± 0.15\n\n\n32 ± 2\n\n\n45 ± 9\n\n\n63\n\n\n140 ± 18\n\n\n 4.2 ± 0.3\n\n\n55 ± 3\n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. of \nAnimals\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nInitial volume of distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nb\nVolume of distribution at steady state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nc\nObserved maximum concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nd\nObserved time to Cmax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ne\nt\n1/2 \nterm = half-life associated with the terminal phase of the concentration vs. time profile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nf\nArea under the concentration versus time curve (extrapolated to infinity).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ng\nCL = serum clearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nh\nMRT = Mean residence time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe initial volume of distribution approximated the plasma volume for both the Fab′ and F(ab′)\n2\n.

Terminal half-life and MRT increased 14 to 35-fold and 53 to 240-fold, respectively. For pegylated anti-IL8 F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecules, CL decreased 15 to 17-fold with pegylation, and terminal half-life and MRT increased by greater than 5-fold and 13-fold, respectively. The changes in these parameters increased for both pegylated Fab′ and F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecules with increasing PEG molecular weight and approached the values of the full-length anti-IL8 (terminal half-life of 74 hours, MRT of 99 hours and CL of 0.47 mL/hr/kg). In comparing the branched(1)40K Fab′ (Group 6) and branched(1)40K F(ab′)\n2 \n(Group 4), unexpected pharmacokinetics were observed. The pegylated Fab′ molecule appeared to remain in the serum longer than the pegylated F(ab′)\n2 \n(see \nFIG. 66\n). The mean CL of branched(1)40K Fab′ was 0.63 mL/hr/kg, but a higher CL was observed for branched(1)40 kD F(ab′)\n2 \n(CL 0.92 mL/hr/kg). The terminal half-life, likewise, was longer for the Fab′ than the F(ab′)\n2 \npegylated molecule (110 vs 45 hours).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that pegylation decreased CL and increased terminal t1/2 and MRT of anti-IL8 fragments (Fab′ and F(ab′)\n2\n) to approach that of the full-length anti-IL8. Clearance was decreased with pegylation 46 to 180-fold for the Fab′ and approximately 16-fold for the F(ab′)\n2\n. The terminal half-life of the Fab′ anti-IL8 fragment was increased by 14 to 35-fold and approximately 5-fold for the F(ab′)\n2 \nanti-IL8. MRT, likewise, were extended by 53 to 240-fold for the Fab′ and approximately 14-fold for the F(ab′)\n2\n. The branched(1) 40 kD Fab′ had a longer terminal half-life and lower clearance compared to the branched(1) 40 kD F(ab′)\n2\n.\n\n\n \nY. In Vivo Efficacy Testing of Anti-IL-8 Antibody Reagents in Rabbit Model of Ischemia/Reperfusion and Acid Aspiration-Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)\n\n\n \n \n \nFull length murine anti-rabbit IL-8 monoclonal antibody 6G4.2.5, 40 kD branched PEG-6G4V11N35A Fab′, and control antibody (anti-HIV gp120 monoclonal antibody 9E3.1F10) were tested in a rabbit ARDS model. The animals were weighed and anaesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine (50 mg/kg body weight), xylazine (5 mg/kg body weight), and acepromazine (0.75 mg/kg body weight). A second dose (20% of the first dosage) was given IM15 minutes before removal of vascular clip, and third dose (60% of the first dosage) was given at tracheotomy. Intra-arterial catheter (22G, 1 in. Angiocath) and intra-venous catheter (24G, 1 in. angiocath) were be placed in the ear central artery and posterior marginal ear vein for blood samplings (arterial blood gases and CBC) and anti-IL-8 and fluid administration, respectively. The anaesthetized animals were transferred in a supine position to an operating tray; the abdominal area was shaved and prepared for surgery. Via a midline laparotomy, the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was isolated and a microvascular arterial clip applied at the aortic origin. Before the temporary closure of the abdomen using 9 mm wound clip (Autoclip, Baxter), 15 ml of normal saline was given intraperitoneally as fluid supplement. After 110 minutes of intestinal ischemia, the abdominal incision was reopened and the arterial clip was released to allow reperfusion. Before closure, 5 ml of normal saline was given intraperitoneally for fluid replacement. The laparotomy incision was closed in two layers and the animals allowed to awaken.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter surgery, the animals were placed on a heating pad (38° C.) and continuously monitored for up to 6 hours post reperfusion and lactated Ringer's 8-12 ml/kg/hr IV was given as fluid supplement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt 22-24 hr post-reperfusion, a tracheotomy was performed under anesthesia. Normal physiologic saline was diluted 1:3 with water and adjusted to pH 1.5 (adjusted by using 1N HCL); 3 ml/kg body weight was then instilled intra-tracheally. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37+/−1 degree C. using a homeothermic heat therapy pad (K-Mod II, Baxter). Fluid supplements (LRS) at a rate of 5 ml/kg/hour IV were given. Blood gases were monitored every hour. The rabbits were returned to the cage after 6 hr of continuous monitoring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nJust prior to aspiration, animals were treated with saline, the control monoclonal antibody (anti-HIV gp-120 IgG 9E3.1F10), the full length murine anti-rabbit IL8 (6g4.2.5 murine IgG2a anti-rabbit IL8) or the pegylated 6G4V11N35A Fab′ (6G4V11N35A Fab′ modified with 40 kD branched PEG-maleimide as described in Section T above, denoted as “40 kD branched PEG-6G4V11N35A Fab′”). Data from saline or control antibody treated animals was combined and presented as “Control”. Arterial blood gases and A-a PO2 gradient measurements were taken daily, and IV fluid supplementation was performed daily. A-a PO2 gradient was measured at 96 hr of reperfusion. The A-a PO2 gradient was calculated as:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA\n-\naPO\n2\n=[FIO\n2(\nPB−PH\n2\nO\n)−(\nPaCO\n2\n/RQ\n)]−\nPaO\n2.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPaO2/FiO2 ratios were measured at 24 hr and 48 hr in room air and 100% oxygen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the final A-a PO2 gradient measurement, the animals were anesthetized with \nNembutal\n 100 mg/kg i.v. and the animals were euthanized by transecting the abdominal aorta in order to reduce red blood cell contamination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL). The lungs were removed en bloc. The entire lung was weighed and then lavaged with an intratracheal tube (Hi-Lo tracheal tube, 3 mm) using 30 ml of HBSS and lidocain. Total and differential leukocyte counts in the BAL were determined. Lesions/changes were verified by histological examination of each lobe of the right lung of each animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gross lung weight, total leukocyte and polymorphonuclear cell counts in BAL, and PaO2/FiO2 data obtained are depicted in \nFIGS. 67\n, \n68\n and \n69\n, respectively. Treatment with 40 kD branched PEG-6G4V11N35A Fab′ exhibited no effect on the biological parameters measured in the model as compared to the “Control” group. However, the data do not contradict the pharmacokinetic analysis or the in vitro activity analysis for the 40 kD branched PEG-6G4V11N35A Fab′ presented in Sections (V) and (X) above. In addition, these data do not contradict the ability of the 40 kD branched PEG-6G4V11N35A Fab′ to reach and act on disease effector targets in circulation or other tissues.\n\n\n \nZ. Additional In Vivo Efficacy Testing of Anti-IL-8 Antibody Reagents in Rabbit Model of Ischemia/Reperfusion and Acid Aspiration-Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)\n\n\n \n \n \nFull length murine anti-rabbit IL-8 monoclonal antibody 6G4.2.5 and 20 kD linear PEG-6G4V11N35E Fab′ were tested in a rabbit model of ischemia/reperfusion- and acid aspiration-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\n\n \nAntibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nA Fab′-SH antibody fragment of the affinity matured anti-IL-8 antibody 6G4V11N35E was expressed using the Fab′ expression plasmid for 6G4V11N35E (described in Section (T) above) in \nE. coli \ngrown to high density in the fermentor as described by Carter et al., \nBio/Technology, \n10: 163-167 (1992). Anti-IL-8 6G4V11N35E Fab′ variant was purified from fermentation paste and modified with 20 kD linear methoxy-PEG-maleimide as described in Example T above. Pegylated material was formulated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at physiological pH. Full length 6G4.2.5 antibody was obtained from hybridoma cell line 6G4.2.5 as described in Section (B) above and formulated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at physiological pH.\n\n\n \nSterile Surgical Procedures and Post-Operative Care\n\n\n \n \n \nMale New Zealand White rabbits weighing 2.2 to 2.5 kg (obtained from Western Oregon Rabbit Company) were anaesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine (50 mg/kg body weight), xylazine (5 mg/kg body weight), and acepromazine (0.75 mg/kg body weight). Intra-arterial catheter (22G, 1 in. Angiocath) and intra-venous catheter (24G, 1 in. angiocath) were be placed in the ear central artery and posterior marginal ear vein for blood samplings (arterial blood gases and CBC) and anti-IL-8 (or fluid) administration, respectively. The anaesthetized animals were transferred in a supine position to an operating tray; the abdominal area was shaved and prepared for surgery. Via a midline laparotomy, the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was isolated and a microvascular arterial clip applied at the aortic origin. Before the temporary closure of the abdomen using 9 mm wound clip (Autoclip, Baxter), 15 ml of normal saline (38° C.) was given intraperitoneally as fluid supplement. After 110 minutes of intestinal ischemia, the abdominal incision was reopened and the arterial clip was released to allow reperfusion. Before closure, 5 ml of normal saline (38° C.) was given intraperitoneally for fluid replacement. The laparotomy incision was closed in two layers and the animals allowed to awaken.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter surgery, the animals were placed on a heating pad (38° C.) and continuously monitored for up to 6 hours post reperfusion and lactated Ringer's 8-12 ml/kg/hr IV was given as fluid supplement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt 22-24 hr post-reperfusion, a tracheotomy was performed under anesthesia using ketamine, xylazine and acepromazine as described above. Normal physiologic saline was diluted 1:3 with water and adjusted to pH 1.5 (adjusted by using 1N HCL), and 3 ml/kg body weight was then instilled intra-tracheally through an uncuffed tracheal tube (2.0 mm I.D., Mallinckrodt Medical, Inc.). After instillation, the trachea was closed with 3-0 silk suture and the rabbits were allowed to recover. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37° C.+/−1° C. using a homeothermic heat therapy pad (K-Mod II, Baxter). Fluid supplements (LRS) at a rate of 5 ml/kg/hour IV were given. The rabbits were observed and blood gases in room air and in 100% oxygen were measured daily.\n\n\n \nDose Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nTreated animals received an intravenous injection of 7 mg/\nkg\n 20 kD linear PEG-6G4V11N35E Fab′ (n=5 animals) at 10 minutes before and 6 hours after acid instillation.\n\n\n \nOxygenation Measurement\n\n\n \n \n \nAlveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient (A-a PO2 gradient) was calculated as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA\n-\naPO\n2\n=[FiO\n2(\nPB−PH\n2\nO\n)−(\nPaCO\n2\n/RQ\n)]−\nPaO\n2\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere FiO2 is fraction of inspired oxygen, PB is barometric pressure, PH2O is partial pressure of water vapor, PaCO2 is arterial carbon dioxide pressure, RQ is respiratory quotient, and PaO2 is arterial oxygen pressure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA-a PO2 gradient and PaO2/FiO2 ratios for each rabbit were measured at baseline (pre-op), before acid instillation, every hour up to 6 hours after acid instillation, and every 24 hours thereafter.\n\n\n \nBronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL)\n\n\n \n \n \nAfter blood gases measurement at 72 hours post reperfusion, the rabbits were anesthetized with \nNembutal\n 50 mg/kg i.v. and were euthanized by exsanguination. The abdominal aorta was transected to reduce red blood cell contamination of bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The lung and heart were removed en bloc. The right lung was lavaged with an intratracheal tube (Hi-Lo tracheal tube, 3.0 mm) using 20 ml of HBSS and lidocain. Total and differential leukocyte counts of BALF were determined.\n\n\n \nGross Lung Weight\n\n\n \n \n \nThe whole lung from each rabbit was weighed immediately after harvest and was expressed as g/kg of body weight.\n\n\n \nPeripheral Blood Count\n\n\n \n \n \nBlood samples (0.05 ml for CBC, 0.2 ml for blood gases) were collected from the ear central artery catheter at baseline (pre-op), 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, and 22 hours post reperfusion (prior to acid or saline instillation) and at 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and every 24 hours after acid instillation. Hematology parameters were determined by Automated Hematology Analyzer according to the standard hematological procedures.\n\n\n \nPharmacokinetics\n\n\n \n \n \nBlood samples (0.5 ml) were collected from the ear central artery catheter at baseline (pre-op), 4 hours, and 22 hours post reperfusion and at 1 hour, 4 hours, and every 24 hours after acid instillation.\n\n\n \nResults and Discussion\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the rabbit model of ARDS, lung injury is manifested by hypoxemia (low PaO2—the pressure of O2 in the arterial blood, as measured by a blood gas machine), lung edema (evidenced by an elevated lung weight to body weight ratio) and pro-inflammatory infiltrates into the alveolar space (evidenced by high white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil (PMN) numbers). Although 40 kD branched PEG-6G4V11N35A Fab′ did not protect rabbits from lung injury at any of the doses tried (5 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) (see Section (Y) above), the 20 kD linear PEG-6G4V11N35E Fab′ had efficacy equal to, and, for some end-points, superior to that of the full length IgG murine anti-rabbit IL-8 monoclonal antibody 6G4.2.5 and prevented lung injury in the rabbits as shown in \nFIGS. 70A-70E\n. (The data points for 40 kD branched PEG-6G4V11N35A Fab′ treated animals, full length 6G4.2.5 treated animals, and saline treated animals appearing in \nFIGS. 70A-70E\n are taken from the data displayed in \nFIGS. 67-69\n and generated in Example Y above.) In addition, these data indicate that large effective size anti-IL-8 Fab′-PEG conjugates can exhibit useful levels of efficacy in acute lung injury and ARDS.\n\n\n \nAA. In Vivo Efficacy Testing of Anti-IL-8 Antibody Reagents in Rabbit Ear Model of Tissue Ischemia and Reperfusion\n\n\n \n \n \nFull length murine anti-rabbit IL-8 monoclonal antibody 6G4.2.5, 20 kD linear PEG-6G4V11N35E Fab′, 30 kD linear PEG-6G4V11N35E Fab′, and 40 kD branched PEG-6G4V11N35E Fab′ were tested in a rabbit ear model of tissue ischemia and reperfusion injury.\n\n\n \nAntibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nA Fab′-SH antibody fragment of the affinity matured anti-IL-8 antibody 6G4V11N35E was expressed using the Fab′ expression plasmid for 6G4V11N35E (described in Example T above) in \nE. coli \ngrown to high density in the fermentor as described by Carter et al., \nBio/Technology, \n10: 163-167 (1992). Anti-IL-8 6G4V11N35E Fab′ variant was purified from fermentation paste and modified with 20 kD linear methoxy-PEG-maleimide, 30 kD linear methoxy-PEG-maleimide, or 40 kD branched methoxy-PEG-maleimide as described in Example T above. Pegylated material was formulated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at physiological pH.\n\n\n \nAnimals\n\n\n \n \n \n1.0 to 1.5 kg New Zealand White rabbits were obtained from Western Oregon Rabbit Company.\n\n\n \nSurgical Procedure and Animal Evaluation\n\n\n \n \n \nThe procedure was essentially described by Vedder et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci\n. (\nUSA\n), 87: 2643-2646 (1990). Briefly, general anesthesia was achieved by intramuscular injections of Ketamine (50 mg/kg) plus Xylazine (5 mg/kg) and Acepromazine (2 mg/kg). The right external ear was prepared for surgery and under sterile procedure the ear was transected at its base, leaving intact only the central artery and vein. All nerves were transected to ensure that the ear was completely anesthetic. A straight microaneurysm clip (1.5×10 mm) was placed across the artery to produce complete ischemia. The ear was reattached with the clip exiting through the wound. The rabbits were then housed at 26° C. and 6 hours later the clip was removed to effect reperfusion. Untreated rabbits (n=11 animals) received an intravenous injection of vehicle (10 mM sodium acetate, 8% trehalose and 0.01% polysorbate-20 at pH 5.5) immediately prior to reperfusion. Treated animals received 5 mg/kg full length IgG murine anti-rabbit IL-8 monoclonal antibody 6G4.2.5 (n=4 animals), 20 kD linear PEG-6G4V11N35E Fab′ (n=3 animals), 30 kD linear PEG-6G4V11N35E Fab′ (n=3 animals), or 40 kD branched PEG-6G4V11N35E Fab′ (n=3 animals) immediately prior to reperfusion.\n\n\n \n \nThe ear volume and necrosis were measured daily by procedures described in Vedder et al., supra. Briefly, the ear was submerged in a beaker of water containing 1.2% Povidone iodine (Baxter) up to the intertragic incisure and the ear volume determined by the volume of fluid displaced. The ears were monitored in this manner for 7 days. The data are represented (in \nFIG. 71\n) as percent change in ear volume calculated as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchange\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\near\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvolume\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nEar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvol\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nday\n\n\n×\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\nEar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvol\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvol\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nAnimals were sacrificed at \nday\n 1 and \nday\n 7 for histological evaluation of the ear and the same section of ear was taken from all animals.\n\n\nTo determine that the therapeutic agents did not adversely affect any hematological parameter, aliquots of blood were withdrawn for complete blood counts and differentials immediately before reperfusion and at 24 hour intervals. In a separate experiment, blood samples were taken at 1, 5, 15, and 30 minutes and at 1 hour and 4 hours.\n\n\n\n \nResults and Discussion\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the rabbit model of ear ischemia reperfusion injury, antibody was administered intravenously at a single dose (5 mg/kg) at the time of reperfusion. In this model, ischemia reperfusion injury is characterized by tissue damage, edema and sometimes necrosis; all attributable in part to neutrophil-mediated damage. Monitoring of ear volume over time is a surrogate end-point for evaluating edema in the ear tissue. The resulting data (depicted in \nFIG. 71\n) showed that treatment with 20 kD linear PEG-, 30 kD linear PEG- and 40 kD branched PEG-conjugated Fab's effectively reduced ear swelling and edema at all time points of observation (\n \ndays\n \n 1, 3 and 5). In fact, the efficacy of all three PEGylated Fab's was statistically indistinguishible from that of the full length IgG murine anti-rabbit IL-8 monoclonal antibody 6G4.2.5 at all time points observed. These data support the efficacy of large effective size anti-IL-8 Fab′-PEG conjugates in ischemic reperfusion injury and specifically support the ability of 40 kD branched PEG-conjugated Fab′ molecules to reach and act on disease effector targets in circulation and other tissues.\n\n\n \nAB. Pharmacokinetic Studies of Two Constructs of Pegylated Anti-VEGF Fab′ Fragments Following Intravenous and Intraperitoneal Administration in Normal Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nThe objective of this study was to characterize and compare the pharmacokinetics of two pegylated species of the Y0317 affinity matured variant of humanized anti-VEGF F(ab)-12 (Y0317 is described in WO 98/45331 published Oct. 15, 1998) (International Application No. PCT/US98/06604 filed Apr. 3, 1998) when administered intravenously and intraperitoneally in normal mice.\n\n\n \nMethods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Y0317 anti-VEGF Fab′ was obtained as described in Example 3 of WO 98/45331. The Y0317 anti-VEGF Fab′ was pegylated with 20 kD linear PEG or 40 kD branched PEG using the thiol protection/deprotection maleimide coupling method described in Example T above to form 20 kD linear PEG-Y0317 Fab′ and 40 kD branched PEG-Y0317 Fab′, respectively. Pegylated Fab's were formulated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at physiological pH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMale CD-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Hollister, Calif.), weighing between 18.9 and 28.8 grams, were injected with a single intravenous (IV) or intraperitoneal (IP) dose of either 20 kD linear or 40 kD branched PEG-Y0317 Fab′ at approximately 3 mg protein/kg. Blood was collected via cardiac puncture upon terminal sacrifice at the following time points (n=2 per time point): pre-dose, 5 and 30 minutes; 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 32 hours; \n \n \n \nDays\n \n \n \n 2, 3, 5, 7 10 and 14. Serum was harvested and analyzed for PEGylated Y0317 Fab′ concentrations by ELISA. In addition, approximately 0.2 mL of serum was collected pre-dose from the \n \nDay\n \n 7 and 14 mice (orbital bleed) as controls for potential antibody analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor each PEGylated Y0317 Fab′, the pooled individual serum PEGylated Y0317 Fab′ concentration data following IV and IP administration were analyzed using a two-compartment and one-compartment pharmacokinetic model, respectively. Concentration values that were below the lower limit of the assay were not used in the analysis.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nTable 11 below summarizes the compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters of the 20 kD linear and 40 kD branched PEG-Y0317 Fab′. \nFIGS. 1 and 2\n display the serum concentration versus time profiles following IV and IP administration, respectively, for the 20 kD linear and 40 kD branched PEG-Y0317 Fab′.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of \n \nPK parameters\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n20K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n40K\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIV\n\n\nIP\n\n\nIV\n\n\nIP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDose (mg/kg)\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCmax (μg/mL)\n\n\n58.1\n\n\n11.5\n\n\n74.6\n\n\n49.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nTmax\n \n\n\n5 \nmin\n \n\n\n8 \nhr\n \n\n\n30 \nmin\n \n\n\n4 hr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCL (mL/day/kg)\n\n\n179\n\n\n236\n\n\n49.4\n\n\n37.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nt\n1/2 \nα (hr)\n\n\n1.34\n\n\n—\n\n\n1.78\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nt\n1/2 \nβ (hr)\n\n\n16.6\n\n\n16.0\na\n \n\n\n29.8\n\n\n28.3\na\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAUC (day · μg/mL)\n\n\n16.8\n\n\n12.7\n\n\n68.9\n\n\n91.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVss (mL/kg)\n\n\n139\n\n\n228\n\n\n82.8\n\n\n63.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBA (%)\n\n\n—\n\n\n75.6\n\n\n—\n\n\n133\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \na\nK10 half-life was reported for IP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter intravenous administration, the clearance of the 20 kD linear PEG-Y0317 Fab′ was 179 mL/day/kg and decreased to 49.4 mL/day/kg with the 40 kD branched PEG-Y0317 Fab′. Vss, also decreasing with a larger PEG size, was 139 and 82.8 for the 20 kD and 40 kD PEGylated species, respectively. In accord with the decrease in clearance and volume of distribution, an increased terminal half-life was observed for the larger PEG size (terminal t\n1/2 \nof approximately 17 and 30 hours for the 20 kD and 40 kD PEGylated species, respectively). After IP administration, the bioavailability was approximately 76 and 133% for the 20 kD and 40 kD PEGylated species, respectively. Results from previous pharmacokinetic studies with intravenous administration of an anti-CD18 Fab in a normal mouse model (Zapata et al., “Site Specific Coupling of Monomethoxypoly(ethylene) glycol to a single-sulfhydryl humanized Fab′”, poster presented at the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology FASEB Meeting held in San Francisco, Calif. on May 21-25, 1995; Abstract No. 1288 published in Zapata et al., \nFASEB J., \n9(6): A1479 (1995)) indicated that the clearance of a non-PEGylated Fab′ was approximately 4500 mL/day/kg and the terminal half-life was approximately 30 minutes. Taken together, these data indicate that 20 kD (linear) and 40 kD (branched) PEGylation of the Y0317 Fab′ resulted in an approximately 25-fold to 90-fold decrease in clearance and a 29-fold and 52-fold increase in terminal t\n1/2\n, respectively.\n\n\n \nAC. In Vivo Efficacy Testing of Anti-VEGF Antibody Reagents in Mouse Model of Tumor Growth\n\n\n \n \n \n40 kD branched PEG-Y0317 anti-human VEGF Fab′ was tested in a mouse tumor growth model.\n\n\n \nMethods\n\n\n \n \n \n40 kD branched PEG-Y0317 anti-human VEGF Fab′ was obtained as described in Example AB above. Y0317 anti-human VEGF MAb (full length IgG1) was obtained by fusing the Y0317 variable light (VL) and variable heavy (VH) domain sequences to constant light (CL) and constant heavy (CH) domain sequences, respectively, in separate pRK expression vectors as described in Eaton et al., \nBiochemistry, \n25: 8343-8347 (1986), co-transfecting the expression constructs into 293 cells or CHO cells, and harvesting antibody from transfected cell culture supernatant essentially as described in Example 1 of WO 98/45331 (published Oct. 15, 1998) (International Application No. PCT/US98/06604 filed Apr. 3, 1998). \nControl\n 40 kD branched PEG-6G4V11N35E anti-rabbit IL-8 Fab′ was obtained as described in Example AA above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman A673 rhabdomyosarcoma cells (ATCC; CRL 1598) were cultured as previously described in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics (Kim et al. \nNature \n362:841-844 (1993) and Borgström et al. \nCancer Res. \n56:4032-4039 (1996)). Female Beige nude mice, 6-10 weeks old (Harlan Sprague Dawley), were injected subcutaneously in the dorsal area with 2.5×10\n6 \nA673 tumor cells in a volume of 100 μl of matrigel. Animals were then treated with 40 kD branched PEG-Y0317 Fab′, Y0317 MAb, control 40 kD branched PEG-6G4V11N35E anti-rabbit IL-8 Fab′, or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at physiological pH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the \nlow dose\n 40 kD branched PEG-Y0317 Fab′ treatment group, 40 kD branched PEG-Y0317 Fab′ was administered at a loading dose of 2 mg/kg on \nday\n 1, followed by maintenance doses of 0.9 mg/kg daily for the remainder of the study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the \nhigh dose\n 40 kD branched PEG-Y0317 Fab′ treatment group, 40 kD branched PEG-Y0317 Fab′ was administered at a loading dose of 6 mg/kg on \nday\n 1, followed by maintenance doses of 2.7 mg/kg daily for the remainder of the study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the Y0317 MAb treatment group, Y0317 MAb was administered at a loading dose of 8 mg/kg on \nday\n 1, followed by maintenance doses of 0.8 mg/kg every third day for the remainder of the study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the control Fab′ treatment group, 40 kD branched PEG-6G4V11N35E anti-rabbit IL-8 Fab′ was administered at a loading dose of 6 mg/kg on \nday\n 1, followed by maintenance doses of 2.7 mg/kg daily for the remainder of the study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the PBS control group, 0.1 ml/day of PBS was administered for the duration of the study. All doses were administered intraperitoneally in a volume of 100 μl, starting 24 hr after tumor cell inoculation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach group initially consisted of 10 mice. Tumor size (length×width×height) was determined at weekly intervals. 17 days after tumor cell inoculation, animals were euthanized and the tumors were removed and weighed. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 74\n, at both doses tested (2 and 6 mg/kg), the 40 kD branched PEG-Y0317 Fab′ markedly suppressed tumor growth as assessed by tumor weight measurements three weeks after tumor cell inoculation. The decreases were 91% and 90%, respectively, in animals treated with the low and high doses of 40 kD branched PEG-Y0317 Fab′ versus 95% in animals treated with Y0317 MAb.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following biological materials have been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md., USA (ATCC):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nATCC\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterial\n\n\nAccession No.\n\n\nDeposit Date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhybridoma cell line 5.12.14\n\n\nHB 11553\n\n\nFeb. 15, 1993\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhybridoma cell line 6G4.2.5\n\n\nHB 11722\n\n\nSep. 28, 1994\n\n\n\n\n\n\npantiIL-8.2, \nE. coli \nstrain 294 mm\n\n\n97056\n\n\nFeb. 10, 1995\n\n\n\n\n\n\np6G425chim2, \nE. coli \nstrain 294 mm\n\n\n97055\n\n\nFeb. 10, 1995\n\n\n\n\n\n\np6G4V11N35A.F(ab′)\n2\n \n\n\n97890\n\n\nFeb. 20, 1997\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nE. coli \nstrain \n\n\n98332\n\n\nFeb. 20, 1997\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49D6(p6G4V11N35A.F(ab′)\n2\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\np6G425V11N35A.choSD\n\n\n209552\n\n\nDec. 16, 1997\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclone#1933 aIL8.92 NB 28605/12\n\n\nCRL-12444\n\n\nDec. 11, 1997\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclone#1934 aIL8.42 NB 28605/14\n\n\nCRL-12445\n\n\nDec. 11, 1997\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese deposits were made under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purpose of Patent Procedure and the Regulations thereunder (Budapest Treaty).
