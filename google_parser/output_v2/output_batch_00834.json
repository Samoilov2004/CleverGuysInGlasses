Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIdentification of the immunophilin protein, FKBP12, as a specific receptor for the powerful immunosuppressant drug, FK506, led to a burst of pharmaceutical research over the past decade. Much of that research was aimed at the discovery of other high affinity ligands for FKBP which might become clinically and commercially significant immunosuppressant agents. A variety of synthetic FKBP ligands were produced and evaluated, but with disappointing results. In the early 1990's it was learned that FK506 works, not simply by binding to FKBP, but by mediating the association of FKBP with the effector protein, calcineurin, to form the tripartite complex which actually mediates immunosuppression. This finding explained the absence of immunosuppressive activity for the many high-affinity FKBP ligands which are now known in the art. A body of synthetic knowledge pertaining to the design and synthesis of FKBP ligands had been developed which appeared destined to lie fallow. See e.g., \n \nUS Patent No. 5,192,773\n \n; \n \n5,330,993\n \n; \n \nWO92/19593\n \n; and \n \nWO94/07858\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLargely independent of the search for new immunosuppressive agents, however, pioneering work on the design, production and use of biological switches based on ligand-mediated multimerization of recombinant proteins, including immunophilin-based fusion proteins, was reported. See \nSpencer et al, 1993, Science 262:1019-1024\n and International Patent Applications \n \nPCT/US94/01660\n \n and \n \nPCT/US94/08008\n \n. Spencer et al reported a new class of biologically active substances based on \ndimers\n of FK506, covalently attached to each other via a synthetic linker moiety. The resultant dimers (\"FK1012\" molecules) are characterized by high binding affinities for immunophilin molecules and are capable of mediating the association or complexation of fusion proteins containing FKBP domains. However, FK1012 and related semisynthetic multimerizing agents are large, complex molecules which can be inconvenient to produce.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNew methods and materials for multimerizing chimeric proteins containing immunophilin moieties would be desirable, where the methods and materials involve smaller, simpler multimerizing agents which are more convenient to produce and which are more readily amenable to structural modification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImportant initial research based on N-oxalyl-pipecolyl and N-oxalyl-prolyl ligand moieties and aimed at providing wholly synthetic replacements for FK1012-type semi-synthetic multimerizing agents was disclosed in \n \nPCT/US95/10559\n \n. Further progress in this direction, including new multimerizing agents e.g. which are more conveniently prepared, have alternative pharmacokinetic profiles and/or which bind preferentially or with higher affinity to genetically engineered immunophilin domains relative to their binding to native immunophilin proteins would be very desirable.\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention provides new materials and methods based on N-acyl-pipecolyl ligand moieties for multimerizing chimeric proteins containing immunophilin-derived domains. The design and expression of fusion proteins containing a ligand-binding domain such as an FKBP domain and one or more effector domains has been reported, inter alia, in Spencer et al and in the international patent applications cited above in connection with Spencer et al, the full contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Numerous other accounts of successful application of this technology have also been reported. Essentially, the fusion proteins are designed such that association of the effector domains, through ligand-mediated \"dimerization\" or \"multimerization\" of the fusion proteins which contain them, triggers a desired biological event such as transcription of a desired gene, cell death, cell proliferation, etc. \"Multimerization\" as the term is used herein encompasses dimerization and higher order multimerization. In many such accounts, the ligand-binding domain of at least one of the fusion proteins is an FKBP domain. For further information and guidance on the design, construction and practice of such systems or components thereof, reference to the following publications is suggested: Spencer et al, 1993, supra; \nRivera et al, 1996, Nature Medicine 2, 977-978\n; \nSpencer et al, 1996, Current Biology 6, 839-847\n; \nLuo et al, 1996, Nature, 383, 181-185\n; \nHo et al, 1996, Nature 382, 822-826\n; \nBelshaw et al, 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93, 4604-4607\n; \nSpencer, 1996, TIG 12(5), 181-187\n; \nSpencer et al, 1995, Proc., Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92, 9805-9809\n: \nHolsinger et al, 1995, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92, 9810-9814\n; \nPruschy et al, 1994, Chemistry & Biology 1(3),163-172\n; and published international patent applications \n \nWO94/18317\n \n, \n \nWO95/02684\n \n, \n \nWO96/20951\n \n and \n \nWO96/41865\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe main focus of the subject invention is a new class of multimerizing agents which are useful as mediators of such protein-protein interactions in applications using fusion proteins containing FKBP domains. In some cases, the FKBP domains are genetically engineered, for instance, to replace the phenylalanine residue at ' position 36 with an amino acid having a less bulky R group, e.g. valine, alanine, methionine, etc. These multimerizing agents may be used in the various applications of the underlying dimerization-based technology, including triggering biological events in genetically engineered cells grown or maintained in culture or present in whole organisms, including humans and other mammals. The multimerizing agents may thus be useful as research reagents in biological experiments in vitro, in experiments conducted on animals containing the genetically engineered cells, and as prophylactic or therapeutic agents in animal and human health care in subjects containing genetically engineered cells.\n\n\n \n\n\nMultimerizing Agents\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to immunophilin-multimerizing agents of formula I\n\n \n \n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, including their individual stereoisomers and mixtures of stereoisomers, where M is an immunophilin-binding group comprising a moiety of formula II:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere G is independently selected from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n\nas defined below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nQ is also a moiety of formula II, or is a naturally occurring FKBP ligand such as FK506 or FK520, or is a synthetic FKBP ligand, of formula III\n\n \n \n\n(where R1, R2 and n may be selected from the definitions provided below) which may be readily prepared and multimerized by covalent attachment to linker moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMultimerizing agents of formula I comprise at least one moiety independently, selected from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n\nand include the following exemplary (and non-exclusive) classes:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the foregoing formulas, the following definitions apply:\n\n \n \n \nn = 2;\n \nX = O, NH or CH\n2\n;\n \nB\n1\n and B\n2\n are independently H or an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkynyl, heteroalkyl, heteroalkenyl, heteroalkynyl, heterocycloalkyl, heterocycloalkenyl, heterocycloalkynyl, aryl or heteroaryl, moiety, and contain up to 12 carbon atoms (not counding carbon atoms of optional substituents);\n \nY = O, S, NH, -NH(C=O-, -NH(C=O)-O-, -NH(SO\n2\n)- or NR\n3\n, or represents a covalent bond from R\n2\n to carbon 9;\n \nR\n1\n R\n2\n, and R\n3\n are the same or different;

The linker moiety may contain one or more ether, thioether, amine, amide, urea, carbamate, sulfonamide, thiocarbamate, ester, thioester, keto, hydroxyl and/or thiol moieties or substituents. Linker moieties may be conveniently joined to monomer M or Q through functional groups such as ethers, amides, ureas, carbamates, and esters; or through alkyl-alkyl, alkyl-aryl, or aryl-aryl carbon-carbon bonds. See e.g. the above cited international patent applications for numerous examples.\n\nFurthermore, linker moieties may be optimized (e.g., by modification of chain length and/or substituents) to enhance physicochemical or pharmacokinetic properties of the multimerizing agent. Numerous linker moieties and classes of linker moieties of general applicability to any of the monomers of this invention are exemplified in the various illustrative compounds disclosed herein.

The Synthetic Monomers Table sets forth a wide range of compounds synthesized and presents data from our Competitive Binding FP Assay for most of the disclosed monomers with respect to both wild-type human FKBP12 and a series of mutant FKBPs. The data show that the monomers of formula II bind to the modified FKBP proteins with IC50's in many cases in the hundreds, tens, and in some cases single digits (nM). A considerable number of the compounds bind to a modified FKBP with an IC50 value 10-fold, 100-fold, or 1000-fold or more better than for binding to wild type human FKBP12. Note that the first several compounds are monomers of formula III, included for the sake of comparison.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Synthetic Multimerizers Table sets forth a sample of multimerizers with data from the Competitive Binding FP Assay, Transcription Assay and Apoptosis Assay.

For instance, methods and materials may be adaptated from known methods for the synthesis of N-oxalyl-pipecolyl, N-oxalyl-prolyl and related monomers. See e.g. \nHolt, et al., J. Amer. Chem.

Additional guidance and examples are provided herein by way of illustration and further guidance to the practitioner. It should be understood that the chemist of ordinary skill in this art would be readily able to make modifications to the foregoing, e.g. to add appropriate protecting groups to sensitive moieties during synthesis, followed by removal of the protecting groups when no longer needed or desired, and would be readily capable of determining other synthetic approaches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example, monomers may be assembled and dimerized via a number of synthetic schemes and in various orders as illustrated in the following reaction schemes.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\nsee: \nYamashita, et al.

Attachment methods may be different for each monomer and the linker may be non-symmetrical and/or differentially functionalized to facilitate stepwise attachment of monomers. By way of example, the following reaction schemes illustrate formation of heterodimers.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nNote also:\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\nand:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nAdditional Optional Modifications\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn addition, compounds of this invention may comprise a substituted pipecolic acid derivative, numerous examples of which have been described in the literature. Using synthetic procedures similar to those described above, substituted pipecolates can be utilized to prepare monomers with \"bumps\" at positions C-2 to C-6 as exemplified below.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\nFor representative examples of substituted pipecolic acids see: \nChung, et al., J. Org. Chem., 1990, 55, 270\n; \nShuman, et al., J. Org. Chem., 1990, 55, 738\n; \nHanson, et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1989, 30, 5751\n; \nBailey, et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1989, 30, 6781\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nFKBP domains\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFKBPs (FK506 binding proteins) are the cytosolic receptors for macrolides such as FK506, FK520 and rapamycin and are highly conserved across species lines. Information concerning the nucleotide sequences, cloning, and other aspects of various FKBP species is already known in the art, permitting the synthesis or cloning of DNA encoding the desired FKBP peptide sequence, e.g., using well known methods and PCR primers based on published sequences. See e.g. \nStaendart et al, 1990, Nature 346, 671-674\n (human FKBP12); \nKay, 1996, Biochem. J. 314, 361-385 (review\n). Homologous FKBP proteins in other mammalian species, in yeast, and in other organsims are also known in the art and may be used in the fusion proteins to be multimerized by compounds of this invention. See e.g. \nKay, 1996, Biochem. J. 314, 361-385\n (FKBP review). The size of FKBP domains for such use varies, depending on which FKBP protein is employed. An FKBP peptide sequence for use in such fusion proteins will be capable of binding to a multimerizing agent of this invention and associating with other such fusion proteins, which may be the same or different. Multimerizer-mediated protein-protein association may be determined by direct or indirect means, known in the art. The FKBP peptide sequence may comprise a naturally occurring peptide sequence derived from the human FKBP12 protein or a peptide sequence derived from another human FKBP, from a murine or other mammalian FKBP, or from some other animal, yeast or fungal FKBP; may contain up to about ten (preferably 1-5) amino acid substitutions, insertions or deletions within that region relative to the naturally occurring sequence; may be a peptide sequence encoded by a DNA sequence capable of selectively hybridizing to a DNA molecule encoding a naturally occurring FKBP or may be encoded by a DNA sequence which would be capable, but for the degeneracy of the genetic code, of selectively hybridizing to a DNA molecule encoding a naturally occurring FKBP. \"Capable of selectively hybridizing\" as that phrase is used herein means that two DNA molecules are susceptible to hybridization with one another, despite the presence of other DNA molecules, under hybridization conditions which can be chosen or readily determined empirically by the practitioner of ordinary skill in this art. Such treatments include conditions of high stringency such as washing extensively with buffers containing 0.2 to 6 x SSC, and/or containing 0.1% to 1% SDS, at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 65-75°C. See for example \nF.M. Ausubel et al., Eds, Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, Units 6.3 and 6.4 (John Wiley and Sons, New York, 3d Edition, 1995\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFKBP domains, wild-type or modified, may be utilized in the context of fusion proteins expressed in genetically engineered cells to render the cells susceptible to multimerizer-dependent transcription of a heterologous or endogenous target gene, cell death, cell proliferation, deletion of a gene, or other biological event, as described in detail in \n \nWO94/18317\n \n, \n \nWO95/02684\n \n, \n \nWO96/20951\n \n, \n \nWO95/41865\n \n, the full contents of each of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIllustrative examples of FKBP chimeras useful in the practice of this invention include the FKBP fusion proteins disclosed in \n \nPCT/US94/01617\n \n (Stanford & Harvard), \n \nPCT/US94/08008\n \n (Stanford & Harvard), Spencer et al (supra), \n \nPCT/US95/10591\n \n (ARIAD) and\n \nPCT/US95/06722\n \n (Mitotix, Inc.); FKBP domains derived from a non-human source; variants of any of the foregoing FKBP fusion proteins which contain up to 10 (preferably 1-5) amino acid insertions, deletions or substitutions in one or more of the FKBP domains and which are still capable of binding to FK506, rapamycin or a compound of this invention; and variants of any of the foregoing FKBP fusion proteins which contain one or more amino acid residues corresponding to Tyr26, Phe36, Asp37, Arg42, Phe46, Phe48, Glu54, Val55, or Phe99 of human FKBP12 in which one or more of those amino acid residues is replaced by a different amino acid, the variant being capable of binding to a compound of this invention. Numerous mutant FKBP domains and fusion proteins containing them are disclosed in the various references cited in this section, including by way of illustration, FKBPs in which phenylalanine at position 36 is replaced with an amino acid having a less bulky side chain, e.g. alanine, valine, methionin or serine.\n\n\n \n\n\nBinding Properties, Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe multimerizing agents of this invention preferably do not measurably participate in a ternary complex with both immunophilin and calcineurin, or with immunophilin and FRAP (\nBrown et al., Nature, 1994, 369, 756-758\n), and are therefore not immunosuppressive like FK506 or rapamycin. Additionally, it will often be preferred that the multimerizing agent be physiologically acceptable (i.e., lack undue toxicity toward the cell or organism with which it is to be used), can be taken orally by animals (i.e., is orally active in applications in whole animals, including gene therapy), and/or can cross cellular and other membranes, as necessary for a particular application.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain applications, preferred multimerizers are those which bind, or comprise monomeric moieties, M, which bind, preferentially to mutant immunophilins (by way of non-limiting example, a human FKBP in which Phe36 is replaced with a different amino acid, preferably an amino acid with a less bulky R group such as valine or alanine) over native or naturally-ocurring immunophilins. For example, such compounds may bind preferentially to mutant FKBPs at least an order of magnitude better than they bind to human FKBP12, and in some cases may bind to mutant FKBPs greater than 2 or even 3 or more orders of magnitude better than they do to human FKBP12, as determined by any scientifically valid or art-accepted assay methodology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding affinities of various multimerizing agents of this invention or their component monomers with respect to human FKBP12, variants thereof or other immunophilin proteins may be determined by adaptation of known methods used in the case of FKBP. For instance, the practitioner may measure the ability of a compound of this invention to compete with the binding of a known ligand to the protein of interest. See e.g. \nSierkierka et al, 1989, Nature 341, 755-757\n (test compound competes with binding of labeled FK506 derivative to FKBP). One set of preferred multimerizing agents of this invention bind, or contain at least one component monomer which binds, to human FKBP12, to a mutant thereof as discussed above, or a fusion protein containing such FKBP domain, with a Kd value below about 200 nM, more preferably below about 50 nM , even more preferably below about 10 nM, and even more preferably below about 1 nM,as measured by direct binding measurement (e.g. fluorescence quenching), competition binding measurement (e.g. versus FK506), inhibition of FKBP enzyme activity (rotamase), or other assay methodology. In one subset of such compounds, the FKBP domain is one in which phenylalanine at position 36 has been replaced with an amino acid having a less bulky side chain, e.g. alanine, valine, methionin or serine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Competitive Binding FP Assay is described in detail in the examples which follow. That assay permits the in vitro measurement of an IC50 value for a given compound which reflects its ability to bind to an FKBP protein in competition with a labeled FKBP ligand, such as, for example, FK506.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne preferred class of compounds of this invention are those multimerizing agents or monomers which have an IC50 value in the Competitive Binding FP Assay better than 1000 nM, preferably better than 300 nM, more preferably better than 100 nM, and even more preferably better than 10 nM with respect to a given FKBP domain and ligand pair, e.g. human FKBP12 or a variant thereof with up to 10, preferably up to 5 amino acid replacements, with a flouresceinated FK506 standard. In one subset of that class, the FKBP domain has one of the abovementioned modifications at position 36.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of the multimerizing agents to multimerize chimeric proteins may be measured cell-based assays by measuring the occurrence of an event triggered by such multimerization. For instance, one may use cells containing and capable of expressing DNAs encoding chimeric proteins comprising one or more immunophilin-derived ligand binding domains and one or more effector domains capable, upon multimerization, of actuating a biological response. We prefer to use cells which further contain a reporter gene under the transcriptional control of a regulatory element (i.e., promoter) which is responsive to the multimerization of the chimeric proteins (at least one of which contains an FKBP domain). The design and preparation of illustrative components and their use in so engineering cells is described in \n \nPCT/US94/01617\n \n and the other international patent applciations referred to in this and the foregoing section. The cells are grown or maintained in culture. A multimerizing agent is added to the culture medium and after a suitable incubation period (to permit gene expression and secretion, e.g. several hours or overnight) the presence of the reporter gene product is measured. Positive results, i.e., multimerization, correlates with transcription of the reporter gene as observed by the appearance of the reporter gene product. The reporter gene product may be a conveniently detectable protein (e.g. by ELISA) or may catalyze the production of a conveniently detectable product (e.g. colored). Materials and methods for producing appropriate cell lines for conducting such assays are disclosed in the international patent application cited above in this section. Typically used target genes include by way of example SEAP, beta-galactosidase, Green Flourescent Protein and luciferase as well as proteins such as hGH for which convenient assays are commercially available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother preferred class of compounds of this invention are those which are capable of inducing a detectable signal in a 2-hybrid transcription assay based on fusion proteins containing an FKBP domain. Preferably, the FKBP domain is an FKBP domain other than wild-type human FKBP12.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother assay for measuring the ability of the multimerizing agents to multimerize chimeric proteins , like the FKBP-based transcription assay, is a cell-based assay which measures the occurrence of an event triggered by such multimerization. In this case, one uses cells which constituively express a detectable product. The cells also contain and are capable of expressing DNAs encoding chimeric proteins comprising one or more immunophilin-derived ligand binding domains and one or more effector domains, such as the intracellular domain of FAS, capable, upon multimerization, of triggering cell death. The design and preparation of illustrative components and their use in so engineering cells is described in \n \nWO95/02684\n \n. See also \n \nWO96/41865\n \n. The cells are maintainined or cultured in a culture medium permitting cell growth or continued viability. The cells or medium are assayed for the presence of the constitutive cellular product, and a base-line level of reporter is thus established. One may use cells engineered for constituive production of hGH or any other conveniently detectable product to serve as the reporter. The compound to be tested is addded to the medium, the cells are incubated, and the cells or medium is tested for the presence of reporter at one or more time points. Decrease in reporter production indicates cell death, an indirect measure of multimerization of the fusion proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother preferred class of compounds of this invention are those which are capable of inducing a detectable signal in such an FKBP-based apoptosis assay. Preferably, the FKBP domain is an FKBP domain other than wild-type human FKBP12. In some cases, the FKBP domain is modified at position 36, as discussed above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConducting such assays permits the practitioner to select multimerizing agents possessing the desired EC50 values and/or binding preference for a mutant FKBP over wild-type human FKBP12. The Competitive Binding FP Assay permits one to select monomers or multimerizing agents which possess the desired IC50 values and/or binding preference for a mutant KFBP or wild-type FKBP relative to a control, such as FK506.\n\n\n \n\n\nMonomers and Synthetic Intermediates\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMonomers, M, of formula II disclosed herein are also useful, both as synthetic intermediates, e.g. in the synthesis of dimerizing agents as disclosed in detail herein, and in their own right in view of their binding affinity for immunophilins or modified immunophilins. They may be administered to the engineered cells, or to organisms containing them (preferably in a composition as described above in the case of administration to whole animals), in an amount effective for reversing or blocking the effect of the multimerizing agent, i.e. for preventing, inhibiting or disrupting multimerization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be noted that compounds of this invention include mixed multimerizing agents of the formula M-L-Q, in which M is a synthetic monomer such as described herein, covalently linked by linker, L, to Q, a natural product immunophilin ligand such as FK506, FK520, rapamycin, cyclosporin A, or an analog or derivative thereof. Numerous such ligands and analogs and derivatives thereof are known in the art which may be linked to synthetic monomers using materials and methods described e.g. in \n \nPCT/US94/01667\n \n and \n \nPCT/US95/10559\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\nUses\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe multimerizing agents can be used as described in \n \nWO94/18317\n \n, \n \nWO95/02684\n \n, \n \nWO96/20951\n \n, \n \nWO95/41865\n \n, e.g. to regulatably activate the transcription of a desired gene, delete a target gene, actuate apoptosis, or trigger other biological events in engineered cells growing in culture or in whole organisms, including in gene therapy applications. The engineered cells contain and are capable of expressing DNAs encoding proteins containing one or more immunophilin domains, such as an FKBP domain or mutant FKBP domain, which are capable of binding to the monomers or to multimerizing agents comprising such monomers such as depicted in the various formulas herein and in the many examples disclosed herein. In such applications, the multimerizing agent is administered to the cell culture or to the organism containing the cells, as the case may be, in an amount effective to multimerize the proteins containing the corresponding ligand-binding domains (as may be observed by monitoring the transcription, apoptosis or other biological process so triggered). Thus, this invention provides a method for regulatably triggering one of theforegoing biological processes by administering a multimerizing agent of this invention which is capable of binding to fusion proteins expressed in the genetically engineered cells to be treated. In the case of administration to whole organisms, the multimerizing agent may be administered in a composition containing the multimerizing agent and acceptable veterinary or pharmaceutical diluents and/or excipients.\n\n\n \n\n\nFormations, dosage and administration\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBy virtue of its capacity to promote protein-protein interactions, a multimerizer of this invention may be used in pharmaceutical compositions and methods for promoting formation of complexes of chimeric proteins of this invention in a human or non-human mammal containing genetically engineered cells of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preferred method of such treatment or prevention is by administering to the mammal an effective amount of the compound to promote measurable formation of such complexes in the engineered cells, or preferably, to promote measurable actuation of the desired biological event triggered by such complexation, e.g. transcription of a target gene, apoptosis of engineered cells, etc.\n\n\n \n \nTherapeutic\n/\nProphylactic Administration\n & \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe multimerizers can exist in free form or, where appropriate, in salt form. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of many types of compounds and their preparation are well-known to those of skill in the art. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of this invention include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of such compounds which are formed, for example, from inorganic or organic acids of bases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may form hydrates or solvates. It is known to those of skill in the art that charged compounds form hydrated species when lyophilized with water, or form solvated species when concentrated in a solution with an appropriate organic solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically (or prophylactically) effective amount of the compound, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Carriers include e.g. saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof, and are discussed in greater detail below. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. The composition can be a liquid solution, suspension, emulsion, tablet, pill, capsule, sustained release formulation, or powder. The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, \netc.\n Formulation may involve mixing, granulating and compressing or dissolving the ingredients as appropriate to the desired preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical carrier employed may be, for example, either a solid or liquid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIllustrative solid carrier include lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and the like. A solid carrier can include one or more substances which may also act as flavoring agents, lubricants, solubilizers, suspending agents, fillers, glidants, compression aids, binders or tablet-disintegrating agents; it can also be an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely divided active ingredient. In tablets, the active ingredient is mixed with a carrier having the necessary compression properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain up to 99% of the active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include, for example, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes and ion exchange resins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIllustrative liquid carriers include syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, water, etc. Liquid carriers are used in preparing solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups, elixirs and pressurized compositions. The active ingredient can be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic solvent, a mixture of both or pharmaceutically acceptable oils or fats. The liquid carrier can contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such as solubilizers, emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners, flavoring agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, colors, viscosity regulators, stabilizers or osmo-regulators. Suitable examples of liquid carriers for oral and parenteral administration include water (partially containing additives as above, e.g. cellulose derivatives, preferably sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols, e.g. glycols) and their derivatives, and oils (e.g. fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil). For parenteral administration, the carrier can also be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate. Sterile liquid carders are useful in sterile liquid form compositions for parenteral administration. The liquid carrier for pressurized compositions can be halogenated hydrocarbon or other pharmaceutically acceptable propellant. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions which are sterile solutions or suspensions can be utilized by, for example, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection. Sterile solutions can also be administered intravenously. The compound can also be administered orally either in liquid or solid composition form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe carrier or excipient may include time delay material well known to the art, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate along or with a wax, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylmethacrylate and the like. When formulated for oral administration, 0.01% Tween 80 in PHOSAL PG-50 (phospholipid concentrate with 1,2-propylene glycol, A. Nattermann & Cie. GmbH) has been recognized as providing an acceptable oral formulation for other compounds, and may be adapted to formulations for various compounds of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of pharmaceutical forms can be employed. If a solid carrier is used, the preparation can be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form or in the form of a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier will vary widely but preferably will be from about 25 mg to about 1 g. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation will be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile injectable solution or suspension in an ampule or vial or nonaqueous liquid suspension.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo obtain a stable water soluble dosage form, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the multimerizer may be dissolved in an aqueous solution of an organic or inorganic acid, such as a 0.3M solution of succinic acid or citric acid. Alternatively, acidic derivatives can be dissolved in suitable basic solutions. If a soluble salt form is not available, the compound is dissolved in a suitable cosolvent or combinations thereof. Examples of such suitable cosolvents include, but are not limited to, alcohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 300, polysorbate 80, glycerin, polyoxyethylated fatty acids, fatty alcohols or glycerin hydroxy fatty acids esters and the like in concentrations ranging from 0-60% of the total volume.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the multimerizer, or the various formulations thereof, including tablets, capsules, injectable solutions, encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, \netc\n. Methods of introduction include but are not limited to dermal, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, pulmonary, epidural, ocular and (as is usually preferred) oral routes. The compound may be administered by any convenient or otherwise appropriate route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (\ne.g\n., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, \netc.\n) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. For treatment or prophylaxis of nasal, bronchial or pulmonary conditions, preferred routes of administration are oral, nasal or via a bronchial aerosol or nebulizer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, it may be desirable to administer the compound locally to an area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion during surgery, topical application, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of a skin patch or implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic to ease pain at the side of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration to an individual of an effective amount of the compound can also be accomplished topically by administering the compound(s) directly to the affected area of the skin of the individual. For this purpose, the compound is administered or applied in a composition including a pharmacologically acceptable topical carrier, such as a gel, an ointment, a lotion, or a cream, which includes, without limitation, such carriers as water, glycerol, alcohol, propylene glycol, fatty alcohols, triglycerides, fatty acid esters, or mineral oils.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther topical carriers include liquid petroleum, isopropyl palmitate, polyethylene glycol, ethanol (95%), polyoxyethylene monolaurate (5%) in water, or sodium lauryl sulfate (5%) in water. Other materials such as anti-oxidants, humectants, viscosity stabilizers, and similar agents may be added as necessary. Percutaneous penetration enhancers such as Azone may also be included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, in certain instances, it is expected that the compound may be disposed within devices placed upon, in, or under the skin. Such devices include patches, implants, and injections which release the compound into the skin, by either passive or active release mechanisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaterials and methods for producing the various formulations are well known in the art and may be adapted for practicing the subject invention. See e.g. \n \nUS Patent Nos. 5,182,293\n \n and \n \n4,837,311\n \n (tablets, capsules and other oral formulations as well as intravenous formulations) and European Patent Application Publication Nos. \n \n0 649 659 (published April 26, 1995\n \n; illustrative formulation for IV administration) and \n \n0 648 494 (published April 19, 1995\n \n; illustrative formulation for oral administration).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective dose of the compound will typically be in the range of about 0.01 to about 50 mg/kgs, preferably about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg of mammalian body weight, administered in single or multiple doses. Generally, the compound may be administered to patients in need of such treatment in a daily dose range of about 1 to about 2000 mg per patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of compound which will be effective in the treatment or prevention of a particular disorder or condition will depend in part on the characteristics of the fusion proteins to be multimerized, the characteristics and location of the genetically engineered cells, and on the nature of the disorder or condition, which can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo\n assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from \nin vitro\n or animal model test systems. The precise dosage level should be determined by the attending physician or other health care provider and will depend upon well known factors, including route of administration, and the age, body weight, sex and general health of the individual; the nature, severity and clinical stage of the disease; the use (or not) of concomitant therapies; and the nature and extent of genetic engineering of cells in the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceutical or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.\n\n\n \n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthetic Overview, part I:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe synthesis of functionalized chiral alcohols was carried out as follows.

Ausubel et al., Eds., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1994\n)]. Recombinant pure wild-type and mutant FKBPs were expressed and purified by standard methods (see eg. \nWiederrecht, G. et al. 1992. J. Biol. Chem. 267, 21753-21760\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor competition FP assays, the appropriate protein concentration (giving ∼90% binding of probe) was first determined by direct binding of probe to protein (see eg. Beacon FP System Applications Guide, Panvera Corp, Madison, WI). All binding assay procedures were performed at room temperature. Serial dilutions of each protein were prepared in 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.8/150 mM NaCl/ 100µg/ml bovine gamma globulin (\"FP buffer\": prepared using only low-fluorescence reagents from Panvera), and 100 µl volumes transferred to wells of a Dynatech micro-fluor black 96-well fluorescence plate. 100 µl of 10 nM \n \n4\n \n in FP buffer plus 2% ethanol (prepared from an ethanol stock of the probe) was then added to each well with mixing. Duplicate control wells contained FP buffer instead of FKBP (for 0% probe binding) or 10 µM wild-type FKBP (for 100% binding).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe plates were stored covered in the dark for approximately 30 min to permit equilibration and then the fluorescence polarization of the sample in each well was read on a Jolley FPM-2 FP plate reader (Jolley Consulting and Research, Inc., Grayslake, IL) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Polarization (mP units) for each protein concentration was plotted (y axis) vs. final concentration of FKBP (x axis). Concentrations were determined by OD280 measurements. Arbitrary units were used for non-quantitated proteins. Non-linear least square analysis was used to fit the curve and extract the K\nd\n of the protein for the probe (in cases where the protein concentration was known) using the following four-parameter equation: \n \n \ny\n \n=\n \nM\n \n⁢\n \n3\n \n+\n \n \n(\n \n \n(\n \n \n \nx\n \n+\n \nM\n \n⁢\n \n1\n \n+\n \nM\n \n⁢\n \n2\n \n \n-\n \nSQRT\n \n \n(\n \n \n \n \nx\n \n+\n \nM\n \n⁢\n \n1\n \n+\n \nM\n \n⁢\n \n2\n \n \n∧\n \n2\n \n \n-\n \n \n4\n \n*\n \n×\n \nM\n \n⁢\n \n1\n \n \n \n)\n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \n/\n \n \n2\n \n*\n \n \nM\n \n⁢\n \n1\n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n*\n \n \nM\n \n⁢\n \n4\n \n-\n \nM\n \n⁢\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere M1 is the probe concentration, M2 the K\nd\n, and M3 and M4 the minimum and maximum mP values respectively. The M3 and M4 fitted values were used to calculate the concentration of FKBP mutant that gives 90% probe binding, and this value was then used in subsequent competition experiments.\n\n\n \n(iii) \nDetermination of binding affinities (IC50s) of synthetic FKBP ligands using competition FP\n \n\n\n \n \n \nSerial 10-fold dilutions of each synthetic ligand were prepared in 100% ethanol in glass vials and stored on ice. All other manipulations were performed at room temperature. Purified recombinant wild-type or mutant FKBP was diluted to (200/98) x the concentration predetermined to give 90% probe binding, and 98 µl aliquots transferred to wells of a Dynatech micro-fluor black 96-well fluorescence plate. 2.0 µl samples of the synthetic ligands were then transferred in duplicate to the wells with mixing. Finally, a probe solution was prepared containing 10 nM \n \n4\n \n in 0.1% ethanol/FP buffer, and 100 µl added to each well with mixing. Duplicate control wells contained ethanol instead of FKBP ligand (for 100% probe binding) or ethanol instead of FKBP ligand and FP buffer instead of FKBP (0% binding).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe plates were stored covered in the dark for approximately 30 min to permit equilibration and then the fluorescence polarization of the sample in each well read on a Jolley FPM-2 FP plate reader (Jolley Consulting and Research, Inc., Grayslake, IL) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The mean polarization (mP units) for each competitor concentration, in some cases converted to % total binding by reference to the control values, was plotted (y axis) vs. log molar final concentration of competitor (x axis). Non-linear least square analysis was used to fit the curve and extract the IC50 using the following equation: \n \n \ny\n \n=\n \nM\n \n⁢\n \n1\n \n+\n \n \nM\n \n⁢\n \n4\n \n-\n \nM\n \n⁢\n \n1\n \n \n/\n \n \n1\n \n+\n \nexp\n \n \nM\n \n⁢\n \n2\n \n*\n \n \nM\n \n⁢\n \n3\n \n-\n \nx\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere M3 is the IC50. For incomplete curves the IC50 was determined by interpolation. FK506 was included as a control in each case.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe table below provides a sample of comparative IC50 values (nM) for a series of monomers with respect to human FKBP12 and mutants thereof. The monomers were tested in linkered and biotinylated form. The FKBP mutants were all point mutants or double point mutants in which phenylalanine 36 (F36) and/or phenylalanine 99 is replaced with a substitute amino acid (valine, alanine, serine, methionine or glycine). These data illustrate distinct binding preferences between pairs of synthetic compounds and mutant FKBPs. A graph is also provided (Fig 1) illustrating competition FP analysis of the binding of wild-type and mutant (F36V) FKBP to the synthetic ligand shown in column 3 of the IC50 Table, with FK506 as a control.\n\n\n \n\n\nCell-based transfection assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDimerizers may also be assayed for their ability to activate transcription of a reporter gene linked to a regulatory sequence responsive to the dimerization of FKBP-containing fusion proteins containing one or more transcription regulatory domains (e.g. DNA binding domains and transcription activation domains). We have made use of such as system as follows. Human 293 cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate procedure with plasmids PCGNNGF3 and PCGNNF3VP16, expressing Gal4 DNA binding domain (aa 1-147) fused to 3 copies of FKBP12 and 3 copies of FKBP12 fused to the VP16 activation domain (aa 411-490), respectively. The reporter plasmid (G5IL2-SEAP) used in these assays contains a gene that encodes for secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) under the control of the minimal IL2 promoter and 5XGAL4 binding sites placed upstream of the promoter. In all cases, a plasmid expressing growth hormone was used as an internal control to moniter transfection efficiency. Approximately, 16 hrs after transfection, the media was removed and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were refed with 2.5 ml of DMEM containing 10% serum and two hours later, synthetic dimerizers were added directly to the medium at appropriate concentrations in 5ul of ethanol carrier solution. Approximetely, 24 hrs after the addition of the drugs, 100 ul of the media was removed and assayed for SEAP activity and another 100 ul of the media was used to assay for growth hormone activity (to normalize for transfection efficiency).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults for a sample of our multimerizers in that system are shown below (see Dimerizer Assay Worksheet) at multimerizer concentrations from 0.1 to 10\n4\n nM, as indicated, normalized for hGH expression, and expressed as a % of maximal transcriptional activity observed with the prototype multimerizer, FK1012 (see Spencer et al, Science, supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalogous assays have also been conducted using cell lines such as 1080 cells in place of 293 cells; activation domains such as the NF-kB p65 activation domain in place of VP16; and the composite DNA binding domain, ZFHD1 (see \nPomerantz, J.L., et al. 1995. Science. 267:93-96\n.) in place of GAL4 (with the reporter gene linked to a DNA sequence recognized by ZFHD1 in place of a GAL4 site).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be appreciated that multimerizers of this invention will vary somewhat in their observed activity, depending on the particular chimeric proteins and other components of such systems. We recommend that the practitioner select multimerizers based on their performance in the particular system of interest.\n\n\n \n\n\nDimerizer-Dependent Activation of Signal Transduction\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMany cellular receptors can be activated by aggregation, either by their physiological ligand or by anti-receptor antibodies. Such aggregation of two proteins can often trigger a specific intracellular signal. One of the uses of multimerizers of this invention is to trigger activation of a receptor effector domain by oligomerizing fusion proteins containing such effector domains together with ligand-binding domains (such as FKBP domains) capable of binding to the multimerizing agent. Preferably, the FKBP domains are modified or selected to permit selective binding with a \"bumped\" multimerizing agent, i.e., containing at least one monomeric constituent M of formula II, even in the presence of endogenous, wild-type FKBP moieties in the cells to be treated. One example of an effector domain is the intracellular domain of Fas. Such domains have been incorporated into fusion proteins which also contain one or more FKBP domains and which are anchored to the cell membrane through a transmembrane protein anchor or through lipid modification of the protein(s), such as myristoylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo examples of the use of bumped dimerizer in signal transduction are to trigger receptor tyrosine kinase activation and to trigger apoptosis via Fas activation, which is discussed below. Unless otherwise mentioned all DNA manipulations were performed following standard procedures (\nF.M. Ausubel et al., Eds., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1994\n) and all protein protocols were performed following standard procedures (\nHarlow, E. and Lane, D. 1988. Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harb\nor.). All PCR products used to make constructs were confirmed by sequencing. For additional information and guidance in this regard, see the international patent applications cited infra.\n\n\n \n\n\nA. Constructs encoding chimeric proteins that include domain(s) of Fas\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability to control Fas activation and trigger apoptosis via a small molecule has applications both in gene therapy, where it may be used to selectively eliminate engineered cells, and in experimental systems. The proteins described here are anchored to the membrane by either of two methods: (1) by a myristoylation sequence or (2) via the low affinity NGF receptor, also called p75, p75 is useful experimentally because of the availability of antibodies to its extracellular domain, and its lack of high affinity interaction with any identified ligand (\nBothwell, M. 1995. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 18:223-253\n), but another protein anchor could substitute.\n\n\n \n\n\n1. Construction of expression vectors encoding chimeric dimerizable construct.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe construction of the expression vectors encoding one or more FKBPs and a myristoylaton domain or p75 domain and a Fas effector domain are described in detail in published international patent application \n \nWO96/41865\n \n. Conventional subcloning techniques were used to substitute modified FKBPs into these constructs (in place of wt FKBP domains) and derivatives thereof.\n\n\n \n\n\n2. Assay of Rapamycin-Mediated Fas Activation in Cell Lines\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of a dimerizer to activate the Fas signal transduction pathway and trigger cell death in cells engineered to express a FAS-FKBP fusion can be tested in cells appropriately transduced by retroviral vectors to express the desired fusion protein. A retroviral vector containing DNA encoding the construct of interest is used to make transducing supernatants by co-transfection via calcium phosphate precipitation of the vector DNA and DNA encoding proteins required for retroviral packaging (\nMuller et al., 1991, Molecular Cell. Biol. 11, 1785-1792\n). Alternatively, stable packaging cell lines can be transfected with the retroviral vector to generate retroviral vector supernatants. The retroviral supernatant is used to transduce target cells. To screen compounds and constructs, we used the human fibrosarcoma line HT1080. Two to three days after transfection, cells are plated into G418 and the resistant population or clones are isolated by standard means. To monitor dimerizer-induced apoptosis, cells are plated into a 96-well plate at either 5000 or 10,000 cells/well in MEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The next day, medium removed and replaced with freshmedium containing the test compound at various dilutions, in triplicate. In some cases, Actinomycin D is included at 50 ng/ml. Untreated wells are always included. The next day, medium is removed and replaced with medium containing 10% Alamar Blue viability indicator, which changes absorbance properties as a function of reducing agent released into the medium by cell metabolism. Alternatively, cells are counted. Optical density at the appropriate wavelength is measured using a platereader spectroscope. Results are normalized to the signal obtained by untreated wells (100%), and EC50 values determined. A control cell line that has been retrovirally transduced with vector alone is also tested as a control for any killing not due to the drug. Results from such assays are set forth in the Synthetic Multimerizers Table, infra. Cell populations and clones vary in the proportion of cells responsive to Fas, depending on the clone and the construct. Variations that work well can be readily identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs an alternative method for monitoring cell death, cells expressing a construct containing p75 followed by 2 mutant FKBPs followed by a Fas effector domain were transfected using an episomal vector, pCEP4 (Invitrogen Corp.) into which we had inserted DNA encoding hGH under control of a CMV promoter. The vector confers resistance to hygromycin. Clones resistant to hygromycin were selected and tested for response to dimerizer and expression of hGH after treatment with a dimerizer, AP1903. Monitoring Alamar Blue or hGH levels led to very similar EC50 curves for cell viability (measured as a % of control value) plotted against dimerizer concentration. In both cases the concentration of dimerizer corresponding to 50% of control was less than 1 nM.\n\n\n \n\n\n3. Assay of Dimerizer-Induced Apoptosis in Animals\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHT1080 cells expressing hGH and a Fas-FKBP construct as described above were harvested in PBS containing 10 mM EDTA plus 0.1% glucose, then washed and resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin plus 0.1% glucose. They were injected intramuscularly into nude mice in a volume of 100 ul, 2 ×10\n6\n cells/mouse. The next day, the mice received an intravenous injection of compound or vehicle. The next day and days following, blood samples were obtained and hGH was measured. Three multimerizers of this invention (of formula IV above) which were thus tested were found to decrease circulating hGH by 50% at the following doses: 0.2 +/-0.01 mg/kg; 0.5 +/-0.2 mg/kg; 2 +/-1 mg/kg (number of experiments ≥2 in all cases) as calculated from estimated initial plasma concentrations immediately after the injection. These results are consistent with effective cell killing, i.e., effective mediation of protein-protein interaction between the fusion proteins in the engineered cells within the mice."
