Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/295,177, filed Jan. 15, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProvided are certain chemical entities and compositions thereof that may be useful in the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancer can be viewed as a breakdown in the communication between tumor cells and their environment, including their normal neighboring cells. Signals, both growth-stimulatory and growth-inhibitory, are routinely exchanged between cells within a tissue. Normally, cells do not divide in the absence of stimulatory signals, and likewise, will cease dividing in the presence of inhibitory signals. In a cancerous, or neoplastic state, a cell acquires the ability to “override” these signals and to proliferate under conditions in which normal cells would not grow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBufalin is one of the predominant components of bufodienolides isolated from traditional Chinese medicine (Chan'su, toad venom), and it has been found to be active against several cancer cell lines. Its anti-cancer activities in animal models have been reported. Its clinical application, however, has been limited due to its poor solubility and narrow therapeutic index.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProvided is at least one chemical entity chosen from compounds of Formula I\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein\n\n\n \n \n \n \nZ is chosen from OR\n9 \nand NR\n10\nR\n11\n;

For example, —CONH\n2 \nis attached through the carbon atom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “optional” or “optionally” is meant that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances wherein the event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, “optionally substituted alkyl” encompasses both “alkyl” and “substituted alkyl” as defined below. It will be understood by those skilled in the art, with respect to any group containing one or more substituents, that such groups are not intended to introduce any substitution or substitution patterns that are sterically impractical, synthetically non-feasible and/or inherently unstable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “alkyl” refers to straight chain and branched chain having the indicated number of carbon atoms, usually from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, for example 1 to 8 carbon atoms, such as 1 to 6 carbon atoms. For example C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl encompasses both straight and branched chain alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. When an alkyl residue having a specific number of carbons is named, all branched and straight chain versions having that number of carbons are intended to be encompassed; thus, for example, “butyl” is meant to include n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl and t-butyl; “propyl” includes n-propyl and isopropyl. “Lower alkyl” refers to alkyl groups having one to six carbons. Examples of alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, 2-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, 2-hexyl, 3-hexyl, 3-methylpentyl, and the like. Alkylene is a subset of alkyl, referring to the same residues as alkyl, but having two points of attachment. Alkylene groups will usually have from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, for example 2 to 8 carbon atoms, such as from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. For example, C\n0 \nalkylene indicates a covalent bond and C\n1 \nalkylene is a methylene group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “alkenyl” refers to an unsaturated branched or straight-chain alkyl group having at least one carbon-carbon double bond derived by the removal of one molecule of hydrogen from adjacent carbon atoms of the parent alkyl. The group may be in either the cis or trans configuration about the double bond(s). Typical alkenyl groups include, but are not limited to, ethenyl; propenyls such as prop-1-en-1-yl, prop-1-en-2-yl, prop-2-en-1-yl (allyl), prop-2-en-2-yl; butenyls such as but-1-en-1-yl, but-1-en-2-yl, 2-methyl-prop-1-en-1-yl, but-2-en-1-yl, but-2-en-1-yl, but-2-en-2-yl, buta-1,3-dien-1-yl, buta-1,3-dien-2-yl; and the like.

Typical alkynyl groups include, but are not limited to, ethynyl; propynyls such as prop-1-yn-1-yl, prop-2-yn-1-yl; butynyls such as but-1-yn-1-yl, but-1-yn-3-yl, but-3-yn-1-yl; and the like. In certain embodiments, an alkynyl group has from 2 to 20 carbon atoms and in other embodiments, from 3 to 6 carbon atoms. “Lower alkynyl” refers to alkynyl groups having two to six carbons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “cycloalkyl” refers to a non-aromatic carbocyclic ring, usually having from 3 to 7 ring carbon atoms. The ring may be saturated or have one or more carbon-carbon double bonds. Examples of cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexyl, and cyclohexenyl, as well as bridged and caged ring groups such as norbornane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “alkoxy” refers to an alkyl group of the indicated number of carbon atoms attached through an oxygen bridge such as, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, sec-butoxy, tert-butoxy, pentyloxy, 2-pentyloxy, isopentyloxy, neopentyloxy, hexyloxy, 2-hexyloxy, 3-hexyloxy, 3-methylpentyloxy, and the like. Alkoxy groups will usually have from 1 to 7 carbon atoms attached through the oxygen bridge. “Lower alkoxy” refers to alkoxy groups having one to six carbons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “acyl” refers to the groups H—C(O)—; (alkyl)-C(O)—; (cycloalkyl)-C(O)—; (aryl)-C(O)—; (heteroaryl)-C(O)—; and (heterocycloalkyl)-C(O)—, wherein the group is attached to the parent structure through the carbonyl functionality and wherein alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, and heterocycloalkyl are as described herein. Acyl groups have the indicated number of carbon atoms, with the carbon of the keto group being included in the numbered carbon atoms. For example a C\n2 \nacyl group is an acetyl group having the formula CH\n3\n(C═O)—.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “formyl” refers to the group —C(O)H.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “alkoxycarbonyl” refers to a group of the formula (alkoxy)(C═O)— attached through the carbonyl carbon wherein the alkoxy group has the indicated number of carbon atoms. Thus a C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxycarbonyl group is an alkoxy group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms attached through its oxygen to a carbonyl linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “azido” refers to the group —N\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “amino” refers to the group —NH\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “mono- and di-(alkyl)amino” refers to secondary and tertiary alkyl amino groups, wherein the alkyl groups are as defined above and have the indicated number of carbon atoms.

For such fused, bicyclic ring systems wherein only one of the rings is a carbocyclic aromatic ring, the point of attachment may be at the carbocyclic aromatic ring or the heterocycloalkyl ring. Bivalent radicals formed from substituted benzene derivatives and having the free valences at ring atoms are named as substituted phenylene radicals.

Depending upon the manner of introduction, the chemical entities may be formulated in a variety of ways as discussed below. The concentration of the at least one chemical entity in the formulation may vary from about 0.01-100 wt. %.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe administration of the chemical entities described herein can be done in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, orally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intranasally, transdermally, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intrapulmonary, vaginally, rectally, or intraocularly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical dosage forms include at least one chemical entity described herein and one or more pharmaceutical excipients. As is known in the art, pharmaceutical excipients are secondary ingredients which function to enable or enhance the delivery of a drug or medicine in a variety of dosage forms (e.g.: oral forms such as tablets, capsules, and liquids; topical forms such as dermal, opthalmic, and otic forms; suppositories; injectables; respiratory forms and the like). Pharmaceutical excipients include inert or inactive ingredients, synergists or chemicals that substantively contribute to the medicinal effects of the active ingredient. For example, pharmaceutical excipients may function to improve flow characteristics, product uniformity, stability, taste, or appearance, to ease handling and administration of dose, for convenience of use, or to control bioavailability. While pharmaceutical excipients are commonly described as being inert or inactive, it is appreciated in the art that there is a relationship between the properties of the pharmaceutical excipients and the dosage forms containing them.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical excipients suitable for use as carriers or diluents are well known in the art, and may be used in a variety of formulations. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, A. R. Gennaro, Editor, Mack Publishing Company (1990); Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21\nst \nEdition, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (2005); Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3rd Edition, A. H. Kibbe, Editor, American Pharmaceutical Association, and Pharmaceutical Press (2000); and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives, compiled by Michael and Irene Ash, Gower (1995), each of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOral solid dosage forms such as tablets will typically comprise one or more pharmaceutical excipients, which may for example help impart satisfactory processing and compression characteristics, or provide additional desirable physical characteristics to the tablet. Such pharmaceutical excipients may be selected from diluents, binders, glidants, lubricants, disintegrants, colors, flavors, sweetening agents, polymers, waxes or other solubility-retarding materials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for intravenous administration will generally comprise intravenous fluids, i.e., sterile solutions of simple chemicals such as sugars, amino acids or electrolytes, which can be easily carried by the circulatory system and assimilated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage forms for parenteral administration will generally comprise fluids, particularly intravenous fluids, i.e., sterile solutions of simple chemicals such as sugars, amino acids or electrolytes, which can be easily carried by the circulatory system and assimilated. Such fluids are typically prepared with water for injection USP. Fluids used commonly for intravenous (IV) use are disclosed in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (2005). The pH of such IV fluids may vary, and will typically be from 3.5 to 8 as known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chemical entities described herein may also be used in conjunction with other well known therapeutic agents that are selected for their particular usefulness against the condition that is being treated. For example, the chemical entities described herein may be useful in combination with at least one additional anti-cancer and/or cytotoxic agents. Further, the chemical entities described herein may also be useful in combination with other inhibitors of parts of the signaling pathway that links cell surface growth factor receptors to nuclear signals initiating cellular proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch known anti-cancer and/or cytotoxic agents that may be used in combination with the chemical entities described herein include:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) other antiproliferative/antineoplastic drugs and combinations thereof, as used in medical oncology, such as alkylating agents (for example cis-platin, oxaliplatin, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, nitrogen mustard, melphalan, chlorambucil, busulphan, temozolamide and nitrosoureas); antimetabolites (for example gemcitabine and antifolates such as fluoropyrimidines like 5-fluorouracil and tegafur, raltitrexed, methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside, and hydroxyurea); antitumor antibiotics (for example anthracyclines like adriamycin, bleomycin, doxorubicin, daunomycin, epirubicin, idarubicin, mitomycinC, dactinomycin and mithramycin); antimitotic agents (for example vinca alkaloids like vincristine, vinblastine, vindesine and vinorelbine and taxoids like taxol and taxotere and polokinase inhibitors); and topoisomerase inhibitors (for example epipodophyllotoxins like etoposide and teniposide, amsacrine, topotecan and camptothecin);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) cytostatic agents such as antioestrogens (for example tamoxifen, fulvestrant, toremifene, raloxifene, droloxifene and iodoxyfene), antiandrogens (for example bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide and cyproterone acetate), LHRH antagonists or LHRH agonists (for example goserelin, leuprorelin and buserelin), progestogens (for example megestrol acetate), aromatase inhibitors (for example as anastrozole, letrozole, vorazole and exemestane) and inhibitors of 5a-reductase such as finasteride;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(iii) anti-invasion agents [for example c-Src kinase family inhibitors like 4-(6-chloro-2,3methylenedioxyanilino)-7-[2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)ethoxy]-5-tetrahydropyran-4yloxyquinazoline (AZD0530; International Patent Application WO 01/94341), N-(2-chloro-6-methylphenyl)-2-{6-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-methylpyrimidin-4ylamino}thiazole-5-carboxamide (dasatinib, BMS-354825; J. Med.

Critical reviews in oncology/haematology, 2005, Vol. 54, pp 11-29); such inhibitors also include tyrosine kinase inhibitors, for example inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor family (for example EGFR family tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-7-methoxy-6-(3-morpholinopropoxy)quinazolin-4-amine (gefitinib, ZD1839), N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-amine (erlotinib, OSI-774) and 6-acrylamido-N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-7-(3-morpholinopropoxy)-quinazolin-4-amine (CI 1033), erbB2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as lapatinib); inhibitors of the hepatocyte growth factor family; inhibitors of the insulin growth factor family; inhibitors of the platelet-derived growth factor family such as imatinib and/or nilotinib (AMN107); inhibitors of serine/threonine kinases (for example Ras/Raf signalling inhibitors such as farnesyl transferase inhibitors, for example sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), tipifarnib (RI15777) and lonafarnib (SCH66336)), inhibitors of cell signalling through MEK and/or AKT kinases, c-kit inhibitors, abl kinase inhibitors, P13 kinase inhibitors, Plt3 kinase inhibitors, CSF-IR kinase inhibitors, IGF receptor (insulin like growth factor) kinase inhibitors; aurora kinase inhibitors (for example AZD1152, PH739358, VX-680, MLN8054, R763, MP235, MP529, VX-528 and AX39459) and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors such as CDK2 and/or CDK4 inhibitors;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(v) antiangiogenic agents such as those which inhibit the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor, [for example the anti-vascular endothelial cell growth factor antibody bevacizumab (Avastin™) and for example, a VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as vandetanib(ZD6474), vatalanib (PTK787), sunitinib (SU11248), axitinib (AG-013736), pazopanib (GW 786034) and 4.{4-fluoro-2-methylindol-5-yloxy)-6-methoxy-7-(3pyrrolidin-1-ylpropoxy)quinazoline (AZD2171; Example 240 within WO 00/47212), compounds such as those disclosed in International Patent Applications WO 97/22596, WO 97/30035, WO 97/32856 and WO 98/13354 and compounds that work by other mechanisms (for example linomide, inhibitors of integrin av˜3 function and angiostatin));\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(vi) vascular damaging agents such as Combretastatin A4 and compounds disclosed in International Patent Applications WO 99/02166, WO 00/40529, WO 00/41669, WO 01/92224, WO 02/04434 and WO 02/08213;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(vii) an endothelin receptor antagonist, for example zibotentan (ZD4054) or atrasentan;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(viii) antisense therapies, for example those which are directed to the targets listed above, such as ISIS 2503, an anti-ras antisense;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ix) gene therapy approaches, including for example approaches to replace aberrant genes such as aberrant p53 or aberrant BRCA1 or BRCA2, GDEPT (gene-directed enzyme pro-drug therapy) approaches such as those using cytosine deaminase, thymidine kinase or a bacterial nitroreductase enzyme and approaches to increase subject tolerance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy such as multi-drug resistance gene therapy; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(x) immunotherapy approaches, including for example ex-vivo and in-vivo approaches to increase the immunogenicity of subject's tumor cells, such as transfection with cytokines such as interleukin 2, interleukin 4 or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, approaches to decrease T-cell anergy, approaches using transfected immune cells such as cytokine-transfected dendritic cells, approaches using cytokine-transfected tumor cell lines and approaches using anti-idiotypic antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the at least one chemical entity is administered in combination with one or more agents chosen from pacliataxel, bortezomib, dacarbazine, gemcitabine, trastuzumab, bevacizumab, capecitabine, docetaxel, erlotinib, aromatase inhibitors, such as AROMASIN™ (exemestane), and estrogen receptor inhibitors, such as FASLODEX™ (fulvestrant).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a chemical entity described herein is administered into a human subject, the daily dosage will normally be determined by the prescribing physician with the dosage generally varying according to the age, weight, and response of the individual subject, as well as the severity of the subject's symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one exemplary application, a suitable amount of at least one chemical entity is administered to a mammal undergoing treatment for cancer, for example, breast cancer. Administration typically occurs in an amount of between about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day (administered in single or divided doses), such as at least about 0.1 mg/kg of body weight per day. A particular therapeutic dosage can include, e.g., from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg of the chemical entity, such as including, e.g., from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg. The quantity of the at least one chemical entity in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from about 0.1 mg to 1000 mg, such as from about 1 mg to 300 mg, for example 10 mg to 200 mg, according to the particular application. The amount administered will vary depending on the particular IC\n50 \nvalue of the at least one chemical entity used and the judgment of the attending clinician taking into consideration factors such as health, weight, and age. In combinational applications in which the at least one chemical entity described herein is not the sole active ingredient, it may be possible to administer lesser amounts of the at least one chemical entity and still have therapeutic or prophylactic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the subject and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the at least one chemical entity. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small amounts until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount and frequency of administration of the at least one chemical entities described herein, and if applicable other chemotherapeutic agents and/or radiation therapy, will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician (physician) considering such factors as age, condition and size of the subject as well as severity of the disease being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy can be administered according to therapeutic protocols well known in the art. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy can be varied depending on the disease being treated and the known effects of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy on that disease. Also, in accordance with the knowledge of the skilled clinician, the therapeutic protocols (e.g., dosage amounts and times of administration) can be varied in view of the observed effects of the administered therapeutic agents (i.e., antineoplastic agent or radiation) on the subject, and in view of the observed responses of the disease to the administered therapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, in general, the at least one chemical entities described herein need not be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition as a chemotherapeutic agent, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, be administered by a different route. For example, the chemical entities/compositions may be administered orally to generate and maintain good blood levels thereof, while the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered intravenously. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is well within the knowledge of the skilled clinician. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particular choice of chemical entity (and where appropriate, chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation) will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the subject and the appropriate treatment protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chemical entities described herein (and where appropriate chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation) may be administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the proliferative disease, the condition of the subject, and the actual choice of chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation to be administered in conjunction (i.e., within a single treatment protocol) with the chemical entity/composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn combinational applications and uses, the chemical entity/composition and the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation need not be administered simultaneously or essentially simultaneously, and the initial order of administration of the chemical entity/composition, and the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation, may not be important. Thus, the at least one chemical entity described herein may be administered first followed by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation; or the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation may be administered first followed by the administration of the at least one chemical entity described herein. This alternate administration may be repeated during a single treatment protocol. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the subject. For example, the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation may be administered first, and then the treatment continued with the administration of the at least one chemical entity described herein followed, where determined advantageous, by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation, and so on until the treatment protocol is complete.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in accordance with experience and knowledge, the practicing physician can modify each protocol for the administration of a chemical entity/composition for treatment according to the individual subject ‘s needs, as the treatment proceeds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe attending clinician, in judging whether treatment is effective at the dosage administered, will consider the general well-being of the subject as well as more definite signs such as relief of disease-related symptoms, inhibition of tumor growth, actual shrinkage of the tumor, or inhibition of metastasis. Size of the tumor can be measured by standard methods such as radiological studies, e.g., CAT or MRI scan, and successive measurements can be used to judge whether or not growth of the tumor has been retarded or even reversed. Relief of disease-related symptoms such as pain, and improvement in overall condition can also be used to help judge effectiveness of treatment.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples serve to more fully describe the manner of using the invention. These examples are presented for illustrative purposes and should not serve to limit the true scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn carrying out the procedures of the methods described herein, it is of course to be understood that reference to particular buffers, media, reagents, cells, culture conditions and the like are not intended to be limiting, but are to be read so as to include all related materials that one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize as being of interest or value in the particular context in which that discussion is presented. For example, it is often possible to substitute one buffer system or culture medium for another and still achieve similar, if not identical, results. Those of skill in the art will have sufficient knowledge of such systems and methodologies so as to be able, without undue experimentation, to make such substitutions as will optimally serve their purposes in using the methods and procedures disclosed herein.\n\n\n \nExample I\n\n\nPreparation of (R)-(3S,5R,8R,9S,10S,13R,14S,17R)-14-hydroxy-10,13-dimethyl-17-(2-oxo-2H-pyran-5-yl)hexadecahydro-1H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren-3-yl 2-aminopropanoate\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n(R)-(3S,5R,8R,9S,10S,13R,14S,17R)-14-hydroxy-10,13-dimethyl-17-(2-oxo-2H-pyran-5-yl)hexadecahydro-1H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren-3-yl 2-aminopropanoate\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo a solution of Boc-amino acid (11.3 mg, 0.06 mmol, 1.2 eq), HOBT (9.7 mg, 0.072 mmol. 1.44 eq), EDC (13.8 mg, 0.072 mmol, 1.44 eq) and DMAP (16.8 mg, 0.15 mmol, 3 eq) in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nwas added bufalin (20 mg, 0.05 mmol).

Taxol (positive control, Sigma) and compounds were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma), and the final concentration of DMSO in the medium was 1%. Tumor cells were plated in 96-well plates at densities from 4000 cells/well of a 96-well plate and allowed to adhere/grow for 24 h. They were then treated with various concentrations of drug for 72 h. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) was used to determine the number of viable cells at the time of compound addition and the number of cells remaining after 72 h compound exposure. The number of cells remaining after 72 h was compared to the number of viable cells at the time of compound addition by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm, allowing for the calculation of growth inhibition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll concentrations of compounds were tested in triplicate and controls were averaged over 4 wells. IC\n50 \nwas calculated by plotting the concentration of compound vs the percentage of inhibition in treated wells using GraphPad Prism 5.

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims priority of the benefits of the filing of Patent Application No. EP 05107066.2 filed Jul. 29, 2005; EP 06101278.7 filed Feb. 3, 2006; and PCT Application No. PCT/EP2006/064812 filed Jul. 28, 2006. The complete disclosures of the aforementioned related patent applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.\n\n\nThe present invention is concerned with macrocyclic compounds having inhibitory activity on the replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It further concerns compositions comprising these compounds as active ingredients as well as processes for preparing these compounds and compositions.\n\n\nHepatitis C virus is the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide and has become a focus of considerable medical research. HCV is a member of the Flaviviridae family of viruses in the hepacivirus genus, and is closely related to the flavivirus genus, which includes a number of viruses implicated in human disease, such as dengue virus and yellow fever virus, and to the animal pestivirus family, which includes bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). HCV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, with a genome of around 9,600 bases. The genome comprises both 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions which adopt RNA secondary structures, and a central open reading frame that encodes a single polyprotein of around 3,010-3,030 amino acids. The polyprotein encodes ten gene products which are generated from the precursor polyprotein by an orchestrated series of co- and posttranslational endoproteolytic cleavages mediated by both host and viral proteases. The viral structural proteins include the core nucleocapsid protein, and two envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2. The non-structural (NS) proteins encode some essential viral enzymatic functions (helicase, polymerase, protease), as well as proteins of unknown function. Replication of the viral genome is mediated by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, encoded by non-structural protein 5b (NSSB). In addition to the polymerase, the viral helicase and protease functions, both encoded in the bifunctional NS3 protein, have been shown to be essential for replication of HCV RNA. In addition to the NS3 serine protease, HCV also encodes a metalloproteinase in the NS2 region.\n\n\nFollowing the initial acute infection, a majority of infected individuals develop chronic hepatitis because HCV replicates preferentially in hepatocytes but is not directly cytopathic. In particular, the lack of a vigorous T-lymphocyte response and the high propensity of the virus to mutate appear to promote a high rate of chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis can progress to liver fibrosis leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma), making it the leading cause of liver transplantations.\n\n\nThere are 6 major HCV genotypes and more than 50 subtypes, which are differently distributed geographically. HCV type 1 is the predominant genotype in Europe and the US. The extensive genetic heterogeneity of HCV has important diagnostic and clinical implications, perhaps explaining difficulties in vaccine development and the lack of response to therapy.\n\n\nTransmission of HCV can occur through contact with contaminated blood or blood products, for example following blood transfusion or intravenous drug use. The introduction of diagnostic tests used in blood screening has led to a downward trend in post-transfusion HCV incidence. However, given the slow progression to the end-stage liver disease, the existing infections will continue to present a serious medical and economic burden for decades.\n\n\nCurrent HCV therapies are based on (pegylated) interferon-alpha (IFN-α) in combination with ribavirin. This combination therapy yields a sustained virologic response in more than 40% of patients infected by genotype 1 viruses and about 80% of those infected by genotypes 2 and 3. Beside the limited efficacy on HCV type 1, this combination therapy has significant side effects and is poorly tolerated in many patients. Major side effects include influenza-like symptoms, hematologic abnormalities, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Hence there is a need for more effective, convenient and better tolerated treatments.\n\n\nRecently, two peptidomimetic HCV protease inhibitors have gained attention as clinical candidates, namely BILN-2061 disclosed in WO00/59929 and VX-950 disclosed in WO03/87092. A number of similar HCV protease inhibitors have also been disclosed in the academic and patent literature. It has already become apparent that the sustained administration of BILN-2061 or VX-950 selects HCV mutants which are resistant to the respective drug, so called drug escape mutants. These drug escape mutants have characteristic mutations in the HCV protease genome, notably D168V, D168A and/or A156S. Accordingly, additional drugs with different resistance patterns are required to provide failing patients with treatment options, and combination therapy with multiple drugs is likely to be the norm in the future, even for first line treatment.\n\n\nExperience with HIV drugs, and HIV protease inhibitors in particular, has further emphasized that sub-optimal pharmacokinetics and complex dosage regimes quickly result in inadvertent compliance failures. This in turn means that the 24 hour trough concentration (minimum plasma concentration) for the respective drugs in an HIV regime frequently falls below the IC\n90 \nor ED\n90 \nthreshold for large parts of the day. It is considered that a 24 hour trough level of at least the IC\n50\n, and more realistically, the IC\n90 \nor ED\n90\n, is essential to slow down the development of drug escape mutants. Achieving the necessary pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism to allow such trough levels provides a stringent challenge to drug design. The strong peptidomimetic nature of prior art HCV protease inhibitors, with multiple peptide bonds poses pharmacokinetic hurdles to effective dosage regimes.\n\n\nThere is a need for HCV inhibitors which may overcome the disadvantages of current HCV therapy such as side effects, limited efficacy, the emerging of resistance, and compliance failures.\n\n\nThe present invention concerns HCV inhibitors which are superior in one or more of the following pharmacological related properties, i.e. potency, decreased cytotoxicity, improved pharmacokinetics, improved resistance profile, acceptable dosage and pill burden.\n\n\nThe present invention concerns inhibitors of HCV replication, which can be represented by formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nand the N-oxides, salts, and stereoisomers thereof, wherein\n\n\nthe dashed line represents an optional double bond between atoms C7 and C8;\n\n\nR\n1 \nis hydrogen or C\n1-6\nalkyl;\n\n\nR\n2 \nis hydrogen or C\n1-6\nalkyl; and\n\n\nn is 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\n\n\nThe present invention concerns two subgroups of inhibitors of HCV replication, which can be represented by formula (I-a) and (I-b):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nand the N-oxides, salts, and stereoisomers thereof, wherein\n\n\nR\n1\n, R\n2 \nand n are as defined herein.\n\n\n\nThe invention further relates to methods for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I), the N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines, metal complexes, and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, its intermediates, and the use of the intermediates in the preparation of the compounds of formula (I).\n\n\nThe invention relates to the compounds of formula (I) per se, the N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines, metal complexes, and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, for use as a medicament.

Or the invention relates to a method of inhibiting HCV replication in a warm-blooded animal said method comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of formula (I), or a N-oxide, addition salt, quaternary amine, metal complex, or stereochemically isomeric forms thereof.\n\n\nAs used in the foregoing and hereinafter, the following definitions apply unless otherwise noted.\n\n\nAs used herein “C\n1-6\nalkyl” as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as for example methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, 1-butyl, 2-butyl, 2-methyl-1-propyl, 1-pentyl, 2-pentyl, 3-pentyl, 1-hexyl, 2-hexyl, 2-methyl-1-butyl, 2-methyl-1-pentyl, 2-ethyl-1-butyl, 3-methyl-2-pentyl, and the like.

The term “stereochemically isomeric forms” as used herein defines all the possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded by the same sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not interchangeable, which the compounds of formula (I) may possess.\n\n\nWith reference to the instances where (R) or (5) is used to designate the absolute configuration of a chiral atom within a substituent, the designation is done taking into consideration the whole compound and not the substituent in isolation.\n\n\nUnless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound encompasses the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, which said compound may possess. Said mixture may contain all diastereomers and/or enantiomers of the basic molecular structure of said compound. All stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of the present invention both in pure form or mixed with each other are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nPure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates as mentioned herein are defined as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the same basic molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates. In particular, the term “stereoisomerically pure” concerns compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of at least 80% (i.e. minimum 90% of one isomer and maximum 10% of the other possible isomers) up to a stereoisomeric excess of 100% (i.e. 100% of one isomer and none of the other), more in particular, compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of 90% up to 100%, even more in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 94% up to 100% and most in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 97% up to 100%. The terms “enantiomerically pure” and “diastereomerically pure” should be understood in a similar way, but then having regard to the enantiomeric excess, and the diastereomeric excess, respectively, of the mixture in question.\n\n\nPure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates of this invention may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For instance, enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids or bases. Examples thereof are tartaric acid, dibenzoyl-tartaric acid, ditoluoyltartaric acid and camphosulfonic acid. Alternatively, enantiomers may be separated by chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably, if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.\n\n\nThe diastereomeric racemates of the compounds of formula (I) can be obtained separately by conventional methods. Appropriate physical separation methods that may advantageously be employed are, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column chromatography.\n\n\nFor some of the compounds of formula (I), their N-oxides, salts, solvates, quaternary amines, or metal complexes, and the intermediates used in the preparation thereof, the absolute stereochemical configuration was not experimentally determined. A person skilled in the art is able to determine the absolute configuration of such compounds using art-known methods such as, for example, X-ray diffraction.\n\n\nThe present invention is also intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring on the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Isotopes of carbon include C-13 and C-14.\n\n\nThe term “prodrug” as used throughout this text means the pharmacologically acceptable derivatives such as esters, amides and phosphates, such that the resulting in vivo biotransformation product of the derivative is the active drug as defined in the compounds of formula (I). The reference by Goodman and Gilman (The Pharmaco-logical Basis of Therapeutics, 8\nth \ned, McGraw-Hill, Int. Ed. 1992, “Biotransformation of Drugs”, p 13-15) describing prodrugs generally is hereby incorporated. Prodrugs preferably have excellent aqueous solubility, increased bioavailability and are readily metabolized into the active inhibitors in vivo. Prodrugs of a compound of the present invention may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either by routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound.\n\n\nPreferred are pharmaceutically acceptable ester prodrugs that are hydrolysable in vivo and are derived from those compounds of formula (I) having a hydroxy or a carboxyl group. An in vivo hydrolysable ester is an ester, which is hydrolysed in the human or animal body to produce the parent acid or alcohol. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable esters for carboxy include C\n1-6\nalkoxymethyl esters for example methoxy-methyl, C\n1-6\nalkanoyloxymethyl esters for example pivaloyloxymethyl, phthalidyl esters, C\n3-8\ncycloalkoxycarbonyloxyC\n1-6\nalkyl esters for example 1-cyclohexylcarbonyl-oxyethyl; 1,3-dioxolen-2-onylmethyl esters for example 5-methyl-1,3-dioxolen-2-onylmethyl; and C\n1-6\nalkoxycarbonyloxyethyl esters for example 1-methoxycarbonyl-oxyethyl which may be formed at any carboxy group in the compounds of this invention.\n\n\nAn in vivo hydrolysable ester of a compound of the formula (I) containing a hydroxy group includes inorganic esters such as phosphate esters and α-acyloxyalkyl ethers and related compounds which as a result of the in vivo hydrolysis of the ester breakdown to give the parent hydroxy group. Examples of α-acyloxyalkyl ethers include acetoxy-methoxy and 2,2-dimethylpropionyloxy-methoxy. A selection of in vivo hydrolysable ester forming groups for hydroxy include alkanoyl, benzoyl, phenylacetyl and substituted benzoyl and phenylacetyl, alkoxycarbonyl (to give alkyl carbonate esters), dialkylcarbamoyl and N-(dialkylaminoethyl)-N-alkylcarbamoyl (to give carbamates), dialkylaminoacetyl and carboxyacetyl. Examples of substituents on benzoyl include morpholino and piperazino linked from a ring nitrogen atom via a methylene group to the 3- or 4-position of the benzoyl ring.\n\n\nFor therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the counter-ion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases which are non-pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutically acceptable acid and base addition salts as mentioned hereinabove are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid and base addition salt forms which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acid. Appropriate acids comprise, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric and the like acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic (i.e. ethanedioic), malonic, succinic (i.e. butanedioic acid), maleic, fumaric, malic (i.e. hydroxybutanedioic acid), tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, p-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids.\n\n\nConversely said salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate base into the free base form.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) containing an acidic proton may also be converted into their non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like.\n\n\nThe term addition salt as used hereinabove also comprises the solvates which the compounds of formula (I) as well as the salts thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are for example hydrates, alcoholates and the like.\n\n\nThe term “quaternary amine” as used hereinbefore defines the quaternary ammonium salts which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted alkyl halide, aryl halide or arylalkyl halide, e.g. methyl iodide or benzyl iodide. Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be used, such as alkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates, alkyl methanesulfonates, and alkyl p-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen. Pharmaceutically acceptable counterions include chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoroacetate and acetate. The counterion of choice can be introduced using ion exchange resins.\n\n\nThe N-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called N-oxide.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that the compounds of formula (I) may have metal binding, chelating, complex forming properties and therefore may exist as metal complexes or metal chelates. Such metalated derivatives of the compounds of formula (I) are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nSome of the compounds of formula (I) may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the compounds of formula (I) have several asymmetric centers. In order to more efficiently refer to each of these asymmetric centers, the numbering system as indicated in the following structural formula will be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsymmetric centers are present at positions 1, 4 and 6 of the macrocycle as well as at the carbon atom 3′ in the pyrrolidine ring. Each of these asymmetric centers can occur in their R or S configuration.\n\n\nThe stereochemistry at position 1 preferably corresponds to that of an L-amino acid configuration, i.e. that of L-proline.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) include a cyclopropyl group as represented in the structural fragment below:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein C\n7 \nrepresents the carbon at position 7 and carbons at position 4 and 6 are asymmetric carbon atoms of the cyclopropane ring.\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding other possible asymmetric centers at other segments of the compounds of the invention, the presence of these two asymmetric centers means that the compounds can exist as mixtures of diastereomers, such as the diastereomers of compounds of formula (I) wherein the carbon at position 7 is configured either syn to the carbonyl or syn to the amide as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne embodiment concerns compounds of formula (I) wherein the carbon at position 7 is configured syn to the carbonyl. Another embodiment concerns compounds of formula (I) wherein the configuration at the carbon at position 4 is R. A specific subgroup of compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the carbon at position 7 is configured syn to the carbonyl and wherein the configuration at the carbon at position 4 is R.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) also include a proline residue. Preferred are the compounds of formula (I) wherein the substituent at the 1 (or 5′) position and the substituent at position 3′ are in a trans configuration. Of particular interest are the compounds of formula (I) wherein position 1 has the configuration corresponding to L-proline and the substituent at position 3′ is in a trans configuration in respect of position 1. Preferably the compounds of formula (I) have the stereochemistry as indicated in the structure of formula (I-c) below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferably, the dashed line is a double bond between carbon atoms 7 and 8 in the compounds of formula (I), (I-c) or in any subgroup of compounds of formula (I). More preferably said double bond between carbon atoms 7 and 8 is in a cis configuration.\n\n\nIt is to be understood that the above defined subgroup of compounds of formulae (I-b), as well as any other subgroup defined herein, are meant to also comprise any N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines, metal complexes and stereochemically isomeric forms of such compounds.\n\n\nWhen n is 2, the moiety —CH\n2\n— bracketed by “n” corresponds to ethanediyl in the compounds of formula (I) or in any subgroup of compounds of formula (I). When n is 3, the moiety —CH\n2\n— bracketed by “n” corresponds to propanediyl in the compounds of formula (I) or in any subgroup of compounds of formula (I). When n is 4, the moiety —CH\n2\n— bracketed by “n” corresponds to butanediyl in the compounds of formula (I) or in any subgroup of compounds of formula (I). When n is 5, the moiety —CH\n2\n-bracketed by “n” corresponds to pentanediyl in the compounds of formula (I) or in any subgroup of compounds of formula (I). When n is 6, the moiety —CH\n2\n— bracketed by “n” corresponds to hexanediyl in the compounds of formula (I) or in any subgroup of compounds of formula (I). Particular subgroups of the compounds of formula (I) are those compounds wherein n is 4 or 5.\n\n\nPreferred embodiments of the invention are compounds of formula (I) or any of the subgroups of compounds of formula (I) wherein R\n1 \nis hydrogen or methyl.\n\n\nEmbodiments of the invention are those compounds of formula (I) or any of the subgroups of compounds of formula (I) wherein R\n2 \nis hydrogen, or C\n1-4\nalkyl, i.e. methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, tert-butyl, or isobutyl.\n\n\nA subgroup of compounds of the invention are those compounds of formula (I) or any of the subgroups of compounds of formula (I) wherein R\n2 \nis hydrogen.\n\n\nAnother subgroup of compounds of the invention are those compounds of formula (I) or any of the subgroups of compounds of formula (I) wherein R\n2 \nis methyl.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) consist of three main building blocks P1, P2, and P3, which are each delimited by a curved sinusoidal line. The building block P1 further contains a P1′ tail. The carbonyl group marked with an asterisk may be part of either building block P2 or of building block P3. The linking of building blocks P1 with P2, P2 with P3, and P1 with P1′, involve forming an amide bond. The linking of blocks P1 and P3 involves a double bond formation. The linking of building blocks P1, P1′, P2 and P3 to prepare compounds of formula (I) can be done in any given sequence. One of the steps involves a cyclization whereby the macrocycle is formed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe synthesis procedures described hereinafter are meant to be applicable for as well the racemates, stereochemically pure intermediates or end products, as any stereoisomeric mixtures. The racemates or stereochemical mixtures may be separated into stereoisomeric forms at any stage of the synthesis procedures. In one embodiment, the intermediates and end products have the stereochemistry specified above in the compounds of formula (I-c).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, compounds (I) are prepared by first forming the amide bonds and subsequent forming the double bond linkage between P3 and P1 with concomitant cyclization to the macrocycle.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, compounds (I) wherein the bond between C\n7 \nand C\n8 \nis a double bond, which are compounds of formula (I-a), as defined above, may be prepared by as outlined in the following reaction scheme:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormation of the macrocycle can be carried out via an olefin metathesis reaction in the presence of a suitable metal catalyst such as e.g. the Ru-based catalyst reported by Miller, S. J., Blackwell, H. E., Grubbs, R. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118, (1996), 9606-9614; Kingsbury, J. S., Harrity, J. P. A., Bonitatebus, P. J., Hoveyda, A. H., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, (1999), 791-799; and Huang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, (1999), 2674-2678; for example a Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst.\n\n\nAir-stable ruthenium catalysts such as bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)-3-phenyl-1H-inden-1-ylidene ruthenium chloride (Neolyst M1®) or bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)-[(phenylthio)methylene]ruthenium (IV) dichloride can be used. Other catalysts that can be used are Grubbs first and second generation catalysts, i.e. Benzylidene-bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)dichlororuthenium and (1,3-bis-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2-imidazolidinylidene)dichloro(phenylmethylene)-(tricyclohexylphosphine)ruthenium, respectively. Of particular interest are the Hoveyda-Grubbs first and second generation catalysts, which are dichloro(o-isopropoxyphenylmethylene)(tricyclohexylphosphine)-ruthenium(II) and 1,3-bis-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2-imidazolidinylidene)dichloro(o-isopropoxyphenylmethylene)ruthenium respectively. Also other catalysts containing other transition metals such as Mo can be used for this reaction.\n\n\nThe metathesis reactions may be conducted in a suitable solvent such as for example ethers, e.g. THF, dioxane; halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichoromethane, CHCl\n3\n, 1,2-dichloroethane and the like. In a preferred embodiment, the metathesis reaction is conducted in toluene. These reactions are conducted at increased temperatures under nitrogen atmosphere.\n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) wherein the link between C7 and C8 in the macrocycle is a single bond, i.e. compounds of formula (I-b), can be prepared from the compounds of formula (I-a) by a reduction of the C7-C8 double bond in the compounds of formula (I-a). This reduction may be conducted by catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence of a noble metal catalyst such as, for example, Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru or Raney nickel. Of interest is Rh on alumina. The hydrogenation reaction preferably is conducted in a solvent such as, e.g. an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, or an ether such as THF, or mixtures thereof. Water can also be added to these solvents or solvent mixtures.\n\n\nThe tail P1′ can be connected to the P1 building block at any stage of the synthesis, i.e. before or after the cyclization, or before or after the cyclization and reduction as explained herein above. P1′ can be linked to P1 by forming an amide bond between both moieties. In one embodiment, the P1′ group is introduced in the last step of the synthesis of the compounds (I) as outlined in the following reaction scheme wherein G represents a group:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this procedure, a cyclopropylsulfonamide (IV) is reacted with an intermediate (III) via an amide forming reaction such as any of the procedures for the formation of an amide bond described hereinafter. In particular, (III) may be treated with a coupling agent, for example N,N′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), EEDQ, IIDQ, EDCI or benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (commercially available as PyBOP®), in a solvent like THF, followed by reaction with the desired cyclopropylsulfonamide (IV) in the presence of a base for example a trialkylamine such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, or 1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) or diisopropylethylamine.\n\n\nThe activation of the carboxylic acid in (III) as described in the above reactions may lead to an internal cyclization reaction to an azalactone intermediate of formula\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1 \nand n are as specified above and wherein the stereogenic centers may have the stereochemical configuration as specified above, in particular as in (I-c). The intermediates (III-a) can be isolated from the reaction mixture, using conventional methodology, and the isolated intermediate (III-a) is then reacted with (IV), or the reaction mixture containing (III-a) can be reacted further with (IV) without isolation of (III-a). In one embodiment, where the reaction with the coupling agent is conducted in a water-immiscible solvent, the reaction mixture containing (III-a) may be washed with water or with slightly basic water in order to remove all water-soluble side products. The thus obtained washed solution may then be reacted with (IV) without additional purification steps. The isolation of intermediates (III-a) on the other hand may provide certain advantages in that the isolated product, after optional further purification, may be reacted with (IV), giving rise to less side products and an easier work-up of the reaction.\n\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) can also be prepared by etherifying an intermediate (V) with a quinoline of formula (VI) as outlined in the following reaction scheme:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX in (VI) represents hydroxy or a leaving group such as a halide, e.g. bromide or chloride, or an arylsulfonyl group, e.g. mesylate, triflate or tosylate and the like.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the reaction of (V) with (VI) is an O-arylation reaction and X represents a leaving group. This reaction can be conducted following the procedures described by E. M. Smith et al. (J. Med. Chem. (1988), 31, 875-885). In particular, this reaction is conducted in the presence of a base, preferably a strong base, in a reaction-inert solvent, e.g. one of the solvents mentioned for the formation of an amide bond.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, starting material (V) is reacted with quinoline (VI) in the presence of a base which is strong enough to detract a hydrogen from the hydroxy group, for example an alkali of alkaline metal hydride such as LiH or sodium hydride, or alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium or potassium methoxide or ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, in a reaction inert solvent like a dipolar aprotic solvent, e.g. DMA, DMF and the like. The resulting alcoholate is reacted with the arylating agent (VII), wherein X is a suitable leaving group as mentioned above. The conversion of (V) to (I) using an O-arylation reaction does not change the stereochemical configuration at the carbon bearing the hydroxy or —O-quinoline group.\n\n\nAlternatively, the reaction of (V) with (VI) can also be conducted via a Mitsunobu reaction (Mitsunobu, 1981, Synthesis, January, 1-28; Rano et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 22, 3779-3792; Krchnak et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 5, 6193-6196; Richter et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1994, 35, 27, 4705-4706). This reaction comprises treatment of intermediate (V) with quinoline (VI) wherein X is hydroxyl, in the presence of triphenylphosphine and an activating agent such as a dialkyl azocarboxylate, e.g. diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD), diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) or the like. The Mitsunobu reaction changes the stereochemical configuration at the carbon bearing the hydroxy or —O-quinoline group.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) wherein R\n1 \nis hydrogen, said compounds being represented by (I-d) can also be prepared from a corresponding nitrogen-protected intermediate (VII) wherein PG represents a nitrogen protecting group. Suitable N-protecting groups are described hereinafter. In one embodiment, PG in (VII) is benzyl or substituted benzyl, in particular 4-methoxybenzyl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe starting materials (VII) in the above reaction can be prepared following the procedures described for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I), but using intermediates wherein the group R\n1 \nis PG.\n\n\nAlternatively, in order to prepare the compounds of formula (I), first an amide bond between building blocks P2 and P1 is formed, followed by coupling of the P3 building block to the P1 moiety in P1-P2, and a subsequent amide bond formation between P3 and the P2 moiety in P2-P1-P3 with concomitant ring closure. Yet again, the tail P1′ can be bonded to the P1 building block at any stage of the synthesis of the compounds of formula (I), for example before or after coupling the building blocks P2 and P1; before or after coupling the P3 building block to P1; or before or after coupling building blocks P3 and P2 and the concomitant ring closure.\n\n\nYet another alternative synthetic methodology is the formation of an amide bond between building blocks P2 and P3, followed by the coupling of building block P1 to P3, and a last amide bond formation between P1 and P2 with concomitant ring closure. Yet again, the tail P1′ can be bonded to the P1 building block at any stage of the synthesis of the compounds of formula (I), i.e. in the present case, before or after coupling the building blocks P2 and P3; before or after coupling the building blocks P1 and P3; before or after coupling P1 and P2 with concomitant ring closure.\n\n\nBuilding blocks P1 and P3 can be linked via double bond formation at carbons 7 and 8, if desired, followed by a reduction of the C7-C8 double bond. The thus formed P1-P3 block can be coupled to building block P2 and subsequently cyclized, by forming amide bonds. In a preferred embodiment, building block P1-P3 is not reduced and coupled as such with P2 and cyclized, yielding compounds (I-1).\n\n\nBuilding blocks P1 and P3 in any of the previous approaches can be linked via double bond formation, e.g. by the olefin metathesis reaction described hereinafter, or a Wittig type reaction.\n\n\nIt should be noted that in compounds of formula (I), the amide bond formation between blocks P2 and P3 may be accomplished at two different positions of the urea moiety. A first amide bond formation encompasses reacting the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine ring with the adjacent activated carbonyl (marked with an asterisk) being part of the P3 building block. An alternative second amide bond formation involves the reaction of the asterisked activated carbonyl being part of the P2 building block with an NHRR\n1 \ngroup, wherein R\n1 \nis as defined for the compounds of formula (I) or a subgroup thereof, and wherein R\n1 \nmay further be a nitrogen-protecting group; and R is the P3 alkyl moiety. The activated asterisked carbonyl can be introduced by reacting the pyrrolidine or amine NHRR\n1 \nwith phosgene or a phosgene derivative.\n\n\nThe individual building blocks can first be prepared and subsequently coupled together or alternatively, precursors of the building blocks can be coupled together and modified at a later stage to the desired molecular composition.\n\n\nThe functionalities in each of the building blocks may be protected to avoid side reactions.\n\n\nThe formation of amide bonds can be carried out using standard procedures such as those used for coupling amino acids in peptide synthesis. The latter involves the dehydrative coupling of a carboxyl group of one reactant with an amino group of the other reactant to form a linking amide bond. The amide bond formation may be performed by reacting the starting materials in the presence of a coupling agent or by converting the carboxyl functionality into an active form such as an active ester, mixed anhydride or a carboxyl acid chloride or bromide. General descriptions of such coupling reactions and the reagents used therein can be found in general textbooks on peptide chemistry, for example, M. Bodanszky, “Peptide Chemistry”, 2nd rev. ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, (1993).\n\n\nExamples of coupling reactions with amide bond formation include the azide method, mixed carbonic-carboxylic acid anhydride (isobutyl chloroformate) method, the carbodiimide(dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or water-soluble carbodiimide such as N-ethyl-N′-[(3-dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide) method, the active ester (p-nitrophenyl ester, N-hydroxysuccinic imido ester) method, the Woodward reagent K-method, the 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI or N,N′-carbonyldiimidazole) method, the phosphorus reagents or oxidation-reduction methods. Some of these methods can be enhanced by adding suitable catalysts, e.g. in the carbodiimide method by adding 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene), or 4-DMAP. Further coupling agents are (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)-tris-(dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, either by itself or in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or 4-DMAP; or 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetra-methyluronium tetrafluoroborate, or O—(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate. These coupling reactions can be performed in either solution (liquid phase) or solid phase.\n\n\nA preferred amide bond formation is performed employing N-ethyloxycarbonyl-2-ethyloxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) or N-isobutyloxy-carbonyl-2-isobutyloxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (IIDQ). Unlike the classical anhydride procedure, EEDQ and IIDQ do not require base nor low reaction temperatures. Typically, the procedure involves reacting equimolar amounts of the carboxyl and amine components in an organic solvent (a wide variety of solvents can be used). Then EEDQ or IIDQ is added in excess and the mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature.\n\n\nThe coupling reactions preferably are conducted in an inert solvent, such as halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, chloroform, dipolar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, DMSO, HMPT, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF).\n\n\nIn many instances the coupling reactions are done in the presence of a suitable base such as a tertiary amine, e.g. triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), N-methyl-morpholine, N-methylpyrrolidine, 4-DMAP or 1,8-diazabicycle[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). The reaction temperature may range between 0° C. and 50° C. and the reaction time may range between 15 min and 24 h.\n\n\nThe functional groups in the building blocks that are linked together may be protected to avoid formation of undesired bonds. Appropriate protecting groups that can be used are listed for example in Greene, “Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry”, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1999) and “The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology”, Vol. 9, Academic Press, New York (1987), hereafter referred to simply as Greene.\n\n\nCarboxyl groups can be protected as an ester that can be cleaved off to give the carboxylic acid. Protecting groups that can be used include 1) alkyl esters such as methyl, trimethylsilyl and tert-butyl; 2) arylalkyl esters such as benzyl and substituted benzyl; or 3) esters that can be cleaved by a mild base or mild reductive means such as trichloroethyl and phenacyl esters.\n\n\nAmino groups can be protected by a variety of N-protecting groups, such as:\n\n \n \n \n \n1) acyl groups such as formyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, and p-toluenesulfonyl;\n \n2) aromatic carbamate groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyls, and 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc);\n \n3) aliphatic carbamate groups such as tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), ethoxycarbonyl, diisopropylmethoxy-carbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl;\n \n4) cyclic alkyl carbamate groups such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl and adamantyloxycarbonyl;\n \n5) alkyl groups such as triphenylmethyl, benzyl or substituted benzyl such as 4-methoxybenzyl;\n \n6) trialkylsilyl such as trimethylsilyl or t.Bu dimethylsilyl; and\n \n7) thiol containing groups such as phenylthiocarbonyl and dithiasuccinoyl. Interesting amino protecting groups are Boc and Fmoc.\n \n \n \n\n\nPreferably the amino protecting group is cleaved off prior to the next coupling step. Removal of N-protecting groups can be done following art-known procedures. When the Boc group is used, the methods of choice are trifluoroacetic acid, neat or in dichloromethane, or HCl in dioxane or in ethyl acetate. The resulting ammonium salt is then neutralized either prior to the coupling or in situ with basic solutions such as aqueous buffers, or tertiary amines in dichloromethane or acetonitrile or dimethyl-formamide. When the Fmoc group is used, the reagents of choice are piperidine or substituted piperidine in dimethylformamide, but any secondary amine can be used. The deprotection is carried out at a temperature between 0° C. and room temperature, usually around 15-25° C., or 20-22° C.\n\n\nOther functional groups that can interfere in the coupling reactions of the building blocks may also be protected. For example hydroxyl groups may be protected as benzyl or substituted benzyl ethers, e.g. 4-methoxybenzyl ether, benzoyl or substituted benzoyl esters, e.g. 4-nitrobenzoyl ester, or with trialkylsilyl goups (e.g. trimethylsilyl or tert-butyldimethylsilyl).\n\n\nFurther amino groups may be protected by protecting groups that can be cleaved off selectively. For example, when Boc is used as the α-amino protecting group, the following side chain protecting groups are suitable: p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) moieties can be used to protect further amino groups; benzyl (Bn) ethers can be used to protect hydroxy groups; and benzyl esters can be used to protect further carboxyl groups. Or when Fmoc is chosen for the α-amino protection, usually tert-butyl based protecting groups are acceptable. For instance, Boc can be used for further amino groups; tert-butyl ethers for hydroxyl groups; and tert-butyl esters for further carboxyl groups.\n\n\nAny of the protecting groups may be removed at any stage of the synthesis procedure but preferably, the protecting groups of any of the functionalities not involved in the reaction steps are removed after completion of the build-up of the macrocycle. Removal of the protecting groups can be done in whatever manner is dictated by the choice of protecting groups, which manners are well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe intermediates of formula (II) may be prepared by reacting an intermediate (VIII) with an alkenamine (IX) in the presence of a carbonyl introducing agent as outlined in the following reaction scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL represents an O-protecting group PG\n1 \nor a group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe O-protecting group can be any of the groups mentioned herein and in particular is a benzoyl or substituted benzoyl group such as 4-nitrobenzoyl.\n\n\nCarbonyl (CO) introducing agents include phosgene, or phosgene derivatives such as carbonyl diimidazole (CDI), and the like. In one embodiment (VIII) is reacted with the CO introducing agent in the presence of a suitable base and a solvent, which can be the bases and solvents used in the amide forming reactions as described above. In a particular embodiment, the base is a hydrogencarbonate, e.g. NaHCO\n3 \nor a tertiary amine such as triethylamine and the like, and the solvent is an ether or halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. THF, CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, CHCl\n3\n, and the like. Thereafter, the amine (IX) is added thereby obtaining intermediates (XII) or (XII-a) as in the above scheme. An alternative route using similar reaction conditions involves first reacting the CO introducing agent with the amine (IX) and then reacting the thus formed intermediate with (VIII).\n\n\nWhere L is PG\n1 \nthe reaction of (VIII) with (IX) yields intermediates (II-a). These can be deprotected, for example where PG\n1 \nis benzoyl or substituted benzoyl by reaction with a an alkali metal hydroxide (LiOH, NaOH, KOH), in particular where PG\n1 \nis 4-nitrobenzoyl, with LiOH, in an aqueous medium comprising water and a water-soluble organic solvent such as an alkanol (methanol, ethanol) and THF. The resulting alcohol (i.e. an intermediate (II-a) wherein L is hydrogen), is reacted with an intermediate (VI) as described above for the reaction of (V) with (VI) and this reaction results in intermediates (II).\n\n\nThe intermediates of formula (III) may be prepared by first cyclizing an ester intermediate (X) to a macrocyclic ester (XI), which in turn is converted to the corresponding macrocyclic carboxylic acid (III) as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL is as specified above and PG\n2 \nis a carboxyl protecting group, e.g. one of the carboxyl protecting groups mentioned above, in particular a C\n1-4\nalkyl or benzyl ester, e.g. a methyl, ethyl or t.butyl ester. The PG\n1 \ngroup mat be removed using art-known methodologies, e.g. methyl or ethyl esters by treatment with an alkali metal hydroxide in an aqueous medium, t.butyl esters with weak acid and benzyl esters with strong acid or by catalytic hydrogenation. Where L is a radical (a) this reaction sequence yields intermediates (III). These can also prepared by removing L being an O-protecting group and etherifying the thus formed alcohol with intermediate (VI) as described above.\n\n\nThe intermediates of formula (VII) may be prepared by cyclizing an intermediate (XII) wherein PG is a nitrogen-protecting group as specified above to intermediates (VII) with a double bond in the macrocycle (VII-a), which can be reduced to the corresponding intermediates (VII) with a single bond at that location in the macrocycle (VII-b):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL is as specified above. Where L is a radical (a) this reaction sequence yields intermediates (VII-a) or (VII-b). These can also prepared by removing L being an O-protecting group and etherifying the thus formed alcohol with intermediate (VI) as described above. The sulfonylamide group in the above sequence may be an ester (i.e. an —OPG\n2 \ngroup as specified above) which may be removed and condensed with a cyclopropylamide (IV) following the procedures mentioned earlier.\n\n\nThe cyclopropylsulfonamide group can be introduced at any stage of the synthesis, either as the last step as described above, or earlier, before the macrocycle formation as shown in the following scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL is as defined above, PG\n2 \nrepresents a carboxyl protecting group, as specified above, and L\n1 \nis a nitrogen-protecting group (PG, as defined above), or L\n1 \nis a group\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1 \nand n are as defined above, or wherein R\n1 \nmay also represent a nitrogen-protecting group (a group PG, as specified above). Obviously, when R\n1 \nrepresents a nitrogen-protecting group, such may be removed at the desired stage of the synthetic route. The intermediates (XIV) wherein L\n1 \nrepresents a group (b) correspond to the intermediates (II) or (II-a) and may be processed further as specified above.\n\n\nCoupling of P1 and P2 Building Blocks\n\n\n\nThe P1 and P2 building blocks are linked using an amide forming reaction following the procedures described above. The P1 building block may have a carboxyl protecting group PG2 (as in (XVI-a)) or may already be linked to P1′ group (as in (XVI-b)). L\n2 \nis hydrogen or a group L as specified above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the procedure of the above scheme, a cyclopropyl amino acid (XVI-a) or (XVI-b) is coupled to the acid function of the P2 building block using an amide forming reaction such as the standard peptide coupling conditions described above. Removal of the acid protection group in (XIII), using the appropriate conditions for the protecting group used, followed by coupling with a cyclopropylsulfonamide (IV) as described above, again yields intermediate (XIV).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, L\n1 \nis a group (b) and these reactions involve coupling P1 to P2-P3, which results in the intermediates (X) or (II) mentioned above. In another embodiment, L\n1 \nis a N-protecting group PG, which is as specified above, and the coupling reaction results in an intermediate (XV-a) from which the group PG can be removed to intermediates (XIII-a), using reaction conditions also mentioned above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one embodiment, PG in this reaction is a BOC group. Where additionally L\n3 \nis hydrogen, the starting material is Boc-L-hydroxyproline.\n\n\nThe group L\n2 \ncan be an O-protecting group PG\n1 \nwhichis introduced on the starting material (XV), wherein L\n2 \nis hydrogen and which is selectively cleavable towards group PG.\n\n\nCoupling of P3 and P2 Building Blocks\n\n\nThe P3 and P2 building blocks are linked using a urea forming reaction following the procedures described above for the coupling of (VII) with (IX). A general procedure is represented in the following reaction scheme wherein L is as specified above and L\n3 \nis a group —O—PG\n2\n, or a group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn (XVIII) R\n1 \nis as specified above, but may further be a nitrogen-protecting group, which may be removed with a nitrogen deprotecting agent at the desired stage of the synthetic route. Where L\n3 \nin (XVIII) is a group —OPG\n2\n, the PG\n2 \ngroup may be removed and the resulting acid coupled with cyclopropyl amino acids (XVI-a) or (XVI-b), yielding intermediates (XIII) or (XIV) wherein L\n1 \nis a radical (b).\n\n\nThe building blocks P1, P1′, P2 and P3 for compounds of formula (I) can be prepared starting from art-known intermediates. A number of such syntheses are described hereafter in more detail.\n\n\nSynthesis of P2 Building Blocks\n\n\nBuilding blocks P2 can be prepared by an O-arylation reaction, e.g. following the procedures described above, as depicted in the scheme below, wherein L\n1 \nis as specified above and in particular is a N-protecting group PG, X is as defined above and L\n4 \nis hydroxy, a group —OPG\n2\n, with PG\n2 \nbeing a carboxyl protecting group, such as any of the carboxyl protecting groups mentioned above; or L\n4 \nis a P1 group such as a group (c) or (d) as defined above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting material (XIX) is reacted with reagent (VI) as described above for the synthesis of (I-d) starting from (V) and (VI). Similarly as described above, this reaction can be done with retention (arylation with X being a leaving group) or inversion (Mitsunobu reaction) of the stereochemistry at the hydroxy bearing carbon atom. In the arylation with X being a leaving group, L\n4 \nmay also be hydroxy, in the Mitsunobu reaction L\n4 \nis a group —OPG\n2\n.\n\n\nIn one embodiment the group L\n1 \nis PG, which is Boc and the starting material (VIII) is commercially available Boc-L-hydroxyproline, or any other stereoisomeric form thereof.\n\n\nWhere L\n4 \nin (XX) is —OPG\n2\n, the carboxyl protecting group PG\n2 \nmay be removed following procedures described above to hydroxyproline derivatives (XVII). In one embodiment PG\n1 \nis Boc and PG\n2 \nis a lower alkyl ester, in particular a methyl or ethyl ester. Hydrolysis of the latter ester to the acid can be done by standard procedures, e.g. acid hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid in methanol or ethanol, or by a metal hydroxide such as sodium or preferably lithium hydroxide.\n\n\nThe intermediates (VI) can be prepared following art-known methods using known starting materials. They may be prepared as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriedel-Craft acylation of a 3-methoxyaniline (XXII), available either commercially or via art-known procedures, using an acylating agent such as acetyl chloride or the like in the presence of one or more Lewis acids such as boron trichloride and aluminium trichloride in a solvent like dichloromethane provides (XXIII). Coupling of (XXIII) with 4-isopropyl-thiazole-2-carboxylic acid (XXIV), preferably under basic conditions, such as in pyridine, in the presence of an activating agent for the carboxylate group, for instance POCl\n3\n, followed by ring closure and dehydration under basic conditions like potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butanol yields quinoline derivative (VI-a). The latter can be converted to (VI-b) wherein LG is a leaving group, e.g. by reaction of (XII) with a halogenating agent, for example phosphoryl chloride or the like, or with an arylsulfonyl chloride, e.g. with tosyl chloride.\n\n\n2-carboxy-4-isopropyl-thiazole (XXIV) is synthesized following art-known procedures, in particular as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthyl thiooxamate (XXVI) is reacted with the β-bromoketone (XXVII) to form the thiazolyl carboxylic acid ester (XXVIII) which is hydrolyzed to the corresponding acid (XXIV). The ethyl ester in these intermediates may be replaced by other carboxyl protecting groups PG\n2\n, as defined above.\n\n\nIntermediate (XXII) may also be prepared as described by Brown et al. J. Med. Chem. 1989, 32, 807-826, or as outlined in the following scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting materials ethylacetyl acetate and ethoxymethylene malononitrile, which are commercially available, are reacted in the presence of a suitable base, such as sodium ethoxide, and a solvent, such as ethanol and the like. This reaction affords intermediate (XXIX). The latter is hydrolyzed, e.g. with a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, e.g. NaOH or LiOH, in a suitable solvent such as ethanol/water to produce (XXX). Decarboxylation of intermediate (XXX) into intermediate (XXXI) is performed at increased temperature until effervescence ceases, preferably in the presence of a basic solvent such as quinoline. Methylation of intermediate (XXXI), in particular with a methylating agent such as MeI in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. K\n2\nCO\n3\n) in a suitable solvent (such as DMF and the like) yields (XXXII). The latter is reacted with a Grignard reagent such as MeMgBr in the presence of a suitable solvent (e.g. THF), followed by hydrolysis, for instance with aqueous HCl, affording intermediate (XOH).\n\n\nSynthesis of P1 Building Blocks\n\n\nThe cyclopropane amino acid used in the preparation of the P1 fragment is commercially available or can be prepared using art-known procedures.\n\n\nThe amino-vinyl-cyclopropyl ethyl ester (XVI-a) may be obtained according to the procedure described in WO 00/09543 or as illustrated in the following scheme, wherein PG\n2 \nis a carboxyl protecting group as specified above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment of commercially available or easily obtainable imine (XXXIII) with 1,4-dihalobutene in presence of a base produces (XXXIV), which after hydrolysis yields cyclopropyl amino acid (XVI-a), having the allyl substituent syn to the carboxyl group. Resolution of the enantiomeric mixture (XVI-a) results in (XVI-a-1). The resolution is performed using art-known procedures such as enzymatic separation; crystallization with a chiral acid; or chemical derivatization; or by chiral column chromatography.\n\n\nThe sulfonamide derivative (XVI-b) can be obtained as outlined in the following reaction scheme, wherein R\n2 \nand PG are as specified above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reaction of (XVI-c) with sulfonamide (IV) is an amide forming procedure, which can be performed following the procedures described above. This reaction yields intermediates (XVI-d) from which the amino protecting group is removed by standard methods such as those described above. This in turn results in the desired intermediate (XVI-b). Starting materials (XVI-c) may be prepared from intermediates (XVI-a) by first introducing a N-protecting group PG and subsequent removal of the group PG\n2\n.\n\n\nSynthesis of the P3 Building Blocks\n\n\nThe P3 building blocks (IX) can be prepared according to methodologies known in the art. One of these methodologies is shown in the scheme below and starts from protected amines (XXXVI), in particular from monoacylated amines, such as trifluoroacetamide, or from a Boc-protected amine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this scheme, LG is a N-protecting group as specified above and in particular is BOC or trifluoroacetyl; R\n1 \nand n are as defined above, and wherein R\n1 \nmay also be a further nitrogen-protecting group which can be cleaved off selectively towards the group PG. LG is a leaving group as specified above, in particular LG is chloro or bromo. Where R\n1 \nrepresents a nitrogen-protecting group, it may be removed with a nitrogen deprotecting agent at the desired stage of the synthetic route.\n\n\nThe monoacylated amines (XXXVI) are treated with a strong base such as sodium hydride and are subsequently reacted with a haloC\n3-8\nalkenyl (XXXVII) to the corresponding protected amine (XXXVIII). Deprotection of (XXXVIII) affords (IX). Deprotection will depend on the group PG, thus if PG is Boc, deprotection can be accomplished with a relatively weak acid, e.g. trifluoroacetic acid, or when PG is trifluoroacetyl, removal is accomplished with a base, e.g. sodium hydroxide.\n\n\nIntermediates (IX) wherein R\n1 \nis hydrogen can also be prepared via a Gabriel synthesis of an alkenylamine, which can be carried out by the treatment of a phthalimide (XXXIX) with a base, such as potassium hydroxide, and (XXXX), followed by the hydrolysis to generate an alkenylamine (IX-a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above scheme is LG halogen, n is as defined above.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may be converted to the corresponding N-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its N-oxide form. Said N-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarbo-peroxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzene-carboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. tert-butyl hydro-peroxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alcohols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.\n\n\nPure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. Diastereomers may be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e.g., counter-current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may be obtained as racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I), which are sufficiently basic or acidic, may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid, respectively chiral base. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali or acid. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereo-chemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereo-chemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound may be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods may advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.\n\n\nIn a further aspect, the present invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) as specified herein, or a compound of any of the subgroups of compounds of formula (I) as specified herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A therapeutically effective amount in this context is an amount sufficient to prophylactically act against, to stabilize or to reduce viral infection, and in particular HCV viral infection, in infected subjects or subjects being at risk of being infected. In still a further aspect, this invention relates to a process of preparing a pharmaceutical composition as specified herein, which comprises intimately mixing a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier with a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), as specified herein, or of a compound of any of the subgroups of compounds of formula (I) as specified herein.\n\n\nTherefore, the compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form or metal complex, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets.\n\n\nBecause of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may also be administered via oral inhalation or insufflation by means of methods and formulations employed in the art for administration via this way. Thus, in general the compounds of the present invention may be administered to the lungs in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry powder, a solution being preferred. Any system developed for the delivery of solutions, suspensions or dry powders via oral inhalation or insufflation are suitable for the administration of the present compounds.\n\n\nThus, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition adapted for administration by inhalation or insufflation through the mouth comprising a compound of formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compounds of the present invention may be administered via inhalation of a solution in nebulized or aerosolized doses.\n\n\nIt is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, suppositories, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) show antiviral properties. Viral infections and their associated diseases treatable using the compounds and methods of the present invention include those infections brought on by HCV and other pathogenic flaviviruses such as Yellow fever, Dengue fever (types 1-4), St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Murray valley encephalitis, West Nile virus and Kunjin virus. The diseases associated with HCV include progressive liver fibrosis, inflammation and necrosis leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and HCC; and for the other pathogenic flaviviruses the diseases include yellow fever, dengue fever, hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis. A number of the compounds of this invention moreover are active against mutated strains of HCV. Additionally, many of the compounds of this invention show a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and have attractive properties in terms of bioavailability, including an acceptable half-life, AUC (area under the curve) and peak values and lacking unfavorable phenomena such as insufficient quick onset and tissue retention.\n\n\nThe in vitro antiviral activity against HCV of the compounds of formula (I) was tested in a cellular HCV replicon system based on Lohmann et al. (1999) Science 285:110-113, with the further modifications described by Krieger et al. (2001), Journal of Virology 75: 4614-4624, which is further exemplified in the examples section. This model, while not a complete infection model for HCV, is widely accepted as the most robust and efficient model of autonomous HCV RNA replication currently available. Compounds exhibiting anti-HCV activity in this cellular model are considered as candidates for further development in the treatment of HCV infections in mammals. It will be appreciated that it is important to distinguish between compounds that specifically interfere with HCV functions from those that exert cytotoxic or cytostatic effects in the HCV replicon model, and as a consequence cause a decrease in HCV RNA or linked reporter enzyme concentration. Assays are known in the field for the evaluation of cellular cytotoxicity based for example on the activity of mitochondrial enzymes using fluorogenic redox dyes such as resazurin. Furthermore, cellular counter screens exist for the evaluation of non-selective inhibition of linked reporter gene activity, such as firefly luciferase. Appropriate cell types can be equipped by stable transfection with a luciferase reporter gene whose expression is dependent on a constitutively active gene promoter, and such cells can be used as a counter-screen to eliminate non-selective inhibitors.\n\n\nDue to their antiviral properties, particularly their anti-HCV properties, the compounds of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof, their N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines, metal complexes and stereochemically isomeric forms, are useful in the treatment of individuals experiencing a viral infection, particularly a HCV infection, and for the prophylaxis of these infections. In general, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of warm-blooded animals infected with viruses, in particular flaviviruses such as HCV.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may therefore be used as medicines.

C\nss \nis the steady state concentration, i.e. the concentration at which the rate of input of drug equals the rate of elimination. C\nmin \nis defined as the lowest (minimum) concentration measured during the dosing interval. C\nmax\n, represents the highest (maximum) concentration measured during the dosing interval. AUC is defined as the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for a defined period of time.\n\n\nThe combinations of this invention can be administered to humans in dosage ranges specific for each component comprised in said combinations. The components comprised in said combinations can be administered together or separately. The NS3/4a protease inhibitors of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof, and ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, may have dosage levels of the order of 0.02 to 5.0 grams-per-day.\n\n\nWhen the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) and ritonavir are administered in combination, the weight ratio of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) to ritonavir is suitably in the range of from about 40:1 to about 1:15, or from about 30:1 to about 1:15, or from about 15:1 to about 1:15, typically from about 10:1 to about 1:10, and more typically from about 8:1 to about 1:8. Also useful are weight ratios of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors of formula (I) to ritonavir ranging from about 6:1 to about 1:6, or from about 4:1 to about 1:4, or from about 3:1 to about 1:3, or from about 2:1 to about 1:2, or from about 1.5:1 to about 1:1.5. In one aspect, the amount by weight of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors of formula (I) is equal to or greater than that of ritonavir, wherein the weight ratio of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) to ritonavir is suitably in the range of from about 1:1 to about 15:1, typically from about 1:1 to about 10:1, and more typically from about 1:1 to about 8:1. Also useful are weight ratios of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) to ritonavir ranging from about 1:1 to about 6:1, or from about 1:1 to about 5:1, or from about 1:1 to about 4:1, or from about 3:2 to about 3:1, or from about 1:1 to about 2:1 or from about 1:1 to about 1.5:1.\n\n\nThe term “therapeutically effective amount” as used herein means that amount of active compound or component or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought, in the light of the present invention, by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease being treated. Since the instant invention refers to combinations comprising two or more agents, the “therapeutically effective amount” is that amount of the agents taken together so that the combined effect elicits the desired biological or medicinal response. For example, the therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising (a) the compound of formula (I) and (b) ritonavir, would be the amount of the compound of formula (I) and the amount of ritonavir that when taken together have a combined effect that is therapeutically effective.\n\n\nIn general it is contemplated that an antiviral effective daily amount would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg body weight, more preferably from 0.1 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as one, two, three, four or more (sub-)doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said (sub-)doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 1 to 1000 mg, and in particular 5 to 200 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.\n\n\nThe exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight, sex, extent of disorder and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines.\n\n\nAccording to one embodiment, the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) and ritonavir may be co-administered once or twice a day, preferably orally, wherein the amount of the compounds of formula (I) per dose is from about 1 to about 2500 mg, and the amount of ritonavir per dose is from 1 to about 2500 mg.

In still another embodiment, the amounts per dose for once or twice daily co-administration are from about 100 to about 1000 mg of the compound of formula (I) and from about 100 to about 800 mg of ritonavir. In yet another embodiment, the amounts per dose for once or twice daily co-administration are from about 150 to about 800 mg of the compound of formula (I) and from about 100 to about 600 mg of ritonavir. In yet another embodiment, the amounts per dose for once or twice daily co-administration are from about 200 to about 600 mg of the compound of formula (I) and from about 100 to about 400 mg of ritonavir.

Then, the reaction was cooled down to room temperature and the excess of phosphorus oxychloride was evaporated. The residual oil was partitioned between a saturated solution of NaHCO\n3 \nand extracted with diethylether (3×70 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over MgSO\n4\n, concentrated by rotary evaporation and passed through short pad of silica (hexanes) to give 3.6 g (62%) of the desired product 2 as white powder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a stirred solution of Boc-4-hydroxyproline, with the specific stereochemistry as illustrated in the formula above, (2.6 g, 11.2 mmol) in DMSO (80 mL) was added potassium tert-butoxide (3.8 g, 3 eq). After approximately 1 h of stirring 4-chloro-2-(4-isopropylthiazol-2-yl)-7-methoxyquinoline (2, 3.6 g, 11.2 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight.

The reaction mixture was flushed with argon and cooled down in an ice bath and DIPEA (1.5 mL) was added in one portion. Then, the reaction mixture was stirred for 10-15 min at 0° C., before HATU (2.93 g, 7.7 mmol) was added at 0° C. under argon, in one portion. After 40 min at 0° C. (reaction was monitored by LC-MS), the reaction mixture was concentrated by rotary evaporation (not to complete dryness), then mixed with a solution of saturated NaHCO\n3 \nand extracted into EtOAc (3×100 mL).

The diethylether layers were combined, washed with brine, dried over MgSO\n4 \nand evaporated to give 3.13 g (98.3%) of the target product 5: m/z=551 (M+H)\n+\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaHCO\n3 \n(1.0 g) was added to a solution of 5 (1.4 g, 2.5 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (50 mL). Then, phosgene (5 mL, 1.9 M in toluene) was added at 0° C. under argon. The resulting suspension was stirred for 40 min at room temperature (monitoring with LC-MS). Then, the reaction mixture was filtered and washed with THF (2×30 mL). The filtrate was concentrated by rotary evaporation and re-dissolved in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(50 mL). NaHCO\n3 \n(1.0 g) and N-methylhept-6-enylamine (1.5 g, 13 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight, and then filtered.

The assay demonstrated that the compounds of formula (I) exhibited activity against HCV replicons functional in a cell culture. The cellular assay was based on a bicistronic expression construct, as described by Lohmann et al. (1999) Science vol. 285 pp. 110-113 with modifications described by Krieger et al. (2001) Journal of Virology 75: 4614-4624, in a multi-target screening strategy. In essence, the method was as follows.\n\n\nThe assay utilized the stably transfected cell line Huh-7 luc/neo (hereafter referred to as Huh-Luc). This cell line harbors an RNA encoding a bicistronic expression construct comprising the wild type NS3-NS5B regions of HCV type 1b translated from an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), preceded by a reporter portion (FfL-luciferase), and a selectable marker portion (neo\nR\n, neomycine phosphotransferase). The construct is bordered by 5′ and 3′ NTRs (non-translated regions) from HCV type 1b. Continued culture of the replicon cells in the presence of G418 (neo\nR\n) is dependent on the replication of the HCV RNA. The stably transfected replicon cells that express HCV RNA, which replicates autonomously and to high levels, encoding inter alia luciferase, are used for screening the antiviral compounds.\n\n\nThe replicon cells were plated in 384 well plates in the presence of the test and control compounds which were added in various concentrations. Following an incubation of three days, HCV replication was measured by assaying luciferase activity (using standard luciferase assay substrates and reagents and a Perkin Elmer ViewLux™ ultraHTS microplate imager). Replicon cells in the control cultures have high luciferase expression in the absence of any inhibitor. The inhibitory activity of the compound on luciferase activity was monitored on the Huh-Luc cells, enabling a dose-response curve for each test compound. EC\n50 \nvalues were then calculated, which value represents the amount of the compound required to decrease by 50% the level of detected luciferase activity, or more specifically, the ability of the genetically linked HCV replicon RNA to replicate.\n\n\nInhibition Assay\n\n\nThe aim of this in vitro assay was to measure the inhibition of HCV NS3/4A protease complexes by the compounds of the present invention. This assay provides an indication of how effective compounds of the present invention would be in inhibiting HCV NS3/4A proteolytic activity.\n\n\nThe inhibition of full-length hepatitis C NS3 protease enzyme was measured essentially as described in Poliakov, 2002 Prot Expression & Purification 25 363 371. Briefly, the hydrolysis of a depsipeptide substrate, Ac-DED(Edans)EEAbuψ[COO]ASK(Dabcyl)-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 1) (AnaSpec, San José, USA), was measured spectrofluorometrically in the presence of a peptide cofactor, KKGSVVIVGRIVLSGK (SEQ ID NO: 2) (Åke Engström, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, Sweden). [Landro, Biochemistry, 1997, 36(31): 9340-9348]. The enzyme (1 nM) was incubated in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM DTT, 40% glycerol, 0.1% n-octyl-D-glucoside, with 25 μM NS4A cofactor and inhibitor at 30° C. for 10 min, whereupon the reaction was initiated by addition of 0.5 μM substrate. Inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO, sonicated for 30 sec. and vortexed. The solutions were stored at −20° C. between measurements.\n\n\nThe final concentration of DMSO in the assay sample was adjusted to 3.3%. The rate of hydrolysis was corrected for inner filter effects according to published procedures. [Liu, 1999 Analytical Biochemistry 267 331-335]. Ki values were estimated by non-linear regression analysis (GraFit, Erithacus Software, Staines, MX, UK), using a model for competitive inhibition and a fixed value for Km (0.15 μM). A minimum of two replicates was performed for all measurements.\n\n\nThe following Table 1 lists compounds that were prepared according to any one of the above examples.

The assay uses the well known Caco-2 cells with a passage number between 40 and 60.\n\n\nApical (A) to Basolateral (B) Transport\n\n\nEvery compound was tested in 2-4 wells. The basolateral and the apical wells contained 1.5 mL and 0.4 mL of transport buffer (TB), respectively, and the standard concentration of the tested substances was 10 μM. Furthermore all test solutions and buffers contained 1% DMSO. Prior to the experiment the transport plates were pre-coated with culture medium containing 10% serum for 30 minutes to avoid nonspecific binding to plastic material. After 21 to 28 days in culture on filter supports the cells were ready for permeability experiments.\n\n\nTransport plate no. 1 comprised 3 rows of 4 wells each. Row 1 was denoted “Wash”, row 2 “30 minutes” and row 3 “60 minutes”. Transport plate no. 2 comprised 3 rows of 4 wells, one denoted row 4 “90 minutes”, row 5 “120 minutes” and the remaining row unassigned.\n\n\nThe culture medium from the apical wells was removed and the inserts were transferred to a wash row (No. 1) in a transport plate (plate no. 1) out of 2 plates without inserts, which had already been prepared with 1.5 mL transport buffer (HBSS, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) in rows 1 to 5. In A→B screening the TB in the basolateral well also contained 1% Bovine Serum Albumin.\n\n\n0.5 mL transport buffer (HBSS, 25 mM MES, pH 6.5) was added to the inserts and the cell monolayers equilibrated in the transport buffer system for 30 minutes at 37° C. in a polymix shaker. After being equilibrated to the buffer system the Transepithelial electrical resistance value (TEER) was measured in each well by an EVOM chop stick instrument. The TEER values were usually between 400 and 1000 S2 per well (depending on the passage number used).\n\n\nThe transport buffer (TB, pH 6.5) was removed from the apical side and the insert was transferred to the 30 minutes row (No. 2) and fresh 425 μL TB (pH 6.5), including the test substance was added to the apical (donor) well. The plates were incubated in a polymix shaker at 37° C. with a low shaking velocity of approximately 150 to 300 rpm. After 30 minutes incubation in row 2 the inserts were moved to new pre-warmed basolateral (receiver) wells every 30 minutes; row 3 (60 minutes), 4 (90 minutes) and 5 (120 minutes).\n\n\n25 μL samples were taken from the apical solution after ˜2 minutes and at the end of the experiment. These samples represented donor samples from the start and the end of the experiment. 300 μL were taken from the basolateral (receiver) wells at each scheduled time point and the post value of TEER was measured at the end of the experiment. To all collected samples acetonitrile was added to a final concentration of 50% in the samples. The collected samples were stored at −20° C. until analysis by HPLC or LC-MS.\n\n\nBasolateral to Apical Transport\n\n\nEvery compound was tested in 2-4 wells. The basolateral and the apical wells contained 1.55 mL and 0.4 mL TB, respectively, and the standard concentration of the tested substances was 10 Furthermore all test solutions and buffers contained 1% DMSO. Prior to the experiment the transport plates were pre-coated with culture medium containing 10% serum for 30 minutes to avoid nonspecific binding to plastic material.\n\n\nAfter 21 to 28 days in culture on filter supports, the cells were ready for permeability experiments. The culture medium from the apical wells was removed and the inserts were transferred to a wash row (No. 1) in a new plate without inserts (Transport plate). The transport plate comprised 3 rows of 4 wells. Row 1 was denoted “wash” and row 3 was the “experimental row”. The transport plate had previously been prepared with 1.5 mL TB (pH 7.4) in wash row No. 1 and with 1.55 mL TB (pH 7.4), including the test substance, in experimental row No. 3 (donor side).\n\n\n0.5 mL transport buffer (HBSS, 25 mM MES, pH 6.5) was added to the inserts in row No. 1 and the cell monolayers were equilibrated in the transport buffer system for 30 minutes, 37° C. in a polymix shaker. After being equilibrated to the buffer system the TEER value was measured in each well by an EVOM chop stick instrument.\n\n\nThe transport buffer (TB, pH 6.5) was removed from the apical side and the insert was transferred to row 3 and 400 μL fresh TB, pH 6.5 was added to the inserts. After 30 minutes 250 μL was withdrawn from the apical (receiver) well and replaced by fresh transport buffer. Thereafter 250 μL samples were withdrawn and replaced by fresh transport buffer every 30 minutes until the end of the experiment at 120 minutes, and finally a post value of TEER was measured at the end of the experiment. A 25 sample was taken from the basolateral (donor) compartment after ˜2 minutes and at the end of the experiment. These samples represented donor samples from the start and the end of the experiment.\n\n\nTo all collected samples acetonitrile was added to a final concentration of 50% in the samples. The collected samples were stored at −20° C. until analysis by HPLC or LC-MS.\n\n\nDetermination of the cumulative fraction absorbed, FA\ncum\n, versus time.

Test compounds and ritonavir were added to human liver microsomes (protein concentration 1 mg/ml) suspended in potassium phosphate buffer (pH=7.4), to get final reaction mixture concentrations of 3 μM test compound and 10 μM ritonavir. In the non-boosted parallel reactions, ritonavir was not added. Boiled human liver microsomes were used for blank experiments. After addition (in a 1:3 ratio) of a cofactor mixture consisting of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (β-NADP, 0.5 mg/ml, 653.2 μM), D-Glucose-6-phosphate (2 mg/ml, 7.1 mM), Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (1.5 U/ml) in 2% NaHCO\n3\n, the reaction mixture was incubated at 37° C. for 30 or 120 minutes after which the reaction was stopped by increasing the temperature to 95° C.
