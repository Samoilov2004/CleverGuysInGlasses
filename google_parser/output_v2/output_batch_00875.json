Adenosine exerts its biological effects by interacting with A\n1\n, A\n2\n (further subclassified as A\n2A\n and A\n2B\n) and A\n3\n cell surface receptors, which modulate important physiological processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe A\n1\n and A\n2A\n receptor subtypes are believed to play complementary roles in adenosine's regulation of a cell's energy supply. Adenosine, which is a metabolic product of ATP, diffuses from the cell and locally activates the A\n1\n receptor to decrease the oxygen demand or activates the A\n2A\n receptor to increase the oxygen supply, thereby reinstating the balance of energy supply and demand within the tissue. The combined action of A\n1\n and A\n2\n subtypes increases the amount of available oxygen to tissue and protects cells against damage caused by a short-term imbalance of oxygen. One of the important functions of endogenous adenosine is to prevent tissue damage during traumas such as hypoxia, an ischemic condition, hypotension and seizure activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, modulation of A\n1\n receptors slows conduction velocity in the heart's atrioventricular node, resulting in the normalization of supraventricular tachycardias and control of ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation and flutter. Modulation of A\n2A\n receptors also regulates coronary vasodilation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdenosine is also a neuromodulator, which modulates molecular mechanisms underlying many aspects of physiological brain function by mediating central inhibitory effects. An increase in neurotransmitter release follows traumas such as hypoxia, ischemia and seizures. Neurotransmitters are ultimately responsible for neural degeneration and neural death, which can cause brain damage or death. Adenosine is thought to be an endogenous anticonvulsant agent that inhibits glutamate release from excitory neurons and neuronal firing. Adenosine agonists, therefore, are useful as antiepileptic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdenosine plays an important role as a cardioprotective agent. Levels of endogenous adenosine increase in response to ischemia and hypoxia and protect cardiac tissue during and after trauma (preconditioning). Adenosine agonists thus are useful as cardioprotective agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation and use of a number of adenosine A\n1\n receptor agonists have been described (\nMoos et al., J. Med.

As described above, the Purine Derivatives are useful for: (i) treating or preventing a Condition in an animal in need thereof; (ii) reducing an animal's rate of metabolism; or (iii) protecting an animal's heart against myocardial damage during cardioplegia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen administered to an animal, the Purine Derivatives can be administered as a component of a composition that comprises a physiologically acceptable carrier or vehicle. The present compositions, which comprise a Purine Derivative, can be administered orally. The Purine Derivatives can also be administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (\ne.g.,\n oral, rectal, or intestinal mucosa) and can be administered together with another biologically active agent. Administration can be systemic or local. Various known delivery systems, including encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, and capsules, can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of administration include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectal, by inhalation, or topical, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. In some instances, administration will result in the release of the Purine Derivatives into the bloodstream. The mode of administration can be left to the discretion of the practitioner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the Purine Derivatives are administered orally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the Purine Derivatives are administered intravenously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, when the Purine Derivatives are used to reduce an animal's rate of metabolism, the Purine Derviatives can be administered by continuous intravenous infusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, it can be desirable to administer the Purine Derivatives locally. This can be achieved, for example, and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, \ne.g.,\n in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository or enema, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, it can be desirable to introduce the Purine Derivatives into the central nervous system, circulatory system or gastrointestinal tract by any suitable route, including intraventricular, intrathecal injection, paraspinal injection, epidural injection, enema, and by injection adjacent to a peripheral nerve. Intraventricular injection can be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPulmonary administration can also be employed, \ne.g.\n, by use of an inhaler of nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent, or via perfusion in a fluorocarbon or synthetic pulmonary surfactant. In certain embodiments, the Purine Derivatives can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and excipients such as triglycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the Purine Derivatives can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (\nsee\n \nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n) and Treat or prevent \net al.,\n \nLiposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer 317-327 and 353-365 (1989\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment the Purine Derivatives can be delivered in a controlled-release system or sustained-release system (\nsee, e.g.,\n \nGoodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra; vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984\n)). Other controlled or sustained-release systems discussed in the review by \nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n) can be used. In one embodiment a pump can be used (\nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n); \nSefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987\n); \nBuchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980\n); and \nSaudek et al., N. Engl. J Med. 321:574 (1989\n)). In another embodiment polymeric materials can be used (see \nMedical Applications of Controlled Release (Langer and Wise eds., 1974\n); \nControlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance (Smolen and Ball eds., 1984\n); \nRanger and Peppas, J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 2:61 (1983\n); \nLevy et al., Science 228:190 (1935\n); \nDuring et al., Ann. Neural. 25:351 (1989\n); and \nHoward et al., J. Neurosurg. 71:105 (1989\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment a controlled- or sustained-release system can be placed in proximity of a target of the Purine Derivatives, \ne.g.,\n the spinal column, brain, colon, skin, heart, lung, or gastrointestinal tract, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present compositions can optionally comprise a suitable amount of a physiologically acceptable excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch physiologically acceptable excipients can be liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. The physiologically acceptable excipients can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating, and coloring agents can be used. In one embodiment the physiologically acceptable excipients are sterile when administered to an animal. Water can be a particularly useful excipient when the Purine Derivative is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid excipients, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable physiologically acceptable excipients also include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The present compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions. aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment the composition is in the form of a capsule. Other examples of suitable physiologically acceptable excipients are described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro eds., 19th ed. 1995\n), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the Purine Derivatives are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a composition adapted for oral administration to human beings. Compositions for oral delivery can be in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs for example. Orally administered compositions can contain one or more agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving a Purine Derivative are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In these latter platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule can be imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time-delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate can also be used. Oral compositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate. In one embodiment the excipients are of pharmaceutical grade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the Purine Derivatives can be formulated for intravenous administration. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration comprise sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions can also include a solubilizing agent. Compositions for intravenous administration can optionally include a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection. The compositions' components can be supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water- free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampule or sachette indicating the quantity of Purine Derivative. Where the Purine Derivatives are to be administered by infusion, they can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the Purine Derivatives are administered by injection, an ampule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Purine Derivatives can be administered by controlled-release or sustained-release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Such dosage forms can be used to provide controlled- or sustained-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled- or sustained-release formulations known to those skilled in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active ingredients of the invention. The invention thus encompasses single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled- or sustained-release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment a controlled- or sustained-release composition comprises a minimal amount of a Purine Derivative to treat or prevent the Condition in a minimal amount of time. Advantages of controlled- or sustained-release compositions include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled- or sustained-release compositions can favorably affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the Purine Derivative, and can thus reduce the occurrence of adverse side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControlled- or sustained-release compositions can initially release an amount of a Purine Derivative that promptly produces the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, and gradually and continually release other amounts of the Purine Derivative to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. To maintain a constant level of the Purine Derivative in the body, the Purine Derivative can be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of Purine Derivative being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled-or sustained-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions, including but not limited to, changes in pH, changes in temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or availability of water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the Purine Derivative that is effective for treating or preventing a Condition, reducing an animal's rate of metabolism, or protecting an animal's heart against myocardial damage during cardioplegia, can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo\n assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed can also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the condition being treated and can be decided according to the judgment of a health-care practitioner. Suitable effective dosage amounts, however, range from about 10 micrograms to about 5 grams about every 4 h, although they are typically about 500 mg or less per every 4 hours. In one embodiment the effective dosage is about 0.01 mg, 0.5 mg, about 1 mg, about 50 mg, about 100 mg, about 200 mg, about 300 mg, about 400 mg, about 500 mg, about 600 mg, about 700 mg, about 800 mg, about 900 mg, about 1 g, about 1.2 g, about 1.4 g, about 1.6 g, about 1.8 g, about 2.0 g, about 2.2 g, about 2.4 g, about 2.6 g, about 2.8 g, about 3.0 g, about 3.2 g, about 3.4 g, about 3.6 g, about 3.8 g, about 4.0g, about 4.2 g, about 4.4 g, about 4.6 g, about 4.8 g, and about 5.0 g, every 4 hours.

Once the animal was anesthetized, the thorax was opened, and the heart was rapidly removed and perfused through the ascending aorta using Krebs-Ringer buffer consisting of NaCl (118 mmol/liter), KCl (4.75 mmol/liter), KH\n2\nPO\n4\n (1.18 mmol/liter), MgSO\n4\n (1.18 mmol/liter), CaCl\n2\n.(2.5 mmol/liter), NaHCO\n3\n (25 mmol/liter), and glucose (11 mmol/liter). A mixture of 95% O\n2\n and 5% CO\n2\n at 37 °C was bubbled through the perfusate. The heart was initially perfused at a constant pressure of 70 mm Hg. About 10 min after the constant pressure perfusion, perfusion was switched to constant flow perfusion achieved using a microtube pump. The perfusion pressure was maintained at the same level of constant pressure perfusion by adjusting flow rate. Once the flow rate was determined, it was maintained throughout the experiment. The hearts were stimulated by rectangular pulses at a rate of 5 Hz and 2-millisecond duration and twice the diastolic threshold, delivered from a stimulus isolation unit (ADInstruments Ltd, Australia).\n\n\n \n\n\nEffect of compound 17 on ischemia-induced arrhythmias\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nRat hearts were perfused at constant pressure of 70 mmHg without pacing as described above. Bipolar epicardial electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded by placing two electrodes on the surface of right appendage and apex. A stainless steel cannula was used as indifferent electrode. The ECG and heart rate were continuously monitored and data were recorded using a PowerLab data acquisition system (ADInstruments Ltd, Australia) in conjunction with a Macintosh computer, and analyzed using Chart.3 computer package. After a 20-minute equilibration period, regional ischemia was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, and the ligature was released 30 minutes after occlusion. Compound \n17\n was applied \ninterperfusate\n 10 minutes before LAD ligation and was present during LAD ligation. Compound \n17\n was tested in this model at 10, 30 and 100 pM concentrations. The incidences of ventricular tachycardia (VT) were almost same in control non-treated (12/12) and in treated hearts (20/22). Incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) was 58% (7/12) in non-treated hearts, and 9% (2/22) in treated hearts. The total duration of both VT and VF were significantly shortened by compound \n17\n at concentrations of 30 and 100 pM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n shows that Compound 17 reduces the duration of ischemia-induced arrhythmias in isolated perfused rat hearts relative to a non-treated control group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above example shows that Compound \n17,\n an illustrative Purine Derivative, reduces the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and accordingly, is useful for treating a cardiac arrhythmia.\n\n\n \n\n\n6.13 \nExample 13\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of compound 17 on function recovery after global ischemia/reperfusion\n\n\n\n\n \nEffect of compound 17 on function recovery after ischemia\n/\nreperfusion\n \n\n\n \n \n \nRat hearts were initially perfused at a constant pressure of 70 mm Hg using the procedure described above in section 6.12.1. After a 20 minutes stabilization period, hearts were subjected to 30 minute no-flow ischemia followed by 40 minute reperfusion. In treated hearts, Compound \n17\n was infused for 10 minutes prior to induction of ischemia.

The atlanto-occipital membrane was exposed and a PE-10 catheter (7.5 cm) was inserted through an incision into the subarachnoidal space. The external end of the catheter was then fixed to the skull, the wound was closed, and the rats were allowed to recover for 7 days post-surgery. Animals without neurological deficits were placed in a plexiglass observation chamber on a metal mesh surface and mechanical thresholds of the plantar surface of the paw were determined using a Dynamic Plantar Aesthesiometer (Ugo Basile, Italy) as follows: Following acclimation, the touch stimulator unit was placed under the animal's paw such that the filament was positioned under the target area of the paw. The filament was then lifted such that it contacted the pad of the animal's paw and continually exerted an increasing upward force on the paw until the animal withdrew the paw. The paw withdrawal threshold was measured 5 times in this manner in turns and the mean of the 5 values was calculated. After control threshold measurements were complete, carrageenan (3 %, 100 µl) was administered subcutaneously into a hindpaw, resulting in marked swelling and redness of the treated paw. Three hours after the carrageenan administration, the threshold values were measured again. The animals were then divided into a control group (administered vehicle intrathecally) and a treatment group (adminstered Compound 17 intrathecally at in a 10 µl injection volume).

A skin incision was made at the upper 1/3 and 2/3 left thigh area of each rat and the left sciatic nerve was exposed and freed from the surrounding connective tissue. An 8-0 nylon suture was then used to tightly ligate the left sciatic nerve of each rat so that the dorsal 1/3 to 1/2 of the nerve thickness was trapped in the ligature. The incision was closed using 4-0 sterile suture. Seven days post-surgery, the animals were put into four groups: a first group that was administered vehicle (control group); a second group that was administered Compound 17 at 0.1 mg/kg; a third group that was administered buprenorphine at 0.3 mg/kg; and a fourth group that was co-administered Compound 17 at 0.1 mg/kg and buprenorphine at 0.3 mg/kg.
