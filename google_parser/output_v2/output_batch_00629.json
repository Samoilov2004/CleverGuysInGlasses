(canceled) Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nCORP (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide) is a naturally occurring 37-amino acid peptide that is generated by tissue-specific alternate processing of calcitonin messenger RNA and is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous system. CGRP is localized predominantly in sensory afferent and central neurons and mediates several biological actions, including vasodilation. CGRP is expressed in alpha- and beta-forms that vary by one and three amino acids in the rat and human, respectively. CGRP-alpha and CGRP-beta display similar biological properties. When released from the cell, CGRP initiates its biological responses by binding to specific cell surface receptors that are predominantly coupled to the activation of adenylyl cyclase. CGRP receptors have been identified and pharmacologically evaluated in several tissues and cells, including those of brain, cardiovascular, endothelial, and smooth muscle origin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on pharmacological properties, these receptors are divided into at least two subtypes, denoted CGRP\n1 \nand CGRP\n2\n. Human α-CORP-(8-37), a fragment of CGRP that lacks seven N-terminal amino acid residues, is a selective antagonist of CGRP\n1\n, whereas the linear analogue of CGRP, diacetoamido methyl cysteine CGRP ([Cys(ACM)2,7]CGRP), is a selective agonist of CGRP\n2\n. CGRP is a potent neuromodulator that has been implicated in the pathology of cerebrovascular disorders such as migraine and cluster headache. In clinical studies, elevated levels of CGRP in the jugular vein were found to occur during migraine attacks (Goadsby et al., Ann. Neurol., 1990, 28, 183-187), and salivary levels of CORP were shown to be elevated in migraine subjects between attacks (Bellamy et al., Headache, 2006, 46, 24-33). CGRP itself has been shown to trigger migrainous headache (Lassen et al., Cephalalgia, 2002, 22, 54-61). In clinical trials, the CGRP antagonist BIBN4096BS has been shown to be effective in treating acute attacks of migraine (Olesen et al., New Engl. J. Med., 2004, 350, 1104-1110) and was able to prevent headache induced by CGRP infusion in a control group (Petersen et al., Clin. Pharmacol. Ther., 2005, 77, 202-213).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCORP-mediated activation of the trigeminovascular system may play a key role in migraine pathogenesis. Additionally, CGRP activates receptors on the smooth muscle of intracranial vessels, leading to increased vasodilation, which is thought to contribute to headache pain during migraine attacks (Lance, Headache Pathogenesis: Monoamines, Neuropeptides, Purines and Nitric Oxide, Lippincott-Raven Publishers, 1997, 3-9). The middle meningeal artery, the principle artery in the dura mater, is innervated by sensory fibers from the trigeminal ganglion which contain several neuropeptides, including CGRP. Trigeminal ganglion stimulation in the cat resulted in increased levels of CGRP, and in humans, activation of the trigeminal system caused facial flushing and increased levels of CGRP in the external jugular vein (Goadsby et al., Ann. Neurol., 1988, 23, 193-196). Electrical stimulation of the dura mater in rats increased the diameter of the middle meningeal artery, an effect that was blocked by prior administration of CORP(8-37), a peptide CGRP antagonist (Williamson et al., Cephalalgia, 1997, 17, 525-531). Trigeminal ganglion stimulation increased facial blood flow in the rat, which was inhibited by CGRP(8-37) (Escott et al., Brain Res. 1995, 669, 93-99). Electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion in marmoset produced an increase in facial blood flow that could be blocked by the non-peptide CORP antagonist BIBN4096BS (Doods et al., Br. J, Pharmacol., 2000, 129, 420-423). Thus the vascular effects of CGRP may be attenuated, prevented or reversed by a CORP antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCORP-mediated vasodilation of rat middle meningeal artery was shown to sensitize neurons of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Williamson et al., The CORP Family: Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), Amylin, and Adrenomedullin, Landes Bioscience, 2000, 245-247). Similarly, distention of dural blood vessels during migraine headache may sensitize trigeminal neurons. Some of the associated symptoms of migraine, including extra-cranial pain and facial allodynia, may be the result of sensitized trigeminal neurons (Burstein et al., Ann. Neurol. 2000, 47, 614-624). A CGRP antagonist may be beneficial in attenuating, preventing or reversing the effects of neuronal sensitization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of the compounds of the present invention to act as CGRP antagonists makes them useful pharmacological agents for disorders that involve CGRP in humans and animals, but particularly in humans. Such disorders include migraine and cluster headache (Doods, Curr Opin Inves Drugs, 2001, 2 (9), 1261-1268; Edvinsson et al., Cephalalgia, 1994, 14, 320-327); chronic tension type headache (Ashina et al., Neurology, 2000, 14, 1335-1340); pain (Yu et al., Eur. J. Pharm., 1998, 347, 275-282); chronic pain (Hulsebosch et al., Pain, 2000, 86, 163-175); neurogenic inflammation and inflammatory pain (Holzer, Neurosci., 1988, 24, 739-768; Delay-Goyet et al., Acta Physiol. Scanda. 1992, 146, 537-538; Salmon et al., Nature Neurosci., 2001, 4(4), 357-358); eye pain (May et al. Cephalalgia, 2002, 22, 195-196); tooth pain (Awawdeh et al., Int. Endocrin.

Care Med., 2002, 30 (8), 1794-1798); opiate withdrawal syndrome (Salmon et al., Nature Neurosci., 2001, 4(4), 357-358); morphine tolerance (Menard et al., J. Neurosci., 1996, 16 (7), 2342-2351); hot flashes in men and women (Chen et al., Lancet, 1993, 342, 49; Spetz et al., J. Urology, 2001, 166, 1720-1723); allergic dermatitis (Wallengren, Contact Dermatitis, 2000, 43 (3), 137-143); psoriasis; encephalitis, brain trauma, ischaemia, stroke, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative diseases (Rohrenbeck et al., Neurobiol. of Disease 1999, 6, 15-34); skin diseases (Geppetti and Holzer, Eds., Neurogenic Inflammation, 1996, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla.); neurogenic cutaneous redness, skin rosaceousness and erythema; tinnitus (Herzog et al., J. Membrane Biology, 2002, 189(3), 225); inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, (Hoffman et al. Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology, 2002, 37(4) 414-422) and cystitis. Of particular importance is the acute or prophylactic treatment of headache, including migraine and cluster headache.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compounds that are useful as

1-13, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is also directed to medicaments or pharmaceutical compositions for treating diseases or disorders in which CGRP is involved, such as migraine, which comprise a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is also directed to the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for treating diseases or disorders in which CGRP is involved, such as migraine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe

disorders in which CGRP is involved, such as migraine, by combining a compound of formula (I) with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that where one or more of the above recited structures or substructures recite multiple substituents having the same designation each such variable may be the same or different from each similarly designated variable. For example, R\n9 \nis recited multiple times in certain configurations of formula I, and each instance of R\n9 \nin formula I may independently be any of the substructures defined under R\n9\n. The invention is not limited to structures and substructures wherein each R\n9 \nmust be the same for a given structural configuration. The same is true with respect to any variable appearing multiple times in a structure or substructure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes compounds of formula I wherein on or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by deuterium. Tautomers of compounds defined in Formula I are also included within the scope of the present invention. For example, compounds including carbonyl —CH\n2\nC(O)— groups (keto forms) may undergo tautomerism to form hydroxyl —CH═C(OH)— groups (enol forms). Both keto and enol forms are included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs appreciated by those of skill in the art, halo or halogen as used herein are intended to include chloro, fluoro, bromo and iodo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “alkyl” is intended to mean linear or branched structures having no carbon-to-carbon double or triple bonds. Thus C\n1-6\nalkyl is defined to identify the group as having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbons in a linear or branched arrangement, such that C \n—\n6alkyl specifically includes, but is not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl and hexyl. “Cycloalkyl” is an alkyl, part or all of which which forms a ring of three or more atoms. C\n0 \nor C\n0\nalkyl is defined to identify the presence of a direct covalent bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “aryl” is intended to mean any stable monocyclic or bicyclic carbon ring of up to 7 members in each ring, wherein at least one ring is aromatic. Examples of such aryl elements include phenyl, napthyl, tetrahydronapthyl, indanyl, or biphenyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heterocycle” or “heterocyclic”, as used herein except where noted, represents a stable 5- to 7-membered monocyclic- or stable 8- to 11-membered bicyclic heterocyclic ring system which is either saturated or unsaturated, and which consists of carbon atoms and from one to six heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of N, O, S, P and Si, and wherein the nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized, and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized, and including any bicycle group in which any of the above-defined heterocyclic rings is fused to a benzene ring. The heterocyclic ring may be attached at any heteroatom or carbon atom which results in the creation of a stable structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a heterocyclic group as defined herein is substituted, the substituent may be bonded to a ring carbon atom of the heterocyclic group, or on a ring heteroatom (i.e., a nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur), which has a valence which permits substitution. Similarly, when a heterocyclic group is defined as a substituent herein, the point of attachment may be at a ring carbon atom of the heterocyclic group, or on a ring heteroatom (i.e., a nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur), which has a valence which permits attachment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkoxy,” as in C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxy, includes alkoxy groups of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms of a straight, branched and cyclic configuration. Examples include methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, cyclopropyloxy, cyclohexyloxy and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to derivatives wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compound of the present invention is basic, salts may be prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids, including inorganic and organic acids. Such acids include acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and the like. In one aspect of the invention the salts are citric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, maleic, phosphoric, sulfuric, fumaric, and tartaric acids. It will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of Formula I are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject compounds are useful in a method of antagonism of CGRP receptors in a patient such as a mammal in need of such antagonism comprising the administration of an effective amount of the compound. The present invention is directed to the use of the compounds disclosed herein as antagonists of CGRP receptors. In addition to primates, especially humans, a variety of other mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method for the treatment, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of a disease or disorder in which the CGRP receptor is involved in a patient that comprises administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that is an antagonist of CGRP receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is further directed to a method for the manufacture of a medicament for antagonism of CORP receptors activity in humans and animals comprising combining a compound of the present invention with a pharmaceutical carrier or diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject treated in the present methods is generally a mammal, for example a human being, male or female, in whom antagonism of CGRP receptor activity is desired. The term “therapeutically effective amount” means the amount of the subject compound that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. As used herein, the term “treatment” refers both to the treatment and to the prevention or prophylactic therapy of the mentioned conditions, particularly in a patient who is predisposed to such disease or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “composition” as used herein is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. Such term in relation to pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. By “pharmaceutically acceptable” it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the compounds of this invention which are readily convertible in vivo into the required compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present invention, the terms “administration of” or “administering a” compound shall encompass the treatment of the various conditions described with the compound specifically disclosed or with a compound which may not be specifically disclosed, but which converts to the specified compound in vivo after administration to the patient. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in “Design of Prodrugs,” ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985. Metabolites of these compounds include active species produced upon introduction of compounds of this invention into the biological milieu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of the compounds of the present invention to act as CORP antagonists makes them useful pharmacological agents for disorders that involve CGRP in humans and animals, but particularly in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention have utility in treating, preventing, ameliorating, controlling or reducing the risk of one or more of the following conditions or diseases: headache; migraine; cluster headache; chronic tension type headache; pain; chronic pain; neurogenic inflammation and inflammatory pain; neuropathic pain; eye pain; tooth pain; diabetes; non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; vascular disorders; inflammation; arthritis; bronchial hyperreactivity, asthma; shock; sepsis; opiate withdrawal syndrome; morphine tolerance; hot flashes in men and women; allergic dermatitis; psoriasis; encephalitis; brain trauma; epilepsy; neurodegenerative diseases; skin diseases; neurogenic cutaneous redness, skin rosaceousness and erythema; inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, cystitis; and other conditions that may be treated or prevented by antagonism of CORP receptors. Of particular importance is the acute or prophylactic treatment of headache, including migraine and cluster headache.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with one or more other drugs in the treatment, prevention, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of diseases or conditions for which compounds of Formula I or the other drugs may have utility, where the combination of the drugs together are safer or more effective than either drug alone. Such other drug(s) may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of Formula I. When a compound of Formula I or II is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of Formula I is preferred. However, the combination therapy may also include therapies in which the compound of Formula I and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping schedules.

All methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active compound is included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect upon the process or condition of diseases. As used herein, the term “composition” is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, solutions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the techniques described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,160,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. Oral tablets may also be formulated for immediate release, such as fast melt tablets or wafers, rapid dissolve tablets or fast dissolve films.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSyrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions and the like, containing the compounds of the present invention are employed. Similarly, transdermal patches may also be used for topical administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition and method of the present invention may further comprise other therapeutically active compounds as noted herein which are usually applied in the treatment of the above mentioned pathological conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the treatment, prevention, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of conditions which require antagonism of CGRP receptor activity an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.01 to 500 mg per kg patient body weight per day which can be administered in single or multiple doses. A suitable dosage level may be about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, or about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg per day. Within this range the dosage may be 0.05 to 0.5, 0.5 to 5 or 5 to 50 mg/kg per day. For oral administration, the compositions are may be provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, particularly 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0. 20.0, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0, 100.0, 150.0, 200.0, 250.0, 300.0, 400.0, 500.0, 600.0, 750.0, 800.0, 900.0, and 1000.0 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, or may be administered once or twice per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen treating, preventing, controlling, ameliorating, or reducing the risk of headache, migraine, cluster headache, or other diseases for which compounds of the present invention are indicated, generally satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the present invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 milligram to about 100 milligram per kilogram of animal body weight, given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 1.0 milligrams to about 1000 milligrams, or from about 1 milligrams to about 50 milligrams. In the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 7 milligrams to about 350 milligrams. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are illustrated in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting materials are made according to procedures known in the art or as illustrated herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be prepared readily according to the following Schemes and specific examples, or modifications thereof, using readily available starting materials, reagents and conventional synthesis procedures. In these reactions, it is also possible to make use of variants which are themselves known to those of ordinary skill in this art but are not mentioned in greater detail. The general procedures for making the compounds claimed in this invention can be readily understood and appreciated by one skilled in the art from viewing the following Schemes.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 1 illustrates a general strategy for the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention via coupling of carboxylic acid A with amine B to give amide C. Standard coupling conditions, such as EDC and HOBT with DIEA as base and DMF as solvent, may be successfully employed in this reaction. Other standard coupling conditions may be employed in the synthesis of such amides, including use of an alternative coupling reagent such as BOP, HATU or PyCLU, or activation of the carboxylic acid as an acid anhydride or acid chloride. In some cases, various protecting group strategies familiar to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis may be employed to allow preparation of a particular compound of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost of the acids A used to make the compounds of the present invention are readily available. They may be obtained from commercial sources or synthesized by methodology familiar to those skilled in the art and as described in the chemical literature. Many of the acids A of interest are also described in Wood et al WO 2008/020902 and Bell et al, U.S. Pat. No. 7,202,251.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis of amine intermediates may be conducted as described in Schemes 2-3. Amine intermediates bearing a variety of substituents may be prepared by employing appropriately substituted starting materials or by derivatization of any intermediates and/or final products as desired by methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis of a representative spiroimidazolone aniline (5) is illustrated in Scheme 2. The commercially available indane (1) can be alternately protected as the CBZ carbamate (2). Conversion of the carboxylic acid to the primary amide followed by Boc deprotection can produce the α-aminoamide 3, which cyclizes to the imidazolone 4 after treatment with (trimethoxymethyl)benzene and heating in toluene. The reaction of aldehyde 3 with orthoesters other than (trimethoxymethyl)benzene may be used to provide a variety of substituted imidazolones 4. The intermediate 4 may be deprotected to provide aniline 5 using a variety of well known methodologies, such as catalytic hydrogenation. Those skilled in the art of organic synthesis will recognize that straightforward modifications of this methodology may be used to access other spiroimidazolone intermediates. Additionally, use of an alternative starting material to the indane 1 may be used to provide different products, such as tetralin-based spiroimidazolones.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Scheme 3, an alternate route to the synthesis of a spiroimidazolone intermediate is shown. Treatment of hydantoin 6 (Bell et al. (2006) \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. \n16, 6165) with Boc anhydride followed by hydrolysis with NaOH leads to indanyl amino acid 7. Protection of the primary amine, followed by conversion of the carboxylic acid to the primary amide and subsequent deprotection may produce intermediate 8. A variety of ways may be used to form the spiroimidazolone ring (9), one of which is via amide coupling to a carboxylic acid, followed by base catalyzed cyclization. Another method may be reaction with an acid chloride, followed by base catalyzed cyclization. The nitro intermediate 9 may be reduced to provide aniline 5 using a variety of well known methodologies, such as catalytic hydrogenation. Alternate reduction conditions using tin or iron may also be used for the conversion of 9 to 5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases the final product may be further modified, for example, by manipulation of substituents. These manipulations may include, but are not limited to, reduction, oxidation, alkylation, acylation, and hydrolysis reactions which are commonly known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases the order of carrying out the foregoing reaction schemes may be varied to facilitate the reaction or to avoid unwanted reaction products. The following examples are provided so that the invention might be more fully understood. These examples are illustrative only and should not be construed as limiting the invention in any way.\n\n\n \nIntermediate 1\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n(±)-Benzyl[2-amino-2-(aminocarbonyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-5-yl]carbamate\n\n\nStep A.

It is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as antagonists of CORP receptor activity may be demonstrated by methodology known in the art. Inhibition of the binding of \n125\nI-CGRP to receptors and functional antagonism of CORP receptors were determined as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNATIVE RECEPTOR BINDING ASSAY: The binding of \n125\nI-CGRP to receptors in SK-N-MC cell membranes was carried out essentially as described (Edvinsson et al. (2001) \nEur. J. Pharmacal. \n415, 39-44). Briefly, membranes (25 μg) were incubated in 1 mL of binding buffer [10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nand 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)] containing 10 pM \n125\nI-CGRP and antagonist. After incubation at room temperature for 3 h, the assay was terminated by filtration through GFB glass fibre filter plates (PerkinElmer) that had been blocked with 0.5% polyethyleneimine for 3 h. The filters were washed three times with ice-cold assay buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and 5 mM MgCl\n2\n), then the plates were air dried. Scintillation fluid (50 μL) was added and the radioactivity was counted on a Topcount (Packard Instrument). Data analysis was carried out by using Prism and the K; was determined by using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng & Prusoff (1973) \nBiochem. Pharmacol, \n22, 3099-3108).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRECOMBINANT RECEPTOR: Human CL receptor (Genbank accession number L76380) was subcloned into the expression vector pIREShyg2 (BD Biosciences Clontech) as a 5′NheI and 3′ PmeI fragment. Human RAMP1 (Genbank accession number AJ001014) was subcloned into the expression vector pIRESpuro2 (BD Biosciences Clontech) as a 5′NheI and 3′NotI fragment. HEK 293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells; ATCC #CRL-1573) were cultured in DMEM with 4.5 g/L glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and maintained at 37° C. and 95% humidity. Cells were subcultured by treatment with 0.25% trypsin with 0.1% EDTA in HBSS. Stable cell line generation was accomplished by co-transfecting 10 μg of DNA with 30 ug Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 75 cm\n2 \nflasks. CL receptor and RAMP1 expression constructs were co-transfected in equal amounts. Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were diluted and selective medium (growth medium+300 μg/mL hygromycin and 1 μg/mL puromycin) was added the following day. A clonal cell line was generated by single cell deposition utilizing a FACS Vantage SE (Becton Dickinson). Growth medium was adjusted to 150 μg/mL hygromycin and 0.5 μg/mL puromycin for cell propagation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRECOMBINANT RECEPTOR BINDING ASSAY: Cells expressing recombinant human CL receptor/RAMP1 were washed with PBS and harvested in harvest buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche). The cell suspension was disrupted with a laboratory homogenizer and centrifuged at 48,000 g to isolate membranes. The pellets were resuspended in harvest buffer plus 250 mM sucrose and stored at 70° C. For binding assays, 20 μg of membranes were incubated in 1 ml binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, and 0.2% BSA) for 3 hours at room temperature containing 10 pM \n125\nI-hCGRP (GE Healthcare) and antagonist. The assay was terminated by filtration through 96-well GFB glass fiber filter plates (PerkinElmer) that had been blocked with 0.05% polyethyleneimine. The filters were washed 3 times with ice-cold assay buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and 5 mM MgCl\n2\n). Scintillation fluid was added and the plates were counted on a Topcount (Packard). Non-specific binding was determined and the data analysis was carried out with the apparent dissociation constant (K.) determined by using a non-linear least squares fitting the bound CPM data to the equation below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\nobsd\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\nmin\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nDrug\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nRadiolabel\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nWhere Y is observed CPM bound, Y\nmax \nis total bound counts, Y\nmin \nis non specific bound counts, (Y\nmax\n-Y\nmin\n) is specific bound counts, % I\nmax \nis the maximum percent inhibition, % I min is the minimum percent inhibition, radiolabel is the probe, and the K\nd \nis the apparent dissociation constant for the radioligand for the receptor as determined by Hot saturation experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRECOMBINANT RECEPTOR FUNCTIONAL ASSAY: Cells were plated in complete growth medium at 85,000 cells/well in 96-well poly-D-lysine coated plates (Corning) and cultured for ˜19 h before assay. Cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with inhibitor for 30 min at 37° C. and 95% humidity in Cellgro Complete Serum-Free/Low-Protein medium (Mediatech, Inc.) with L-glutamine and 1 g/L BSA. Isobutyl-methylxanthine was added to the cells at a concentration of 300 μM and incubated for 30 min at 37° C. Human α-CGRP was added to the cells at a concentration of 0.3 nM and allowed to incubate at 37° C. for 5 min. After α-CGRP stimulation the cells were washed with PBS and processed for cAMP determination utilizing the two-stage assay procedure according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (cAMP SPA direct screening assay system; RPA 559; GE Healthcare). Dose response curves were plotted and IC\n50 \nvalues determined from a 4-parameter logistic fit as defined by the equation y=((a-d)/(1+(x/c)\nb\n)+d, where y=response, x=dose, a=max response, d=min response, c=inflection point and b=slope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn suitable assays, such as those described herein, the compounds of the invention are expected to have activity as antagonists of the CGRP receptor, generally with a K\ni \nor IC\n50 \nvalue of less than about 50 μM. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds of the invention as antagonists of CGRP receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamplary K\ni \nvalues in the recombinant receptor binding assay for exemplary compounds of the invention are provided in the table below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n570\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n2600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n6400\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n630\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n130\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n160\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the invention has been described and illustrated with reference to certain particular embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various adaptations, changes, modifications, substitutions, deletions, or additions of procedures and protocols may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
