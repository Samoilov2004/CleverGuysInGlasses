Description\n\n\n\n\n PYRROLOBEN ODIA EPINES USED TO TREAT PROLIFERATIVE DISEASES \n\n\nThe present invention relates to pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs), in particular \n\n\npyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers having a C2-C3 double bond and an aryl group at the C2 position on one monomer unit, and a C2-C3 double bond and either a conjugated double or triple bond at the C2 position or an alkyl group at the C2 position on the other monomer unit. \n\n\nBackground to the invention \n\n\nSome pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) have the ability to recognise and bond to specific sequences of DNA; the preferred sequence is PuGPu. The first PBD antitumour antibiotic, anthramycin, was discovered in 1965 (Leimgruber, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 87, 5793- 5795 (1965); Leimgruber, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 87, 5791-5793 (1965)). Since then, a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported, and over 10 synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues (Thurston, et al., Chem. Rev. 1994, 433-465\n\n\n(1994)). Family members include abbeymycin (Hochlowski, et al., J. Antibiotics, 40, 145- 148 (1987)), chicamycin (Konishi, et al., J. Antibiotics, 37, 200-206 (1984)), DC-81 \n\n\n(Japanese Patent 58-180 487; Thurston, et al., Chem. Brit, 26, 767-772 (1990); Bose, et al., Tetrahedron, 48, 751-758 (1992)), mazethramycin (Kuminoto, et al., J. Antibiotics, 33, 665-667 (1980)), neothramycins A and B (Takeuchi, et al., J. Antibiotics, 29, 93-96 (1976)), porothramycin (Tsunakawa, et al., J. Antibiotics, 41 , 1366-1373 (1988)), prothracarcin (Shimizu, et al, J. Antibiotics, 29, 2492-2503 (1982); Langley and Thurston, J. Org. Chem., 52, 91 -97 (1987)), sibanomicin (DC-102)(Hara, et al., J. Antibiotics, 41 , 702-704 (1988); Itoh, et al., J. Antibiotics, 41 , 1281-1284 (1988)), sibiromycin (Leber, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 110, 2992-2993 (1988)) and tomamycin (Arima, et al., J. Antibiotics, 25, 437-444 (1972)). PBDs are of the general structure: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n They differ in the number, type and position of substituents, in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings, and in the degree of saturation of the C ring. In the B-ring there is either an imine (N=C), a carbinolamine(NH-CH(OH)), or a carbinolamine methyl ether (NH- CH(OMe)) at the N10-C1 1 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for \n\n alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an (S)-configuration at the chiral C1 1 a position which provides them with a right-handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three-dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B-form DNA, leading to a snug fit at the binding site (Kohn, In Antibiotics III. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 3-1 1 (1975); Hurley and Needham-\n\n\nVanDevanter, Acc. Chem. Res., 19, 230-237 (1986)). Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove, enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their use as antitumour agents. It has been previously disclosed that the biological activity of this molecules can be potentiated by joining two PBD units together through their C8/C'-hydroxyl functionalities via a flexible alkylene linker (Bose, D.S., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 114, 4939-4941 (1992); Thurston, D.E., et al., J. Org. Chem., 61 , 8141 -8147 (1996)). The PBD dimers are thought to form sequence-selective DNA lesions such as the palindromic 5'-Pu-GATC-Py-3' interstrand cross-link (Smellie, M., et al., Biochemistry, 42, 8232-8239 (2003); Martin, C, et al, Biochemistry, 44, 4135-4147) which is thought to be mainly responsible for their biological activity. -136): \n\n\n\n\n\nhas recently completed Phase I clinical trials in the oncology area and is about to enter Phase II (Gregson, S., et al., J. Med.

In one embodiment, the Linker unit includes a Stretcher unit (A), a Specificity unit (L\n1\n), and a Spacer unit (L\n2\n). The Linker unit is connected at one end to the Ligand unit and at the other end to the PBD dimer compound. \n\n\nIn one aspect, such a Conjugate is shown below in formula Ilia: \n\n\nL- (A\n1\n \na\n-L\n1\ns-L\n2\n \ny\n-D)p (Ilia) \n\n\n wherein: \n\n\n L is the Ligand unit; and \n\n\n -A\n1\na-L\n1\n \ns\n-L\n2\ny- is a Linker unit (LU), wh \n\n\n -A\n1\n- is a Stretcher unit, \n\n\n a is 1 or 2, \n\n\n L\n1\n - is a Specificity unit, \n\n\n s is an integer ranging from 1 to 12, \n\n\n -L\n2\n- is a Spacer unit, \n\n\n y is 0, 1 or 2; \n\n\n -D is an PBD dimer; and \n\n\n p is from 1 to 20. \n\n\n\n\n\nL - (A\n1\n \na\n- L\n2\n \ny\n -D)\np\n (1Mb) \n\n\nAlso illustrated as: \n\n\n L - (A\n1\n \na\n- L\n2\n \ny\n (- L\n1\ns) -D)p (lb) \n\n wherein: \n\n\n L is the Ligand unit; and \n\n\n -A\n1\n \na\n-L\n1\ns(L\n2\ny)- is a Linker unit (LU), wherein: \n\n\n -A\n1\n- is a Stretcher unit linked to a Stretcher unit (L\n2\n), \n\n\n a is 1 or 2, \n\n\n L\n1\n - is a Specificity unit linked to a Stretcher unit (L\n2\n), \n\n\n s is an integer ranging from 0 to 12, \n\n\n -L\n2\n- is a Spacer unit, \n\n\n y is 0, 1 or 2; \n\n\n -D is a PBD dimer; and \n\n\n p is from 1 to 20. \n\n\nPreferences \n\n\n The following preferences may apply to all aspects of the invention as described above, or may relate to a single aspect. The preferences may be combined together in any combination. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the Conjugate has the formula: \n\n\n wherein L, A\n1\n, a, L\n1\n \n,\n s, L\n2\n, D and p are as described above. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the Ligand unit (L) is a Cell Binding Agent (CBA) that specifically binds to a target molecule on the surface of a target cell. An exemplary formula is illustrated below: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where the asterisk indicates the point of attachment to the Drug unit (D), CBA is the\n\n\nCell Binding Agent, L\n1\n is a Specificity unit, A\n1\n is a Stretcher unit connecting L\n1\n to the Cell Binding Agent, L\n2\n is a Spacer unit, which is a covalent bond, a self-immolative group or together with -OC(=0)- forms a self-immolative group, and L\n2\n optional. \n\n In another embodiment, the Ligand unit (L) is a Cell Binding Agent (CBA) that specifically binds to a target molecule on the surface of a target cell. An exemplary formula is illustrated below:\n\n\n \n\n where the asterisk indicates the point of attachment to the Drug unit (D), CBA is the Cell Binding Agent, L\n1\n is a Specificity unit, A\n1\n is a Stretcher unit connecting L\n1\n to the Cell Binding Agent, L\n2\n is a Spacer unit which is a covalent bond or a self-immolative group, and a is 1 or 2, s is 0, 1 or 2, and y is 0 or 1 or 2. \n\n\nIn the embodiments illustrated above, L\n1\n can be a cleavable Specificity unit, and may be referred to as a \"trigger\" that when cleaved activates a self-immolative group (or self- immolative groups) L\n2\n, when a self-immolative group(s) is present. When the Specificity unit L\n1\n is cleaved, or the linkage (i.e., the covalent bond) between L\n1\n and L\n2\n is cleaved, the self-immolative group releases the Drug unit (D). \n\n\nIn another embodiment, the Ligand unit (L) is a Cell Binding Agent (CBA) that specifically binds to a target molecule on the surface of a target cell. An exemplary formula is illustrated below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I\n\n\nCBA - A\n1\n \na\n- L\n2\n \ny\n - \n*\n where the asterisk indicates the point of attachment to the Drug (D), CBA is the Cell Binding Agent, L\n1\n is a Specificity unit connected to L\n2\n, A\n1\n is a Stretcher unit connecting L\n2\n to the Cell Binding Agent, L\n2\n is a self-immolative group, and a is 1 or 2, s is 1 or 2, and y is 1 or 2. \n\n\nIn the various embodiments discussed herein, the nature of L\n1\n and L\n2\n can vary widely. These groups are chosen on the basis of their characteristics, which may be dictated in part, by the conditions at the site to which the conjugate is delivered. Where the Specificity unit L\n1\n is cleavable, the structure and/or sequence of L\n1\n is selected such that it is cleaved by the action of enzymes present at the target site (e.g., the target cell). L\n1\n units that are cleavable by changes in pH (e.g. acid or base labile), temperature or upon irradiation (e.g. photolabile) may also be used. L\n1\n units that are cleavable under reducing or oxidising conditions may also find use in the Conjugates. \n\n\nIn some embodiments, L\n1\n may comprise one amino acid or a contiguous sequence of amino acids. The amino acid sequence may be the target substrate for an enzyme. \n\n In one embodiment, L\n1\n is cleavable by the action of an enzyme. In one embodiment, the enzyme is an esterase or a peptidase. For example, L\n1\n may be cleaved by a lysosomal protease, such as a cathepsin. In one embodiment, L\n2\n is present and together with -C(=0)0- forms a self-immolative group or self-immolative groups. In some embodiments, -C(=0)0- also is a self-immolative group. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, where L\n1\n is cleavable by the action of an enzyme and L\n2\n is present, the enzyme cleaves the bond between L\n1\n and L\n2\n, whereby the self-immolative group(s) release the Drug unit. \n\n\nL\n1\n and L\n2\n, where present, may be connected by a bond selected from: \n\n\n -C(=0)NH-, \n\n\n -C(=0)0-, \n\n\n -NHC(=0)-, \n\n\n -OC(=0)-, \n\n\n -OC(=0)0-, \n\n\n -NHC(=0)0-, \n\n\n -OC(=0)NH-, \n\n\n -NHC(=0)NH, and \n\n\n -O- (a glycosidic bond). \n\n\nAn amino group of L\n1\n that connects to L\n2\n may be the N-terminus of an amino acid or may be derived from an amino group of an amino acid side chain, for example a lysine amino acid side chain. \n\n\nA carboxyl group of L\n1\n that connects to L\n2\n may be the C-terminus of an amino acid or may be derived from a carboxyl group of an amino acid side chain, for example a glutamic acid amino acid side chain. \n\n\nA hydroxy group of L\n1\n that connects to L\n2\n may be derived from a hydroxy group of an amino acid side chain, for example a serine amino acid side chain. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, -C(=0)0- and L\n2\n together form the group: \n\n\n \n\n where the asterisk indicates the point of attachment to the Drug unit, the wavy line indicates the point of attachment to the L\n1\n, Y is -N(H)-, -0-, -C(=0)N(H)- or -C(=0)0-, and n is 0 to 3. The phenylene ring is optionally substituted with one, two or three substituents as described herein. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, Y is NH. \n\n\n In one embodiment, n is 0 or 1 . Preferably, n is 0. \n\n\nWhere Y is NH and n is 0, the self-immolative group may be referred to as a \n\n\np-aminobenzylcarbonyl linker (PABC). \n\n\nThe self-immolative group will allow for release of the Drug unit (i.e., the asymmetric PBD) when a remote site in the linker is activated, proceeding along the lines shown below (for n=0): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where the asterisk indicates the attachment to the Drug, L\n*\n is the activated form of the remaining portion of the linker and the released Drug unit is not shown. These groups have the advantage of separating the site of activation from the Drug. \n\n\nIn another embodiment, -C(=0)0- and L\n2\n together form a group selected from: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where the asterisk, the wavy line, Y, and n are as defined above. Each phenylene ring is optionally substituted with one, two or three substituents as described herein. In one \n\n embodiment, the phenylene ring having the Y substituent is optionally substituted phenylene ring not having the Y substituent is unsubstituted. \n\n\nIn another embodiment, -C =0)0- and L\n2\n together form a group selected from: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where the asterisk, the wavy line, Y, and n are as defined above, E is O, S or NR, D is N, CH, or CR, and F is N, CH, or CR. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, D is N. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, D is CH. \n\n\n In one embodiment, E is O or S. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, F is CH. \n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the covalent bond between L\n1\n and L\n2\n is a cathepsin labile (e.g., cleavable) bond. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, L\n1\n comprises a dipeptide. The amino acids in the dipeptide may be any combination of natural amino acids and non-natural amino acids. In some \n\n\nembodiments, the dipeptide comprises natural amino acids. Where the linker is a cathepsin labile linker, the dipeptide is the site of action for cathepsin-mediated cleavage. The dipeptide then is a recognition site for cathepsin. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the group -X X\n2\n- in dipeptide,\n\n\n is selected from: \n\n\n -Phe-Lys-, \n\n\n -Val-Ala-, \n\n\n -Val-Lys-, \n\n\n -Ala-Lys-, \n\n\n -Val-Cit-, \n\n\n -Phe-Cit-, \n\n\n -Leu-Cit-, \n\n\n -lle-Cit-, \n\n\n -Phe-Arg-, and \n\n\n -Trp-Cit-; \n\n\nwhere Cit is citrulline. In such a dipeptide, -NH- is the amino group of Xi, and CO is the carbonyl group of X\n2\n. \n\n\nPreferably, the group -XrX\n2\n- in dipeptide, -NH-X X\n2\n-CO-, is selected from: \n\n -Phe-Lys-, \n\n\n -Val-Ala-, \n\n\n -Val-Lys-, \n\n\n -Ala-Lys-, and \n\n\n -Val-Cit-. \n\n\nMost preferably, the group -X\n!\n-X\n2\n- in dipeptide, -NH-XrX\n2\n-CO-, is -Phe-Lys-, Val-Cit or -Val-Ala-. Other dipeptide combinations of interest include: \n\n\n -Gly-Gly-, \n\n\n -Pro-Pro-, and \n\n\n -Val-Glu-. Other dipeptide combinations may be used, including those described by Dubowchik et al., which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the amino acid side chain is chemically protected, where appropriate. The side chain protecting group may be a group as discussed below. Protected amino acid sequences are cleavable by enzymes. For example, a dipeptide sequence comprising a Boc side chain-protected Lys residue is cleavable by cathepsin. \n\n\nProtecting groups for the side chains of amino acids are well known in the art and are described in the Novabiochem Catalog. Additional protecting group strategies are set out in Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene and Wuts. \n\n\nPossible side chain protecting groups are shown below for those amino acids having reactive side chain functionality: \n\n\n Arg: Z, Mtr, Tos; \n\n\n Asn: Trt, Xan; \n\n\n Asp: Bzl, t-Bu; \n\n\n Cys: Acm, Bzl, Bzl-OMe, Bzl-Me, Trt; \n\n\n Glu: Bzl, t-Bu; \n\n\n Gin: Trt, Xan; \n\n\n His: Boc, Dnp, Tos, Trt; \n\n\n Lys: Boc, Z-CI, Fmoc, Z; \n\n\n Ser: Bzl, TBDMS, TBDPS; \n\n\n Thr: Bz; \n\n\n Trp: Boc; \n\n\n Tyr: Bzl, Z, Z-Br. \n\n In one embodiment, -X\n2\n- is connected indirectly to the Drug unit. In such an embodiment, the Spacer unit L\n2\n is present. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the dipeptide is used in combination with a self-immolative group(s) (the Spacer unit). The self-immolative group(s) may be connected to -X\n2\n-. \n\n\nWhere a self-immolative group is present, -X\n2\n- is connected directly to the self-immolative group. In one embodiment, -X\n2\n- is connected to the group Y of the self-immolative group. Preferably the group -X\n2\n-CO- is connected to Y, where Y is NH. \n\n\n-X is connected directly to A\n1\n. In one embodiment, -X-p is connected directly to A\n1\n. \n\n\nPreferably the group NH-X (the amino terminus of Xi) is connected to A\n1\n. A\n1\n may comprise the functionality -CO- thereby to form an amide link with -X . In one embodiment, L\n1\n and L\n2\n together with -OC(=0)- comprise the group -X X\n2\n-PABC-. The PABC group is connected directly to the Drug unit. In one example, the self- immolative group and the dipeptide together form the group -Phe-Lys-PABC-, which is illustrated below: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where the asterisk indicates the point of attachment to the Drug unit, and the wavy line indicates the point of attachment to the remaining portion of L\n1\n or the point of attachment to A\n1\n. Preferably, the wavy line indicates the point of attachment to A\n1\n. \n\n\nAlternatively, the self-immolative group and the dipeptide together form the group -Val-Ala- PABC-, which is illustrated below: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where the asterisk and the wavy line are as defined above. In another embodiment, L\n1\n and L\n2\n together with -OC(=0)- represent: \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n where the asterisk indicates the point of attachment to the Drug unit, the wavy line indicates the point of attachment to A\n1\n, Y is a covalent bond or a functional group, and E is a group that is susceptible to cleavage thereby to activate a self-immolative group. \n\n\nE is selected such that the group is susceptible to cleavage, e.g., by light or by the action of an enzyme. E may be -N0\n2\n or glucuronic acid (e.g., β-glucuronic acid). The former may be susceptible to the action of a nitroreductase, the latter to the action of a \n\n\nβ-glucuronidase. \n\n\nThe group Y may be a covalent bond. \n\n\nThe group Y may be a functional group selected from: \n\n\n -C(=0)- -NH- -O-\n\n\n-C(=0)NH-, \n\n\n -C(=0)0-, \n\n\n -NHC(=0)-, \n\n\n -OC(=0)-, \n\n\n -OC(=0)0-, \n\n\n -NHC(=0)0-, \n\n\n -OC(=0)NH-, \n\n\n -NHC(=0)NH-, \n\n\n -NHC(=0)NH, \n\n\n -C(=0)NHC(=0)-, \n\n\n S0\n2\n, and \n\n\n -S-. The group Y is preferably -NH-, -CH\n2\n-, -0-, and -S- \n\n\nIn some embodiments, L\n1\n and L\n2\n together with -OC(=0)- represent: \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n where the asterisk indicates the point of attachment to the Drug unit, the wavy line indicates the point of attachment to A, Y is a covalent bond or a functional group and E is glucuronic acid (e.g., β-glucuronic acid). Y is preferably a functional group selected from -NH-. \n\n\nIn some embo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where the asterisk indicates the point of attachment to the remainder of L\n2\n or the Drug unit, the wavy line indicates the point of attachment to A\n1\n, Y is a covalent bond or a functional group and E is glucuronic acid (e.g., β-glucuronic acid). Y is preferably a functional group selected from -NH-, -CH\n2\n-, -0-, and -S-. \n\n\n In some further embodiments, Y is a functional group as set forth above, the functional group is linked to an amino acid, and the amino acid is linked to the Stretcher unit A\n1\n.

In a preferred embodiment, n is 1 and m is 0 to 10, 1 to 8, preferably 4 to 8, most preferably 4 or 8. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the connection between the Ligand unit and A\n1\n is through a thiol residue of the Ligand unit and a maleimide group of A\n1\n. \n\n In one embodiment, the connection between the Ligand unit and A\n1\n is: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where the asterisk indicates the point of attachment to the remaining portion of A\n1\n , L\n1\n, L\n2\n or D, and the wavy line indicates the point of attachment to the remaining portion of the Ligand unit. In this embodiment, the S atom is typically derived from the Ligand unit. \n\n\nIn each of the embodiments above, an alternative functionality may be used in place of the malemide-derived group shown below \n\n\n\n\n\n where the wavy line indicates the point of attachment to the Ligand unit as before, and the asterisk indicates the bond to the remaining portion of the A\n1\n group, or to L\n1\n, L\n2\n or D. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the maleimide-derived group is replaced with the group: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where the wavy line indicates point of attachment to the Ligand unit, and the asterisk indicates the bond to the remaining portion of the A\n1\n group , or to L\n1\n, L\n2\n or D. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the maleimide-derived group is replaced with a group, which optionally together with a Ligand unit (e.g., a Cell Binding Agent), is selected from: \n\n\n -C(=0)NH-, \n\n\n -C(=0)0-, \n\n\n -NHC(=0)-, \n\n\n -OC(=0)-, \n\n\n -OC(=0)0-, \n\n\n -NHC(=0)0-, \n\n\n -OC(=0)NH-, \n\n\n -NHC(=0)NH-, \n\n\n -NHC(=0)NH, \n\n -C(=0)NHC(=0)-, \n\n\n -S-, \n\n\n -S-S-, \n\n\n -CH\n2\nC(=0)- -C(=0)CH\n2\n-, \n\n\n =N-NH-, and \n\n\n -NH-N=. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the maleimide-derived group is replaced with a group, which optionally together with the Ligand unit, is s \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n where the wavy line indicates either the point of attachment to the Ligand unit or the bond to the remaining portion of the A\n1\n group, and the asterisk indicates the other of the point of attachment to the Ligand unit or the bond to the remaining portion of the A\n1\n group. \n\n\nOther groups suitable for connecting L\n1\n to the Cell Binding Agent are described in \n\n\nWO 2005/082023. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the Stretcher unit A\n1\n is present, the Specificity unit L\n1\n is present and Spacer unit L\n2\n is absent.

As described above, the amino acids in the dipeptide may be any combination of natural amino acids and non-natural amino acids. In some embodiments, the dipeptide comprises natural amino acids. Where the linker is a cathepsin labile linker, the dipeptide is the site of action for cathepsin-mediated cleavage.

In one embodiment, the Linker-Drug compounds are designed for connection to a Cell Binding Agent. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the Drug Linker formula: \n\n\n\n\n\n where the asterisk indicates the point of attachment to the Drug unit, G\n1\n is a Stretcher group (A\n1\n) to form a connection to a Ligand unit, L\n1\n is a Specificity unit, L\n2\n (a Spacer unit) is a covalent bond or together with -OC(=0)- forms a self-immolative group(s). \n\n\nIn another embodiment, the Drug Linker compound has the formula: \n\n\nG\n1\n-L\n1\n-L\n2\n- . where the asterisk indicates the point of attachment to the Drug unit, G\n1\n is a Stretcher unit (A\n1\n) to form a connection to a Ligand unit, L\n1\n is a Specificity unit, L\n2\n (a Spacer unit) is a covalent bond or a self-immolative group(s). \n\n\nL\n1\n and L\n2\n are as defined above.

Protecting groups for use in a cathepsin labile linker are also discussed in Dubowchik et al. In certain embodiments of the invention, the group L\n1\n includes a Lys amino acid residue. The side chain of this amino acid may be protected with a Boc or Alloc protected group. A Boc protecting group is most preferred. \n\n\nThe functional group G\n1\n forms a connecting group upon reaction with a Ligand unit (e.g., a cell binding agent. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the functional group G\n1\n is or comprises an amino, carboxylic acid, hydroxy, thiol, or maleimide group for reaction with an appropriate group on the Ligand unit. In a preferred embodiment, G\n1\n comprises a maleimide group. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the group G\n1\n is an alkyl maleimide group.

In one embodiment, the group G\n1\n is: \n\n\n\n\n\n where the asterisk indicates the point of attachment to L\n1\n, L\n2\n or D, and n is 0 to 6.

In a preferred embodiment, n is 1 and m is 0 to 10, 1 to 8, preferably 4 to 8, and most preferably 4 or 8. \n\n\nIn each of the embodiments above, an alternative functionality may be used in place of the malemide group shown below: \n\n\n\n\n\n where the asterisk indicates the bond to the remaining portion of the G In one embodiment, the maleimide-derived group is replaced with the group: \n\n\n\n\n\n where the asterisk indicates the bond to the remaining portion of the G group. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the maleimide group is replaced with a group selected from: \n\n\n -C(=0)OH, \n\n\n -OH, \n\n\n -NH\n2\n, \n\n\n -SH, \n\n\n -C(=0)CH\n2\nX, where X is CI, Br or I, \n\n\n -CHO, \n\n\n -NHNH\n2\n \n\n\n -C≡CH, and \n\n\n -N\n3\n (azide). \n\n\nIn one embodiment, L\n1\n is present, and G\n1\n is -NH\n2\n, -NHMe, -COOH, -OH or -SH. \n\n In one embodiment, where L\n1\n is present, G\n1\n is -NH\n2\n or -NHMe. Either group may be the N-terminal of an L\n1\n amino acid sequence. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, L\n1\n is present and G\n1\n is -NH\n2\n, and L\n1\n is an amino acid sequence -X X\n2\n- , as defined above. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, L\n1\n is present and G\n1\n is COOH. This group may be the C-terminal of an L\n1\n amino acid sequence. In one embodiment, L\n1\n is present and G\n1\n is OH. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, L\n1\n is present and G\n1\n is SH. \n\n\nThe group G\n1\n may be convertible from one functional group to another. In one \n\n\nembodiment, L\n1\n is present and G\n1\n is -NH\n2\n. This group is convertable to another group G\n1\n comprising a maleimide group. For example, the group -NH\n2\n may be reacted with an acids or an activated acid (e.g., N-succinimide forms) of those G\n1\n groups comprising maleimide shown above. \n\n\nThe group G\n1\n may therefore be converted to a functional group that is more appropriate for reaction with a Ligand unit. \n\n\nAs noted above, in one embodiment, L\n1\n is present and G\n1\n is -NH\n2\n, -NHMe, -COOH, -OH or -SH. In a further embodiment, these groups are provided in a chemically protected form. The chemically protected form is therefore a precursor to the linker that is provided with a functional group. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, G\n1\n is -NH\n2\n in a chemically protected form. The group may be protected with a carbamate protecting group. The carbamate protecting group may be selected from the group consisting of: \n\n\n Alloc, Fmoc, Boc, Troc, Teoc, Cbz and PNZ. \n\n\n Preferably, where G\n1\n is -NH\n2\n, it is protected with an Alloc or Fmoc group. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, where G\n1\n is -NH\n2\n, it is protected with an Fmoc group. In one embodiment, the protecting group is the same as the carbamate protecting group of the capping group. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the protecting group is not the same as the carbamate protecting group of the capping group. In this embodiment, it is preferred that the protecting group is removable under conditions that do not remove the carbamate protecting group of the capping group. \n\n The chemical protecting group may be removed to provide a functional group to form a connection to a Ligand unit. Optionally, this functional group may then be converted to another functional group as described above. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the active group is an amine. This amine is preferably the N-terminal amine of a peptide, and may be the N-terminal amine of the preferred dipeptides of the invention. The active group may be reacted to yield the functional group that is intended to form a connection to a Ligand unit. \n\n\nIn other embodiments, the Linker unit is a precursor to the Linker uit having an active group. In this embodiment, the Linker unit comprises the active group, which is protected by way of a protecting group. The protecting group may be removed to provide the Linker unit having an active group. \n\n\nWhere the active group is an amine, the protecting group may be an amine protecting group, such as those described in Green and Wuts. \n\n\nThe protecting group is preferably orthogonal to other protecting groups, where present, in the Linker unit. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the protecting group is orthogonal to the capping group. Thus, the active group protecting group is removable whilst retaining the capping group. In other embodiments, the protecting group and the capping group is removable under the same conditions as those used to remove the capping group. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the Linker unit is: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where the asterisk indicates the point of attachment to the Drug unit, and the wavy line indicates the point of attachment to the remaining portion of the Linker unit, as \n\n applicable or the point of attachment to G\n1\n. Preferably, the wavy line indicates the point of attachment to G\n1\n. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the Linker unit is: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the asterisk and the wavy line are as defined above. \n\n\nOther functional groups suitable for use in forming a connection between L\n1\n and the Cell Binding Agent are described in WO 2005/082023. \n\n\nLigand Unit \n\n\nThe Ligand Unit may be of any kind, and include a protein, polypeptide, peptide and a non- peptidic agent that specifically binds to a target molecule. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit may be a protein, polypeptide or peptide. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit may be a cyclic polypeptide. These Ligand units can include antibodies or a fragment of an antibody that contains at least one target molecule-binding site, lymphokines, hormones, growth factors, or any other cell binding molecule or substance that can specifically bind to a target. The terms \"specifically binds\" and \"specific binding\" refer to the binding of an antibody or other protein, polypeptide or peptide to a predetermined molecule (e.g., an antigen). \n\n\nTypically, the antibody or other molecule binds with an affinity of at least about 1x10\n7\n M\n\"1\n, and binds to the predetermined molecule with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific molecule (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined molecule or a closely-related molecule. \n\n\nExamples of Ligand units include those agents described for use in WO 2007/085930, which is incorporated herein. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit is a Cell Binding Agent that binds to an extracellular target on a cell. Such a Cell Binding Agent can be a protein, polypeptide, peptide or a non- peptidic agent. In some embodiments, the Cell Binding Agent may be a protein, polypeptide or peptide. In some embodiments, the Cell Binding Agent may be a cyclic polypeptide. The Cell Binding Agent also may be antibody or an antigen-binding fragment \n\n of an antibody. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). \n\n\nIn one embodiment the antibody is a monoclonal antibody; chimeric antibody; humanized antibody; fully human antibody; or a single chain antibody. One embodiment the antibody is a fragment of one of these antibodies having biological activity. Examples of such fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n and Fv fragments. \n\n\nThe antibody may be a diabody, a domain antibody (DAB) or a single chain antibody. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. \n\n\nAntibodies for use in the present invention include those antibodies described in \n\n\nWO 2005/082023 which is incorporated herein. Particularly preferred are those antibodies for tumour-associated antigens. Examples of those antigens known in the art include, but are not limited to, those tumour-associated antigens set out in WO 2005/082023. See, for instance, pages 41 -55. \n\n\nIn some embodiments, the conjugates are designed to target tumour cells via their cell surface antigens. The antigens may be cell surface antigens which are either over- expressed or expressed at abnormal times or cell types. Preferably, the target antigen is expressed only on proliferative cells (preferably tumour cells); however this is rarely observed in practice. As a result, target antigens are usually selected on the basis of differential expression between proliferative and healthy tissue. \n\n\nAntibodies have been raised to target specific tumour related antigens including: \n\n\n Cripto, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD30, CD33, Glycoprotein NMB, CanAg, Her2 (ErbB2/Neu), CD56 (NCAM), CD70, CD79, CD138, PSCA, PSMA (prostate specific membrane antigen), BCMA, E-selectin, EphB2, Melanotransferin, Mud 6 and TMEFF2. \n\n\nThe Ligand unit is connected to the Linker unit. In one embodiment, the Ligand unit is connected to A, where present, of the Linker unit. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the connection between the Ligand unit and the Linker unit is through a thioether bond. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the connection between the Ligand unit and the Linker unit is through a disulfide bond. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the connection between the Ligand unit and the Linker unit is through an amide bond. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the connection between the Ligand unit and the Linker unit is through an ester bond. \n\n In one embodiment, the connection between the Ligand unit and the Linker is formed between a thiol group of a cysteine residue of the Ligand unit and a maleimide group of the Linker unit. \n\n\nThe cysteine residues of the Ligand unit may be available for reaction with the functional group of the Linker unit to form a connection. In other embodiments, for example where the Ligand unit is an antibody, the thiol groups of the antibody may participate in interchain disulfide bonds. These interchain bonds may be converted to free thiol groups by e.g. treatment of the antibody with DTT prior to reaction with the functional group of the Linker unit. \n\n\nIn some embodiments, the cysteine residue is an introduced into the heavy or light chain of an antibody. Positions for cysteine insertion by substitution in antibody heavy or light chains include those described in Published U.S. Application No. 2007-0092940 and International Patent Publication WO2008070593, which are incorporated herein. \n\n\nMethods of Treatment \n\n\n The compounds of the present invention may be used in a method of therapy. Also provided is a method of treatment, comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeutically-effective amount of a compound of formula I. The term \n\n\n\"therapeutically effective amount\" is an amount sufficient to show benefit to a patient. Such benefit may be at least amelioration of at least one symptom. The actual amount administered, and rate and time-course of administration, will depend on the nature and severity of what is being treated. Prescription of treatment, e.g. decisions on dosage, is within the responsibility of general practitioners and other medical doctors. \n\n\nA compound may be administered alone or in combination with other treatments, either simultaneously or sequentially dependent upon the condition to be treated. Examples of treatments and therapies include, but are not limited to, chemotherapy (the administration of active agents, including, e.g. drugs; surgery; and radiation therapy. \n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, and for use in accordance with the present invention, may comprise, in addition to the active ingredient, i.e. a compound of formula I, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer, stabiliser or other materials well known to those skilled in the art. Such materials should be non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. The precise nature of the \n\n carrier or other material will depend on the route of administration, which may be oral, or by injection, e.g. cutaneous, subcutaneous, or intravenous. \n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be in tablet, capsule, powder or liquid form. A tablet may comprise a solid carrier or an adjuvant. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally comprise a liquid carrier such as water, petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or synthetic oil. Physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol may be included. A capsule may comprise a solid carrier such a gelatin. \n\n\nFor intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, or injection at the site of affliction, the active ingredient will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous solution which is pyrogen-free and has suitable pH, isotonicity and stability.

For example, a reference to carboxylic acid (-COOH) also includes the anionic (carboxylate) form (-COO\n\"\n), a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventional protected forms. Similarly, a reference to an amino group includes the protonated form (-N\n+\nHR\n1\nR\n2\n), a salt or solvate of the amino group, for example, a hydrochloride salt, as well as conventional protected forms of an amino group. Similarly, a reference to a hydroxyl group also includes the anionic form (-0\n\"\n), a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventional protected forms. \n\n\nSalts \n\n\n It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding salt of the active compound, for example, a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt. Examples of \n\n pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge, et ai, J. Pharm. Sci., 66, 1-19 (1977). \n\n\nFor example, if the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g. -COOH may be -COO\n\"\n), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na\n+\n and K\n+\n, alkaline earth cations such as Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2+\n, and other cations such as Α \n3\n. \n\n\nExamples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e. NH\n4\n \n+\n) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g. NH\n3\nR\n+\n, NH\n2\nR2\n+\n, NHR\n3\n \n+\n, NR\n4\n \n+\n). Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, \n\n\ndiethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, \n\n\nethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine. An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH\n3\n)\n4\n \n+\n. \n\n\nIf the compound is cationic, or has a functional group which may be cationic (e.g. -NH\n2\n may be -NH\n3\n \n+\n), then a salt may be formed with a suitable anion. Examples of suitable inorganic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following inorganic acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric, sulfurous, nitric, nitrous, phosphoric, and phosphorous. \n\n\nExamples of suitable organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following organic acids: 2-acetyoxybenzoic, acetic, ascorbic, aspartic, benzoic, \n\n\ncamphorsulfonic, cinnamic, citric, edetic, ethanedisulfonic, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, glucheptonic, gluconic, glutamic, glycolic, hydroxymaleic, hydroxynaphthalene carboxylic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, lauric, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, mucic, oleic, oxalic, palmitic, pamoic, pantothenic, phenylacetic, phenylsulfonic, propionic, pyruvic, salicylic, stearic, succinic, sulfanilic, tartaric, toluenesulfonic, and valeric.

The term \"solvate\" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute (e.g. active compound, salt of active compound) and solvent. If \n\n the solvent is water, the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate, for example, a mono-hydrate, a di-hydrate, a tri-hydrate, etc. \n\n\nCarbinolamines \n\n\nThe invention includes compounds where a solvent adds across the imine bond of the PBD moiety, which is illustrated below where the solvent is water or an alcohol (R\nA\nOH, where R\nA\n is C-i-4 alkyl): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n These forms can be called the carbinolamine and carbinolamine ether forms of the PBD. The balance of these equilibria depend on the conditions in which the compounds are found, as well as the nature of the moiety itself. \n\n\nThese particular compounds may be isolated in solid form, for example, by lyophilisation. Isomers \n\n\n Certain compounds may exist in one or more particular geometric, optical, enantiomeric, diasteriomeric, epimeric, atropic, stereoisomeric, tautomeric, conformational, or anomeric forms, including but not limited to, cis- and trans-forms; E- and Z-forms; c-, t-, and r- forms; endo- and exo-forms; R-, S-, and meso-forms; D- and L-forms; d- and l-forms; (+) and (-) forms; keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms; syn- and anti-forms; synclinal- and anticlinal-forms; a- and β-forms; axial and equatorial forms; boat-, chair-, twist-, envelope-, and halfchair- forms; and combinations thereof, hereinafter collectively referred to as \"isomers\" (or \"isomeric forms\"). Note that, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms, specifically excluded from the term \"isomers\", as used herein, are structural (or constitutional) isomers (i.e. isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space). For example, a reference to a methoxy group, -OCH\n3\n, is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, a hydroxymethyl group, -CH\n2\nOH . Similarly, a reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, meta- chlorophenyl. However, a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class (e.g. Ci\n-7\n alkyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl; butyl \n\n includes η-, iso-, sec-, and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-, meta-, and para- methoxyphenyl). \n\n\nThe above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, \n\n\nthioketone/enethiol, N-nitroso/hyroxyazo, and nitro/aci-nitro. \n\n\n\n\n\n keto enol enolate Note that specifically included in the term \"isomer\" are compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions. For example, H may be in any isotopic form, including \n1\nH, \n2\nH (D), and \n3\nH (T); C may be in any isotopic form, including \n12\nC, \n13\nC, and \n14\nC; O may be in any isotopic form, including \n16\n0 and \n18\n0; and the like. Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound includes all such isomeric forms, including (wholly or partially) racemic and other mixtures thereof. Methods for the preparation (e.g. asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g. fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods taught herein, or known methods, in a known manner. \n\n\nGeneral synthetic routes \n\n\n The synthesis of PBD compounds is extensively discussed in the following references, which discussions are incorporated herein by reference: \n\n\na) WO 00/12508 (pages 14 to 30); \n\n\nb) WO 2005/023814 (pages 3 to 10); \n\n\nc) WO 2004/043963 (pages 28 to 29); and \n\n\nd) WO 2005/085251 (pages 30 to 39). \n\n\nSynthesis route \n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention, where R\n10\n and R\n11\n form a nitrogen-carbon double bond between the nitrogen and carbon atoms to which they are bound, can be synthesised from a compound of Formula 2: \n\n Formula 2 \n\n\n\n\n\nwhere R\n2\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n9\n, R\n6'\n, R\n7'\n, R\n9'\n, R\n12\n, X, X' and R\" are as defined for compounds of formula I, Prot\nN\n is a nitrogen protecting group for synthesis and Prot° is a protected oxygen group for synthesis or an oxo group, by deprotecting the imine bond by standard methods. \n\n\nThe compound produced may be in its carbinolamine or carbinolamine ether form depending on the solvents used. For example if Prot\nN\n is Alloc and Prot° is an oxygen protecting group for synthesis, then the deprotection is carried using palladium to remove the N10 protecting group, followed by the elimination of the oxygen protecting group for synthesis. If Prot\nN\n is Troc and Prot° is an oxygen protecting group for synthesis, then the deprotection is carried out using a Cd/Pb couple to yield the compound of formula (I). If Prot\nN\n is SEM, or an analogous group, and Prot° is an an oxo group, then the oxo group can be removed by reduction, which leads to a protected carbinolamine intermediate, which can then be treated to remove the SEM protecting group, followed by the elimination of water. The reduction of the compound of Formula 2 can be accomplished by, for example, lithium tetraborohydride, whilst a suitable means for removing the SEM protecting group is treatment with silica gel. \n\n\nCompounds of formula 2 can be synthesised from a compound of formula 3a: \n\n\nFormula 3a \n\n\n\n\n\nwhere R\n2\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n9\n, R\n6'\n, R\n7'\n, R\n9'\n, X, X' and R\" are as defined for compounds of formula 2, by coupling an organometallic derivative comprising R\n12\n, such as an organoboron derivative. The organoboron derivative may be a boronate or boronic acid. \n\n\nCompounds of formula 2 can be synthesised from a compound of formula 3b: \n\n Formula 3b \n\n\n\n\n\nwhere R\n12\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n9\n, R\n6'\n, R\n7'\n, R\n9'\n, X, X' and R\" are as defined for compounds of formula 2, by coupling an organometallic derivative comprising R\n2\n, such as an organoboron derivative. The organoboron derivative may be a boronate or boronic acid. \n\n\nCompounds of formulae 3a and 3b can be synthesised from a compound of formula 4: \n\n\nFormula 4 \n\n\n\n\n\nwhere R\n2\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n9\n, R\n6'\n, R\n7'\n, R\n9'\n, X, X' and R\" are as defined for compounds of formula 2, by coupling about a single equivalent (e.g. 0.9 or 1 to 1.1 or 1.2) of an organometallic derivative, such as an organoboron derivative, comprising R\n2\n or R\n12\n. \n\n\nThe couplings described above are usually carried out in the presence of a palladium catalyst, for example Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n4\n, Pd(OCOCH\n3\n)\n2\n, PdCI\n2\n, Pd\n2\n(dba)\n3\n. The coupling may be carried out under standard conditions, or may also be carried out under microwave conditions. \n\n\nThe two coupling steps are usually carried out sequentially. They may be carried out with or without purification between the two steps. If no purification is carried out, then the two steps may be carried out in the same reaction vessel. Purification is usually required after the second coupling step. Purification of the compound from the undesired by-products may be carried out by column chromatography or ion-exchange separation. \n\n\nThe synthesis of compounds of formula 4 where Prot° is an oxo group and Prot\nN\n is SEM are described in detail in WO 00/12508, which is incorporated herein by reference. In particular, reference is made to scheme 7 on page 24, where the above compound is designated as intermediate P. This method of synthesis is also described in WO \n\n\n 2004/043963. \n\n The synthesis of compounds of formula 4 where Prot is a protected oxygen group for synthesis are described in WO 2005/085251 , which synthesis is herein incorporated by reference. \n\n\nCompounds of formula I where R\n10\n and R\n10\n are H and R\n11\n and R\n11\n are SO\nz\nM, can be synthesised from compounds of formula I where R\n10\n and R\n11\n form a nitrogen-carbon double bond between the nitrogen and carbon atoms to which they are bound, by the addition of the appropriate bisulphite salt or sulphinate salt, followed by an appropriate purification step. Further methods are described in GB 2 053 894, which is herein incorporated by reference. \n\n\nNitrogen protecting groups for synthesis \n\n\n Nitrogen protecting groups for synthesis are well known in the art. In the present invention, the protecting groups of particular interest are carbamate nitrogen protecting groups and hemi-aminal nitrogen protecting groups. \n\n\nCarbamate nitrogen protecting groups ing structure: \n\n\n\n\n\n * \n\n\nwherein R'\n10\n is R as defined above.

Other linkers can be prepared according to the references cited herein or as known to the skilled artisan. \n\n\nLinker-Drug compounds can be prepared according to methods known in the art. Linkage of amine-based X substituents (of the PDB dimer Drug unit) to active groups of the Linker units can be performed according to methods generally described in U.S. Patent Nos.\n\n\n6,214,345 and 7,498,298; and WO 2009-01 17531 , or as otherwise known to the skilled artisan. \n\n Antibodies can be conjugated to Linker-Drug compounds as described in Doronina et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2003, 21 , 778-784). Briefly, antibodies (4-5 mg/mL) in PBS containing 50 mM sodium borate at pH 7.4 are reduced with tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) at 37 °C. The progress of the reaction, which reduces interchain disulfides, is monitored by reaction with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and allowed to proceed until the desired level of thiols/mAb is achieved. The reduced antibody is then cooled to 0°C and alkylated with 1 .5 equivalents of maleimide drug-linker per antibody thiol. After 1 hour, the reaction is quenched by the addition of 5 equivalents of N-acetyl cysteine. Quenched drug-linker is removed by gel filtration over a PD-10 column. The ADC is then sterile-filtered through a 0.22 μιη syringe filter. Protein concentration can be determined by spectral analysis at 280 nm and 329 nm, respectively, with correction for the contribution of drug absorbance at 280 nm. Size exclusion chromatography can be used to determine the extent of antibody aggregation, and RP-HPLC can be used to determine the levels of remaining NAC-quenched drug-linker. \n\n\nFurther Preferences \n\n\n The following preferences may apply to all aspects of the invention as described above, or may relate to a single aspect.

The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 16 hours at room temperature and the solvent was removed by evaporation in vacuo. The resulting residue was re- dissolved in dry THF (20 mL) and the acid chloride solution was added dropwise to a stirred mixture of (2S,4R)-methyl-4-hydroxypyrrolidine-2-carboxylate hydrochloride (859 mg, 4.73 mmol) and TEA (6.6 mL, 4.79 g, 47.3 mmol) in THF (10 mL) at -30°C (dry ice/ethylene glycol) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for a further 3 hours after which time TLC (95:5 v/v CHCIs/MeOH) and LC/MS (2.45 min (ES+) m/z (relative intensity) 721 {[M + H]\n+\n , 20)) revealed formation of product. Excess THF was removed by rotary evaporation and the resulting residue was dissolved in DCM (50 mL). The organic layer was washed with 1 N \n\n HCI (2 x 15 mL), saturated NaHC0\n3\n (2 x 15 mL), H\n2\n0 (20 mL), brine (30 mL) and dried (MgS0\n4\n). Filtration and evaporation of the solvent gave the crude product as a dark coloured oil. Purification by flash chromatography (gradient elution: 100% CHCI\n3\n to 96:4 v/v CHCI\n3\n/MeOH) isolated the pure amide 2a as an orange coloured glass (840 mg, 54%). \n\n\nMethod B: Oxalyl chloride (9.75 mL, 14.2 g, 1 1 1 mmol) was added to a stirred suspension of the nitro-acid 1 a (17.3 g, 37.1 mmol) and DMF (2 mL) in anhydrous DCM (200 mL). Following initial effervescence the reaction suspension became a solution and the mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 16 hours. Conversion to the acid chloride was confirmed by treating a sample of the reaction mixture with MeOH and the resulting bis- methyl ester was observed by LC/MS. The majority of solvent was removed by \n\n\nevaporation in vacuo, the resulting concentrated solution was re-dissolved in a minimum amount of dry DCM and triturated with diethyl ether. The resulting yellow precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with cold diethyl ether and dried for 1 hour in a vacuum oven at 40°C. The solid acid chloride was added portionwise over a period of 25 minutes to a stirred suspension of (2S,4R)-methyl-4-hydroxypyrrolidine-2-carboxylate hydrochloride (15.2 g, 84.0 mmol) and TEA (25.7 mL, 18.7 g, 185 mmol) in DCM (150 mL) at -40°C (dry ice/CH\n3\nCN). Immediately, the reaction was complete as judged by LC/MS (2.47 min (ES+) m/z (relative intensity) 721 {[M + H]\n+\n , 100)), the mixture was diluted with DCM (150 mL) and washed with 1 N HCI (300 mL), saturated NaHC0\n3\n (300 mL), brine (300 mL), filtered (through a phase separator) and the solvent evaporated in vacuo to give the pure product 2a as an orange solid (21 .8 g, 82%). \n\n\nAnalytical Data: [a]\n22\n \nD\n = -46.1 ° (c = 0.47, CHCI\n3\n); \n1\n H NMR (400 MHz, CDCI\n3\n) (rotamers) δ 7.63 (s, 2H), 6.82 (s, 2H), 4.79-4.72 (m, 2H), 4.49-4.28 (m, 6H), 3.96 (s, 6H), 3.79 (s, 6H), 3.46-3.38 (m, 2H), 3.02 (d, 2H , J = 1 1 .1 Hz), 2.48-2.30 (m, 4H), 2.29-2.04 (m, 4H); \n13\nC NMR (100 MHz, CDCI\n3\n) (rotamers) δ 172.4, 166.7, 154.6, 148.4, 137.2, 127.0, 109.7, 108.2, 69.7, 65.1 , 57.4, 57.0, 56.7, 52.4, 37.8, 29.0; IR (ATR, CHCI\n3\n) 3410 (br), 3010, 2953, 1741 , 1622, 1577, 1519, 1455, 1429, 1334, 1274, 121 1 , 1 177, 1072, 1050, 1008, 871 cm\n\"1\n ; MS (ES\n+\n) m/z (relative intensity) 721 ([M + Hf, 47), 388 (80); HRMS [M + H]\n+\n theoretical C\n3\ni H\n36\nN\n4\n0i\n6\n m/z 721 .2199, found (ES\n+\n) m/z 721 .2227. \n\n\n(a) 1, 1 '-[[(Pentane-1 ,5-diyl)dioxy]bis[(5-methoxy-2-nitro-1 ,4- phenylene)carbonyl]]bis[(2S,4R)-methyl-4-hydroxypyrrolidine-2-carboxylate] (2b) \n\n Preparation from 1 b according to Method B gave the pure product as an orange foam (75.5 g, 82%). \n\n\nAnalytical Data: (ES\n+\n) m/z (relative intensity) 749 ([M + H]\n+\n , 100). \n\n\n(b) 1, 1 '-[[(Propane-1,3-diyl)dioxy]bis(11aS,2R)-2-(hydroxy)-7-methoxy-1,2,3, 10, 11, 11a- hexahydro-5H-pyrrolo[2, 1 -c][1 ,4]-benzodiazepin-5, 11 -dione] (3a) \n\n\nMethod A: A suspension of 10% Pd/C (7.5 g, 10% w/w) in DMF (40 mL) was added to a solution of the nitro-ester 2a (75 g, 104 mmol) in DMF (360 mL).

Solid Pd/C was removed by filtration and the filtrate was concentrated by rotary evaporation under vacuum (below 10 mbar) at 40°C to afford a dark oil containing traces of DMF and residual charcoal. The residue was digested in EtOH (500 mL) at 40°C on a water bath (rotary evaporator bath) and the resulting suspension was filtered through celite and washed with ethanol (500 mL) to give a clear filtrate. Hydrazine hydrate (10 mL, 321 mmol) was added to the solution and the reaction mixture was heated at reflux. After 20 minutes the formation of a white precipitate was observed and reflux was allowed to continue for a further 30 minutes. The mixture was allowed to cool down to room temperature and the precipitate was retrieved by filtration, washed with diethyl ether (2\n*\n1 volume of precipitate) and dried in a vacuum desiccator to provide 3a (50 g, 81 %). \n\n\nMethod B: A solution of the nitro-ester 2a (6.80 g, 9.44 mmol) in MeOH (300 mL) was added to Raney™ nickel (4 large spatula ends of a ~ 50% slurry in H\n2\n0) and anti-bumping granules in a 3-neck round bottomed flask. The mixture was heated at reflux and then treated dropwise with a solution of hydrazine hydrate (5.88 mL, 6.05 g, 188 mmol) in MeOH (50 mL) at which point vigorous effervescence was observed. When the addition was complete (~ 30 minutes) additional Raney™ nickel was added carefully until effervescence had ceased and the initial yellow colour of the reaction mixture was discharged. The mixture was heated at reflux for a further 30 minutes at which point the reaction was deemed complete by TLC (90:10 v/v CHCI\n3\n/MeOH) and LC/MS (2.12 min (ES+) m/z (relative intensity) 597 ([M + H]\n+\n , 100)). The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to around 40°C and then excess nickel removed by filtration through a sinter funnel without vacuum suction. The filtrate was reduced in volume by evaporation in vacuo at \n\n which point a colourless precipitate formed which was collected by filtration and dried in a vacuum desiccator to provide 3a (5.40 g, 96%). \n\n\nAnalytical Data: [a]\n27\n \nD\n = +404° (c = 0.10, DMF); \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d\n6\n) δ 10.2 (s, 2H, NH), 7.26 (s, 2H), 6.73 (s, 2H), 5.1 1 (d, 2H, J = 3.98 Hz, OH), 4.32-4.27 (m, 2H), 4.19- 4.07 (m, 6H), 3.78 (s, 6H), 3.62 (dd, 2H, J = 12.1 , 3.60 Hz), 3.43 (dd, 2H, J = 12.0, 4.72 Hz), 2.67-2.57 (m, 2H), 2.26 (p, 2H, J = 5.90 Hz), 1 .99-1.89 (m, 2H); \n13\nC NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d\n6\n) 8 169.1 , 164.0, 149.9, 144.5, 129.8, 1 17.1 , 1 1 1 .3, 104.5, 54.8, 54.4, 53.1 , 33.5, 27.5; IR (ATR, neat) 3438, 1680, 1654, 1610, 1605, 1516, 1490, 1434, 1379, 1263, 1234, 1216, 1 177, 1 156, 1 1 15, 1089, 1038, 1018, 952, 870 cm\n\"1\n; MS (ES\n+\n) m/z (relative intensity) 619 {[M + Na]\n+\n , 10), 597 {[M + H]\n+\n , 52), 445 (12), 326 (1 1 ); HRMS [M + H]\n+\n theoretical C2\n9\nH\n3\n2N4O1\n0\n m/z 597.2191 , found (ES\n+\n) m/z 597.2205. \n\n\n(b) 1, 1 '-[[(Pentane-1,5-diyl)dioxy]bis(11aS,2R)-2-(hydroxy)-7-methoxy-1,2,3, 10, 11, 11a- hexahydro-5H-pyrrolo[2, 1-c][1 ,4]-benzodiazepin-5, 11-dione] (3b) \n\n\n Preparation from 2b according to Method A gave the product as a white solid (22.1 g, 86%). \n\n\nAnalytical Data: MS (ES\n\"\n) m/z (relative intensity) 623.3 ([M - H]\n\"\n , 100); \n\n\n(c) 1, 1 '-[[(Propane-1,3-diyl)dioxy]bis(11aS, 2R)-2-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)- 7-methoxy- 1,2,3, 10, 11, 11 a-hexahydro-5H-pyrrolo[2, 1-c][1,4]-benzodiazepin-5, 11-dione] (4a) \n\n\nTBSCI (317 mg, 2.1 mmol) and imidazole (342 mg, 5.03 mmol) were added to a cloudy solution of the tetralactam 3a (250 mg, 0.42 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (6 mL).

Serial dilutions of the test article (50 μΙ_) were added, and incubation was carried out for 92 hours at 37°C. After addition of test compound, cultures were incubated to 96 hours at 37°C. Resazurin (0.25 mM, 50 μΙ_, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in medium was added and incubation was continued for 4 h. The plates were read on a Fusion HT microplate reader (Packard, Meriden, CT) using an excitation wavelength of 525 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Data from all assays were reduced using GraphPad Prism Version 4 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The IC\n50\n concentrations compared to untreated control cells were determined using a 4 parameter curve fits. The IC\n50\n (nM) values for compound 15 are: \n\n\n\n\n\nThe same method was also used to determine the activity of compounds 1 1 and 18: \n\n IC50 (nM) Caki-1 786-0 TF1a MCF-7 \n\n\n 1 1 0.06 0.1 0.07 0.2 \n\n\n 18 0.6 1 0.7 2 \n\n\nAlternative cell assay \n\n\n Cells were plated in 150 μΙ_ growth media per well into black-sided clear-bottom 96-well plates (Costar, Corning) and allowed to settle for 1 hour in the biological cabinet before placing in the incubator at 37°C, 5% C0\n2\n. The following day, 4X concentration of drug stocks were prepared, and then titrated as 10-fold serial dilutions producing 8-point dose curves and added at 50μΙ per well in duplicate. Cells were then incubated for 48 hours at 37°C, 5% C0\n2.\n Cytotoxicity was measure by incubating with 100μΙ_ Cell Titer Glo \n\n\n(Promega) solution for 1 hour, and then luminescence was measured on a Fusion HT plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Data was processed with Excel (Microsoft) and GraphPad (Prism) to produce dose response curves and IC50 values were generated and data collected. \n\n\n Example 9: Preparation of PDB Dimer Conjugates \n\n\n Antibody-drug conjugates were prepared as previously described (see Doronina et al., Nature Biotechnology, 21 , 778-784 (2003)) or as described below. \n\n\nEngineered hlgG1 antibodies with introduced cysteines: CD70 antibodies containing a cysteine residue at position 239 of the heavy chain (hi F6d) were fully reduced by adding 10 equivalents of TCEP and 1 mM EDTA and adjusting the pH to 7.4 with 1 M Tris buffer (pH 9.0). Following a 1 hour incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was cooled to 22 °C and 30 equivalents of dehydroascorbic acid were added to selectively reoxidize the native disulfides, while leaving cysteine 239 in the reduced state. The pH was adjusted to 6.5 with 1 M Tris buffer (pH 3.7) and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 hour at 22 °C.\n\n\nThe pH of the solution was then raised again to 7.4 by addition of 1 M Tris buffer (pH 9.0). 3.5 equivalents of the PBD drug linker in DMSO were placed in a suitable container for dilution with propylene glycol prior to addition to the reaction. To maintain solubility of the PBD drug linker, the antibody itself was first diluted with propylene glycol to a final concentration of 33% (e.g., if the antibody solution was in a 60 mL reaction volume, 30 mL \n\n of propylene glycol was added). This same volume of propylene glycol (30 mL in this example) was then added to the PBD drug linker as a diluent. After mixing, the solution of PBD drug linker in propylene glycol was added to the antibody solution to effect the conjugation; the final concentration of propylene glycol is 50%. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes and then quenched by addition of 5 equivalents of N-acetyl cysteine. The ADC was then purified by ultrafiltration through a 30 kD membrane. (Note that the concentration of propylene glycol used in the reaction can be reduced for any particular PBD, as its sole purpose is to maintain solubility of the drug linker in the aqueous media.) \n\n\nExample 10: Determination of Conjugate In Vitro Cytotoxicity \n\n\n Cells as detailed below were collected and plated in 96 well black-sided plates at a density of 10,000 cells/well in 150 μΙ_ of medium. Serial dilutions of the test article (50 μΙ_) were added, and incubation was carried out for 92 hours at 37°C. After addition of test compound, cultures were incubated to 96 hours at 37°C. Resazurin (0.25 mM, 50 μΙ_,\n\n\nSigma, St. Louis, MO) in medium was added and incubation was continued for 4 h. The plates were read on a Fusion HT microplate reader (Packard, Meriden, CT) using an excitation wavelength of 525 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Data from all assays were reduced using GraphPad Prism Version 4 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The IC\n50\n concentrations compared to untreated control cells were determined using a 4 parameter curve fits. The antibody used was a CD70 antibody (humanized 1 F6; see Published U.S. Application No. 2009-148942) having introduced cysteine residues at amino acid heavy chain position 239 (according to the EU numbering system) (indicated as h1 F6d). \n\n\nThe IC\n50\n (nM) values for ADCs of compound 31 are: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Maximum inhibition (Max Inhb) = % inhibition at top concentration out of 100% untreated. \n\n Example 11 : Determination of In Vivo Cytotoxicity of Selected Conjugates \n\n\n The following study was conducted in concordance with the Animal Care and Use \n\n\nCommittee in a facility fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. The antibodies used were an antibody having introduced cysteine residues at position 239 (S239C) in the heavy chains and conjugated to compound 31 , and a nonbinding control conjugated to the same compound 31. \n\n\nTreatment studies were conducted in an antigen+ xenograft model. Tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously into scid mice. Mice were randomized to study groups (n=6). The ADC-compound 31 or control ADCs were dosed ip according to a q4dx4 schedule (as shown by the triangles on the x axis). Tumor volume as a function of time was determined using the formula (L x W2)/2. Animals were euthanized when tumor volumes reached 1000 mm\n3\n. \n\n\nReferring to Figure 1 , the ADC of compound 31 was dosed at 0.1 (□), 0.3 (ss) and 1 (■) mg/kg. A nonbinding control, conjugated to compound 31 , was administered at the same doses (0.1 (Δ), 0.3 (A) and 1 (A) mg/kg). All three doses of the Ab-compound 31 \n\n\nconjugate had better activity than the nonbinding control conjugate. Untreated tumours are shown by \n*\n."
