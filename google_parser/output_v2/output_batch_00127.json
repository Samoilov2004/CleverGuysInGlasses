Description\n\n\n\n\n Chemical Compounds \n\n\nThe present invention relates to nucleotide derivatives and their use in the treatment of cancer. \n\n\nThe nucleoside analogue gemcitabine is well established as an anticancer agent. It functions as an inhibitor of DNA synthesis after activation to its 5 '-phosphate form. \n\n\nInternational patent application no. PCT/GB2004/003148 (publication no. WO 2005/012327 A) discloses the use of phosphoramidate drivatives of gemcitabine to treat cancer. The derivatives all have both an aromatic group linked through O to P and a single amidate group linking through N to P. Compared to gemcitabine, the derivatives may display an enhanced potency with respect to cancer and/or a reduced toxicity. D M Vail et al, 2007 AACR Annual Meeting, Los Angeles, CA presented an efficacy and safety profile of a prodrug of the anti-proliferative nucleotide analog 9-(2- phosphonylmethoxyethyl) guanine used for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. Guanine is derived from purine. The compound tested comprised a nucleoside phosphonate, i.e. a compound with a P-C link to the nucleoside base. \n\n\nC R Wagner et al Med. Res. Rev. 2000, 20 417-451 discloses phosphoramidate diesters of FUdR and their use as anti -cancer agents. \n\n\nEach of D Cahard et al, Mini-Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry, 2004, 4, 371-382 and B C Jones et al, Antiviral Chemistry & Chemotherapy (1991) 2(1), 35-39 discloses phosphorodiamidates of AZT and their use as anti-viral agents. \n\n\nThere is a need to provide compounds in the treatment of cancer that show improved properties, particularly having regard to enhanced potency and/or reduced cytotoxicity. \n\n\nIt is an object of the present invention to provide such compounds. \n\n It is a further object of the present invention to provide such compounds for use in the treatment of cancer. \n\n\nAccording to the present invention there is provided a chemical compound according to formula (I): \n\n\n \n\n wherein: \n\n\nR\n2\n is selected from the group comprising CR\n5 6\nC0\n2\nR7 and CpCealkyl and Ri is selected from the group comprising H and Ci-Cealkyl, \n\n\nor Ri and R\n2\n together with the N atom to which they are attached form a ring moiety comprising 5 to 8 ring atoms; R\n4\n is selected from the group comprising CR\n5\nR\n6\nCO2R\n7\n and d-Cealk l and R3 is selected from the group comprising H and Ci-Cgalkyl, \n\n\nor R\n3\n and R4 together with the N atom to which they are attached form a ring moiety comprising 5 to 8 ring atoms; where, independently for each of R\n2\n and R4: \n\n\n R\n5\n and Rg are selected, independently, from the group comprising the side chains of naturally occurring alpha amino acids; and \n\n\n R\n7\n is selected from the group comprising d-C^alky!; Y is selected from the group comprising H and C(0)R, where R is Ci-Qsalkyl; \n\n Z is selected from the group comprising H and C(0)R, where R is C\nr\nCi\n8\nalkyl, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof. \n\n\nSurprisingly, it has been found that phosphorodiamidate derivatives according to formula I are effective as potential chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer. Notably, compounds of formula (I) show enhanced anti-cancer potency and/or reduced cytotoxicity, compared to gemcitabine. The present invention thus provides the use of the compounds of the present invention in the treatment of cancer in homo sapiens and other mammals. In particular, compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of solid rumours, for example, in the treatment of colon cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer and prostate cancer. Although we do not wish to be bound by any theory, it is believed that in compounds of formula (I) it is the presence of the two amidate groups on the P atom, together with the identity of the groups Ri, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R4, R5, R6 and R\n7\n, which contribute to the enhanced anticancer potency and/or the reduced cytotoxicity, compared to their nucleoside counterpart. Where R\n2\n and/or R4 is the ester -CR\n5\nR\n6\nC0\n2\nR\n7\n, the anti-cancer potency exhibited varies with the choice of R\n5\n, R\n$\n and, especially, R\n7\n. Where R\n2\n and R4 are each esters, the choice of each of R\n\\\n and R\n3\n, and where R\n2\n and/or R4 is not an ester, the choice of the remaining Ri, R\n2\n, R3 and R4 groups on the respective amino N atoms also contribute to the anticancer potency. In one embodiment, each of R\n2\n and R4 is -CR5R6CO\n2\nR7 and each of Ri and R\n3\n is H, especially in such an embodiment where each of R\n2\n and R4 is -CH\n5\nReC0\n2\nR\n7\n and each of Ri and R3 is H, R\n2\n and R4 are the same. \n\n\nIt will be appreciated that when R\n2\n and/or R4 is the ester group -CR\n5\nR\n6\nC0\n2\nR\n7\n, the respective moieties\n\n\n and -NR\n3\n-CR\n5\nR\n6\nC0\n2\n- of the phosphorodiamidate compounds of formula (I) correspond to the structure of that of alpha amino acids. \n\n\nR\n5\n and R<5 are selected, independently, from the group comprising the side chains of naturally occurring alpha amino acids. By \"naturally occurring alpha amino acids\" is meant Alanine, Arginine, Asparagine, Aspartic Acid, Cysteine, Cystine, Glycine, Glutamic \n\n Acid, Glutamine, Histidine, Hydroxylysine, Hydroxyproline, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Proline, Serine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Tyrosine and Valine. The group comprising the side chains of these naturally occurring alpha amino acids, from which group R5 and ¾ are independently selected, thus comprises the following moieties: \n\n\nCH\n3\n- as present in Alanine \n\n\n H\n2\nNC(=NH)NH[CH\n2\n]\n3\n- as present in Argenine \n\n\nNH\n2\nC(0)CH\n2\n- as present in Aspargine \n\n\nH0\n2\nCH\n2\n- as present in Asparctic Acid \n\n\nHSCH\n2\n- as present in Cysteine \n\n\n H0\n2\nCH(NH\n2\n)CH\n2\nSSCH\n2\n- as present in Cystine \n\n\nH- as present in Glycine \n\n\n H0\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n- as present in Glutamic Acid \n\n\n H\n2\nN(0)CCH\n2\nCH\n2\n- as present in Glutamine \n\n\nC\n3\nN\n2\nHCH\n2\n- as present in Histidine \n\n\n H\n2\nNCH\n2\nCH(OH)CH\n2\nCH\n2\n- as present in Hydroxylysine \n\n\n -CH\n2\nCH(OH)C¾- as present in Hydroxyproline \n\n\n CH\n3\nCH\n2\nCH(CH\n3\n)- as present in Isoleucine \n\n\n (CH\n3\n)\n2\nCHCH\n2\n- as present in Leucine \n\n\nH\n2\nNCH\n2\n(CH\n2\n)\n3\n- as present in Lysine \n\n\n CH\n3\nSCH\n2\nCH\n2\n- as present in Methionine \n\n\n PhCH\n2\n- as present in Phenylalanine \n\n\n -CH\n2\nC¾CH\n2\n- as present in Proline \n\n\n OHCH\n2\n- as present in Serine \n\n\nCH\n3\nCH(OH)- as present in Threonine \n\n\n CsNHiCHi- as present in Tryptophan \n\n\n HOC6H\n4\nCH\n2\n- as present in Tyrosine \n\n\n (CH\n3\n)\n2\nCH- as present in Valine. The term \"a side chain of a naturally occurring alpha amino acid\" thus includes H and moieties comprising only one C atom, as well as saturated, unbranched C3 moieties attached additionally at their terminal C atom to their respective amino N atom, in which instance, for R\n2\n, R\n\\\n is absent and for R4, R3 is absent. \n\n By \"a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative\" is meant any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, salt of such ester, hydrate, solvate, or crystalline form or metabolite or any other compound which upon administration to a recipient is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of formula (I). \n\n\nIn one embodiment, R\n2\n and R4 are the same. \n\n\nIn one embodiment, R\n2\n and R4 are each -CR5R6CO2R7. \n\n\nSuitably, R\n7\n is selected from the group comprising branched and unbranched Q-C^ acyclic alkyl and C3-C8 cyclic alkyl, any of which acyclic and cyclic alkyl moieties may be substituted, with generally one, two or three substituents as set out below, and/or unsaturated.

Where R\n2\n and R\n4\n are both esters, suitably R\n5\n, R\n$\n and R\n7\n are the same in each of R3 and R4 and each of Ri and R\n3\n is H. \n\n Where R\n2\n and/or R4 is the ester and R5 differs from R\n$\n, the stereochemistry of the amino acid may be D or L. In one embodiment the amino acid has natural L stereochemistry at *CR\n5\nR6. In another embodiment the amino acid has D stereochemistry at *CR\n5\nR6.

Cytoxicity assay was based on MTT assay as we previously \n\n\nreported. The method is based on the ability of viable mitochondria to convert MTT, a \n\n soluble tetrazolium \n\n\nsalt (3-[4,5-dirnemylthiazd-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) into an insoluble formazan precipitate that is dissolved and quantified by spectrophotometry. A 96-well culture cell culture plate was \n\n\nused. Cells were counted with a haemocytomete counting \n\n\nchamber and a specific number (4000 per well) of cells \n\n\nwere seeded to each well with culture medium (DMEM). \n\n\n Compounds, dissolved in DMSO, were series diluted (1:5) in culture medium, to cover a final concentration range between 0.128 and 2000 nM. The culture plate was incubated for 72 h at 37 _C. The cells were washed twice with BSS. A solution of MTT in 0.5 mg mL in culture medium was added into each well. The culture plate was then incubated at 37 _C for 4 h. MTT was then removed by aspiration. The crystals produced by MTT reagent within the cells were then extracted by the addition of 100 1L of Triton XI 00 (10% in water). The cells were incubated at 4 _C for 24 h. The absorbance of the colorimetric products was then measured at a wavelength of 540 nm using a spectrophotometer (Titertecek). \n\n\nData: \n\n\nCpd L-Ala Gemcitabine diamidate EC50 (nM) Colorectal cell HRT18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CPF457 \n\n\n 14 \n\n\n Bn \n\n\n CPF458 \n\n\n 31 \n\n\n cycHex \n\n\n CPF459 \n\n\n 42 \n\n\n Et \n\n\n CPF460 \n\n\n 1.6 \n\n\n CH2tBu \n\n\n CPF461 \n\n\n 3.2 \n\n\n iPr \n\n\nGemcitabine 64 \n\n It can be observed that all of the diamidates are more potent than gemcitabine parent in this assay; some are up to 20 times more potent.
