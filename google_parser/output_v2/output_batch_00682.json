Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of the invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention refers to the use of 5-HT\n7\n receptor agonists for the treatment of pain and the symptoms of pain, especially certain subtypes of pain like neuropathic pain such as allodynia, the prevention or the prophylaxis of pain and the symptoms of pain, especially certain subtypes of pain like neuropathic pain such as allodynia.\n\n\n \n\n\nBackground of the invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe treatment of pain conditions is of great importance in medicine. There is currently a worldwide need for additional pain therapy. The pressing requirement for a specific treatment of pain conditions or as well a treatment of specific pain conditions which is right for the patient, which is to be understood as the successful and satisfactory treatment of pain for the patients, is documented in the large number of scientific works which have recently and over the years appeared in the field of applied analgesics or on basic research on nociception.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPAIN is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage (\nIASP, Classification of chronic pain, 2nd Edition, IASP Press (2002), 210\n). Even though pain is always subjective its causes or syndromes can be classified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEspecially neuropathic pain which in the past years has developed into a major health problem in broad areas of the population needs a very specific treatment, especially considering that any treatment of neuropathic pain is extremely sensitive to the causes behind the pain, be it the disease ultimately causing it or the mechanistic pathway over which it develops.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHyperalgesia and allodynia account for clinically relevant states such as inflammation and neuropathic pain. These conditions are characterized by alterations of pain perception that include enhanced sensitivity to noxious stimuli (hyperalgesia) and abnormal pain sensitivity to previously non-painful stimuli (allodynia). From the mechanistic point of view, the relationship between central sensitization and these pain associated behaviors, hyperalgesia and allodynia, has been recognized. Central sensitization is a term coined to describe the increased excitability of CNS nociceptive neurons triggered by persistent input or peripheral injury (Woolf, 1983). In fact, many popular models of post-injury hypersensitivity revolve around the notion of central sensitization whereby injury-evoked afferent discharges cause spinal cord neurons to reduce their stimulation threshold, to expand their receptive fields and to increase their responsiveness to different peripheral drives (Woolf, 1983; Hylden et al., 1989; Woolf and Thompson 1991; Coderre and Katz, 1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany different neurotransmitter systems, ion channels and enzymes have been implicated in pain transmission, processing and controlling. Among them, serotonin (5-hydroxtryptamine [5-HT]), produced by central and peripheral serotonergic neurons but also by platelets and mast cells after tissue injury, has been described to exert algesic or analgesic effects depending on the site of action and the receptor subtype it acts on (Eide and Hole, 1993; Millan, 2002). At the peripheral level, after nerve injury, 5-HT is released in Increased amounts and interacts with different 5-HT receptors present on C-fibers (Sommer, 2004). Acting in combination with other inflammatory mediators, 5-HT may ectopically excite and sensitize afferent nerve fibers, thus contributing to peripheral sensitization and hyperalgesia following inflammation and nerve injury (Beck and Handwerker, 1974; Obata et al., 2000). The central serotonin system has also been the subject of considerable research over the last twenty years. Both 5-HT and noradrenaline (NE)-mediated pathways of descending inhibition have been described extensively. These monoaminergic tracts arise from the midbrain and brainstem and terminate on the spinal cord to suppress sensory transmission and consequently produce analgesia. However, descending pathways projecting to the dorsal horn not only suppress (descending inhibition) but they may also potentiate (descending facilitation) nociceptive messages. In the case of the descending 5-HT system, both inhibition and facilitation have been described depending on the 5-HT receptor involved and on their divergent neuronal localization (Millan, 2002; Suzuki et al., 2004; Oyama et al., 1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferent drugs acting on the central 5-HT system have been investigated and/or used as analgesics. Among them, antidepressants are frequently used as adjuvants for analgesic treatment of pain. A significant amount of evidence supports the use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and other 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in the management of chronic pain, but because of their effects on multiple systems, they are associated with numerous undesirable side effects (Carter and Sullivan, 2002; Mattia et al., 2002; Parkin and Barkin, 2005). The newer selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), having only 5-HT-receptor-mediated side effects, have not been thoroughly studied but they seem to be less efficacious than TCAs and SNRIs in treating chronic pain (Barkin and Fawcett, 2000; Bomholt et al., 2005; Briley, 2004; Maizels and McCarberg, 2005; Sindrup et al., 2005; Stahl et al., 2005). In addition, available data suggest that increased 5-HT levels do not invariably inhibit nociceptive processing. Rather, it elicits a spectrum of pro- and antinociceptive actions that are receptor-dependent and a function of stimulus quality and modality (Millan, 2002; Suzuki et al., 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs reviewed by Millan (2002), different 5-HT receptors have been implicated in analgesia. Among them, 5-HT\n1A\n, 5-HT\n1B/1D\n, 5-HT\n2A\n, 5-HT\n2C\n and 5-HT\n3\n have received most attention (Eide and Hole, 1993; Oyama et al., 1996; Obata et al., 2000; Kayser et al., 2002; Colpaert, 2006).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA recent Immunocytochemical study investigating 5-HT\n7\n receptor distribution at the lumbar level revealed that 5-HT\n7\n immunolabelling is localized mainly in the two superficial laminae of the dorsal horn and in small and medium-sized dorsal root ganglion cells, which is consistent with a predominant role in nociception (Doly et al., 2005). In rat and human dorsal root ganglia, the presence of 5-HT\n7\n receptor messenger RNA has also been detected (Pierce et al., 1996, 1997). Electron microscopic examination of the dorsal horn revealed three main localizations: 1) a postsynaptic localization on peptidergic cell bodies in laminae I-III and in numerous dendrites; 2) a presynaptic localization on unmyelinated (presumably of primary afferent origin) and thin myelinated peptidergic fibers (from intrinsic cells); and 3) a localization on astrocytes in lamina I and II (Doly et al., 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegarding its function, a possible pronociceptive role of peripheral and spinal 5-HT\n7\n receptors has been described In the formalin test based on local paw and intrathecal administration of 5-HT or the non-selective 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) serotonergic agonist and reversion of their effects by the 5-HT\n7\n receptor antagonist SB-269970 (Rocha-González, 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs especially neuropathic pain has developed into a major health problem in broad areas of the population and needs a very specific treatment, it was the underlying problem solved by this invention to find new ways of treating pain, especially neuropathic pain, such as allodynia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSo, the main object of this invention is the use of a compound binding to the 5-HT\n7\n receptor and acting as a full or partial agonist in the production of a medicament for the treatment of allodynia, characterized in that the compound binding to the 5-HT\n7\n receptor is binding with a higher affinity by a factor of at least 10 - expressed as a K\ni\n - value - to the 5-HT\n7\n receptor than to the 5-HT\n1A\n receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis/these compound/s may be in neutral form, the form of a base or acid, in the form of a salt, preferably a physiologically acceptable salt, in the form of a solvate or of a polymorph and/or in the form of in the form of its racemate, pure stereoisomers, especially enantiomers or diastereomers or in the form of mixtures of stereoisomers, especially enantiomers or diastereomers, in any suitable ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile working on compounds binding to the 5-HT\n7\n receptor and which act there as agonists it was surprisingly found out that these compounds could act on the treatment of pain, especially neuropathic pain, such as allodynia, with a high potency. This was all the more surprising as there was a clear tendency in the art to expect that it was the compounds binding to the 5-HT\n7\n receptor but which act there as antagonists would be the ones usuable for the treatment of pain, especially neuropathic pain. Clearly this was found here as not being the case, especially not for neuropathic pain, such as allodynia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Treating\" or \"treatment\" as used in this application are defined as including the treatment of the symptoms of pain, especially neuropathic pain, especially certain subtypes of neuropathic pain, such as allodynia - as well as treatment of the disease or disease consequences causing the symptoms, the prevention or the prophylaxis of the symptoms of pain, especially neuropathic pain, especially certain subtypes of neuropathic pain, such as allodynia - as well as the prevention or the prophylaxis of the disease or disease consequences causing the symptoms. Preferably \"treating\" or \"treatment\" as used in this application are defined as including the treatment of the symptoms of pain, especially neuropathic pain, especially certain subtypes of neuropathic pain, such as allodynia - as well as treatment of the disease consequences causing the symptoms, the prevention or the prophylaxis of the symptoms of pain, especially neuropathic pain, especially certain subtypes of neuropathic pain, such as allodynia - as well as the prevention or the prophylaxis of the disease consequences causing the symptoms. Most preferably \"treating\" or \"treatment\" as used in this application are defined as including the treatment of the symptoms of pain, especially of neuropathic pain, especially certain subtypes of neuropathic pain, such as allodynia, and the prevention or the prophylaxis of the symptoms of pain, especially of neuropathic pain, especially certain subtypes of neuropathic pain, such as allodynia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe superfamily of serotonin receptors (5-HT) includes 7 classes (5-HT\n1\n-5-HT\n7\n) encompassing 14 human subclasses that are described in many positions in literature especially in \nD. Hoyer, et al., Neuropharmacology, 1997, 36, 419\n. Thus:\n\n \n \n \n\"The 5-HT\n7\n receptor\" as used in this application is well known and defined.\n \n\"The 5-HT\n1A\n receptor\" as used in this application is well known and defined.\n \nAll other \"5-HT receptors\" as used in this application are well known and defined.\n \n\n\n\"Compound binding to the 5-HT\n7\n receptor\" as used in this application is/are defined as having a K\nl\n Value in their binding to the 5-HT\n7\n-receptor ≤ 2 µM.\n\n\n \n \n \nAssays that may be used for determining the affinity and selectivity of a 5-HT\n7\n receptor agonist and/or other affinities to 5-HT receptors are well known in the art and especially measuring the affinities to these receptors are offered by service companies like CEREP (128, rue Danton, 92500 Rueil. Malmaison, France) or MDS Pharma Services (Rosa de Lima 1bis, 2° 28290 Las Matas (Madrid), Spain). It is possible to classify a compound with 5-HT receptor affinity as agonist (also as inverse agonist or antagonist) according to the reference of S. M. Stahl, Essential Psychopharmacology, Neuroscientific basis and practical applications, Ed. Cambridge, 1996, \nChapter\n 3. The respective part of the literature is hereby incorporated by reference and forms part of the disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"Agonist\" is defined as a compound that binds to a receptor and has an intrinsic effect, and thus, increases the basal activity of a receptor when it contacts the receptor. Full agonists show the maximum effect like in this case 5CT or AS-19 on the 5-HT\n7\n receptor, whereas a partial agonist like MSD-5a is giving less (e.g. 80%) of the response of the full agonist as a maximum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"salt\" is to be understood as meaning any form of the active compound according to the invention in which this assumes an ionic form or is charged and is coupled with a counter-ion (a cation or anion) or is in solution. By this are also to be understood complexes of the active compound with other molecules and ions, in particular complexes which are complexed via ionic interactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"physiologically acceptable salt\" is understood in particular, in the context of this invention, as salt (as defined above) formed either with a physiologically tolerated acid, that is to say salts of the particular active compound with inorganic or organic acids which are physiologically tolerated - especially if used on humans and/or mammals - or with at least one, preferably inorganic, cation which are physiologically tolerated - especially if used on humans and/or mammals. Examples of physiologically tolerated salts of particular acids are salts of: hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromide, monohydrobromide, monohydrochloride or hydrochloride, methiodide, methanesulfonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, citric acid, glutamic acid, hippuric acid picric acid and/or aspartic acid. Examples of physiologically tolerated salts of particular bases are salts of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals and with NH\n4\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"solvate\" according to this invention is to be understood as meaning any form of the active compound according to the invention in which this compound has attached to it via noncovalent binding another molecule (most likely a polar solvent) especially including hydrates and alcoholates, e.g. methanolate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the current invention the following proviso applies to the compounds used in this invention:\n\n \n \n \nwith the proviso that the compound epinastin is excluded.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the current invention the following proviso applies to the compounds used in this invention:\n\n \n \n \nwith the proviso that the compound 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy- dipropylaminotetralin) is excluded.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nSome known subgroups of pain are acute pain, chronic pain, visceral pain and including also headaches, especially migraine. A subgroup of pain being of special interest in connection with this invention is neuropathic pain, such as allodynia, which is the pain treated as highly preferred embodiment of the invention.

in the form shown or in form of the acid or base or in form of a salt, especially a physiologically acceptable salt, or in form of a solvate, especially a hydrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAS-19 [(2S)-(+)-8-(1,3,5-trimethylpyrazolin-4-yl)-2-(dimethylamino) tetralin] is defined by below sketched formula and is commercially available (e.g. through TOCRIS).\n\n \n \n\nMSD-5a (corresponds to compound 5a in Thomson et al., 2004; Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories) [2-(6-phenylpyridin-2-ylthio)-\nN,N-\ndimethyl ethanamine] is described in this literature including its synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny use of a compound that is a prodrug of a compound used according to the invention - especially AS-19 and MSD-5a - is within the scope of the invention. The term \"prodrug\" is used in its broadest sense and encompasses those derivatives that are converted in vivo to the compounds of the invention. Such derivatives would readily occur to those skilled in the art, and include, depending on the functional groups present in the molecule and without limitation, the following derivatives of the present compounds: esters, amino acid esters, phosphate esters, metal salts sulfonate esters, carbamates, and amides. Examples of well known methods of producing a prodrug of a given acting compound are known to those skilled in the art and can be found e.g. in Krogsgaard-Larsen et al. \"Textbook of Drug design and Discovery\" Taylor & Francis (April 2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise stated, the compounds used according to the invention - especially AS-19 and MSD-5a - are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of a hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by \n13\nC- or \n14\n C-enriched carbon or \n15\nN-enriched nitrogen are within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn human therapeutics, the dose administered can be quite low depending on the route of administration. Generally an effective administered amount of a compound of the invention will depend on the relative efficacy of the compound chosen, the severity of the disorder being treated and the weight of the sufferer. However, active compounds will typically be administered once or more times a day for example 1, 2, 3 or 4 times daily, with typical total daily doses In the range of from 0.1 to 1000 mg/kg/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny medicament according to the invention contains the active ingredient as well as optionally at least one auxiliary material and/or additive and/or optionally another active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe auxiliary material and/or additive can be specifically selected from conserving agents, emulsifiers and/or carriers for parenteral application. The selection of these auxiliary materials and/or additives and of the amounts to be used depends upon how the pharmaceutical composition is to be applied. Examples include here especially parenteral like intravenous subcutaneous or intramuscular application formulations but which could also be used for other administration routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRoutes of administration can include intramuscular injection, intraveneous injection, subcutaneous injection, sublingual, bucal, patch through skin, oral ingestion, implantable osmotic pump, collagen implants, aerosols or suppository.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncluded in this invention are especially also methods of treatments of a patient or a mammal, including men, suffering from pain, especially neuropathic pain using a compound binding to the shut, receptor and acting as an agonist.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPharmacological methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod 1: Binding and functionality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBinding affinities were determined in radioligand binding assays according to their standard assays protocols. In \ncase\n 1, the assays included in the LeadProfilingScreen package plus 5-HT\n1\n non-selective, 5-HT\n2\n non-selective, 5-HT\n2B\n, 5-HT\n2C\n, 5-HT\n4\n, 5-HT\n5A\n, 5-HT\n6\n and 5-HT\n7\n were performed. In \ncase\n 2, assays included in the High-throughput profile plus 5-HT\n1D\n, 5-HT\n2\nB, 5-HT\n4e\n were performed. For AS-19 further assays were carried out to complete its selectivity profile for serotonin receptors, including 5-HT\n1B\n, 5-HT\n1D\n, 5-HT\n2A\n and 5-HT\n4e\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nFunctionality\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \ncAMP measurements were performed by using a system based on Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescense (HTRF) (Gabriel et al., 2003). This technology allows the direct measurement of cAMP on HEK-293F cells that stably expressed human 5-HT\n7\n receptors. The principle of this assay is based on competition between cAMP produced by cells and cAMP-XL665 conjugate for the binding with monoclonal anti-cAMP-cryptate conjugate. The HTRF cAMP kit from CisBio was used according to the manufacturer's directions. The experimental procedure was performed as stated below. After overnight serum-free incubation, suspended cells (20,000 cells per well) were added to 96-well culture plates in incubation buffer composed of Ham's F12 (Gibco) plus 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1- methyl-xanthine (IBMX; Sigma) and 20 µM pargyline (Sigma).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor agonist and antagonist experiments, 2 µl of either compound or vehicle was added to each well on 40 µl of cell suspension at different concentrations, preincubating plates for 10 min at room temperature after compound addition. Afterwards, 10 µl of either vehicle or 5-HT was added incubating for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped lysing the cells with a mixture of 25 µl of cryptate and 25 µl of XL-665 prepared in the lysis buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Plates were incubated for an additional hour at room temperature and read at 665 nm/620 nm using a RubyStar Plate reader (BMG LabTech).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMethod 2: Capsaicin test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimals\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMale CD1 mice aged from 6 to 8 weeks old were used in these studies. Animals were housed in groups of five, provided with food and water ad libitum and kept in controlled laboratory conditions with the temperature maintained at 21 ± 1 °C and light in 12 h cycles (on at 07:00 h and off at 19:00 h). Experiments were carried out in a soundproof and air-regulated experimental room. The number of mice per group in each individual experiment was 16.\n\n\n \n\n\nDrugs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCapsaicin (8-methyl-\nN\n-vanillyl 6-nonamide) was dissolved in 1 % DMSO (vehicle). Drugs used for treatments were: AS-19 [(2\nS\n)-(+)-8-(1,3,5-trimethylpyrazolin-4-yl)-2-(dimethytamino) tetralin), MSD-5a (corresponds to compound 5a in Thomson et al., 2004; Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories) [2-(6-phenylpyndin-2-ylthio)-\nN,N-\ndimethyl ethanamine], SB-258719 [(\nR\n)-3,N-Dimethy)-\nN\n-(1-methyl-3-(4-methy)pipendin-1-yl) propyl) benzene sulfonamide], SB-269970 [(\nR\n)-3-(2-(2-(4-Methylpiperidin-1-yl) ethyl) pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl) phenol], WAY-100635 [(\nN\n-{2-{4-{2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl) ethyl)-\nN\n-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexane carboxamide] and F-13640 [(3-Chloro-4-fluoro-phenyly[4-fluoro-4-{[(5-methyl-pyidin-2-ylmethyl)-amino]-methyl}piperidin-1-yl] methanone]. AS-19 was dissolved in 1% DMSO and the rest of compounds were prepared as aqueous solutions. Doses were calculated based on the molecular weight of the free base. All the compounds and vehicles (1% DMSO or physiological saline) were administered in a volume of 5 ml/kg through the subcutaneous (s.c.) route. When two compounds were co-administered, they were injected s.c. in opposite flanks of the mice.\n\n\n \n\n\nCapsaicin model of neurogenic pain\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSubplantar capsaicin injection initially evokes a nocifensive behavior that is characterized by lifting and guarding the injected paw and typically lasts up to 5 min following injection. Afterwards, hypersensitivity to both thermal and mechanical stimuli is evidenced (Gilchrist et al., 1996). In this study, sensitization by subplantar capsaicin injection was used to assess the effect of several 5-HT\n7\n ligands on mechanical allodynia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice were injected with capsaicin (1ug or 4 ng in 20µl of 1% DMSO) or 1% DMSO (vehicle) into the mid-plantar surface of the right hind paw. Drug treatments with 5-HT\n7\n ligands were done 30 min before capsaicin injection and withdrawal latencies to a mechanical stimulus were determined 15 min after capsaicin injection (\nFig. 1\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nEvaluation of mechanical allodynia: authomatic von Frey test\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMechanical allodynia was quantified by measuring the hind paw withdrawal response latency to von Frey filament stimulation. Mice were placed into compartment enclosures in a test chamber with a framed metal mesh floor and allowed to acclimate to their environment for 120 min before testing. During this time the animal initially demonstrated exploratory behavior, but subsequently stopped exploring and stood quietly with only occasional bouts of grooming. The mechanical stimulus was applied to the plantar surface of the right, capsaicin-injected hind paw from below the mesh floor by using an automated testing device (dynamic plantar aesthesiometer; Ugo Basile, Italy) that lifts a straight filament (0.5 mm diameter). The filament exerted a fixed upward pressure (1 g or 0.25 g) on the plantar surface. When the animal withdrew its hind paw, the mechanical stimulus automatically stopped and the latency time was recorded. Latency was defined as the time from the onset of exposure to the filament to the cessation of the pressure when the sensor detected the withdrawal of the paw. A cut-off latency of 60 sec was imposed. Paw withdrawal latencies were measured in triplicate for each animal.\n\n\n \n\n\nExperimental protocol\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWhen fixed at 1 g, the pressure exerted by the filament is insufficient to induce timely pain responses in normal control mice (in the absence of capsaicin) and thus prompt withdrawal responses found 15 min after sensitization with 1 µg capsaicin reflect mechanical allodynia. This approach enabled us to evaluate the possible antiallodynic effect of 5-HT\n7\n ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, in some experiments, only 4 ng (instead of 1µg) of capsaicin were injected into the paw and the pressure exerted by the filament was reduced to 0.25 g (instead of 1 g). Mice receiving this minor amount of capsaicin (250 times less than those used to induce allodynia) did not display allodynia when mechanically stimulated with a low upward pressure of 0.25 g. This approach was used to test the possibility that treatments could exert a proallodynic effect. The \nFigure 1\n summarizes the two different experimental approaches carried out in this study.\n\n\n \n\n\nData analysis\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nData are presented as mean paw withdrawal latency responses in sec ± S.E.M. Capsaicin-injected hind paw withdrawal responses to mechanical stimulation of treated mice were compared with those of untreated (vehicle-treated) mice. Statistical analysis to test intergroup comparisons was made using an initial one-way analysis of variance followed by the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMethod 3: Partial sciatic nerve ligation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimals\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMale CD1 mice aged from 6 to 8 weeks old were used in these studies. Animals were housed in groups of five, provided with food and water ad libitum and kept in controlled laboratory conditions with the temperature maintained at 21 ± 1 °C and light in 12 h cycles (on at 07:00 h and off at 19:00 h). Experiments were carried out in a soundproof and air-regulated experimental room.\n\n\n \n\n\nDrugs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDrugs used for treatments were: AS-19 [(2\nS\n)-(+)-8-(1,3,5-trimethylpyrazolin-4-yl)-2-(dimethylamino) tetralin], MSD-5a (corresponds to compound 5a in Thomson et al., 2004; Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories) [2-(6-phenylpyridin-2-ylthio)-\nN,N-\ndimethyl ethanamine], SB-258719 [(\nR\n)-3,\nN\n-Dimethyl-\nN\n-(1-methyl-3-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl) propyl) benzene sulfonamide]. AS-19 was dissolved in 1% DMSO In the free base form and saline with the dihydrochloride salt. The rest of compounds were prepared as aqueous solutions. Doses were calculated based on the molecular weight of the free base. All the compounds and vehicles (1% DMSO or physiological saline) were administered in a volume of 5 ml/kg through the subcutaneous (s.c.) route. When two compounds were co-administered, they were injected s.c. in opposite flanks of the mice.\n\n\n \n\n\nSurgery\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe partial sciatic nerve ligation model was used to induce neuropathic pain, according to the method previously described (Seltzer et al., 1990; Malmberg and Basbaum, 1998). This model consists of partial injury to the sciatic nerve at mid-thigh level. All surgical procedures for nerve injury were performed under isoflurane (IsoFlo\n®\n, Abbott-Laboratorios Dr. Esteve, S.A., Barcelona, Spain) anesthesia (induction: 3%; surgery: 2%). Briefly, mice were anaesthetized and the common sciatic nerve was exposed at the level of the mid-thigh of the right hind paw. Partial nerve injury was produced at about 1 cm proximal to the nerve trifurcation by tying a tight ligature around approximately 33 to 50% the diameter of the sciatic nerve using 9-0 non-absorbable virgin silk suture (Alcon surgical, Texas, USA). Ligature enclosed the outer 1/3-1/2 sciatic nerve whereas the rest of the nerve (inner 2/3-1/2) was leaved \"uninjured\". The muscle was then stitched with 6-0 silk suture and the skin incision was closed with wound clips. Control, sham-operated mice underwent the same surgical procedure and the sciatic nerve was exposed, but not ligated. After surgery, animals were allowed to recover for 5 days prior to Initiation of nociceptive behavioral tests (see experimental protocol below).\n\n\n \n\n\nNociceptive behavioral tests\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAllodynia to mechanical stimulus and hyperalgesia to noxious thermal stimulus were used as outcome measures of neuropathic pain and as Indicators of the possible antinoaceptive effect of drug treatments.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of mechanical allodynia: automatic von Frey test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMechanical allodynia was quantified by measuring the tactile threshold for hind paw withdrawal following von Frey filament stimulation. The day of the test, mice were placed into compartment enclosures in a test chamber with a framed metal mesh floor and allowed to acclimate to their environment for 1 h before testing. The mechanical stimulus was applied to the plantar surface of the right hind paw from below the mesh floor by using an automated testing device (dynamic plantar aesthesiometer; Ugo Basile, Italy) that lifts a straight filament (0.5 mm diameter). The filament exerted an increasing upward pressure on the plantar surface. The pressure increased linearly with time (0.1g/s; from 0 to 5 g in 50 s) until the mouse withdrew its paw. When the animal withdrew its hind paw, the mechanical stimulus automatically stopped and the force was recorded as the mechanical threshold. Thus, the mechanical threshold was defined as the pressure at which the sensor detected the withdrawal of the paw. A cut-off threshold of 5 g (50 s) was imposed. Paw withdrawal latencies were measured in triplicate for each animal.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of mechanical allodynia: manual von Frey test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMechanical allodynia was quantified by measuring the hind paw withdrawal response to von Frey filament stimulation, as previously reported (Chaplan et al., 1994). The filament of 0.4 g was first used. Then, the strength of the next filament was decreased when the animal responded or increased when animal did not respond. This up-down procedure was stopped four measures after the first change in animal responding and the threshold of response was calculated. Clear paw withdrawal, shaking was considered as a nociceptive-like response.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of thermal hyperalgesia: plantar test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThermal hyperalgesia was assessed using the plantar test by determination of the withdrawal latencies to a thermal stimulus following a modification of the test described by Hargreaves et al. (1988). The day of the test, mice were placed in a plantar test device (Plantar test, Ugo Basile, Italy) and allowed to acclimate to their environment for 1 h before testing. The plantar test device consisted of a plastic cubicle with a glass floor through which a mobile infrared photobeam was applied onto the plantar surface of the right hind paw. Latency time to withdrawal from the thermal stimulus was determined. The intensity of the infrared photobeam was adjusted to produce mean response latencies in control untreated mice of approximately 8 to 12 seconds. The response latency was determined using a timer linked to the photodiode motion sensors in the plantar test device. Response latency was defined as the time from the onset of exposure to the infrared photobeam to the cessation of the photobeam when the photodiode motion sensor detected the withdrawal of the paw of the mouse. Paw withdrawal latencies were measured in triplicate for each animal and the mean value was used for analysis. A cut-off latency of 20 seconds was imposed to avoid tissue damage.\n\n\n \n\n\nExperimental protocol: Latin square design.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effectiveness of acute treatments with 5-HT\n7\n ligands compared to vehicle on the expression of neuropathic pain was investigated based on the following experimental protocol. Mice were habituated for 1 h to the environment of the different experimental tests (either von Frey or plantar test, depending on the experiment) during 4 days. After the habituation period, pre-injury baseline responses in each test were established during 2 consecutive days. One day after baseline measurements, nerve injury or sham operation was induced as previously described. Mice were then tested in either the von Frey or the plantar test on \nday\n 5 after the surgical procedure to monitor post-injury responses. Post-injury baseline responses of mice treated with vehicle were obtained on day 10 (basal pre-treatment). On days 11-13 mice received treatment with three different doses of 5-HT\n7\n ligands following a \nLatin\n square design. Finally, on \nday\n 14 after surgery, baseline responses in vehicle-treated mice (basal post-treatment) were evaluated as an internal control to ensure that mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were not influenced by previous treatments in the \nLatin square\n design. Behavioral evaluation was always done 30 min after treatment with either vehicle or 5-HT\n7\n ligands. \nFigure 15\n summarizes the chronology of the experimental protocol.\n\n\n \n\n\nExperimental protocol Single dose design.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMice were habituated for 2 h to the environment of the different experimental tests (either manual von Frey or plantar test, depending on the experiment) during 1-2 days. After the habituation period, measurements in each test were established after 1 h habituation by means of the manual von Frey or the plantar test, 30 and 45 min, respectively, after administration of the vehicle or the tested compounds. One day after baseline measurement, nerve injury was induced as previously described and 5 days later post-injury baseline values were obtained in the mentioned tests. On \nday\n 10 post-injury mice received vehicle and measurements were done to obtain pre-treatment basal values. The day of the test, on \nday\n 11 post-injury, measurements in drug-treated mice were done (\nFig. 16\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nData analysis\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nData were primarily presented as pressure (grams) required for reaching the threshold of response (paw withdrawal) in the von Frey test or as latency (seconds) of paw withdrawal in the plantar test. In some cases, data were presented as percentages respect to pre-treatment baseline values. Values were always mean ± S.E.M.\n\nData obtained in the von Frey and plantar tests in treated mice were compared with those of untreated (vehicle-treated) mice. Statistical analysis to test intergroup comparisons was made using an initial one-way analysis of variance followed by the post hoc Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. Differences were considered significant if the probability of error was less than 5% (the level of significance was set at p < 0.05).\n\n\n \n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nBarkin RL, Fawcett J.

Food and water were available \nad libitum.\n Rats were allowed to habituate to the housing facilities for at least 1 week before surgery. Ethical guidelines of the Committee for Research and Ethical Issues of the International Association for the Study of Pain (1983) were adhered to in these studies.\n\n\n \n\n\nDrugs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDrugs used for treatments were: AS-19 [(\n2S\n)-(+)-8-(1,3,5-trimethylpyrazolin-4-yl)-2-(dimethylamino) tetralin], MSD-5a (corresponds to compound 5a in Thomson et al., 2004; Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories) [2-(6-phenylpyridin-2-ylthio)-\nN,N-\ndimethyl ethanamine], SB-269970 [(\nR\n)-3-(2-(2-(4-Methylpiperidin-1-yl) ethyl) pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl) phenol], SB-258719 [(\nR\n)-3,\nN\n-Dimethyl-\nN\n-(1-methyl-3-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl) propyl) benzene sulfonamide]. All compounds were prepared as aqueous solutions. AS-19 and MSD-5a were administered by subcutaneous (s.c.) route, whereas SB-258719 and SB-269970 were administered through the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. When two compounds were co-administered, one was injected s.c. and the other i.p.\n\n\n \n\n\nSurgery\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nRats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.), and CCI-SN was made according to the method of Bennett and Xie (1988). Briefly, the right common sciatic nerve was exposed at mid-tight level by blunt dissection through the biceps femoris muscle. Proximal to the trifurcation, ≈10 mm of nerve was freed from adhering tissue and four loose ligatures (5.0 chromic catgut) were tied around the sciatic nerve (≈1 mm apart). To obtain the desired degree of constriction, the criterion formulated by Bennett and Xie (1988) was applied: the ligatures reduced the diameter of the nerve by a just noticeable amount, and retarded, but did not interrupt, the epineurial circulation. In sham-operated control rats, an identical dissection was performed on the right side allowing the sciatic nerve to be freed from surrounding tissue, but not ligatured. Finally, muscle and skin were closed in layers with silk thread.\n\n\n \n\n\nNociceptive test procedures\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMechanical nociceptive thresholds, expressed as grams (g), were measured using the Randall-Sellito test (Ugo Basile analgesimeter, Bioseb, Chaville, France). An increasing pressure was applied to the nerve-injured hindpaw of unrestrained rats until paw withdrawal (PW) and then a squeak (i.e. the vocalization threshold when the paw was held under pressure) were obtained. As PW is a spinally coordinated reflex whereas vocalization is a supra-spinal integrated response (Kayser and Christensen, 2000), this test allowed assessment of the respective contribution of spinal versus supra-spinal mechanisms.\n\n\n \n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBennett GJ, Xie YK.

When two compounds were co-administered, one was injected s.c. and the other i.p.\n\n\n \n\n\nSurgery\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAfter pentobarbital-induced anaesthesia, the head of the rat was fixed in a stereotaxic frame, and a mid-line scalp incision was made, exposing skull and nasal bone. The infraorbital part of the right infraorbital nerve was then exposed. The edge of the orbit, formed by the maxillary, frontal, lacrimal and zygomatic bones, was dissected free, and orbital contents were gently deflected to give access to the infraorbital nerve. The latter was then dissected free at its most rostral extent in the orbital cavity, just caudal to the infraorbital foreamen. Two chromic catgut (5-0) ligatures were tied loosely (with about 2 mm spacing) around the nerve (Vos et al., 1994; Kayser et al., 2002). Care was taken to avoid any interruption of the epineurial circulation. In sham-operated rats, the right infraorbital nerve was exposed, but it was not ligatured.\n\n\n \n\n\nNociceptive test procedures\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn these rats with unilateral ligatures on the infraorbital nerve, sensitivity to mechanical stimulation in the ipsilateral vibrissal territory was assessed by determination of pressure threshold, delivered through von Frey filaments (Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA), necessary to trigger defensive behavioural response (brisk withdrawal of the head; attack; escape reaction). For each stimulus filament (corresponding to a calibrated pressure of 0.217, 0.445, 0.745, 0.976, 2.35, 4.19, 6.00, 7.37 or 12.5 g), three consecutive applications (1 sec apart) were made in order to verify the stability of the response. In both sciatic nerve- and infraorbital nerve- ligatured rats, threshold values were determined first two days before surgery, then 14 days later, at a time when hyperesponsiveness to mechanical and thermal stimulations has fully developed (Vos et al., 1994).\n\n\n \n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKayser V, Aubel B, Hamon M, Bourgoin S.

Experiments were carried out in a soundproof and air-regulated experimental room.\n\n\n \n\n\nDrugs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nStreptozotocin was purchased from Tocris (500mg, ref.1621) and was administered by intraperitoneal (ip) route at 200 mg/kg in a volume of 10 ml/kg. Streptozotocin was dissolved in saline immediately before administration.\n\nDrug used for treatments was AS-19 (Ref. 1968, Tocris; Sanin et al., 2003). AS-19 was dissolved in saline. Doses were calculated based on the molecular weight of the free base and administered in a volume of 10 ml/kg through the subcutaneous (i.p) route.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of mechanical allodynia: manual von Frey test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMechanical allodynia was quantified by measuring the hind paw withdrawal response to von Frey filament stimulation, as previously reported (Chaplan et al., 1994). The filament of 0.4 g and 4 g were the first and the last used, respectively. Then, the strength of the next filament was decreased when the animal responded or increased when animal did not respond. This up-down procedure was stopped four measures after the first change in animal responding and the threshold of response was calculated. Clear paw withdrawal, shaking was considered as a nociceptive-like response.\n\n\n \n\n\nExperimental protocol\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBecause the primary indicator for the successful induction of type I diabetes using this animal model is the development of hyperglycemia, it is necessary to measure the level of glucose in the blood circulation. Diabetic hyperglycemia is defined in this study as a nonfasting plasma glucose concentration more than 250 mg/dl.\n\nAfter a basal reading with von Frey hairs and one glucose level control, a dose of 200 mg/kg of streptozotocin prepared in saline was injected intraperitoneally in the 7 week after birth.\n\nThe glucose levels were monitoring one week after streptozotocin treatment to confirm the acquisition of diabetes, blood samples were collected through maxilar vein and plasma glucose levels were estimated by diagnostic Accu-Chek Sensor Comfort System kit method. Only animals with glucose levels higher than 250 mg/dl, were selected to measure mechanical allodynia.\n\nReadings with von Frey hairs were done 30 min after treatment with vehicle, on \n \n \nday\n \n \n 21, 24 and 29 post-streptozotocin and after treatment with AS-19 (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg) on \n \n \nday\n \n \n 22, 25 and 30 post-streptozotocin, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nChaplan SR, Bach FW, Pogrel JW, Chung JM, Yaksh TL.

Animals were housed in groups of five, provided with food and water ad libitum and kept in controlled laboratory conditions with the temperature maintained at 21 ± 1 °C and light in 12 h cycles (on at 07:00 h and off at 19:00 h).

AS-19 was dissolved in 1% DMSO. Doses refer to the salt weight. AS-19 was administered in a volume of 5 ml/kg through the subcutaneous (s.c.) route.\n\n\n \n\n\nExperimental protocol\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMale CD1 mice (Harlan Ibérica, Barcelona) were injected with λ-carrageenan (50 µl of a 2.5% solution) or saline (vehicle) into the plantar surface of the right hind paw. Subplantar carrageenan injection results in paw edema, allodynia and hyperalgesia, and represents a standard animal model to identify antiinflammatory and analgesic compounds. In this study, the effect of AS-19 on mechanical allodynia or thermal hyperalgesia was assessed 3 hours (acute inflammation) or 4 days (chronic inflammation) after subplantar carrageenan injection. Withdrawal threshold or latencies to mechanical or thermal stimuli were determined using the authomatic von Frey and plantar test, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nEvaluation of mechanical allodynia: authomatic von Frey test\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMechanical allodynia was quantified by measuring the tactile threshold for hind paw withdrawal following von Frey filament stimulation. The day of the test, mice were placed into compartment enclosures in a test chamber with a framed metal mesh floor and allowed to acclimate to their environment for 1 h before testing. The mechanical stimulus was applied to the plantar surface of the right hind paw from below the mesh floor by using an automated testing device (dynamic plantar aesthesiometer; Ugo Basile, Italy) that lifts a straight filament (0.5 mm diameter). The filament exerted an increasing upward pressure on the plantar surface. The pressure increased linearly with time (0.1g/s; from 0 to 5 g in 50 s) until the mouse withdrew its paw. When the animal withdrew its hind paw, the mechanical stimulus automatically stopped and the force was recorded as the mechanical threshold. Thus, the mechanical threshold was defined as the pressure at which the sensor detected the withdrawal of the paw. A cut-off threshold of 5 g (50 s) was imposed. Paw withdrawal latencies were measured in triplicate for each animal.\n\n\n \n\n\nEvaluation of thermal hyperalgesia: plantar test\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThermal hyperalgesia was assessed using the plantar test by determination of the withdrawal latencies to a thermal stimulus following a modification of the test described by Hargreaves et al. (1988). The day of the test, mice were placed in a plantar test device (Plantar test, Ugo Basile, Italy) and allowed to acclimate to their environment for 1 h before testing. The plantar test device consisted of a plastic cubicle with a glass floor through which a mobile infrared photobeam was applied onto the plantar surface of the right hind paw. Latency time to withdrawal from the thermal stimulus was determined. The intensity of the infrared photobeam was adjusted to produce mean response latencies in control untreated mice of approximately 8 to 12 seconds. The response latency was determined using a timer linked to the photodiode motion sensors in the plantar test device. Response latency was defined as the time from the onset of exposure to the infrared photobeam to the cessation of the photobeam when the photodiode motion sensor detected the withdrawal of the paw of the mouse. Paw withdrawal latencies were measured in triplicate for each animal and the mean value was used for analysis. A cut-off latency of 20 seconds was imposed to avoid tissue damage.\n\n\n \n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHargreaves K, Dubner R, Brown F, Flores C, Joris J.

This has hindered pharmacological studies exploring the role played by this receptor. In this study, pharmacological evidence is presented to prove the involvement of the 5-HT\n7\n receptor in the control of nociceptive behaviors. Information on the selectivity of the pharmacological tools used is thus a key issue and has been compiled in this section. AS-19 is a 5-HT\n7\n receptor agonist (Ki = 0.605 nM, Emax = 77.0±2.3 %, EC50 = 8.87±0.57 nM). Unfortunately, as pointed up by Perez-Garcia and Meneses (2005), there is a lack of information in the literature regarding its affinity for receptors other than 5-HT\n7\n. Hence, the affinity of AS-19 for a total of 70 receptors, transporters or ion channels was evaluated in a commercial screening package (MDS Pharma Services) and the binding profile was presented in Table 1. Not only AS-19 has high affinity for 5-HT\n7\n receptors but also has significant affinity for the 5-HT\n1A\n (Ki = 89.7 nM), and 5-HT\n5A\n (Ki = 98.5 nM) receptors, showing no significant affinity for other 5-HT receptor subtypes or other receptors, transporters or ion channels included in the screening package.\n\nMSD-5a is also a 5-HT\n7\n agonist (Ki = 0.6 nM, Emax = 60.8±1.9 %, EC50 = 6.82±1.45 nM), but its selectivity against 5-HT\n1A\n (Ki = 16 nM) is not as high as in the case of AS-19 (Table 1). In addition, it has partial agonist activity, giving 80% of the response of the full agonist 5-CT in 5-HT\n7\n receptors (Thomson et al., 2004).\n\nSB-258719 was identified as the first selective 5-HT\n7\n receptor antagonist, with 100-fold selectivity over a range of other receptors (Forbes et al., 1998). SB-269970 was also identified as a potent and selective 5-HT\n7\n receptor antagonist (Lovell et al., 2000). Particularly noteworthy is the lack of affinity at the 5-HT\n1A\n receptor by both 5-HT\n7\n receptor antagonists used in this study (Forbes et al., 1998; Lovell et al., 2000). Regarding functionality, SB-258719 and SB-269970 have been described as a pure antagonist and an inverse agonist, respectively (Mahé et al., 2004). However, both 5-HT\n7\n antagonists should be considered as invers agonists as negative intrinsic activity for these compounds has been demonstrated (Romero et al., 2006).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe doses chosen in our experiments of either agonist or antagonists have already been tested in other in vivo experiments like assays sensitive to memory formation, potential psychotic and anxiety status or antidepressant drugs (Perez-Garcia et al., 2005; Guscott et al., 2005). The knowledge of these compounds has helped us to choose the best range of doses to study in order to avoid finding side effects.\n\n \n \nTable 1.

Mice injected with capsaicin (1µg) into the mid-plantar surface of the right hind paw developed \nmechanical allodynia\n 15 min after the injection. The pressure exerted by the filament (1 g) was below the threshold of feeling of paws from control mice (control withdrawal latencies of mice injected with 1% DMSO were close to the 60 sec cut-off). However, 15 min after subplantar capsaicin injection, the same \"innocuous\", \"non-noxious\" pressure (1 g) was perceived as painful and the withdrawal latency was severely reduced (\nFig. 2\n). This abnormal pain sensitivity to previously non-painful mechanical stimuli is known as mechanical allodynia and in our model results from capsaicin sensitization.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nb) Selective 5-HT\n7\n receptor agonlsts dose-dependently inhibit capsaicin-induced mechanical allodynia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSystemic subcutaneous administration of the 5-HT\n7\n receptor agonist AS-19 dose-dependently inhibited capsaicin-induced mechanical allodynia (\nFig. 3\n). Significantly increased paw withdrawal latencies of mice treated with AS-19 were found at the doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/Kg when comparing to mice treated with vehicle. The antiallodynic effect reached the maximum at the dose of 10 mg/kg.\n\nSimilar to AS-19, MSD-5a, another 5-HT\n7\n receptor agonist used in this study, exerted antiallodynic effects (\nFig. 4\n). At doses of 3,10 and 30 mg/kg, administration of MSD-5a to mice receiving capsaicin increased the latencies of nociceptive paw withdrawal responses to mechanical stimulation compared to vehicle-treated mice. Differences were significant (p>0.05) at all three tested doses and reached the maximum at 10 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n\n\n \nc\n) \nReversion of the antiallodynic effect of 5-HT\n7\n receptor agonists by selective 5-HT\n1\n receptor antagonists\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to confirm that activation of 5-HT\n7\n receptors is unambiguously responsible for the inhibition of capsaicin-induced mechanical allodynia exerted by AS-19 and MSD-5a, we used two different 5-HT\n7\n receptor antagonists (SB-258719 and SB-269970) to try to pharmacologically reverse the antiallodynic effect of agonists.\n\nFirst we performed a dose-response study of the effect of SB-258719 by itself on capsaicin-induced mechanical allodynia (\nFig. 5\n). SB-258719 was s.c injected at doses of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg and no effects were observed except at the highest dose, at which an antiallodynic effect was evidenced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the next experiment, low doses of SB-258719 having no antiallodynic effects were chosen to try to reverse the antiallodynic effect exerted by 5 mg/kg of AS-19. As shown in \nFigure 6\n, SB-258719 at 2.5 and 5 mg/kg had no effect whereas treatment with AS-19 (5 mg/kg) increased paw withdrawal latencies. Interestingly, the analgesic (antiallodynic) effect of AS-19 was dose-dependently inhibited when co-administered with SB-258719.\n\nPharmacological reversion of the antiallodynic effect of AS-19 was also successfully accomplished by using another 5HT\n7\n receptor antagonist, SB-269970, at a dose (10 mg/kg) that by itself did not modify paw withdrawal latencies after subplantar capsaicin injection (\nFig. 7\n). Finally, we also blocked the antiallodynic effect produced by the other 5HT\n7\n receptor agonist, MSD-5a (10 mg/kg), using the antagonist SB-258719 (5 mg/kg) (\nFig. 8\n) Altogether, preceding data using two different 5HT\n7\n receptor agonists and confirmation by pharmacological reversion with two different 5HT\n7\n receptor antagonists, strongly suggest that activation of 5HT\n7\n receptors exerts an antiallodynic effect after capsaicin sensitization.\n\nAs AS-19 has some affinity for 5-HT\n1A\n receptors in addition to binding to 5HT\n7\n receptors (see Table 1) and as 5-HT\n1A\n receptor agonists are known to exert analgesic effects in a number of animal models (Colpaert, 2006), we next evaluated the possibility that actions on 5-HT\n1A\n receptors could also contribute to the antiallodynic effects of AS-19. To accomplish that, AS-19 was administered together with the selective 5-HT\n1A\n antagonist WAY-100635 (Foster et al., 1995; Khawaja et al., 1995) at 0.3 mg/kg, a dose that had no effect on capsaicin-induced mechanical allodynia (\nFig. 9\n) but largely blocks the effect of the selective 5-HT\n1A\n agonist F-13640 (Colpaert et al., 2002) (\nFig. 10\n). Similarly, this dose has been shown to block the 5-HT\n1A\n-mediated effects induced by 8-OH-DPAT (ID\n50\n = 0.01 mg/kg) (Foster et al., 1995) and other 5-HT\n1A\n agonists (Reissig et al., 2005; You et al., 2005). Intriguingly, the antiallodynic effect of AS-19 at 5 and 10 mg/kg was unaffected in the presence of WAY-100635 but was abolished by SB-258719 (\nFig. 11\n), indicating that activation of 5-HT\n7\n but not of 5-HT\n1A\n receptors underlies the antiallodynic effect exerted by AS-19.\n\n\n \n\n\n \nd\n) \nSelective 5-HT\n7\n receptor antagonists exert proallodynlc effects\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nActivation of 5-HT\n7\n receptors by selective agonists has an antiallodynic effect in mice sensitized with capsaicin, but do selective 5-HT\n7\n receptor antagonists exert a proallodynic effect? To investigate this possibility we reduced both the dose of capsaicin (from 1 µg to 4 ng) and the upward pressure exerted by the filament (from 1 g to 0.25 g). Under these conditions, mice did not display mechanical allodynia. However, when treated with SB-258719 or SB-269970, mice receiving this minor amount of capsaicin (4 ng) and subjected to this low-pressure stimulation (0.25 g) showed a marked allodynia (\nFig. 12\n). Interestingly, the proallodynic effect of 5-HT\n7\n receptor antagonists was observed in mice injected with 4 ng of capsaicin but not in mice injected with vehicle (1% DMSO), suggesting that a minimal sensitizing challenge is needed for the antagonists to exert their effect.\n\nThe proallodynic effect of SB-258719 was dose-dependent (\nFig. 13\n) and was inhibited by AS-19 dose dependently (\nFig. 14\n). Promotion of allodynia by the other antagonist, SB-269970, was also inhibited by AS-19 (\nFig. 14\n), pointing to the involvement of 5-HT\n7\n receptors in such an effect.\n\n\n \n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-HT\n7\n receptors play a key role In the control of mechanical allodynia elicited by capsaicin sensitization:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n• \nActivation of 5HT\n7\n receptors by selective agonists dose-dependently Inhibits capsaicin-induced mechanical allodynia\n.\n\nThe antiallodynic effect was evidenced by using two different selective 5HT\n7\n receptor agonists (AS-19 and MSD-5a). AS-19 and MSD-5a blocked this behavioral manifestation of pain and restored the nociceptive response of capsaicin-sensitized mice to baseline values found in control unaffected mice.\n\n\n• \nIn contrast, blocking of SHT\n7\n receptors by selective antagonists produces a dose-dependent proallodynic effect.\n \n\nThe proallodynic effect was evidenced by using two different selective 5HT\n7\n receptor antagonists (SB-258719 and SB-269970).\n\n\n• \nAntiallodynic effects by agonists and proallodynic effects by antagonists can be reversed by antagonists and agonists, respectively.\n \n\nThe analgesic (antiallodynic) effects of AS-19 and MSD-5a were both inhibited by using two different selective 5HT\n7\n receptor antagonists (SB-258719 and SB-269970). In the same way, promotion of allodynia by the antagonists SB-258719 and SB-269970 was blocked by the AS-19 agonist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results reveal the involvement of the 5-HT\n7\n receptor In the control of pain in conditions involving central sensitization and point to a new potential therapeutic use of 5-HT\n7\n receptor agonists as analgesics, especially in neuropathic pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Partial sciatic nerve ligation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nNeuropathic pain refers to pain as a result of damage (due to injury or disease) to the nervous system including nerves, spinal cord and certain CNS regions (Woolf and Mannion, 1999; Zimmermann, 2001). Patients with neuropathic pain often suffer from spontaneous pain, allodynia (pain response to normally innocuous stimuli) and hyperalgesia (exaggerated pain evoked by noxious stimuli). Direct evaluation of spontaneous pain in animals is not possible, although some signs such as excessive grooming, changes in exploratory behavior or weight bearing have been suggested as indications of spontaneous pain. In contrast, evoked pain (allodynia and hyperalgesia) to thermal or mechanical stimuli can be clearly observed in most animal models of neuropathic pain. From the mechanistic point of view, neuropathic pain-associated behaviors, allodynia and hyperalgesia, revolve around the notion of central sensitization, whereby injury-evoked increased and persistent afferent discharges cause spinal cord neurons to reduce their stimulation threshold, to expand their receptive fields and to increase their responsiveness to different peripheral drives (Woolf, 1983; Hylden et al., 1989; Woolf and Thompson 1991; Coderre and Katz, 1997).\n\nMost neuropathic pain models are made by producing diseases or causing injuries to peripheral nerves. These methods to induce neuropathic pain differ in the location and type of peripheral nerve injury. The latter includes transection, loose or tight ligation, crush, perineural inflammation, tumor invasion, infection and toxic affectation (Wang and Wang, 2003). In an attempt to simulate causalgia as a result of partial nerve injury in humans, Seltzer el al. (1990) developed a rat model of neuropathic pain involving the ligation of 1/3 to 1/2 of the thickness of the sciatic nerve. Partial sciatic nerve ligated rats exhibit marked allodynia to von Frey hair stimulation and hyperalgesia to both thermal and mechanical noxious stimuli in the ipsilateral nerve-ligated paw. The evoked pain appears within hours after ligation and last for over 7 months. Similar results were obtained in mice by Malmberg and Basbaum (1998), who established some additional behavioral and neuroanatomical correlates and pointed up the reliability and objectivity of the partial sciatic nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain in mouse.\n\n\n \n\n\na) Effect of 5-HT\n7\n receptor ligands in neuropathic pain: \nvon Frey test-mechanical allodynia\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPartial sciatic nerve ligature induced mechanical allodynia. This was evidenced as a reduced pressure threshold for evoking withdrawal of the ipsilateral hind paw on \nday\n 10 post-injury compared to baseline pre-injury values (\nFig.17A\n). Systemic administration of the 5-HT\n7\n receptor agonist AS-19 on days 11-13 at doses of 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg significantly inhibited mechanical allodynia. At all these three doses, AS-19 restored thresholds of the nociceptive withdrawal response of nerve-injured paws to baseline pre-injury values. The analgesic (antiallodynic) effect disappeared as soon as AS-19 treatment was stopped (post-treatment thresholds the day after administration were indistinguishable from pre-treatment ones). Treatments with lower doses (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) of AS-19 were ineffective as no modification of this behavioral manifestation of neuropathic pain was found compared to vehicle-treated mice.\n\nSham operation did not induce mechanical allodynia but slight (not significant) reductions of the threshold of the nociceptive withdrawal response were usually found in sham-operated \nmice\n 10 days after surgery (\nFig. 17B\n). AS-19 only produced minor effects in sham-operated mice although at doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg AS-19 increased the nociceptive threshold.\n\nSimilar to AS-19, MSD-5a, another 5-HT\n7\n receptor agonist used in this study, exerted antiallodynic effects (\nFig. 19\n). Systemic administration of MSD-5a on days 11-13 at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg significantly inhibited mechanical allodynia. At these doses, MSD-5a restored thresholds of the nociceptive withdrawal response of nerve-injured paws to baseline pre-injury values. The analgesic (antiallodynic) effect disappeared the following day after last administration of MSD-5a (threshold were indistinguishable from pre-treatment one). Treatment with lower dose (0.3 mg/kg) of MSD-5a was ineffective as no modification of this behavioral manifestation of neuropathic pain was found compared to vehicle-treated mice.\n\nSham operation did not induce mechanical allodynia but slight (not significant) reductions of the threshold of the nociceptive withdrawal response were usually found in sham-operated \nmice\n 14 days after surgery (\nFig. 19B\n). MSD-5a did not produce any effects in sham-operated mice.\n\nActivation of 5-HT\n7\n receptors by the selective agonist AS-19 has antiallodynic effects in nerve-injured mice, but to investigate the possibility that a selective 5-HT\n7\n receptor antagonist exerts proallodynic effects, the 5-HT\n7\n receptor antagonist SB-258719 was administered to neuropathic mice. We observed that treatment with SB-258719 at 10 mg/kg significantly decreased the mechanical threshold for evoking withdrawal of the ipsilateral, nerve-injured hind paw below post-injury values (\nFig. 21A\n). Interestingly, treatment with SB-258719 not only promoted allodynia in nerve-injured mice but it was also able to induce mechanical allodynia in sham-operated mice (\nFig. 21 B)\n.\n\nIn order to strengthen the notion that activation of 5-HT\n7\n receptors is responsible for the analgesic effect exerted by AS-19 and MSD-5a it was tried to pharmacologically reverse its antiallodynic effect with the antagonist SB-258719. The antagonist SB-258719 at the dose of 5 mg/Kg had no antiallodynic effect and was able to reverse the antiallodynic effect exerted by AS-19 and MSD-5a at 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively (\nFig. 23\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nb) Effect of 5-HT\n7\n receptor ligands in neuropathic pain: \nplantar test - thermal hyperalgesia\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPartial sciatic nerve ligature induced thermal hyperalgesia as evidenced by decreased paw withdrawal latency to thermal stimulus on \nday\n 10 post-injury compared to baseline pre-injury values (\nFig. 18A\n). However, a significant decrease of such a hyperalgesia was observed on days 11-13 post-injury in mice receiving treatment with the 5-HT\n7\n receptor agonist AS-19. In fact, treatment with AS-19 at doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg increased the withdrawal latency of nerve-injured paws to levels indistinguishable from control baseline pre-injury values. Lower doses (0.1 mg/kg) of AS-19 did not exert analgesic (antihyperalgesic) effect. Sham operation did not produce any significant modification of the nociceptive response and administration of AS-19 to sham-operated mice had no effects (\nFig. 18B\n).\n\nSimilar to AS-19, MSD-5a, another 5-HT\n7\n receptor agonist used in this study, at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg increased the withdrawal latency of nerve-injured paws to levels indistinguishable from control baseline pre-injury values (\nFig. 20A\n). Lower doses (0.3 mg/kg) of MSD-5a did not exert analgesic (antihyperalgesic) effect. Sham operation did not produce any significant modification of the nociceptive response and administration of MSD-5a to sham-operated mice had no effects (\nFig. 20B\n). Interestingly, treatment with SB-258719 did not promote hyperalgesia in nerve-injured mice (\nFig. 22A\n) but it was able to reverse the antihyperalgesic effect of 5-HT\n7\n agonists (\nFig 24\n). As shown in \nFig. 24\n, the antihyperalgesic effect of the agonists, AS-19 (5 mg/kg) and MSD-5a (10 mg/kg) was inhibited when co-administered with the antagonist SB-258719 (5 mg/kg).\n\n\n \nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\n\n\n5-HT\n7\n receptors play a key role in the control of neuropathic pain:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n• \nActivation of 5HT\n7\n receptors exerts an analgesic effect in neuropathic pain: the 5HT\n7\n receptor agonists, AS-19 and MSD-5a inhibits neuropathic pain-associated behaviors (mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia).\n \n\nThe antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects were fully achieved by using low doses (1 mg/kg) of the selective 5HT\n7\n, receptor agonist AS-19.\n\n\n• In contrast, blocking of 5HT\n7\n receptors promotes neuropathic pain: the 5HT\n7\n receptor antagonist SB-258719 exacerbates the behavioral manifestations of neuropathic pain (mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia).\n\nThe selective 5HT\n7\n receptor antagonist SB-258719 enhances allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain conditions after nerve injury. In addition, SB-258719 precipitated the appearance behavioral manifestations of neuropathic pain in sham-operated mice.\n\n\n• \nAnalgesic effect by the 5HT\n7\n receptor agonist and algesic effect by the 5HT\n7\n receptor antagonist can be pharmacologically reversed by coadministering both compounds\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results reveal the involvement of the 5-HT\n7\n receptor in the control of neuropathic pain and point to a new potential therapeutic use of 5-HT\n7\n receptor agonists as analgesics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4: Chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve (CCI-SN)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDirect 5-HT\n7\n receptor stimulation by AS-19 and 5a-MSD exerts clear-cut antihyperalgesic effects in sciatic nerve-ligatured rats (\nFig. 25\n and \n26\n, respectively).

An estimated 50% of diabetics develop some form of peripheral neuropathy, with approximately 32% suffering from chronic, severe, and unremitting pain. The most frequently described manifestation of diabetic neuropathy is a distal \nsymmetrical polyneuropathy.Type\n 1 diabetic patients are diagnosed when beta-cell destruction is almost complete.\n\nStreptozotocin is a toxin that has direct cytotoxic effects on β-cells when injected at high doses. STZ-treated mice lead to inflammatory autoimmune-mediated destruction of β-cells, developing overt diabetes, with marked hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, polydipsia, and polyphagia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing the streptozotocin treatment the response threshold (g) is reduced considerably (\nFig. 33\n). A dose-response effect of AS-19 was observed, with a clear antiallodynic effect in diabetic mice at 10 mg/kg (\nFig 33\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 7: Carrageenan model of inflammatory pain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na) Effect of AS-19 on mechanical allodynia (measured by automatic von Frey) in acute inflammatory conditions (3 h post-carrageenan)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThree hours after carrageenan injection, prominent swelling was observed in the affected ipsilalateral paw. Edema was accompanied by mechanical allodynia, as evidenced by reduced paw withdrawal threshold in the ipsilateral carrageenan-treated paw (right paw) respect to the control contralateral paw (left paw) in vehicle-treated mice (\nFig 34\n). Systemic administration of AS-19 (10 mg/Kg, s.c.) 30 minutes before the von Frey test significantly reduced carrageenan-induced mechanical allodynia.\n\n\n \n\n\nb) Effect of AS-19 on thermal hyperalgesia In chronic inflammatory conditions (4 days post-carrageenan)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFour days after carrageenan injection, swelling was still remarkable and thermal hyperalgesia was shown in the ipsilateral paw. A single injection with AS-19 (10 mg/Kg, s.c.) on day 4th significantly inhibited thermal hyperalgesia in the affected paw (\nFig. 35\n). In fact, no thermal hyperalgesia was observed in mice receiving AS-19, as the withdrawal latency of the affected carrageenan-treated paw was not significantly different from that of the unaffected contralateral paw of the vehicle group.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 8: Formalin model of inflammatory pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of AS-19 after formalin injection\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAS-19 (5 mg/kg i.p.) exerted a significant decrease in paw licking time in the second phase of formalin test (\nFig. 36\n)."

Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to a compound for use in treatment of muscle wasting disorders, more particularly treating muscle wasting in a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder, by administering to the subject a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) compound or its pharmaceutical acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate or N-oxide.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMuscle wasting refers to the progressive loss of muscle mass and/or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles, including the skeletal or voluntary muscles, which control movement, cardiac muscles, which control the heart (cardiomyopathics), and smooth muscles. Chronic muscle wasting is a chronic condition (i.e. persisting over a long period of time) characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass, weakening and degeneration of muscle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein degradation by catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation, an unusually low rate of protein synthesis, or a combination of both. Muscle protein catabolism, whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis, leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscle wasting is associated with chronic, neurological, genetic or infectious pathologies, diseases, illnesses or conditions. These include Muscular Dystrophies such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Myotonic Dystrophy; Muscle Atrophies such as Post-Polio Muscle Atrophy (PPMA); Cachexias such as Cardiac Cachexia, AIDS Cachexia and Cancer Cachexia, malnutrition, Leprosy, Diabetes, Renal Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cancer, end stage Renal failure, Sarcopenia, Emphysema, Osteomalacia, HIV Infection, AIDS, and Cardiomyopathy,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, other circumstances and conditions are linked to and can cause muscle wasting. These include chronic lower back pain, advanced age, central nervous system (CNS) injury, peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury, chemical injury, central nervous system (CNS) damage, peripheral nerve damage, spinal cord damage, chemical damage, burns, disuse deconditioning that occurs when a limb is immobilized, long term hospitalization due to illness or injury, and alcoholism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn intact androgen receptor (AR) signalling pathway is crucial for appropriate development of skeletal muscles. Furthermore, an intact AR-signalling pathway increases lean muscle mass, muscle strength and muscle protein synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscle wasting, if left unabated, can have dire health consequences. For example, the changes that occur during muscle wasting can lead to a weakened physical state that is detrimental to an individual's health, resulting in increased susceptibility to infraction and poor performance status. In addition, muscle wasting is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from cachexia and AIDS. Innovative approaches are urgently needed at both the basic science and clinical levels to prevent and treat muscle wasting, in particular chronic muscle wasting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO 98/53826A\n \n (University of Tennessee Research Corp.) discloses various compounds having androgen-receptor activity and their use in a method of hormone therapy in order to effect a change in an androgen-dependent condition, such as sarcopenia and the suppression of spermatogenesis.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a compound represented by a structure of formula I:\n\n \n \n\nwherein\n\n \n \n \nG is O or S;\n \nX is O;\n \nT is OH, OR, -NHCOCH\n3\n, or NHCOR\n \nZ is NO\n2\n, CN, COOH, COR, NHCOR or CONHR;\n \nY is CF\n3\n, F, I, Br, Cl, CN, C(R)\n3\n or Sn(R)\n3\n;\n \nQ is alkyl, halogen, CF\n3\n, CN, C(R)\n3\n, Sn(R)\n3\n, N(R)\n2\n, NHCOCH\n3\n, NHCOCF\n3\n, NHCOR, NHCONHR, NHCOOR, OCONHR, CONHR, NHCSCH\n3\n, NHCSCF\n3\n, NHCSR, NHSO\n2\nCH\n3\n, NHSO\n2\nR OR, COR, OCOR, OSO\n2\nR, SO\n2\nR, SR; or Q together with the benzene ring to which it is attached is a fused ring system represented by structure A, B or C:\n\n \n \n \n \nR is alkyl, haloalkyl, dihaloalkyl, trihaloalkyl, CH\n2\nF, CHF\n2\n, CF\n3\n, CF\n2\nCF\n3\n, phenyl, halogen, alkenyl, OH or an aromatic group having at least one carbocyclic aromatic group or heterocyclic aromatic group; and\n \nR\n1\n is CH\n3\n, CH\n2\nF, CHF\n2\n, CF\n3\n, CH\n2\nCH\n3\n, or CF\n2\nCF\n3\n;\n \n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate or \nN\n-oxide thereof, for use in treating a muscle wasting disorder caused by Muscular Dystrophy, a Muscular Atrophy, X-linked spinal-bulbar Muscular Atrophy (SBMA), a Cachexia, Renal disease, or end stage Renal failure.\n    \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the compound is of formula II:\n\n \n \n\nwherein X, Y, Z and Q are as defined above and G is O, T is OH and R1 is CH\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the compound is a compound of formula I or II wherein Y is CF\n3\n.

In one embodiment, the muscle wasting condition or disorder is a chronic muscle wasting condition or disorder. \"chronic muscle wasting\" is defined herein as the chronic (i.e. persisting over a long period of time) progressive loss of muscle mass and/or to the chronic progressive weakening and degeneration of muscle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein breakdown or degradation, by muscle protein catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation, an unusually low rate of protein synthesis, or a combination of both. Protein catabolism or depletion, whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis, leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting. The term \"catabolism\" has its commonly known meaning in the art, specifically an energy burning form of metabolism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscle wasting can occur as a result of a pathology, disease, condition or disorder. The pathology, illness, disease or condition may be chronic. The pathology, illness, disease or condition may be genetic. As described herein, the pathologies, diseases, conditions or disorders for which the compounds and compositions of the present invention are administered are those that directly or indirectly produce a wasting (i. e. loss) of muscle mass, that is a muscle wasting disorder, as defined in the claims.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese are Muscular Dystrophies; Muscle Atrophies; SBMAs, Cachexias, Renal disease and end stage Renal failure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe muscular dystrophies are genetic diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal or voluntary muscles that control movement. The muscles of the heart and some other involuntary muscles are also affected in some forms of muscular dystrophy. The major forms of Muscular Dystrophy are: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Becker Muscular Dystrophy, Limb-girdle Muscular Dystrophy, Facioscapulhumeral Muscular Dystrophy, Congenital Muscular Dystrophy, Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy, Distal Muscular Dystrophy and Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscular Dystrophy can affect people of all ages. Although some forms first become apparent in infancy or childhood, others may not appear until middle age or later. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is the most common kind of Muscular Dystrophy affecting children. Myotonic Dystrophy is the most common of these diseases in adults.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscle Atrophy is characterized by wasting away or diminution of muscle and a decrease in muscle mass. For example, Post-Polio Muscular Atrophy is a muscle wasting that occurs as part of the Post-Polio Syndrome (PPS). The Atrophy includes weakness, muscle fatigue, and pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of Muscular Atrophy is X-linked spinal-bulbar Muscular Atrophy (SBMA-also known as Kennedy s Disease). This disease arises from a defect in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome, affects only males, and its onset is in adulthood. Because the primary disease cause is an androgen receptor mutation, androgen replacement is not a current therapeutic strategy. There are some investigational studies where exogenous testosterone propionate is being given to boost the levels of androgen with hopes of overcoming androgen insensitivity and perhaps provide an anabolic effect. Still, use of supraphysiological levels of testosterone for supplementation will have limitations and other potentially serious complications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCachexia is weakness and a loss of weight caused by a disease or as a side effect of illness. Cardiac Cachexia, i. e. a muscle protein wasting of both the cardiac and skeletal muscle, is a characteristic of congestive heart failure. Cancer Cachexia is a syndrome that occurs in patients with solid tumours and haematological malignancies and is manifested by weight loss with massive depletion of both adipose tissue and lean muscle mass. Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Cachexia is a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) associated myopathy and/or muscle weakness/wasting that is a relatively common clinical manifestation of AIDS. Individuals with HIV-associated myopathy or muscle weakness or wasting typically experience significant weight loss, generalized or proximal muscle weakness, tenderness, and muscle atrophy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs contemplated herein, this invention provides a class of compounds which are Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM) compounds. These compounds, which are useful in preventing and treating muscle wasting disorders as defined in the claims are classified as androgen receptor agonists (AR agonists), partial agonists or androgen receptor antagonists (AR antagonists).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA receptor agonist is a substance which binds receptors and activates them. A receptor partial agonist is a substance which binds receptor and partially activate them. A receptor antagonist is a substance which binds receptors and inactivates them. As demonstrated herein, the SARM compounds of the present invention have a tissue-selective effect, wherein one agent may be an agonist, partial agonist and/or antagonist, depending on the tissue. For example, the SARM compound may stimulate muscle tissue and at the same time inhibit prostate tissue. In one embodiment, the SARMs which are useful in treating and preventing muscle wasting disorders as defined in the claims are AR agonists, and are, therefore, useful in binding to and activating the AR. In another embodiment, the SARMs are AR antagonists, and are, therefore, useful in binding to and inactivating the AR. Assays to determine whether the compounds of the present invention are AR agonists or antagonists are well known to a person skilled in the art. For example, AR agonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to maintain and/or stimulate the growth of AR containing tissue such as prostate and seminal vesicles, as measured by weight. AR antagonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds inhibit the growth of AR containing tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention can be classified as partial AR agonist/antagonists. The SARMs are AR agonists in some tissues, to cause increased transcription of AR-responsive genes (e.g. muscle anabolic effect). In other tissues, these compounds serve as competitive inhibitors of testosterone/DHT on the AR to prevent agonistic effects of the native androgens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe SARM compounds of the present invention bind either reversibly or irreversibly to the androgen receptor. The SARM compounds may bind reversibly to the androgen receptor. The SARM compounds may bind irreversibly to the androgen receptor. The compounds of the present invention may contain a functional group (affinity label) that allows alkylation of the androgen receptor (i.e. covalent bond formation). Thus, in this case, the compounds bind irreversibly to the receptor and, accordingly, cannot be displaced by a steroid, such as the endogenous ligands DHT and testosterone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides safe and effective compounds for use in methods for treating a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder as defined in the claims. In one embodiment, the subject is a mammalian subject. In another embodiment, the subject is a human subject. In another embodiment, the subject is a male subject. In another embodiment, the subject is a female subject.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention provides a compound for use in treating a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder as defined in the claims by administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound and a pharmaceutical acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"pharmaceutical composition\" means a \"therapeutically effective amount\" of the active ingredient, i. e. the SARM compound, together with a pharmaceutical acceptable carrier or diluent. A \"therapeutically effective amount\" as used herein refers to that amount which provides a therapeutic effect for a given condition and administration regimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions containing the SARM agent can be administered to a subject by any method known to a person skilled in the art, such as parenterally, paracancerally, transmucosally, transdermally, intramuscularly, intravenously, intradermally, subcutaneously, intraperitonealy, intraventricularly, intracranially, intravaginally or intratumorally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered orally, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for oral administration, i.e. as a solid or a liquid preparation. Suitable solid oral formulations include tablets, capsules, pills, granules, pellets. Suitable liquid oral formulations include solutions, suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oils. In one embodiment of the present invention, the SARM compounds are formulated in a capsule. In accordance with this embodiment, the compositions of the present invention comprise in addition to the SARM active compound and the inert carrier or diluent, a hard gelating capsule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered by intravenous, intraarterial, or intramuscular injection of a liquid preparation. Suitable liquid formulations include solutions, suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oils. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intravenously, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intravenous administration. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intraarterially, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intraarterial administration. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intramuscularly, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intramuscular administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered topically to body surfaces, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for topical administration. Suitable topical formulations include gels, ointments, creams, lotions, drops. For topical administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, are prepared and applied as solutions, suspensions, or emulsions in a physiologically acceptable diluent with or without a pharmaceutical carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered as a suppository, for example a rectal suppository or a urethral suppository. Further, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered by subcutaneous implantation of a pellet. In a further embodiment, the pellet provides for controlled release of SARM agent over a period of time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compound may be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see \nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n); \nTreated al., in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez- Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989\n); \nLopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327\n; see generally ibid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein \"pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents\" are well known to those skilled in the art. The carrier or diluent may be a solid carrier or diluent for solid formuations, a liquid carrier or diluent for liquid formulations, or mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid carriers/diluents include a gum, a starch (e.g. corn starch, pregeletanized starch), a sugar (e.g., lactose, mannitol, sucrose, dextrose), a cellulosic material (e.g. microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose), a cyclodextrin, an acrylate (e.g. polymethylacrylate), calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide, talc, or mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor liquid formulations, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions or oils. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Examples of oils are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, and fish-liver oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParenteral vehicles (for subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, or intramuscular injection) include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's and fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers such as those based on Ringer's dextrose. Examples are sterile liquids such as water and oils, with or without the addition of a surfactant and other pharmaceutical acceptable adjuvants. In general, water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, and glycols such as propylene glycols or polyethylene glycol are preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Examples of oils are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, and fish-liver oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the compositions may further comprise binders (e. g. acacia, cornstarch, gelatin, carbomer, ethyl cellulose, guar gum, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, povidone), disintegrating agents (e. g. cornstarch, potato starch, alginic acid, silicon dioxide, croscarmelose sodium, crospovidone, guar gum, sodium starch glycolate), buffers (e. g., Tris-HCI., acetate, phosphate) of various pH and ionic strength, additives such as albumin or gelatin to prevent absorption to surfaces, detergents (e. g. , Tween 20, Tween 80, Pluronic F68, bile acid salts), protease inhibitors, surfactants (e. g. sodium lauryl sulfate), permeation enhancers, solubilising agents (e. g., glycerol, polyethylene glycerol), anti-oxidants (e. g., ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite, butylated hydroxyanisole), stabilizers (e. g. hydroxypropylcellulose, hyroxypropylmethyl cellulose), viscosity increasing agents (e. g. carbomer, colloidal silicon dioxide, ethyl cellulose, guar gum), sweetners (e. g. aspartame, citric acid), preservatives (e. g., Thimerosal, benzyl alcohol, parabens), lubricants (e. g. stearic acid, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate), flow-aids (e. g. colloidal silicon dioxide), plasticizers (e. g. diethyl phthalate, triethyl citrate), emulsifiers (e. g. carbomer, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate), polymer coatings (e. g. poloxamers or poloxamines), coating and film forming agents (e. g. ethyl cellulose, acrylates, polymethacrylates) and/or adjuvants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be controlled release compositions, i. e. compositions in which the SARM compound is released over a period of time after administration. Controlled or sustained release compositions include formulation in lipophilic depots (e. g. fatty acids, waxes, oils).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe composition may be an immediate release composition, i. e. a composition in which all of the SARM compound is released immediately after administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition may be delivered in a controlled release system. For example, the agent may be administered using intravenous infusion, an implantable osmotic pump, a transdermal patch, liposomes, or other modes of administration. A pump may be used (see Langer, supra; \nSefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14: 201 (1987\n);\nBuchwald et al., Surgery 88: 507 (1980\n); \nSaudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321: 574 (1989\n). Further, polymeric materials can be used. Furthermore, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity to the therapeutic target, i. e. , the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e. g. , \nGoodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984\n). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by \nLanger (Science 249: 1527-1533 (1990\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may also include incorporation of the active material into or onto particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polglycolic acid, hydrogels, etc, or onto liposomes, microemulsions, micelles, unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles, erythrocyte ghosts, or spheroplasts.) Such compositions will influence the physical state, solubility, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso of use in the invention are particulate compositions coated with polymers (e. g. poloxamers or poloxamines) and the compound coupled to antibodies directed against tissue-specific receptors, ligands or antigens or coupled to ligands of tissue-specific receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso of use in the invention are compounds modified by the covalent attachment of water-soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol, copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyproline. The modified compounds are known to exhibit substantially longer half-lives in blood following intravenous injection than do the corresponding unmodified compounds (Abuchowski \net al.,\n 1981; Newmark \net al.,\n 1982; and Katre \net al.,\n 1987). Such modifications may also increase the compound's solubility in aqueous solution , eliminate aggregation, enhance the physical and chemical stability of the compound, and greatly reduce the immunogenicity and reactivity of the compound. As a result, the desired in vivo biological activity may be achieved by the administration of such polymer-compound abducts less frequently or in lower doses than with the unmodified compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation of pharmaceutical compositions which contain an active component is well understood in the art, for example by mixing, granulating, or tablet-forming processes. The active therapeutic ingredient is often mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutical acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient. For oral administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are mixed with additives customary for this purpose, such as vehicles, stabilizers, or inert diluents, and converted by customary methods into suitable forms for administration, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard or soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. For parenteral administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are converted into a solution, suspension, or emulsion, if desired with the substances customary and suitable for this purpose, for example, solubilizers or other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn active component can be formulated into the composition as neutralized pharmaceutical acceptable salt forms. Pharmaceutical acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide or antibody molecule), which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, mandelic. Salts formed from the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases asisopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the present use, the salts of the SARM will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other salts may, however, be used in the preparation of the compounds according to the invention or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic: acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs defined herein, \"contacting\" means that the SARM compound of the present invention is introduced into a sample containing the enzyme in a test tube, flask, tissue culture, chip, array, plate, microplate, capillary, or the like, and incubated at a temperature and time sufficient to permit binding of the SARM to the enzyme. Methods for contacting the samples with the SARM or other specific binding components are known to those skilled in the art and may be selected depending on the type of assay protocol to be run. Incubation methods are also standard and are known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"contacting\" may mean that the SARM compound of the present invention is introduced into a subject receiving treatment, and the SARM compound is allowed to come in contact with the androgen receptor in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"treating\" includes preventative as well as disorder remitative treatment. As used herein, the terms \"reducing\", \"suppressing\" and \"inhibiting\" have their commonly understood meaning of lessening or decreasing.\n\nAs used herein, the term \"progression\" means increasing in scope or severity, advancing, growing or becoming worse. As used herein, the term \"recurrence\" means the return of a disease after a remission.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"administering\" refers to bringing a subject in contact with a SARM compound of the present invention. As used herein, administration can be accomplished in vitro, i. e. in a test tube, or in vivo, i. e. in cells or tissues of living organisms, for example humans. In one embodiment, the present invention encompasses administering the compounds of the present invention to a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the SARM compound is administered as the sole active ingredient. However, also encompassed is administration of the SARM compounds in combination with one or more therapeutic agents. These agents include: LHRH analogs, reversible antiandrogens, antiestrogens, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), anticancer drugs, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, aromatase inhibitors, progestins, other selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMS), testosterone, anabolic steroids, growth hormones or agents acting through other nuclear hormone receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in certain embodiments, the SARM may be in combination with any one of the following: an LHRH analog; a reversible antiandrogen; an antiestrogen; a SERM; an anticancer drug; a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor; an aromatase inhibitor; a progestin; another SARM; testosterone; an anabolic steroid; a growth hormone; or an agent acting through other nuclear hormone receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious embodiments of dosage ranges are contemplated by this invention.

Compound V is a powerful anabolic agent that maintains the mass of the levator ani in castrated male rats.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMyosin heavy chain (MHC) is the predominant protein in skeletal muscle encoded by a multigene family expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner [\nAdams G.R., Zeng S.A., Baldwin K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 276:R954-R961, 1999\n]. To further demonstrate the importance of compound V in muscle, the effects of this nonsteroidal anabolic agent directly in skeletal muscle by monitoring the expression of MHC subtypes using RT-PCR has been demonstrated. In steady state, mRNA expression usually parallels the pattern of MHC protein expression. Because transcription of MHC mRNA occurs in advance of MHC protein translation, and the increased sensitivity of RT-PCR compared to western blotting, rapid changes in mRNA expression can be detected and used to analyze the subtle dynamic effects of muscle anabolism [\nWright C., Haddad F., Qin A. X., Baldwin K.M. J. Appl. Phys. 83 (4):1389-1396, 1997\n].\n\n\n \n\n\nMethods:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nRat muscle tissue was harvested in 5 volumes of RNA later solution (Ambion, cat.# 7020) and stored at 4°C until used for RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated in the FastPrep FP120 instrument (Qbiogene) using RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion, cat # 1914) in combination with FastRNA green tubes (Qbiogene, cat.# 6040-600) at settings for time at 45 sec and speed at 6.5. 1 ug of total RNA was used for reverse transcription using Retroscript kit (Ambion, cat# 1710). The mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 60 min, followed by 10 min at 92 °C, and then chilled on ice and used in PCR reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelatively quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze expression of MHC mRNA in rat musculus masseter (MM) and levator ani (LA). As an internal standard 18S ribosomal RNA was used (QuantumRNA classic 18S Internal Standard, Ambion, cat.# 1716). Linear range of PCR reaction for all primers as well as optimal ratio of 18S primers to competitors to achieve the same level of amplification as the genes of interest was determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimers were obtained from IDT based on the recently published design (\nWright et al., J. Appl. Phys. 1997;83:1389\n), with the following sequence:\n\n \n \n \n5'GAAGGCCAAGAAGGCCATC3' (SEQ ID NO.1).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nTo design a perfect match of upstream primers for the neonatal sequence, slight modifications of the above common primer was necessary (Table1). The optimal annealing temperature of these degenerate common primers was, however, unchanged, and they were used in the same manner as the common primer as 5'-oligonucleotides for PCR reactions. The 3'-oligonucleotides used in the PCR reactions were designed from the 3'-untranslated regions of each of the different MHC genes, where the sequences are highly specific for each MHC gene [Wright et al 1997]:\n\n \nTable 1. \nOligonucleotide primers used for PCR amplification reactions\n \n \n \n \nMHC subtype\n \nCommon Primer (SEQ ID NO.1)\n \nAntisense Primer\n \n \n \n \nIIb\n \n5'GAAGGCCAAGAAGGCCATC3'\n \n5'GTGTGATTTCTTCTGTCACC3' (SEQ ID NO.2)\n \n \n \nIIx\n \n5'GAAGGCCAAGAAGGCCATC3'\n \n5'GGTCACTTTCCTGCTTTGGA3' (SEQ ID NO.3)\n \n \n \nneonatal\n \n5'GAAGGCCAAGAAGGCCATC3'\n \n5'GCGGCCTCCTCAAGATGCGT3' (SEQ ID NO.4)\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche, cat# 1146165), 200 µM of each dNTP (Invitrogen, cat.#R725-01), 0.2 µM each MHC primer (IDT), 1 µl of cDNA from reverse transcription reaction and 4 µl of 18S primers: competitors mixture were used in 50 µl PCR reaction. Amplification was carried out in PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research, Inc.) with an initial denaturation step of 3 min at 94 °C, followed by optimized number of cycles for the MHC primer pair, with each cycle consisting of 45 sec at 94 °C, 60 sec at 48 °C, 90 sec 72 °C, and a final step of 5 min at 72°C. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis [20-µl aliquots of a 50-µl PCR reaction loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel (in 1x Tris-Acetate-EDTA buffer) containing 0.2µg/ml ethidium bromide] to visualize the PCR products. Gels were photographed under ultraviolet (UV) light using Polaroid instant film number 57 to generate an image of the gel. Pictures were scanned and the volume of the optical density (OD) of a DNA band was determined by the Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics), and the background was subtracted (so local background was directly proportional to the amount of DNA over a wide range). Intensity (volume of the OD) of the MHC band was divided by the intensity of the control fragment, thereby correcting for any differences in the efficiency of the PCR reactions. The content of each experimental group MHC gene was calculated as a percentage of the MHC value in the control group (Table 2).\n\n\n \n\n\nResults:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe masseter muscles dissected from untreated intact female rats was set as the control level (representing 100%) of MHC IIb expression (see histogram in \nFigure 1a\n). Intact female rats treated with androgens were evaluated against the untreated controls for the effect of treatment on MHC IIb from masseter. The results indicate that testosterone propionate has a positive effect on masseter muscle where it increased transcription of MCH type IIb to 142% of untreated control (\nFigure 1b\n). Compound V was found to have a similar effect where it increased level of MHC IIb transript to 124% (\nFigure 1b\n). Actual untransformed data (PCR results) is shown in \nFigure 1a\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn these same rats, the levator ani was dissected and evaluated for the expression pattern of MHC family members. The data indicate that all animals treated with androgens (TP or Compound V) for a period of 14- and 28-days had a muscle present in the location expected for the levator ani, and further characterization of this tissue by RT-PCR demonstrates presence of MHC type IIb and very little expression of MHC subtypes IIx and the neonatal isoform. The SDS-PAGE as well as immunoblotting with a MHC type II specific antibody revealed a single band of apparent molecular weight of about 200 kDa. These results are consistent with the presence of a levator ani muscle [\nTalmadge R. J. and Roy R.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 75(5): 2337-2340, 1993\n].\n\n \nTable 2.

Intact male rats treated with androgens were evaluated against the untreated controls for the effect of treatment on MHC IIb from masseter or gastrocnemius. The results indicate that testosterone propionate has a positive effect on masseter muscle where it increased transcription of MHC type IIb to 120(±14)% of untreated control (\nFigure 2\n - Top). Compound V was also anabolic in muscle, with an increase in MHC type IIb to 117(±13)% (\nFigure 2\n - Top). In gastrocnemius muscle, similar results were observed. Testosterone propionate has a positive effect on gastrocnemius muscle where it increased transcription of MHC type IIb to 139(±47)% of untreated control (\nFigure 2\n - Bottom). Compound V was also anabolic in muscle, with an increase in MHC type IIb to 162(±54)% (\nFigure 2\n - Bottom).\n\n\n \n\n\nConclusions:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThese results demonstrate that both the selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) as exemplified by compound V and TP have direct anabolic effects on the musculoskeletal system in intact female and male rats as measured by a net increase in the expression of mRNA for MHC. Additionally, treatment with these anabolic agents for a period of 14- and 28-days resulted in muscular hypertrophy of the levator ani. Testosterone has been recognized as an anabolic androgen for several decades. It has been demonstrated herein, that the selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) as exemplified by Compound V is an orally bioavailable nonsteroidal agent with tissue selective anabolic effects in male rats and which increases muscle mass. The selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) as described hereinabove, may be used in the treatment of a muscle wasting disorder as defined in the claims.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacologic Activity and Tissue-Selectivitv of Compounds V and VI in Rats of Varying Hormonal Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPrevious studies by Applicants demonstrated that Compound V is a potent and efficacious selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) in castrated male rats. To provide a representative model of the vast majority of men that will eventually receive this drug, Applicants completed a preclinical study to compare the pharmacologic effects and tissue-selectivity of Compound V, Compound VI - another potent SARM, and testosterone propionate (TP) in male rats of varying hormonal status. Male rats with normal testicular function (i.e., intact with no surgical manipulation) were included to examine the effects of Compound V on animals with normal blood levels of testosterone. Male rats that received unilateral orchidectomy (i.e., surgical removal of one testis) were included to examine the effects of Compound V on animals with slight androgen depletion. Male rats that received bilateral orchidectomy (i.e., surgical removal of both testes) were included to examine the effects of Compounds V and VI on androgen-deficient animals.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMethods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds V and VI were synthesized and characterized in the laboratory of Dr. Duane Miller at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan Biosciences (Indianapolis, IN). The animals were maintained on a 12-h cycle of light and dark with food and water available \nad libitum.\n All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University, and conformed to the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH publication #85-23, revised 1985). Immature male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 187 to 214 g were randomly distributed into 9 groups of 5 animals. One day before the initiation of drug treatment, groups 4 through 6 and groups 7 through 9 received unilateral or bilateral orchidectomy, respectively, via a midline scrotal incision. \nGroups\n 1 through 3 did not undergo surgery. All drugs given to animals were freshly prepared as solutions in polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG 300). Groups 4 and 7 received treatment with vehicle alone (i.e., PEG 300). Animals in \ngroups\n 3, 6, and 9 received testosterone propionate (TP, 0.5 mg/day) via implantation of subdermal osmotic pumps (Model 2002, Durect Corporation, Palo Alto, CA). Animals in \n \ngroups\n \n 2, 5, and 8 received Compound V or Compound VI (0.5 mg/day) via implantation of subdermal osmotic pumps. After 14 days of drug treatment, rats were weighed, anesthetized, and sacrificed. The ventral prostates, seminal vesicles, and levator ani muscle were removed and weighed. Osmotic pumps were also removed from animals to check for correct pump operation. The weights of all organs were normalized to body weight, and analyzed for any statistically significant differences between groups using single-factor ANOVA with the alpha value set \na priori\n at p < 0.05. The weights of prostates and seminal vesicles were used as indices for evaluation of androgenic activity, and the levator ani muscle weight was used to evaluate the anabolic activity. Statistical analyses of parameters from complete blood count or serum chemical profiling, wherever applicable, were performed by single-factor ANOVA with the alpha value set \na priori\n at p<0.05.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nResults:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs shown in Table 3 and \nFigure 3\n, in intact animals, Compound V decreased the size of the prostate to 79% and, of that observed in control animals (\nFig 3A\n), with no statistically significant changes in the size of the seminal vesicles (\nFig 3B\n) or levator ani muscle (\nFig 3C\n). The pharmacologic effects and tissue selectivity of Compound V were more obvious in hemi-orchidectomized animals (Table 3 and \nFigure 4\n). Compound V decreased the size of the prostate (\nFig 4A\n) and seminal vesicles (\nFig 4B\n) to 75% and 79%, respectively, and increased the size of the levator ani muscle (\nFig 4C\n) to 108% of that observed in untreated hemi-orchidectomized animals. These observations demonstrate that Compound V acts as a partial agonist in prostate and seminal vesicles and as a full agonist in levator ani muscle. No adverse pharmacologic effects were observed. Similarly, as shown in Table 3 and in \nFigures 5\n and \n6\n, in castrated animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTable 3.

Compound V led to significant decreases in prostate weights in intact and hemi-orchidectomized animals, and was less effective than TP at increasing the weight of the prostate in castrated animals. Similar pharmacologic effects were noted in the seminal vesicles (another organ generally considered as a marker of androgenic effects), with the exception that Compound V had no effect on the weight of the seminal vesicles in intact animals. Compound V treatment led to significant increases in the weight of the levator ani muscle in hemi-orchidectomized and castrated animals. These effects were greater than those observed with TP. These data demonstrate the tissue-selective pharmacologic effects of Compound V. It is important to note that these effects were observed in the absence of any significant changes in plasma concentrations of FSH, LH and testosterone (not shown). In summary, these data show that Compound V elicits an optimal pharmacological profile in male animals, identifying it as the first member of a new class of orally bioavailable and tissue-selective SARMs.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacologic Activity and Tissue-Selectivity of selected halogenated Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators in Rats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds VI-X in Table 5 were synthesized and characterized in the laboratory of Dr. Duane Miller at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tissue-selectivity and pharmacologic effects of Compounds VI-X were determined as described above in Example 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 5 shows the chemical structures and binding affinities of Compounds VI-IX.

Compounds VI-IX all had an anabolic effect, increasing the weight of the levator ani muscle in a dose-dependent manner. Compounds VI, VIII and IX (\nFigures 7 A, C and D\n, respectivetly) increased the weight of the levator ani muscle to values close to those of the intact controls. The effect of compound VII (\nFigure 7B\n) was even more pronounced - increasing the weight of the levator ani muscle to values exceeding those of intact controls. There were no statistically significant changes in the sizes of the prostate or seminal vesicles. These data demonstrate the tissue-selective pharmacologic effects of Compounds VI-IX.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacologic Activity and Tissue-Selectivity of Compound X in Rats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompound X (Table 6) was synthesized and characterized in the laboratory of Dr. Duane Miller at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tissue-selectivity and pharmacologic effects of Compound X were determined as described above in Examples 2 and 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 6 shows the chemical structure and binding affinity of Compound X.
