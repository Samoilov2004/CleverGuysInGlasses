Description\n\n\n\n\n DESCRIPTION \n\n\nIMIDAZOQUINOLINES WHICH ACT VIA TOLL - LIKE RECEPTORS (TLR) TECHNICAL FIELD \n\n\n The present invention relates to imidazoquinoline derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy. \n\n\nBACKGROUND ART \n\n\nThe immune system is comprised of innate and acquired immunity, both of which work cooperatively to protect the host from microbial infections. It has been shown that innate immunity can recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns through toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed on the cell surface of immune cells. Recognition of invading pathogens then triggers cytokine production (including interferon alpha (IFNa)) and upregulation of co- stimulatory molecules on phagocytes, leading to modulation of T cell function. Thus, innate immunity is closely linked to acquired immunity and can influence the development and regulation of an acquired response. TLRs are a family of type I transmembrane receptors characterized by an NH2-terminal extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain (LRR) and a COOH-terminal intracellular tail containing a conserved region called the Toll/ILl receptor (TIR) homology domain. The extracellular domain contains a varying number of LRR, which are thought to be involved in ligand binding. Eleven TLRs have been described to date in humans and mice. They differ from each other in ligand specificities, expression patterns, and in the target genes they can induce. \n\n\nLigands which act via TLRs (also known as immune response modifiers (IRMS)) have been developed, for example, the imidazoquinoline derivatives described in US Patent No. 4689338 which include the product Imiquimod for treating genital warts, and the adenine derivatives described in WO 98/01448 and WO 99/28321. \n\n\nDISCLOSURE OF INVENTION \n\n This patent application describes a class of imidazoquinoline compounds having immuno-modulating properties which act via TLR7 that are useful in the treatment of viral or allergic diseases and cancers.

They may for example contain from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Examples of Ci-Ce alkyl groups/ moieties include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, ieri-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl or n-octyl. Similarly, an alkylene group/moiety may be linear or branched. Examples of Ci-C\n6\n alkylene groups /moieties include methylene, ethylene, n-propylene, n-butylene, n-pentylene, n-hexylene, 1-methylethylene, 2-methylethylene,\n\n\n1,2-dimethylethylene, 1-ethy .ethylene, 2-ethylethylene, 1-, 2- or 3-methylpropylene and 1-, 2- or 3-ethylpropylene. An alkenyl or alkynyl group is an unsaturated linear or branched group, containing for example from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. It should be appreciated that, in formula (I), if more than one substituent contains a group or moiety S(0)\np\n or S(0)\nq\n or if a substituent contains two or more S(0)\np\n or S(0)\nq\n, then each \"p\" or each \"q\" independently represents an integer 0, 1 or 2. For example, if R\n7\n represents a C3-C6 cycloalkyl group substituted by two groups S(0)\nq\nR\nn\n, then each \"q\" may be the same or different. In the same way, each group \"R\n11\n\", where there is more than one such group, may be the same or different. Cycloalkyl or carbocycle groups are rings containing, for example, from 3 to 8 carbon atoms and are saturated. \n\n\nHeterocyclic groups are rings which may be saturated, partially unsaturated or unsaturated, and contain from 3 to 20 atoms, at least one and suitably from 1 to 4 atoms are heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen. Rings may be monocyclic, fused, bridged, or spiro bicyclic heterocyclic ring system(s). Monocyclic heterocyclic rings contain from about 3 to 12 ring atoms, with from 1 to 5 heteroatoms selected from N, O and S, and suitably from 3 to 7 member atoms, in the ring. Bicyclic heterocycles contain from 7 to 17 member atoms, suitably 7 to 12 member atoms, in the ring. Bicyclic heterocyclic (s) rings may be fused, spiro, or bridged ring systems. \n\n\nExamples of heterocyclic groups which are saturated or partially saturated include cyclic ethers (oxiranes) such as ethyleneoxide, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and substituted cyclic ethers. Heterocycles containing nitrogen include, for \n\n example, azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine, tetrahydrotriazine, tetrahydropyrazole, and the like. Typical sulfur containing heterocycles include tetrahydrothiophene, dihydro-l,3-dithiol-2-yl, and hexahydrothiepin-4-yl.

For heterocycles containing sulfur, the oxidized sulfur heterocycles containing SO or SO2 groups are also included. Examples include the sulfoxide and sulfone forms of tetrahydrothiophene. A suitable value for a heterocyclyl group which bears 1 or 2 oxo or thioxo substituents is, for example, 2-oxopyrrolidinyl, 2-thioxopyrrolidinyl, 2-oxoimidazolidinyl, 2-thioxoimidazolidinyl, \n\n\n2-oxopiperidinyl, 2,5-dioxopyrrolidinyl, 2,5-dioxoimidazolidinyl or 2 , 6 -dioxopiperidinyl . \n\n\nHeterocyclic groups which are aromatic in nature are referred to as \"heteroaryr groups. These groups are aromatic mono-, bi-, or polycyclic heterocyclic ring incorporating one or more (for example 1-4) heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S. The term heteroaryl includes both monovalent species and divalent species. Examples of heteroaryl groups include furyl, pyrrolyl, thienyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, 1,3,5-triazenyl, benzofuranyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, benzothienyl, benzoxazolyl, benzimidazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzothiazolyl, indazolyl, purinyl, benzofurazanyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, cinnolinyl, pteridinyl, naphthyridinyl, carbazolyl, phenazinyl, benzisoquinolinyl, pyridopyrazinyl, thieno[2,3-b]furanyl, 2H-furo[3,2-b]-pyranyl, 5H-pyrido[2,3-d]-o-oxazinyl, lH-pyrazolo[4,3-d]-oxazolyl, 4H-imidazo[4,5-d]thiazolyl, pyrazino[2,3-d]pyridazinyl, imidazo[2, 1-b] thiazolyl, imidazo[l,2-b][l,2,4]triazinyl. \"Heteroaryl\" also covers ring systems wherein at least one ring is an aromatic ring containing 1 or more heteroatoms selected from O, S and N and one or more of the other rings is a non-aromatic, saturated or partially unsaturated ring optionally containing one or more heteroatoms selected from O, S and N, for example l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l,8-naphthyridinyl, l,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrido[2,3-b]pyrazinyl and \n\n 3 , 4 - dihy dro - 2 H-pyrido [ 3 , 2 - b] [ 1 , 4 ] oxaziny 1. \n\n\nA preferred heteroaryl group is a 5-7 member aromatic ring or 6,6- or 6,5-fused bicyclic ring containing one or more ring heteroatoms selected from N, S, O.

For example, R\n1\n represents isopropyl, and R\nb\n and R\nc\n represent hydrogen. \n\n In a particular embodiment, Z\n1\n is a C2-6 alkylene, in particular a straight chain C\n2\n-\n6\n alkylene group, for example a straight chain C2-\n4\n alkylene group. A particular example of Z\n1\n is n-propylene.

(For the avoidance of doubt, within the definition of X\n1\n, the first atom appearing is linked to the Z\n1\n group. Thus, when X\n1\n is CONR\n5\n, the carbon atom is linked to the Z\n1\n group and the nitrogen atom is linked to the Y\n1\n group.) As will be understood, when X\n1\n represents >N-COR\n5\n, the nitrogen is attached to Z\n1\n and Y\n1\n. The same applies when X\n1\n is >NCONR\n5\nR\n5a\n.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, χι represents NR\n5\n, >N-COR\n5\n, or >N-CONR\nS\nR\n5\na. \n\n\n Where R\n6\n is present in any group X\n1\n, it is suitably selected from hydrogen or C 1-6 alkyl such as methyl. \n\n\n A particular example of X\n1\n is a group NR\n5\n. \n\n\n Another particular example of an X\n1\n group is >N-COR\n5\n. \n\n\n Another particular example of an X\n1\n group is >N-CONR\n5\nR\n5a\n. \n\n\n Particular examples of R\n5\n groups include hydrogen or a Ci-6alkyl optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from NR\n7\nR\n8\n or R\n9\n, where R\n7\n, R\n8\n and R\n9\n are as defined above. \n\n\n For instance, R\n5\n represents a C1-C6 alkyl or C1-C4 alkyl optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from NR\n7\nR\n8\n or R\n9\n, where R\n7\n, R\n8\n and R\n9\n are as defined above. \n\n\nIn particular, R\n5\n is a C1-C6 alkyl, particularly C1-C3 alkyl such as methyl, ethyl or n-propyl, optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from NR R\n8\n where R\n7\n and R\n8\n are as defined above. \n\n\n In yet a further embodiment, R\n5\n is a Ci-C\n6\n alkylene which may be linked to a carbon atom within a C2-C6 alkylene group Z\n1\n so as to form a saturated 4-7 membered nitrogen containing ring.

The reactions may conveniently be carried out in an organic solvent such as acetonitrile, l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone or N,N-dimethylformamide at a temperature, for example, in the range from 0 to 150°C. The reaction may be suitably effected by the presence of a base (e.g. sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate). \n\n\nIn process (b), the reaction may conveniently be carried out in an organic solvent such as l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, 1 ,2-dichloroethane or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature, for example, in the range from 0 to 100°C. \n\n\nCompounds of formula (II) may be prepared as illustrated in the reaction scheme A: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme A \n\n\nwhere R\na\n, m, R\n3\n and Z\n1\n are as defined in relation to formula (I) and P is a protecting group. The compound of formula (B) is prepared by nitration of a compound of formula (A). Suitable nitrating agents include nitric acid. The reaction is suitably effected in an organic solvent such as an organic acid such as propionic acid. The reaction may be carried out at elevated temperature, for example from room \n\n temperature to 150° C. \n\n\nCompounds of formula (C) may be prepared by reacting the compound of formula (B) with a mixture of thionyl chloride and DMF to give the aryl chloride which can then be displaced with an aminoalkanol. The chlorination is suitably carried out in a solvent such as dichloromethane, preferably at elevated temperature. The displacement of the chloride with an aminoalkanol, is suitably carried out in the presence of a base for example triethylamine or Hunigs base and in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, at a temperature in the range from 0 to 40°C. \n\n\nCompounds of formula (D) are prepared by adding a suitable protecting group to the hydroxy terminal group. This can be effected using conventional chemistry as outlined for example in 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis' by Theodora Green (publisher: John Wiley & Sons). A suitable protecting group P for the hydroxy group is, for example, an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl, or a silyl group for example iert- butyl(dimethyl) silyl. \n\n\n Compounds of formula (D) may also be prepared by adding a protected aminoalkanol to a compound of formula (B), using the same conditions as above. \n\n\nThe compound of formula (D) is then reduced to form a compound of formula (E). Suitable reducing agents include iron powder in a suitable solvent such as acetic acid or sodium borohydride in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as a 15% of nickel chloride in a suitable solvent such as methanol or hydrogenation. Suitable hydrogenation conditions include the use of hydrogen gas at elevated pressure, for example at 2-5Bar in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as a 1% platinum on carbon catalyst. The reaction is suitably effected at room temperature. Compounds of formula (E) are then cyclised to form the compound of formula (F). Suitable cyclisation conditions include reaction with an acid chloride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine in a suitable solvent such as N-methyl pyrrolidinone or an acid in the presence of a coupling reagent such as 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-l-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphat purum (HATU) in the presence of a base such as triethylamine in a suitable \n\n solvent such as N-methyl pyrrolidine. Alternatively the compound of formula (F) may be prepared by cyclisation reaction with an orthoester in a suitable solvent such as N-methyl pyrrolidinone in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as 10mol% of toluensulphuric acid. The reaction is suitably effected at elevated temperatures, for example from 30-150°C. \n\n\nCompounds of formula (F) may be oxidised to compounds of formula (G) by reaction with an oxidising agent such as meia-chloroperoxybenzoic acid or hydrogen peroxide. The reaction is suitably effected in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or ethanol at reduced temperatures for example in the range of -10°C to room temperature. \n\n\nSubsequently, the compound of formula (G) is reacted with p-toluenesulphonyl chloride and aqueous ammonia to convert it to the compound of formula (H). The reaction is suitably effected in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane. Temperatures in the range from 0-40°C and conveniently at room temperature are suitably employed. \n\n\nDeprotection of the resultant compound of formula (H) yields a compound of formula (J). The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon. \n\n\nThe product of formula (J) is then converted to a compound of formula (II) by formation of a suitable leaving group such as halo, for instance chloro or bromo, or an activated alcohol such as a mesylate or tosylate. For example, the chloride may be formed by reacting the compound of formula (J) with thionyl chloride, preferably in a solvent such as dichloromethane at a temperature between 20-40°C. Compounds of formulae (IV) and (IVA) may be prepared by an analogous route as \n\n illustrated in Scheme B. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n M N Q \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (IVA) S \n\n\n Scheme B \n\n\nwhere R\na\n, m, R\n3\n and Z\n1\n are as defined in relation to formula (I), R\n5b\n is as defined in relation to formula (IVA) and P\n1\n is an amino protecting group. \n\n\nCompounds of formula (K) or (L) may be prepared by reacting the compound of \n\n formula (B) with a mixture of thionyl chloride and DMF to give the aryl chloride which can then be displaced with a di-amino alkane, or a protected form thereof. The chlorination is suitably carried out in a solvent such as dichlorome thane, preferably at elevated temperature. The displacement of the chloride with a di-amino alkane, or a protected form thereof, is suitably carried out in the presence of a base for example triethylamine or Hunigs base and in an organic solvent such as dichlorome thane, at a temperature in the range from 0 to 40°C. \n\n\nWhere a diaminoalkane is used, a compound of formula (K) is prepared which may be subsequently protected to form a compound of formula (L) using conventional methods. \n\n\nA suitable protecting group P\n1\n is for example, a group such as an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or i-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl. A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group. \n\n\nReduction of the product of formula (L) using for example analogous conditions to those described above for the reduction of the compound of formula (D), will yield a compound of formula (M). This in turn may be cyclised to a compound of formula (N) using conditions analogous to those described above for the cyclisation of the compound of formula (E), oxidised to a compound of formula (Q) using conditions analogous to those described above for the oxidation of the compound of formula (F), and the product reacted with p-toluenesulphonyl chloride and aqueous ammonia to form the compound of formula (S) using for example conditions analogous to those described above for the preparation of the compound of formula (H). Deprotection of the resultant compound of formula (S) yields a compound of formula (IV). The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an alkoxycarbonyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an alkoxycarbonyl group such as a i-butoxycarbonyl group may be \n\n removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulfuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A phthaloyl protecting group which be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine. \n\n\nSuitably in Scheme B, R\n5\n is hydrogen, which may be converted to a different R\n5\n group later, for example once the compound of formula (IV) has been converted to a compound of formula (I). \n\n\nCompounds of formula (VI) where X\n3\n is NR\n5\n may be prepared by reacting compounds of formula (II) with compounds of formula (XI): \n\n\nR\n5\nNH\n2\n \n\n\n(XI) \n\n\n Coupling conditions will be similar to those described above for the reactions (a) and (c). Compounds of formula (I) may be converted to other compounds of formula (I) using conventional methods. For example, in process (h) above, compounds where R\n5\n is hydrogen may be reacted with compounds of formula (X): \n\n\nI -COR\n5\n \n\n\n (X) where L\n4\n is a leaving group such as halo for instance chloro, and R\n5\n is defined in relation to formula (I). The reaction is suitably carried out in an organic solvent such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide and /or dichloromethane optionally in the presence of a base such as triethylamine. Temperatures in the range from 0 to 150°C are suitably employed. \n\n\nSimilarly, oxidation of compounds of formula (I) during process (d) above can be carried out under conventional conditions, for example by reaction with an oxidising agent such as raeia-chloroperoxybenzoic acid or hydrogen peroxide. The reaction is suitably effected in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or \n\n ethanol at temperatures for example in the range of 0-40°C. \n\n\nCompounds of formula (IX) above where X\n4\n is an activated acid such as an acid as set out in Scheme C. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n H\n2\nN-Z\n1\n-COOR\nx\n \n\n\n T \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme C \n\n\nwhere R\na\n, m, R\n3\n and Z\n1\n are as defined in relation to formula (I), R\nx\n is an alkyl such as methyl or ethyl, or ester protecting group. \n\n\n Conditions used for the reactions shown in Scheme C are generally similar to those used in analogous steps in Scheme B. A compound of formula Y may be converted to a compound of formula Z with a base such as lithium or sodium hydroxide, in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or methanol and water. \n\n Alternatively the ester may be hydrolysed under acidic conditions such as aqueous HC1, preferably at elevated temperature. A compound of formula (IX) may be prepared from a compound of formula (Z) by activation of the acid to an acyl halide, such as chloride with a reagent such as thionyl chloride then treated with a compound of formula (III). The formation of the acid chloride may conveniently be carried out neat or in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane at a temperature, for example, in the range from 0 to 80°C. The activated acid is then treated with a compound of formula (III), the reaction may conveniently be carried out in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide, with a base such as triethylamine at a temperature, for example, in the range from 0 to 80°C. Alternatively the acid may be activated with a coupling agent such as 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or benzotriazol- 1-yloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate. A compound of formula (I) in which X\n1\n is NR\n5\n and R\n5\n is hydrogen may be converted to a corresponding compound of formula (I) in which R\n5\n is -COCH2NR\n7\nR\n8\n by reaction with chloroacetyl chloride followed by an amine of formula R\n7\nR\n8\nNH where R\n7\n and R\n8\n are as defined above. The first stage is suitably carried out in an organic solvent such as chloroform, dichloromethane or acetonitrile, with one equivalent of chloroacetyl chloride. Temperatures in the range from 0 to 50°C are suitably employed. In the second stage the reaction is suitably carried out in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or acetonitrile, with excess of an amine R\n7\nR\n8\nNH. Temperatures in the range from 0°C to 100°C are suitably employed. \n\n\nA compound of formula (I) in which X\n1\n is NR\n5\n and R\n5\n is hydrogen may also be converted to a corresponding compound of formula (I) in which R\n5\n is a C1-C6 alkyl (e.g. propyl) group substituted by NR\n7\nR\n8\n by reaction with a compound of formula (XX), L\n10\n-R\n5\n, where L\n10\n is a leaving group such as halo for instance chloro and R\n5\n is as defined above. The reaction is suitably carried out in an organic solvent siich as dimethylformaldehyde or acetonitrile, with preferably one equivalent of formula (XX) compound optionally in the presence of a base such as triethylamine and a salt such as sodium iodide or potassium iodide. Temperatures in the range from 0°C to 100°C are suitably employed. \n\n A compound of formula (I) in which X\n1\n is NR\n5\n and R\n5\n is a Ci-C6 alkyl (e.g. propyl) group substituted by NR\n7\nR\n8\n may also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (XII): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (XII) \n\n\nwhere L\n5\n is a leaving group for example chloro or mesylate and m R\na\n, R\n1\n, n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, A, Z\n1\n and Y\n1\n are as defined above, with an amine of formula (XXI), R\n7\nR\n8\nNH, where R\n7\n and R\n8\n are as defined above. The reaction may be carried out using an excess of the amine R\n7\nR\n8\nNH in an organic solvent such as DMF or dioxane at a temperature in the range of, for example, 40\nb\nC- 150°C. Sodium iodide may be used as an additive in the reaction. \n\n\nA compound of formula (XII) may be prepared from a corresponding compound of formula XIII): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (XIII) \n\n\n The alcohol may be converted into a leaving group using conventional methods, for example, by reaction with thionyl chloride in an appropriate solvent such as DCM at a temperature from 20- 100°C. \n\n\nA compound of formula (XIII) may be formed using the route in scheme A and the chemistry above. \n\n\nCompounds of formulae (III), (V), (VII), (VIII), A, (X), (XI), (XX) and (XXI) are known compounds or can be prepared from known compounds by conventional \n\n methods. \n\n\nIt will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the processes of the present invention certain functional groups such as hydroxyl or amino groups in the reagents may need to be protected by protecting groups. Thus, the preparation of the compounds of formula (I) may involve, at an appropriate stage, the removal of one or more protecting groups. \n\n\nThe protection and deprotection of functional groups is described in 'Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry', edited by J.W.F. McOmie, Plenum Press (1973) and 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis', 3\nrd\n edition, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience (1999). \n\n\nIn another embodiment of the invention there is provided an intermediate compound of the formula (Γ): \n\n\n \n\n wherein Z\n1\n, Y\n1\n, R\na\n, R\nb\n, R\nc\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, m and n are as defined in Claim 1; and R\n1\n' represents hydrogen, Ci-Cs alkyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl, or a 3- to 8-membered saturated heterocyclic ring group comprising a O atom, wherein R\nr\nis optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from halogen, cyano, hydroxyl and C1-C3 alkoxy; \n\n\nor a salt thereof, for synthesis of a compound of formula (I) or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt. \n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) above may be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, preferably an acid addition salt such as a hydrochloride, hydrobromide, trifluoroacetate, sulphate, phosphate, acetate, fumarate, maleate, tartrate, lactate, citrate, pyruvate, succinate, oxalate, methane sulphonate or p-toluenesulphonate. Preferred salts include dimethane sulphonic acid, \n\n monosaccharin, disaccharin, di-l-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (di-xinafoate), dibenzenesulphonic acid (di-besylate), mandelic and fumaric acid salts. \n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) are capable of existing in stereoisomeric forms. It will be understood that the invention encompasses the use of all geometric and optical isomers (including atropisomers) of the compounds of formula (I) and mixtures thereof including racemates. The use of tautomers and mixtures thereof also form an aspect of the present invention. Enantiomerically pure forms are particularly desired. \n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts have activity as pharmaceuticals, in particular as modulators of toll-like receptor (especially TLR7) activity, and is expected to provide an immuno-modulator effect and thus be useful as a therapeutic and prophylactic agent for diseases associated with an abnormal immune response (e.g. autoimmune diseases and allergic diseases) and various infections and cancers which are required for activation of an immune response.

bacterial diseases such as tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium, leprosy; other infectious diseases, such as fungal diseases, chlamydia, Candida, aspergillus, cryptococcal meningitis, Pneumocystis carnii, cryptosporidiosis, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, trypanosome infection and leishmaniasis. \n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts have antedrug properties. An antedrug is defined as an active synthetic derivative that is designed to undergo biotransformations to a readily excretable less active form upon entry into the systemic circulation, therefore minimizing systemic side-effects. Thus, on administration, a compound of the invention is rapidly degraded enzymatically to yield a degradation product having a substantially reduced medical effect. A medical effect as defined herein means a pharmacological activity of the compound of the invention, including specifically interferon inducing activity and/or suppression of IL4/IL5 production activity. \n\n\nThe medical effect of the degradation product is preferably 10 times, more preferably 100 times less than that of the compound of the invention (i.e. parent compound). \n\n\nThe pharmacological activity can be measured using methods known in the art, preferably using in vitro evaluation methods such as commercially available ELISA kits or the biological assay described in Example 7 of the present specification. \n\n Furthermore a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R\n1\n represents branched chain alkyl, Γ, or R\nB\n and R\nC\n represent methyl show good chemical stability. \n\n\nThus, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically- acceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore defined for use in therapy. In a further aspect, the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore defined in the manufacture of a medicament for use in therapy. \n\n\nIn the context of the present specification, the term \"therapy\" also includes \"prophylaxis\" unless there are specific indications to the contrary. The terms \"therapeutic\" and \"therapeutically\" should be construed accordingly. \n\n\nProphylaxis is expected to be particularly relevant to the treatment of persons who have suffered a previous episode of, or are otherwise considered to be at increased risk of, the disease or condition in question. Persons at risk of developing a particular disease or condition generally include those having a family history of the disease or condition, or those who have been identified by genetic testing or screening to be particularly susceptible to developing the disease or condition. \n\n\nIn particular, the compounds of the invention may be used in the treatment of asthma, COPD, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, cancer, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, HPV, bacterial infections or a skin condition as listed hereinbefore (for example, atopic dermatitis, actinic keratosis, pre-cancerous skin lesions or cutaneous vial infections). Compound (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may also be useful as a vaccine adjuvant. \n\n\nThe anti-cancer treatment defined hereinbefore may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve, in addition to the compound of the invention, conventional surgery or radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

For example, the daily dosage of the compound of the invention, if inhaled, may be in the range from 0.05 micrograms per kilogram body weight (pg/kg) to 100 micrograms per kilogram body weight (pg/kg). For example, a dose of about 0.1 to 100 pg/kg such as a dose of about 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 or 100 pg/kg. Alternatively, if the compound is administered orally, then the daily dosage of the compound of the invention may be in the range from 0.01 micrograms per kilogram body weight (pg/kg) to 100 milligrams per kilogram body weight (mg/kg). \n\n\n The dosages mentioned herein refer to the dose of Compound (I) as the free base. Accordingly, the equivalent dose of a particular salt will be higher because of the increased molecular weight of the salt compared to the free base. \n\n\n The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be used on their own but will generally be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition in which the formula (I) compound/ salt (active ingredient) is in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable pharmaceutical formulations are described in, for example, \"Pharmaceuticals-The Science of Dosage Form Designs\", M. E. Aulton, Churchill Livingstone, 1988. Depending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will \n\n preferably comprise from 0.05 to 99 %w (per cent by weight), more preferably from 0.05 to 80 %w, still more preferably from 0.10 to 70 %w, and even more preferably from 0.10 to 50 %w, of active ingredient, all percentages by weight being based on total composition. \n\n\nThe present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore defined, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. \n\n\nThe invention further provides a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention which comprises mixing a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore defined with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. \n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be administered topically (including to the skin, eye, buccal cavity, respiratory tract or nasally) in the form, e.g., of creams, solutions, suspensions, heptafluoroalkane (HFA) aerosols and dry powder formulations, for example, formulations administered from a suitable device such as a pressurised meter ed dose inhaler (pMDI), a dry powder inhaler (DPI) or nebuliser, such as the inhaler device known as the Turbuhaler™; or systemically, e.g. by oral administration in the form of tablets, capsules, syrups, powders or granules; or by parenteral administration in the form of a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion for injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion); or by rectal administration in the form of suppositories. \n\n\nDry powder formulations and pressurized HFA aerosols of the compounds of the invention (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts) may be administered by oral or nasal inhalation. For inhalation, the compound is desirably finely divided. The finely divided compound preferably has a mass median diameter of less than 10 micrometres (μπι), and may be suspended in a propellant mixture with the assistance of a dispersant, such as a C8-C20 fatty acid or salt thereof, (for example, oleic acid), a bile salt, a phospholipid, an alkyl saccharide, a perfluorinated or polyethoxylated surfactant, or other pharmaceutically acceptable dispersant. \n\n For nasal administration the compound is suitably dissolved in an aqueous medium, which is suitably buffered to maintain the pH at a desired level. \n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered by means of a dry powder inhaler. The inhaler may be a single or a multi dose inhaler, and may be a breath actuated dry powder inhaler. \n\n\nOne possibility is to mix the finely divided compound of the invention with a carrier substance, for example, a mono-, di- or polysaccharide, a sugar alcohol, or another polyol. Suitable carriers are sugars, for example, lactose, glucose, raffinose, melezitose, lactitol, maltitol, trehalose, sucrose, mannitol; and starch. Alternatively the finely divided compound may be coated by another substance. The powder mixture may also be dispensed into hard gelatine capsules, each containing the desired dose of the active compound. Another possibility is to process the finely divided powder into spheres which break up during the inhalation procedure. This spheronized powder may be filled into the drug reservoir of a multidose inhaler, for example, that known as the Turbuhaler™ in which a dosing unit meters the desired dose which is then inhaled by the patient. With this system the active ingredient, with or without a carrier substance, is delivered to the patient. \n\n\nFor oral administration the compound of the invention may be admixed with an adjuvant or a carrier, for example, lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol; a starch, for example, potato starch, corn starch or amylopectin; a cellulose derivative; a binder, for example, gelatine or polyvinylpyrrolidone; and/or a lubricant, for example, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, polyethylene glycol, a wax, paraffin, and the like, and then compressed into tablets. If coated tablets are required, the cores, prepared as described above, may be coated with a concentrated sugar solution which may contain, for example, gum arabic, gelatine, talcum and titanium dioxide. Alternatively, the tablet may be coated with a suitable polymer dissolved in a readily volatile organic solvent. \n\n\nFor the preparation of soft gelatine capsules, the compound of the invention may be admixed with, for example, a vegetable oil or polyethylene glycol. Hard gelatine capsules may contain granules of the compound using either the \n\n above-mentioned excipients for tablets. Also liquid or semisolid formulations of the compound of the invention may be filled into hard gelatine capsules. \n\n\nLiquid preparations for oral application may be in the form of syrups or suspensions, for example, solutions containing the compound of the invention, the balance being sugar and a mixture of ethanol, water, glycerol and propylene glycol. Optionally such liquid preparations may contain colouring agents, flavouring agents, saccharine and /or carboxymethylcellulose as a thickening agent or other excipients known to those skilled in art. \n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered in conjunction with other compounds used for the treatment of the above conditions. \n\n\nThe invention therefore further relates to combination therapies wherein a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition or formulation comprising a compound of the invention is administered concurrently or sequentially or as a combined preparation with another therapeutic agent or agents, for the treatment of one or more of the conditions listed. \n\n\nIn particular, for the treatment of the inflammatory diseases COPD, asthma and allergic rhinitis the compounds of the invention may be combined with agents such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors such as anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies (for example Remicade, CDP-870 and adalimumab) and TNF receptor immunoglobulin molecules (such as Enbrel); non-selective cyclo-oxygenase COX-l/COX-2 inhibitors whether applied topically or systemically (such as piroxicam, diclofenac, propionic acids such as naproxen, flubiprofen, fenoprofen, ketoprofen and ibuprofen, fenamates such as mefenamic acid, indomethacin, sulindac, azapropazone, pyrazolones such as phenylbutazone, salicylates such as aspirin), COX-2 inhibitors (such as meloxicam, celecoxib, rofecoxib, valdecoxib, lumarocoxib, parecoxib and etoricoxib); glucocorticosteroids (whether administered by topical,oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intra-articular routes); methotrexate, lefunomide; hydroxychloroquine, d-penicillamine, auranofin or other parenteral or oral gold preparations.

MS:ESI 633 (M+ l) \n\n\nBiological Assay \n\n\nHuman TLR7 assay \n\n\n The most common variant sequence of human TLR7 (represented by the EMBL \n\n sequence AF240467) was cloned into the mammalian cell expression vector pUNO and transfected into a HEK293 cell line already stably expressing the pNiFty2-SEAP reporter plasmid; integration of the reporter gene was maintained by selection with the antibiotic zeocin. Transfectants with stable TLR7 expression were selected using the antibiotic blasticidin. In this reporter cell-line, expression of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) is controlled by an NFkB/ELAM-1 composite promoter comprising five NFkB sites combined with the proximal ELAM-1 promoter. TLR signaling leads to the translocation of NFkB and activation of the promoter results in expression of the SEAP gene. TLR7-specific activation was assessed by determining the level of SEAP produced following overnight incubation of the cells at 37°C with the standard compound in the presence of 0.1%(v/v) dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Concentration dependent induction of SEAP production by compounds was expressed as the concentration of compound which produced half of the maximal level of SEAP induction for that compound (EC50). \n\n\n\n\nCompound hTLR7 EC50 (nM) Compound hTLR7 EC50 (nM)\n\n\nExample 1 Not tested.

Accordingly, in one embodiment according to the invention there is provided a compound of the formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as described herein other than the compounds: \n\n\nEthyl \n\n\n 2-(3-((N-(2-(4-amino-2-(2-methoxyethyl)-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-l-yl)ethyl)-2- (diethylamino)acetamido)methyl)phenoxy)acetate; \n\n\nMethyl \n\n\n 2-(3-((N-(2-(4-amino-2-(2-methoxyethyl)-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-l-yl)ethyl)-2- \n\n (diethylamino) acetamido) methyl) phenoxy) acetate ; \n\n\nIsopropyl \n\n\n 2-(3-((N-(2-(4-amino-2-(2-methoxyethyl)-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-l-yl)ethyl)-2-\n\n\n(die thylamino) acetamido) methyl) phenoxy) acetate ; \n\n\n Ethyl \n\n\n 2-(3-((N-(2-(4-amino-2-(2-methoxyethyl)-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-l-yl)ethyl)-2- (diethylamino)acetamido)methyl)phenoxy)-2-methylpropanoate; and Methyl 2-(3-((N-(2-(4-amino-2-(2-methoxyethyl)-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-l-yl)ethyl)-2- (diethylamino)acetamido)methyl)phenoxy)-2-methylpropanoate. \n\n\nEffect of the compounds on antigen-induced pulmonary inflammation in a rat asthma model \n\n\n Rats were sensitized and challenged to produce allergic airway inflammation in a similar manner to that described by Underwood et al (British Journal of Pharmacology 2002; 137: 263-275, 2002). Male Brown Norway rats were sensitized subcutaneously with ovalbumin (OVA) and aluminum hydroxide on day 0, and challenged with aerosolized OVA solution on day 14. The test compound was administered twice intratracheally 24 hours before and 24 hours after the OVA-challenge and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected 48 hours after the OVA-challenge. Then eosinophils and Th2 cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13) in the BALF were measured to evaluate efficacy of the test compounds of this invention. The results obtained are shown in the following table. \n\n\n\n\nEosinophils and Th2 cytokines in BALF \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n * Eosinophil(Cells/BALF), IL-5(pg/mL BALF) and IL- 13(pg/mL BALF): data shows inhibition(%) to OVA-Challenge control. \n\n\n \"No effect\" in the Table means that the test compound showed the almost same level of IL-5/IL- 13 induction as the OVA-challenge control."
