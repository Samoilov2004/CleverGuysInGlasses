GPCRs have usually seven transmembrane domains. Upon binding of a ligand to an extra-cellular portion or fragment of a GPCR, a signal is transduced within the cell that results in a change in a biological or physiological property or behaviour of the cell. GPCRs, along with G-proteins and effectors (intracellular enzymes and channels modulated by G-proteins), are the components of a modular signaling system that connects the state of intra-cellular second messengers to extra-cellular inputs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGPCR genes and gene products can modulate various physiological processes and are potential causative agents of disease. The GPCRs seem to be of critical importance to both the central nervous system and peripheral physiological processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe GPCR protein superfamily is represented in five families: Family I, receptors typified by rhodopsin and the beta2-adrenergic receptor and currently represented by over 200 unique members; Family II, the parathyroid hormone/calcitonin/secretin receptor family; Family III, the metabotropic glutamate receptor family, Family IV, the CAMP receptor family, important in the chemotaxis and development of \nD. discoideum\n; and Family V, the fungal mating pheromone receptor such as STE2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG proteins represent a family of heterotrimeric proteins composed of α, β and γ subunits, that bind guanine nucleotides. These proteins are usually linked to cell surface receptors (receptors containing seven transmembrane domains) for signal transduction. Indeed, following ligand binding to the GPCR, a conformational change is transmitted to the G protein, which causes the α-subunit to exchange a bound GDP molecule for a GTP molecule and to dissociate from the βγ-subunits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe GTP-bound form of the α, β and γ-subunits typically functions as an effector-modulating moiety, leading to the production of second messengers, such as cAMP (e.g. by activation of adenyl cyclase), diacylglycerol or inositol phosphates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGreater than 20 different types of α-subunits are known in humans. These subunits associate with a small pool of β and γ subunits. Examples of mammalian G proteins include Gi, Go, Gq, Gs and Gt. G proteins are described extensively in Lodish et al., Molecular Cell Biology (Scientific American Books Inc., New York, N.Y., 1995; and also by Downes and Gautam, 1999, The G-Protein Subunit Gene Families. \nGenomics \n62:544-552), the contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKnown and uncharacterized GPCRs currently constitute major targets for drug action and development. There are ongoing efforts to identify new G protein coupled receptors which can be used to screen for new agonists and antagonists having potential prophylactic and therapeutic properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore than 300 GPCRs have been cloned to date, excluding the family of olfactory receptors. Mechanistically, approximately 50-60% of all clinically relevant drugs act by modulating the functions of various GPCRs (Cudermann et al., \nJ. Mol. Med., \n73:51-63, 1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemerinR, also called Dez [Sequence ID Nos: 1 (human polynucleotide sequence, \nFIG. 1\n); 2 (human amino acid sequence, \nFIG. 2\n); 3 (mouse polynucleotide sequence, \nFIG. 3\n); 4 (mouse amino acid sequence, \nFIG. 3\n); 5 (rat polynucleotide sequence; \nFIG. 4\n); and 6 (rat amino acid sequence, \nFIG. 4\n)] has been described as an orphan G protein coupled receptor related to GPR-1 (38% overall amino acid identity), C3a receptor (38%), C5a anaphylatoxin receptor (36%) and formyl Met-Leu-Phe receptors (35%). ChemerinR is more distantly related to the chemokine receptors subfamily (Methner A, Hermey G, Schinke B, Hermans-Borgmeyer I. (1997) \nBiochem Biophys Res Commun \n233:336-42; Samson M, Edinger A L, Stordeur P, Rucker J, Verhasselt V, Sharron M, Govaerts C, Mollereau C, Vassart G, Doms R W, Parmentier M. (1998) \nEur J Immunol \n28:1689-700). ChemerinR transcripts were found to be abundant in monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages, with or without treatment with LPS. Low expression can also be detected by reverse transcription-PCR in CD4+ T lymphocytes. In situ hybridization experiments also showed that the receptor was differentially regulated during development, with a prominent expression in developing osseous and cartilaginous tissues. It was also detectable in the adult parathyroid glands, indicating a possible function in phosphocalic metabolism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gene encoding ChemerinR was assigned by radiation hybrid mapping to the g21.2-21.3 region of \nhuman chromosome\n 12, outside the gene clusters identified so far for chemoattractant receptors. ChemerinR was tested in fusion assays for potential coreceptor activity by a range of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV viral strains. Several SIV strains (SIVmac316, SIVmac239, SIVmac17E-Fr and SIVsm62A), as well as a primary HIV-1 strain (92UG024-2) efficiently used ChemerinR as a co-receptor. This receptor therefore appears to be a coreceptor for immunodeficiency viruses that does not belong to the chemokine receptor family. It is also a putative chemoattractant receptor and it could play an important role in the recruitment or trafficking of leukocyte cell populations. ChemerinR, by its specific expression in macrophages and immature dendritic cells, appears as a particularly attractive candidate receptor involved in the initiation and early regulation of immune responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTIG2 (Tazarotene-induced \ngene\n 2, thereafter Preprochemerin [Sequence ID Nos: 7 (human Preprochemerin polynucleotide sequence, \nFIG. 6\n); 8 (human amino acid sequence, \nFIG. 6\n); 9 (mouse polynucleotide sequence, \nFIG. 7\n); and 10 (mouse amino acid sequence, \nFIG. 7\n)] was identified as a cDNA, the expression of which is up-regulated by the treatment of skin raft cultures by the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) beta/gamma-selective anti-psoriatic synthetic retinoid, tazarotene [AGN 190168/ethyl 6-[2-(4,4-dimethylthiochroman-6-yl)-ethynyl]nicotinate] (Nagpal S, Patel S, Jacobe H, DiSepio D, Ghosn C, Malhotra M, Teng M, Duvic M, Chandraratna R A. (1997) \nJ Invest Dermatol \n109: 91-5). The retinoid-mediated up-regulation in the expression of Preprochemerin was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. The Preprochemerin is located at 17p13.3 position, a region associated with pancretic tumorigenesis. The Preprochemerin cDNA is 830 bp long and encodes a putative protein product of 163 amino acids. Preprochemerin is expressed and induced by tazarotene in culture only when keratinocytes and fibroblasts form a tissue-like 3-dimensional structure. RAR-specific retinoids were also shown to increase Preprochemerin mRNA levels. In contrast, neither RXR-specific retinoids nor 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increased Preprochemerin levels in these cells. Preprochemerin is also expressed at high levels in nonlesional psoriatic skin but at lower levels in the psoriatic lesion and its expression is up-regulated in psoriatic lesions after topical application of tazarotene. In addition, Preprochemerin has been shown to be dramatically upregulated by 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 and dexamethasone in osteoclast-supporting stromal cells (Adams A E, Abu-Amer Y, Chappel J, Stueckle S, Ross F P, Teitelbaum S L, Suva L J. (1999) \nJ Cell Biochem \n74: 587-95).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages are professional antigen-presenting cells that play key roles in both innate and adaptive immunity. DCs and macrophages are attracted to infection and inflammatory sites by a variety of factors, among which chemokines constitute the largest group so far (Caux, C. et al. (2002) \nTransplantation \n73: S7-S11, Mellman, I. and Steinman, R M (2001) \nCell \n106:255-258). It has been shown that tremendous functional, morphological and metabolic diversity exists among these cell populations. One of these functional differences is the expression of differential sets of chemoattractant receptors, which is responsible for the selective recruitment of specific cell subpopulations, according to their lineage, origin and maturation state (Caux, C. et al. (2002) \nTransplantation \n73: S7-S11). Many tumor types have been demonstrated to attract macrophages and DCs through the direct or indirect production of chemoattractant factors (Coussens, L M and Werb, Z. (2002) \nNature \n420:860-867, Vicari, A P and Caux, C. (2002) \nCytokine Growth Factors Rev. \n13:143-154). These include a number of CC-chemokines, such as MCP-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDCs are specialized antigen-presenting cells located throughout the human body. DCs function as sentinels of the immune system. They serve as essential link between innate and adaptive immune systems and induce both primary and secondary immune responses (Palucka, K A and Banchereau, J. (1999) \nJ. Clin. Immunol. \n19:12-25). They traffic from the blood to the tissues where, while immature, they capture antigens. They then leave the tissues and move to the draining lymphoid organs where, coverted into mature DCs, they initiate the immune response by activating naïve CD8\n+\n cells, which seek out and kill the antigen-expressing tumor cells. Chemokines are important effectors of the regulation of DCs recruitment, and depending on the chemokine gradient released at the site of injury, different DC populations will be recruited. It is expected that the type of resulting immune response will likely be dependent on the DC subpopulation recruited and thus on the chemokines secreted (Caux, C. et al. (2002) \nTransplantation \n73: S7-S11).\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention is based on the discovery that Chemerin, a polypeptide resulting from the proteolytic processing of the Proprechemerin precursor, is a natural ligand of the ChemerinR, and binds specifically to ChemerinR.

The interaction is useful for screening assays for agents that modulate the interaction and thus the function of ChemerinR. The interaction between Chemerin and ChemerinR also provides for the diagnosis of conditions involving dysregulated receptor activity. The interaction also provides for therapeutic approaches for treatment of a disease or disorder.\n\n\n \nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nFor convenience, the meaning of certain terms and phrases used in the specification, examples, and appended claims, are provided below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polypeptide” refers to a polymer in which the monomers are amino acids and are joined together through peptide or disulfide bonds. It also refers to either a full-length naturally-occurring amino acid sequence or a fragment thereof between about 8 and about 500 amino acids in length. Additionally, unnatural amino acids, for example, β-alanine, phenyl glycine and homoarginine may be included. Commonly-encountered amino acids which are not gene-encoded may also be used in the present invention. All of the amino acids used in the present invention may be either the D- or L-optical isomer. The L-isomers are preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “ChemerinR polypeptide” refers to a polypeptide having two essential properties: 1) a ChemerinR polypeptide has at least 70% amino acid identity, and preferably 80%, 90%, 95% or higher, including 100% amino acid identity, to SEQ ID NO: 2; and 2) a ChemerinR polypeptide has ChemerinR activity, i.e., the polypeptide binds a Chemerin polypeptide or a functional fragment thereof. Optimally, a “ChemerinR polypeptide” also has ChemerinR signaling activity as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “a Chemerin polypeptide” refers to a polypeptide having at least 30% or higher identity to a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 73, SEQ ID NO: 61 and SEQ ID Nos. 92-97, and the defined polypeptide specifically binds to and activates a signaling activity of a ChemerinR polypeptide. Preferrably, the polypeptide is at least 50%, or higher identity to a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 73, SEQ ID NO: 61 and SEQ ID Nos. 92-97. Preferrably, the polypeptide is at least 60%, or 70%, or 80%, or 85%, or higher identity to a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 73, SEQ ID NO: 61 and SEQ ID Nos. 92-97. The term “specifically binds” means that the Chemerin polypeptide has an EC\n50\n, IC\n50\n, or a K\nd \nof 100 nM or less. “Chemerin polypeptide” also refers to a fragment of a polypeptide meeting the preceding definition, wherein the fragment retains at least 50% of the binding activity and level of signaling activation of the full length polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 14. A Chemerin also includes a anolog, variant or some short polypeptide from C-terminal end of the Chemerin (SEQ ID NO 14) as depicted in \nFIGS. 8\n, and \n16\n, \n20\n \na \nand \n20\n \nb \nthat binds specifically to a ChemerinR polypeptide. A Chemerin polypeptide can comprise additions, insertions, deletions or substitutions relative to SEQ ID NO: 14, as long as the resulting polypeptide retains at least 50% of the binding activity and level of signaling activation of the full length polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NO: 14. In one embodiment, a “Chemerin polypeptide” encompasses further the truncated Preprochemerin sequence of SEQ ID NO: 73 shown in \nFIG. 16\n (the nucleotide sequence shown in \nFIG. 16\n, which encodes the truncated Preprochemerin polypeptide is SEQ ID NO: 72). In addition to the sequences necessary for binding to ChemerinR and activating a ChemerinR signaling activity, a Chemerin polypeptide, including the truncated Chemerin polypeptide can comprise additional sequences, as in for example, a Chemerin fusion protein. Non-limiting examples of fusion partners include glutathione-S-transferase (GST), maltose binding protein, alkaline phosphatase, thioredoxin, green fluorescent protein (GFP), histidine tags (e.g., 6× or greater His), or epitope tags (e.g., Myc tag, FLAG tag).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “a nucleic acid sequence” refers to a polynucleotides such DNA or RNA. The term should also include both single and doublestranded polynucleotides. The term should also be understood to include, as equivalents, analogs of either RNA or DNA made from nucleotide analogs, and, as applicable to the embodiment being described, single (sense or antisense) and double-stranded polynucleotides. ESTs, chromosomes, cDNAs, mRNAs, and rRNAs are representative examples of molecules that may be referred to as nucleic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “Chemerin polynucleotide” refers to a polynucleotide that encodes a Chemerin polypeptide as defined herein, or the complement thereof. In one embodiment, a “Chemerin polynucleotide” is a polynucleotide sequence which encodes a truncated Preprochemerin polypeptide (e.g., the truncated Preprochemerin polypeptide shown in \nFIG. 17\n), such as the polynucleotide sequence shown in \nFIG. 17\n (SEQ ID NO: 49).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “a ChemerinR polynucleotide” refers to a polynucleotide that encodes a ChemerinR polypeptide, or a ChemerinR polypeptide analog or variant as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “standard” refers to a sample taken from an individual who is not affected by a disease or disorder characterized by dysregulation of G-protein coupled receptor (i.e., ChemerinR) activity. The “standard” is used as a reference for the comparison of receptor mRNA or polypeptide levels and quality (i.e., mutant vs. wild type), as well as for the comparison of G-protein coupled receptor activities. A “standard” also encompasses a reference sequence, e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1, with which sequences of nucleic acids or their encoded polypeptides are compared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “dysregulation” refers to the signaling activity of ChemerinR in a sample wherein a) a 10% or greater increase or decrease in the amount of one or more of ChemerinR polypeptide, ligand or mRNA level is measured relative to a standard, as defined herein, in a given assay or; b) at least a single base pair change in the ChemerinR coding sequence is detected relative to SEQ ID NO: 1, and results in an alteration of ChemerinR ligand binding or signaling activity as defined in paragraphs a), c) or d) or; c) a 10% or greater increase or decrease in the amount of ChemerinR ligand binding activity is measured relative to a standard, as defined herein, in a given assay or; d) a 10% or greater increase or decrease in a second messenger, as defined herein, is measured relative to the standard, as defined herein, in a given assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “expression vector” refers to a nucleic acid construct capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are linked. The construct further includes regulatory sequences, including for example, a promoter, operably linked to the genes. In general, expressing vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of “plasmids” which refer generally to circular double stranded DNA loops which, in their vector form are not bound to chromosome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “plasmid DNA expression vector” refers generally to a circular double stranded DNA loop which in their vector form are not bound to the chromosome, and which are capable of autonomous replication and/or expression of nucleic acids to which it is linked.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “adenovirus expression vector” refers to an expression vector which is derived from \nhuman adenovirus serotype\n 5, lacks ability to self-replicate, is capable of delivering into a cell a gene, and is capable of autonomous replication and/or expression of the gene inside the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “composition” refers to a compound that is made of one or more molecules, preferably a protein or a nucleic acid encoding a protein, or a mixture thereof. A composition can be naturally occurring, or derived by recombinant technology, or by other synthetic means known to one skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “therapeutic composition” refers to a composition that upon delivered into a cell, acts upon the cell to correct or compensate for an underlying molecular deficit, or counteract a disease state or syndrome of the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antibody” refers to the conventional immunoglobulin molecule, as well as fragments thereof which are also specifically reactive with one of the subject polypeptides. Antibodies can be fragmented using conventional techniques and the fragments screened for utility in the same manner as described herein below for whole antibodies. For example, F(ab)\n2 \nfragments can be generated by treating antibody with pepsin. The resulting F(ab)\n2 \nfragment can be treated to reduce disulfide bridges to produce Fab fragments. The antibody of the present invention is further intended to include bispecific, single-chain, and chimeric and humanized molecules having affinity for a polypeptide conferred by at least one CDR region of the antibody. In preferred embodiments, the antibodies, the antibody further comprises a label attached thereto and able to be detected, (e.g., the label can be a radioisotope, fluorescent compound, chemiluminescent compound, enzyme, or enzyme co-factor).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody” refers to an antibody that recognizes only one type of antigen. This type of antibodies is produced by the daughter cells of a single antibody-producing hybridoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “transgenic animal” refers to any animal, preferably a non-human mammal, bird, fish or an amphibian, in which one or more of the cells of the animal contain heterologous nucleic acid introduced by way of human intervention, such as by transgenic techniques well known in the art. The nucleic acid is introduced into the cell, directly or indirectly by introduction into a precursor of the cell, by way of deliberate genetic manipulation, such as by microinjection or by infection with a recombinant virus. The term genetic manipulation does not include classical cross-breeding, or in vitro fertilization, but rather is directed to the introduction of a recombinant DNA molecule. This molecule may be integrated within a chromosome, or it may be extra-chromosomally replicating DNA. In the typical transgenic animals described herein, the transgene causes cells to express a recombinant form of one of the subject polypeptide, e.g. either agonistic or antagonistic forms. However, transgenic animals in which the recombinant gene is silent are also contemplated, as for example, the FLP or CRE recombinase dependent constructs described below. Moreover, “transgenic animal” also includes those recombinant animals in which gene disruption of one or more genes is caused by human intervention, including both recombination and antisense techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “therapeutically effective amount” refers to the total amount of each active component of the pharmaceutical composition or method that is sufficient to show a meaningful patient benefit, i.e., treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of the relevant medical condition, or an increase in rate of treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of such conditions. When applied to an individual active ingredient, administered alone, the term refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that results in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously. Generally, a composition will be administered in a single dosage in the range of 100 μg-100 mg/kg body weight, preferably in the range of 1 μg-100n/kg body weight. This dosage may be repeated daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or as considered appropriate by the treating physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “ChemerinR activity” refers to specific binding of a Chemerin polypeptide or a functional fragment thereof by a ChemerinR polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “ChemerinR signaling activity” refers to the initiation or propagation of signaling by a ChemerinR polypeptide. ChemerinR signaling activity is monitored by measuring a detectable step in a signaling cascade by assaying one or more of the following: stimulation of GDP for GTP exchange on a G protein; alteration of adenylate cyclase activity; protein kinase C modulation; phosphatidylinositol breakdown (generating second messengers diacylglycerol, and inositol triphosphate); intracellular calcium flux; activation of MAP kinases; modulation of tyrosine kinases; or modulation of gene or reporter gene activity. A detectable step in a signaling cascade is considered initiated or mediated if the measurable activity is altered by 10% or more above or below a baseline established in the substantial absence of a Chemerin polypeptide relative to any of the ChemerinR activity assays described herein below. The measurable activity can be measured directly, as in, for example, measurement of cAMP or diacylglycerol levels. Alternatively, the measurable activity can be measured indirectly, as in, for example, a reporter gene assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “detectable step” refers to a step that can be measured, either directly, e.g., by measurement of a second messenger or detection of a modified (e.g., phosphorylated) protein, or indirectly, e.g., by monitoring a downstream effect of that step. For example, adenylate cyclase activation results in the generation of cAMP. The activity of adenylate cyclase can be measured directly, e.g., by an assay that monitors the production of cAMP in the assay, or indirectly, by measurement of actual levels of cAMP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “isolated” refers to a population of molecules, e.g., polypeptides or polynucleotides, the composition of which is less than 50% (by weight), preferably less than 40% and most preferably 2% or less, contaminating molecules of an unlike nature. When the term “isolated” is applied to a ChemerinR polypeptide, it is specifically meant to encompass a ChemerinR polypeptide that is associated with or embedded in a lipid membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “candidate compound” and “candidate modulator” refer to a composition being evaluated for the ability to modulate ligand binding to a ChemerinR polypeptide or the ability to modulate an activity of a ChemerinR polypeptide. Candidate modulators can be natural or synthetic compounds, including, for example, small molecules, compounds contained in extracts of animal, plant, bacterial or fungal cells, as well as conditioned medium from such cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “small molecule” refers to a compound having molecular mass of less than 3000 Daltons, preferably less than 2000 or 1500, still more preferably less than 1000, and most preferably less than 600 Daltons. A “small organic molecule” is a small molecule that comprises carbon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “change in binding” or “change in activity” and the equivalent terms “difference in binding” or “difference in activity” refer to an at least 10% increase or decrease in binding, or signaling activity in a given assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “conditions permitting the binding of Chemerin to ChemerinR” refers to conditions of, for example, temperature, salt concentration, pH and protein concentration under which Chemerin binds ChemerinR. Exact binding conditions will vary depending upon the nature of the assay, for example, whether the assay uses viable cells or only membrane fraction of cells. However, because ChemerinR is a cell surface protein, and because Chemerin is a secreted polypeptide that interacts with ChemerinR on the cell surface, favored conditions will generally include physiological salt (90 mM) and pH (about 7.0 to 8.0). Temperatures for binding can vary from 15° C. to 37° C., but will preferably be between room temperature and about 30° C. The concentration of Chemerin and ChemerinR polypeptide in a binding reaction will also vary, but will preferably be about 0.1 pM (e.g., in a reaction with radiolabeled tracer Chemerin, where the concentration is generally below the K\nd\n) to 1 (e.g., Chemerin as competitor). As an example, for a binding assay using ChemerinR-expressing cells and purified, recombinant, labeled Chemerin polypeptide, binding is performed using 0.1 nM labeled Chemerin, 100 nM cold Chemerin, and 25,000 cells at 27° C. in 250 μl of a binding buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mM CaCl\n2\n, and 0.5% Fatty acid free BSA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “sample” refers to the source of molecules being tested for the presence of an agent that modulates binding to or signaling activity of a ChemerinR polypeptide. A sample can be an environmental sample, a natural extract of animal, plant yeast or bacterial cells or tissues, a clinical sample, a synthetic sample, or a conditioned medium from recombinant cells or a fermentation process. The term “tissue sample” refers to a tissue that is tested for the presence, abundance, quality or an activity of a ChemerinR polypeptide, a Chemerin polypeptide, a nucleic acid encoding a ChemerinR or Chemerin polypeptide, or an agent that modifies the ligand binding or activity of a ChemerinR polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “tissue” is an aggregate of cells that perform a particular function in an organism. The term “tissue” as used herein refers to cellular material from a particular physiological region. The cells in a particular tissue can comprise several different cell types. A non-limiting example of this would be brain tissue that further comprises neurons and glial cells, as well as capillary endothelial cells and blood cells, all contained in a given tissue section or sample. In addition to solid tissues, the term “tissue” is also intended to encompass non-solid tissues, such as blood.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “membrane fraction” refers to a preparation of cellular lipid membranes comprising a ChemerinR polypeptide. As the term is used herein, a “membrane fraction” is distinct from a cellular homogenate, in that at least a portion (i.e., at least 10%, and preferably more) of non-membrane-associated cellular constituents has been removed. The term “membrane associated” refers to those cellular constituents that are either integrated into a lipid membrane or are physically associated with a component that is integrated into a lipid membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “decrease in binding” refers to a decrease of at least 10% in the binding of a Chemerin polypeptide or other agonist to a ChemerinR polypeptide as measured in a binding assay as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “second messenger” refers to a molecule, generated or caused to vary in concentration by the activation of a G-Protein Coupled Receptor, that participates in the transduction of a signal from that GPCR. Non-limiting examples of second messengers include cAMP, diacylglycerol, inositol triphosphates and intracellular calcium. The term “change in the level of a second messenger” refers to an increase or decrease of at least 10% in the detected level of a given second messenger relative to the amount detected in an assay performed in the absence of a candidate modulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “aequorin-based assay” refers to an assay for GPCr activity that measures intracellular calcium flux induced by activated GPCRs, wherein intracellular calcium flux is measured by the luminescence of aequorin expressed in the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “binding” refers to the physical association of a ligand (e.g., a Chemerin polypeptide) with a receptor (e.g., ChemerinR). As the term is used herein, binding is “specific” if it occurs with an EC\n50 \nor a K\nd \nof 100 nM or less, generally in the range of 100 nM to 10 pM. For example, binding is specific if the EC\n50 \nor K\nd \nis 100 nM, 50 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 950 pM, 900 pM, 850 pM, 800 pM, 750 pM, 700 pM, 650 pM, 600 pM, 550 pM, 500 pM, 450 pM, 400 pM, 350 pM, 300 pM, 250 pM, 200 pM, 150 pM, 100 pM, 75 pM, 50 pM, 25 pM or 10 pM or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “EC\n50\n,” refers to that concentration of an agent at which a given activity, including binding of a Chemerin polypeptide or other ligand and a functional activity of a ChemerinR polypeptide, is 50% of the maximum for that ChemerinR activity measurable using the same assay. Stated differently, the “EC\n50\n” is the concentration of agent that gives 50% activation, when 100% activation is set at the amount of activity that does not increase with the addition of more agonist. It should be noted that the “EC\n50 \nof a Chemerin polypeptide” will vary with the identity of the Chemerin polypeptide; for example, variant Chemerin polypeptides (i.e., those containing insertions, deletions, substitutions or fusions with other polypeptides, including Chemerin molecules from species other than humans and variants of them that satisfy the definition of Chemerin polypeptide set forth above) can have EC\n50 \nvalues higher than, lower than or the same as wild-type Chemerin. Therefore, where a Chemerin variant sequence differs from wild-type Chemerin of SEQ ID NO:8, one of the skill in the art can determine the EC\n50 \nfor that variant according to conventional methods. The EC\n50 \nof a given Chemerin polypeptide is measured by performing an assay for an activity of a fixed amount of ChemerinR polypeptide in the presence of doses of the Chemerin polypeptide that increase at least until the ChemerinR response is saturated or maximal, and then plotting the measured ChemerinR activity versus the concentration of Chemerin polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “IC\n50\n” is the concentration of an antagonist or inverse agonist that reduces the maximal activation of a ChemerinR receptor by 50%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “detectably labeled” refers to the property of a molecule, e.g., a Chemerin polypeptide or other ChemerinR ligand, that has a structural modification that incorporates a functional group (label) that can be readily detected. Detectable labels include but are not limited to fluorescent compounds, isotopic compounds, chemiluminescent compounds, quantum dot labels, biotin, enzymes, electron-dense reagents, and haptens or proteins for which antisera or monoclonal antibodies are available. The various means of detection include but are not limited to spectroscopic, photochemical, radiochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, or chemical means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “affinity tag” refers to a label, attached to a molecule of interest (e.g., a Chemerin polypeptide or other ChemerinR ligand), that confers upon the labeled molecule the ability to be specifically bound by a reagent that binds the label. Affinity tags include, but are not limited to an epitope for an antibody (known as “epitope tags”), biotin, 6×His, and GST. Affinity tags can be used for the detection, as well as for the purification of the labeled species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “decrease in binding” refers to a decrease of at least 10% in the amount of binding detected in a given assay with a known or suspected modulator of ChemerinR relative to binding detected in an assay lacking that known or suspected modulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “delivering,” when used in reference to a drug or agent, means the addition of the drug or agent to an assay mixture, or to a cell in culture. The term also refers to the administration of the drug or agent to an animal. Such administration can be, for example, by injection (in a suitable carrier, e.g., sterile saline or water) or by inhalation, or by an oral, transdermal, rectal, vaginal, or other common route of drug administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “effective amount” refers to that amount of a drug or ChemerinR modulating agent that results in a change in a ChemerinR activity as defined herein (i.e., at least 10% increase or decrease in a ChemerinR activity).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “amplifying,” when applied to a nucleic acid sequence, refers to a process whereby one or more copies of a nucleic acid sequence is generated from a template nucleic acid. A preferred method of “amplifying” is PCR or RT/PCR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “substantial absence” refers to a level of an activating or inhibiting factor that is below the level necessary to activate or inhibit GPCR function by at least 10% as measured by a given assay disclosed herein or known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “G-Protein coupled receptor,” or “GPCR” refers to a membrane-associated polypeptide with 7 alpha helical transmembrane domains. Functional GPCR's associate with a ligand or agonist and also associate with and activate G-proteins. ChemerinR is a GPCR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “agent that modulates the function of a ChemerinR polypeptide” is a molecule or compound that increases or decreases ChemerinR activity, including compounds that change the binding of Chemerin polypeptides or other agonists, and compounds that change ChemerinR downstream signaling activities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “null mutation” refers to an insertion, deletion, or substitution that modifies the chromosomal sequences encoding a polypeptide, such that the polypeptide is not expressed.\n\n\n \n \nI. Assays for the Identification of Agents that Modulate the Activity of ChemerinR\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgents that modulate the activity of ChemerinR can be identified in a number of ways that take advantage of the interaction of the receptor with Chemerin. For example, the ability to reconstitute ChemerinR/Chemerin binding either in vitro, on cultured cells or in vivo provides a target for the identification of agents that disrupt that binding. Assays based on disruption of binding can identify agents, such as small organic molecules, from libraries or collections of such molecules. Alternatively, such assays can identify agents in samples or extracts from natural sources, e.g., plant, fungal or bacterial extracts or even in human tissue samples (e.g., tumor tissue). In one aspect, the extracts can be made from cells expressing a library of variant nucleic acids, peptides or polypeptides, including, for example, variants of Chemerin polypeptide itself. Modulators of ChemerinR/Chemerin binding can then be screened using a binding assay or a functional assay that measures downstream signaling through the receptor. Both binding assays and functional assays are validated using Chemerin polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother approach that uses the ChemerinR/Chemerin interaction more directly to identify agents that modulate ChemerinR function measures changes in ChemerinR downstream signaling induced by candidate agents or candidate modulators. These functional assays can be performed in isolated cell membrane fractions or on cells expressing the receptor on their surfaces.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA. ChemerinR polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays using the interaction of ChemerinR and Chemerin require a source of ChemerinR polypeptide. The polynucleotide and polypeptide sequence of human ChemerinR are presented herein as SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2. The human ChemerinR polynucleotide sequence is also available at GenBank Accession No. Y14838, and was reported in Samson et al., 1998, Eur. J. Immunol. 28: 1689-1700, incorporated herein by reference. ChemerinR polypeptide sequence is also recorded at accession Nos. O75748 and CAA75112 in the Swissprot database. Related sequences include those for CMKRL1 (GenBank Accession Nos. XM\n—\n006864 and NM004072 (nucleotide sequences) and Swissprot Accession No. Q99788 (polypeptide sequence)), human DEZb (GenBank Accession No. U79527 (nucleotide sequence)), human DEZa (GenBank Accession No. U79526 (nucleotide sequence), mouse DEZ (GenBank Accession No. U79525 (nucleotide sequence) and Swissprot Accession No. P97468 (polypeptide sequence)), and rat ChemerinR (GenBank Accession No. AJ002745 (nucleotide sequence) and Swissprot Accession No. O35786 (polypeptide sequence).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne skilled in the art can readily amplify a ChemerinR sequence from a sample containing mRNA encoding the protein through basic PCR and molecular cloning techniques using primers or probes designed from the known sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression of recombinant polypeptides is well known in the art. Those skilled in the art can readily select vectors and expression control sequences for the expression of ChemerinR polypeptides useful according to the invention in eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells. ChemerinR must be associated with cell membrane or detergents like synthetic liposomes in order to have binding or signaling function. Methods for the preparation of cellular membrane fractions are well known in the art, e.g., the method reported by Hubbard & Cohn, 1975, J. Cell Biol. 64: 461-479, which is incorporated herein by reference. In order to produce membranes comprising ChemerinR, one need only apply such techniques to cells endogenously or recombinantly expressing ChemerinR. Alternatively, membrane-free ChemerinR can be integrated into membrane preparations by dilution of detergent solution of the polypeptide (see, e.g., Salamon et al., 1996, Biophys. J. 71:283-294, which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. Chemerin Polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a Chemerin polypeptide including the full-length active form and the truncated Chemerin polypeptides. The 163 amino acid full-length Preprochemerin polypeptide is first produced in a cell as inactive form (\nFIG. 6\n). This inactive form of Chemerin is converted into the active form of Chemerin (137 amino acids) by the following two steps: a) removing 20 amino acids at N-terminus (this form is called prochemerin, 143 amino acids, Fibure 8); b) removing 6 amino acids at C-terminus (137 amino acids, \nFIG. 9\n). Preferably, the C-terminus human truncated Preprochemerin and chemerin polypeptides are presented in \nFIGS. 16\n, \n8\n and \n20\n \na \n(human chemerin −9, −10, −11, −12, −13, −19) respectively. The Chemerin polypeptides of the invention may be a recombinant Chemerin polypeptide, a natural Chemerin polypeptide, or a synthetic Chemerin polypeptide, preferably a recombinant Chemerin polypeptide. The Chemerin polypeptide of the invention may also encompass the analogs or variants whose polypeptide sequences are different from the naturally-occurring ones, but retain substantially the same function or activity as a Chemerin polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe full-length human inactive Preprochemerin polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences are presented herein as \n \nSEQ ID Nos\n \n 7 and 8, respectively (\nFIG. 6\n). Preprochemerin sequences are also available from GenBank (e.g., Human polynucleotide sequences include Accession Nos. XM 004765, U77594, NM 002889, human polypeptide sequence is available at Accession Nos. Q99969, BAA76499, AAB47975, NP002880, and XP004765; \nGallus gallus \npolynucleotide sequences include Accession Nos. BG713704, BG713660 and BG713614; mouse polynucleotide sequences include BF020273, AW113641 and bf018000; rat polynucleotide sequences include AW915104; \nSus scrofa \npolynucleotide sequences include BF078978 and BF713092 (overlapping ESTs, last 7 amino acids of Preprochemerin sequence in BF713092); and \nBos taurus \npolynucleotide sequences include BG691132). An alignment of Preprochemerin sequences is presented in \nFIG. 11\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a Chemerin polypeptide. The nucleic acid sequences of the invention may also contain the coding sequences fused in frame to a marker sequence for purification of the polypeptides of the present invention. The nucleic acid sequences of the present invention may be employed for producing polypeptides of the present invention by recombinant techniques. The nucleic acid sequences of the invention may be included in any one of the expressing vectors such as plasmid DNA, phage DNA, or Viral DNA vectors etc, all vectors are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs with ChemerinR, Chemerin polynucleotides can be cloned through standard PCR and molecular cloning techniques using the known sequences as a source of amplification primers or probes. Similarly, cloned Chemerin polypeptides can be expressed in eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells as known in the art. As a non-limiting example, Chemerin may be cloned into an acceptable mammalian expression vector, such as pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for expression in a host cell. A Chemerin expression construct for expression in yeast is described in Example 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemerin can also be expressed in vitro through in vitro transcription and translation. Further, if desired for a given assay or technique, Chemerin polypeptides useful according to the invention can be produced as fusion proteins or tagged proteins. For example, either full length Chemerin or a portion thereof (i.e., at least 10 amino acids, preferably at least 20 amino acids or more, up to one amino acid less than full length Chemerin) can be fused to Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST), secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), a FLAG tag, a Myc tag, or a 6×-His peptide to facilitate the purification or detection of the Chemerin polypeptide. Methods and vectors for the production of tagged or fusion proteins are well known in the art, as are methods of isolating and detecting such fused or tagged proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant Chemerin polypeptides can be used in purified form. Alternatively, conditioned medium from Chemerin transfected cells can be used. The amounts of Chemerin necessary in a given binding or functional assay according to the invention will vary depending upon the assay, but will generally use 1 pM to 1 nM of labeled and 10 pM to 1 μm of unlabeled Chemerin per assay. The affinities and EC\n50\ns of tagged Chemerin polypeptides for ChemerinR may vary relative to those of full length wild type Chemerin polypeptide, and the amount necessary for a given assay can therefore be adjusted relative to the wild-type values. If necessary for a given assay, Chemerin can be labeled by incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids in the medium during synthesis, e.g., \n35\nS-Met, \n14\nC-Leu, tritium H3 or others as appropriate. Methods of chemical labeling with \n125\nI are known in the art. Fluorescent labels can also be attached to Chemerin polypeptides or to other ChemerinR ligands using standard labeling techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Chemerin polypeptides may also be employed for treatment of a disease or disorder. For example, cells from a patient may be engineered with a polynucleotide (DNA or RNA) encoding a polypeptide ex vivo, with the engineered cells then being provided to a patient to be treated with the polypeptide. Such methods are well-known in the art. Similarly, cells may be engineered in vivo for expression of a polypeptide in vivo by, for example, procedures known in the art. These and other methods for administering a polypeptide of the present invention by such method should be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings of the present invention. For example, the expression vector for engineering cells in vivo may be a retrovirus, an adenovirus, or a non-viral vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC. Assays to Identify Modulators of ChemerinR Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe discovery that Chemerin is a ligand of the ChemerinR receptor permits screening assays to identify agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists of receptor activity. The screening assays will have two general approaches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1) Ligand binding assays, in which cells expressing ChemerinR, membrane extracts from such cells, or immobilized lipid membranes comprising ChemerinR are exposed to a labeled Chemerin polypeptide and candidate compound. Following incubation, the reaction mixture is measured for specific binding of the labeled Chemerin polypeptide to the ChemerinR receptor. Compounds that interfere with or displace labeled Chemerin polypeptide can be agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists of ChemerinR activity. Functional analysis can be performed on positive compounds to determine which of these categories they fit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2) Functional assays, in which a signaling activity of ChemerinR is measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \na) For agonist screening, cells expressing ChemerinR or membranes prepared from them are incubated with candidate compound, and a signaling activity of ChemerinR is measured. The assays are validated using a Chemerin polypeptide as agonist, and the activity induced by compounds that modulate receptor activity is compared to that induced by Chemerin. An agonist or partial agonist will have a maximal biological activity corresponding to at least 10% of the maximal activity of wild type human Chemerin when the agonist or partial agonist is present at 10 μM or less, and preferably will have 50%, 75%, 100% or more, including 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold or more activity than wild-type human Chemerin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb) For antagonist or inverse agonist screening, cells expressing ChemerinR or membranes isolated from them are assayed for signaling activity in the presence of a Chemerin polypeptide with or without a candidate compound. Antagonists or inverse agonists will reduce the level of Chemerin-stimulated receptor activity by at least 10%, relative to reactions lacking the antagonist or inverse agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc) For inverse agonist screening, cells expressing constitutive ChemerinR activity or membranes isolated from them are used in a functional assay that measures an activity of the receptor in the presence and absence of a candidate compound. Inverse agonists are those compounds that reduce the constitutive activity of the receptor by at least 10%. Overexpression of ChemerinR (i.e., expression of 5-fold or higher excess of ChemerinR polypeptide relative to the level naturally expressed in macro phages in vivo) may lead to constitutive activation. ChememerinR can be overexpressed by placing it under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, e.g., the CMV early promoter. Alternatively, certain mutations of conserved GPCR amino acids or amino acid domains tend to lead to constitutive activity. See for example: Kjelsberg et al., 1992, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n267:1430; McWhinney et al., 2000. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n275:2087; Ren et al., 1993, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n268:16483; Samama et al., 1993, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n268:4625; Parma et al., 1993, \nNature \n365:649; Parma et al., 1998, \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n286:85; and Parent et al., 1996, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n271:7949.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigand Binding and Displacement Assays:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne can use ChemerinR polypeptides expressed on a cell, or isolated membranes containing receptor polypeptides, along with a Chemerin polypeptide in order to screen for compounds that inhibit the binding of Chemerin to ChemerinR. When identified in an assay that measures binding or Chemerin polypeptide displacement alone, compounds will have to be subjected to functional testing to determine whether they act as agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor displacement experiments, cells expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide (generally 25,000 cells per assay or 1 to 100 μg of membrane extracts) are incubated in binding buffer (e.g., 50 mM Hepes pH 7.4; 1 mM CaCl\n2\n; 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) Fatty Acid-Free; and 0 5 mM MgCl\n2\n) for 1.5 hrs (at, for example, 27° C.) with labeled Chemerin polypeptide in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of a candidate modulator. To validate and calibrate the assay, control competition reactions using increasing concentrations of unlabeled Chemerin polypeptide can be performed. After incubation, cells are washed extensively, and bound, labeled Chemerin is measured as appropriate for the given label (e.g., scintillation counting, enzyme assay, fluorescence, etc.). A decrease of at least 10% in the amount of labeled Chemerin polypeptide bound in the presence of candidate modulator indicates displacement of binding by the candidate modulator. Candidate modulators are considered to bind specifically in this or other assays described herein if they displace 50% of labeled Chemerin (sub-saturating Chemerin dose) at a concentration of 10 μM or less (i.e., EC\n50 \nis 10 μM or less).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, binding or displacement of binding can be monitored by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Surface plasmon resonance assays can be used as a quantitative method to measure binding between two molecules by the change in mass near an immobilized sensor caused by the binding or loss of binding of a Chemerin polypeptide from the aqueous phase to a ChemerinR polypeptide immobilized in a membrane on the sensor. This change in mass is measured as resonance units versus time after injection or removal of the Chemerin polypeptide or candidate modulator and is measured using a Biacore Biosensor (Biacore AB). ChemerinR can be immobilized on a sensor chip (for example, research grade CM5 chip; Biacore AB) in a thin film lipid membrane according to methods described by Salamon et al. (Salamon et al., 1996, Biophys J. 71: 283-294; Salamon et al., 2001, Biophys. J. 80: 1557-1567; Salamon et al., 1999, Trends Biochem. Sci. 24: 213-219, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.). Sarrio et al. demonstrated that SPR can be used to detect ligand binding to the GPCR A(1) adenosine receptor immobilized in a lipid layer on the chip (Sarrio et al., 2000, Mol. Cell. Biol. 20: 5164-5174, incorporated herein by reference). Conditions for Chemerin binding to ChemerinR in an SPR assay can be fine-tuned by one of skill in the art using the conditions reported by Sarrio et al. as a starting point.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSPR can assay for modulators of binding in at least two ways. First, a Chemerin polypeptide can be pre-bound to immobilized ChemerinR polypeptide, followed by injection of candidate modulator at approximately 10 μl/min flow rate and a concentration ranging from 1 nM to 100 μM, preferably about 1 μM. Displacement of the bound Chemerin can be quantitated, permitting detection of modulator binding. Alternatively, the membrane-bound ChemerinR polypeptide can be pre-incubated with candidate modulator and challenged with a Chemerin polypeptide. A difference in Chemerin binding to the ChemerinR exposed to modulator relative to that on a chip not pre-exposed to modulator will demonstrate binding. In either assay, a decrease of 10% or more in the amount of a Chemerin polypeptide bound is in the presence of candidate modulator, relative to the amount of a Chemerin polypeptide bound in the absence of candidate modulator indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits the interaction of ChemerinR and Chemerin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother method of measuring inhibition of binding of a Chemerin polypeptide to ChemerinR uses fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). FRET is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that occurs between a fluorescence donor (D) and a fluorescence acceptor (A) in close proximity to each other (usually <100 A of separation) if the emission spectrum of D overlaps with the excitation spectrum of A. The molecules to be tested, e.g., a Chemerin polypeptide and a ChemerinR polypeptide, are labeled with a complementary pair of donor and acceptor fluorophores. While bound closely together by the ChemerinR:Chemerin interaction, the fluorescence emitted upon excitation of the donor fluorophore will have a different wavelength than that emitted in response to that excitation wavelength when the polypeptides are not bound, providing for quantitation of bound versus unbound polypeptides by measurement of emission intensity at each wavelength. Donor:Acceptor pairs of fluorophores with which to label the polypeptides are well known in the art. Of particular interest are variants of the \nA. victoria \nGFP known as Cyan FP(CFP, Donor(D)) and Yellow FP (YFP, Acceptor(A)). The GFP variants can be made as fusion proteins with the respective members of the binding pair to serve as D-A pairs in a FRET scheme to measure protein-protein interaction. Vectors for the expression of GFP variants as fusions are known in the art. As an example, a CFP-Chemerin fusion and a YFP-ChemerinR fusion can be made. The addition of a candidate modulator to the mixture of labeled Chemerin and ChemerinR proteins will result in an inhibition of energy transfer evidenced by, for example, a decrease in YFP fluorescence relative to a sample without the candidate modulator. In an assay using FRET for the detection of ChemerinR:Chemerin interaction, a 10% or greater decrease in the intensity of fluorescent emission at the acceptor wavelength in samples containing a candidate modulator, relative to samples without the candidate modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits ChemerinR:Chemerin interaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variation on FRET uses fluorescence quenching to monitor molecular interactions. One molecule in the interacting pair can be labeled with a fluorophore, and the other with a molecule that quenches the fluorescence of the fluorophore when brought into close apposition with it. A change in fluorescence upon excitation is indicative of a change in the association of the molecules tagged with the fluorophore:quencher pair. Generally, an increase in fluorescence of the labeled ChemerinR polypeptide is indicative that the Chemerin polypeptide bearing the quencher has been displaced. For quenching assays, a 10% or greater increase in the intensity of fluorescent emission in samples containing a candidate modulator, relative to samples without the candidate modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits ChemerinR:Chemerin interaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the surface plasmon resonance and FRET methods, fluorescence polarization measurement is useful to quantitate protein-protein binding. The fluorescence polarization value for a fluorescently-tagged molecule depends on the rotational correlation time or tumbling rate. Protein complexes, such as those formed by ChemerinR associating with a fluorescently labeled Chemerin polypeptide, have higher polarization values than uncomplexed, labeled Chemerin. The inclusion of a candidate inhibitor of the ChemerinR:Chemerin interaction results in a decrease in fluorescence polarization, relative to a mixture without the candidate inhibitor, if the candidate inhibitor disrupts or inhibits the interaction of ChemerinR with Chemerin. Fluorescence polarization is well suited for the identification of small molecules that disrupt the formation of polypeptide or protein complexes. A decrease of 10% or more in fluorescence polarization in samples containing a candidate modulator, relative to fluorescence polarization in a sample lacking the candidate modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits ChemerinR:Chemerin interaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother alternative for monitoring ChemerinR:Chemerin interactions uses a biosensor assay. ICS biosensors have been described by AMBRI (Australian Membrane Biotechnology Research Institute; http//www.ambri.com.au/). In this technology, the association of macromolecules such as ChemerinR and Chemerin, is coupled to the closing of gramacidin-facilitated ion channels in suspended membrane bilayers and thus to a measurable change in the admittance (similar to impedence) of the biosensor. This approach is linear over six orders of magnitude of admittance change and is ideally suited for large scale, high throughput screening of small molecule combinatorial libraries. A 10% or greater change (increase or decrease) in admittance in a sample containing a candidate modulator, relative to the admittance of a sample lacking the candidate modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits the interaction of ChemerinR and Chemerin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is important to note that in assays of protein-protein interaction, it is possible that a modulator of the interaction need not necessarily interact directly with the domain(s) of the proteins that physically interact. It is also possible that a modulator will interact at a location removed from the site of protein-protein interaction and cause, for example, a conformational change in the ChemerinR polypeptide. Modulators (inhibitors or agonists) that act in this manner are nonetheless of interest as agents to modulate the activity of ChemerinR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that any of the binding assays described herein can be performed with a non-Chemerin ligand (for example, agonist, antagonist, etc.) of ChemerinR, e.g., a small molecule identified as described herein. In practice, the use of a small molecule ligand or other non-Chemerin ligand has the benefit that non-polypeptide chemical compounds are generally cheaper and easier to produce in purified form than polypeptides such as Chemerin. Thus, a non-Chemerin ligand is better suited to high-throughput assays for the identification of agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists than full length Chemerin. This advantage in no way erodes the importance of assays using Chemerin, however, as such assays are well suited for the initial identification of non-Chemerin ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the binding assays described can be used to determine the presence of an agent in a sample, e.g., a tissue sample, that binds to the ChemerinR receptor molecule, or that affects the binding of Chemerin to the receptor. To do so, ChemerinR polypeptide is reacted with Chemerin polypeptide or another ligand in the presence or absence of the sample, and Chemerin or ligand binding is measured as appropriate for the binding assay being used. A decrease of 10% or more in the binding of Chemerin or other ligand indicates that the sample contains an agent that modulates Chemerin or ligand binding to the receptor polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFunctional Assays of Receptor Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \ni. GTPase/GTP Binding Assays:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor GPCRs such as ChemerinR, a measure of receptor activity is the binding of GTP by cell membranes containing receptors. In the method described by Traynor and Nahorski, 1995, Mol. Pharmacol. 47: 848-854, incorporated herein by reference, one essentially measures G-protein coupling to membranes by measuring the binding of labeled GTP. For GTP binding assays, membranes isolated from cells expressing the receptor are incubated in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 80 pM \n35\nS-GTPγS and 3 μM GDP. The assay mixture is incubated for 60 minutes at 30° C., after which unbound labeled GTP is removed by filtration onto GF/B filters. Bound, labeled GTP is measured by liquid scintillation counting. In order to assay for modulation of Chemerin-induced ChemerinR activity, membranes prepared from cells expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide are mixed with a Chemerin polypeptide, and the GTP binding assay is performed in the presence and absence of a candidate modulator of ChemerinR activity. A decrease of 10% or more in labeled GTP binding as measured by scintillation counting in an assay of this kind containing candidate modulator, relative to an assay without the modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits ChemerinR activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar GTP-binding assay can be performed without Chemerin to identify compounds that act as agonists. In this case, Chemerin-stimulated GTP binding is used as a standard. A compound is considered an agonist if it induces at least 50% of the level of GTP binding induced by full length wild-type Chemerin when the compound is present at 1 μM or less, and preferably will induce a level the same as or higher than that induced by Chemerin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGTPase activity is measured by incubating the membranes containing a ChemerinR polypeptide with γ\n32\nP-GTP. Active GTPase will release the label as inorganic phosphate, which is detected by separation of free inorganic phosphate in a 5% suspension of activated charcoal in 20 mM H\n3\nPO\n4\n, followed by scintillation counting. Controls include assays using membranes isolated from cells not expressing ChemerinR (mock-transfected), in order to exclude possible non-specific effects of the candidate compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to assay for the effect of a candidate modulator on ChemerinR-regulated GTPase activity, membrane samples are incubated with a Chemerin polypeptide, with and without the modulator, followed by the GTPase assay. A change (increase or decrease) of 10% or more in the level of GTP binding or GTPase activity relative to samples without modulator is indicative of ChemerinR modulation by a candidate modulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nii. Downstream Pathway Activation Assays:\n\n\n \n \n \n \na. Calcium flux—The Aequorin-based Assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aequorin assay takes advantage of the responsiveness of mitochondrial apoaequorin to intracellular calcium release induced by the activation of GPCRs (Stables et al., 1997, Anal. Biochem. 252:115-126; Detheux et al., 2000, J. Exp. Med., 192 1501-1508; both of which are incorporated herein by reference). Briefly, ChemerinR-expressing clones are transfected to coexpress mitochondrial apoaequorin and Gα16. Cells are incubated with 5 μM Coelenterazine H (Molecular Probes) for 4 hours at room temperature, washed in DMEM-F12 culture medium and resuspended at a concentration of 0.5×10\n6 \ncells/ml. Cells are then mixed with test agonist peptides and light emission by the aequorin is recorded with a luminometer for 30 sec. Results are expressed as Relative Light Units (RLU). Controls include assays using membranes isolated from cells not expressing ChemerinR (mock-transfected), in order to exclude possible non-specific effects of the candidate compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAequorin activity or intracellular calcium levels are “changed” if light intensity increases or decreases by 10% or more in a sample of cells, expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide and treated with a candidate modulator, relative to a sample of cells expressing the ChemerinR polypeptide but not treated with the candidate modulator or relative to a sample of cells not expressing the ChemerinR polypeptide (mock-transfected cells) but treated with the candidate modulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen performed in the absence of a Chemerin polypeptide, the assay can be used to identify an agonist of ChemerinR activity. When the assay is performed in the presence of a Chemerin polypeptide, it can be used to assay for an antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb. Adenylate Cyclase Assay:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays for adenylate cyclase activity are described by Kenimer & Nirenberg, 1981, Mol. Pharmacol. 20: 585-591, incorporated herein by reference. That assay is a modification of the assay taught by Solomon et al., 1974, Anal. Biochem. 58: 541-548, also incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, 100 μl reactions contain 50 mM Tris-Hcl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 20 mM creatine phosphate (disodium salt), 10 units (71 μg of protein) of creatine phosphokinase, 1 mM α-\n32\nP-ATP (tetrasodium salt, 2 μCi), 0.5 mM cyclic AMP, G-\n3\nH-labeled cyclic AMP (approximately 10,000 cpm), 0.5 mM Ro20-1724, 0.25% ethanol, and 50-200 μg of protein homogenate to be tested (i.e., homogenate from cells expressing or not expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide, treated or not treated with a Chemerin polypeptide with or without a candidate modulator). Reaction mixtures are generally incubated at 37° C. for 6 minutes. Following incubation, reaction mixtures are deproteinized by the addition of 0.9 ml of cold 6% trichloroacetic acid. Tubes are centrifuged at 1800×g for 20 minutes and each supernatant solution is added to a Dowex AG50W-X4 column. The cAMP fraction from the column is eluted with 4 ml of 0.1 mM imidazole-HCl (pH 7.5) into a counting vial. Assays should be performed in triplicate. Control reactions should also be performed using protein homogenate from cells that do not express a ChemerinR polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, adenylate cyclase activity is “changed” if it increases or decreases by 10% or more in a sample taken from cells treated with a candidate modulator of ChemerinR activity, relative to a similar sample of cells not treated with the candidate modulator or relative to a sample of cells not expressing the ChemerinR polypeptide (mock-transfected cells) but treated with the candidate modulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc. cAMP Assay:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntracellular or extracellular cAMP is measured using a cAMP radioimmunoassay (RIA) or cAMP binding protein according to methods widely known in the art. For example, Horton & Baxendale, 1995, Methods Mol. Biol. 41: 91-105, which is incorporated herein by reference, describes an RIA for cAMP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of kits for the measurement of cAMP are commercially available, such as the High Efficiency Fluorescence Polarization-based homogeneous assay marketed by LJL Biosystems and NEN Life Science Products. Control reactions should be performed using extracts of mock-transfected cells to exclude possible non-specific effects of some candidate modulators.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe level of cAMP is “changed” if the level of cAMP detected in cells, expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide and treated with a candidate modulator of ChemerinR activity (or in extracts of such cells), using the RIA-based assay of Horton & Baxendale, 1995, supra, increases or decreases by at least 10% relative to the cAMP level in similar cells not treated with the candidate modulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nd. Phospholipid Breakdown, DAG Production and Inositol Triphosphate Levels:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReceptors that activate the breakdown of phospholipids can be monitored for changes due to the activity of known or suspected modulators of ChemerinR by monitoring phospholipid breakdown, and the resulting production of second messengers DAG and/or inositol triphosphate (IP\n3\n). Methods of measuring each of these are described in Phospholipid Signaling Protocols, edited by Ian M. Bird. Totowa, N.J., Humana Press, 1998, which is incorporated herein by reference. See also Rudolph et al., 1999, J. Biol. Chem. 274: 11824-11831, incorporated herein by reference, which also describes an assay for phosphatidylinositol breakdown. Assays should be performed using cells or extracts of cells expressing ChemerinR, treated or not treated with a Chemerin polypeptide with or without a candidate modulator. Control reactions should be performed using mock-transfected cells, or extracts from them in order to exclude possible non-specific effects of some candidate modulators.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, phosphatidylinositol breakdown, and diacylglycerol and/or inositol triphosphate levels are “changed” if they increase or decrease by at least 10% in a sample from cells expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide and treated with a candidate modulator, relative to the level observed in a sample from cells expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide that is not treated with the candidate modulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ne. PKC Activation Assays:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGrowth factor receptor tyrosine kinases tend to signal via a pathway involving activation of Protein Kinase C (PKC), which is a family of phospholipid- and calcium-activated protein kinases. PKC activation ultimately results in the transcription of an array of proto-oncogene transcription factor-encoding genes, including c-fos, c-myc and c-jun, proteases, protease inhibitors, including collagenase type I and plasminogen activator inhibitor, and adhesion molecules, including intracellular adhesion molecule I (ICAM I). Assays designed to detect increases in gene products induced by PKC can be used to monitor PKC activation and thereby receptor activity. In addition, the activity of receptors that signal via PKC can be monitored through the use of reporter gene constructs driven by the control sequences of genes activated by PKC activation. This type of reporter gene-based assay is discussed in more detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor a more direct measure of PKC activity, the method of Kikkawa et al., 1982, J. Biol. Chem. 257: 13341, incorporated herein by reference, can be used. This assay measures phosphorylation of a PKC substrate peptide, which is subsequently separated by binding to phosphocellulose paper. This PKC assay system can be used to measure activity of purified kinase, or the activity in crude cellular extracts. Protein kinase C sample can be diluted in 20 mM HEPES/2 mM DTT immediately prior to assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe substrate for the assay is the peptide Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: 80), derived from the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate protein (MARCKS). The K\nm \nof the enzyme for this peptide is approximately 50 μM. Other basic, protein kinase C-selective peptides known in the art can also be used, at a concentration of at least 2-3 times their K\nm\n. Cofactors required for the assay include calcium, magnesium, ATP, phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol. Depending upon the intent of the user, the assay can be performed to determine the amount of PKC present (activating conditions) or the amount of active PCK present (non-activating conditions). For most purposes according to the invention, non-activating conditions will be used, such that the PKC that is active in the sample when it is isolated is measured, rather than measuring the PKC that can be activated. For non-activating conditions, calcium is omitted in the assay in favor of EGTA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay is performed in a mixture containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1-2 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 100 μM ATP, ˜1 μCi γ-\n32\nP-ATP, 100 μg/ml peptide substrate (˜100 μM), 140 μM/3.8 μM phosphatidylserine/diacylglycerol membranes, and 100 μM calcium (or 500 μM EGTA). 48 μl of sample, diluted in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM DTT is used in a final reaction volume of 80 μl. Reactions are performed at 30° C. for 5-10 minutes, followed by addition of 25 μl of 100 mM ATP, 100 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, which stops the reactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the reaction is stopped, a portion (85 μl) of each reaction is spotted onto a Whatman P81 cellulose phosphate filter, followed by washes: four \ntimes\n 500 ml in 0.4% phosphoric acid, (5-10 mM per wash); and a final wash in 500 \nml\n 95% EtOH, for 2-5 mM. Bound radioactivity is measured by scintillation counting. Specific activity (cpm/nmol) of the labeled ATP is determined by spotting a sample of the reaction onto P81 paper and counting without washing. Units of PKC activity, defined as nmol phosphate transferred per min, are calculated as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity, in UNITS (nmol/min) is:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\ncpm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\non\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npaper\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n105\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nµl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntotal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n85\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nµl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspotted\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\nassay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nmin\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nspecific\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nATP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncpm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmol\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alternative assay can be performed using a Protein Kinase C Assay Kit sold by PanVera (Cat. # P2747).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays are performed on extracts from cells expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide, treated or not treated with a Chemerin polypeptide with or without a candidate modulator. Control reactions should be performed using mock-transfected cells, or extracts from them in order to exclude possible non-specific effects of some candidate modulators.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, PKC activity is “changed” by a candidate modulator when the units of PKC measured by either assay described above increase or decrease by at least 10%, in extracts from cells expressing ChemerinR and treated with a candidate modulator, relative to a reaction performed on a similar sample from cells not treated with a candidate modulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nf. Kinase assays:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMAP kinase activity can be assayed using any of several kits available commercially, for example, the p38 MAP Kinase assay kit sold by New England Biolabs (Cat # 9820) or the FlashPlate™ MAP Kinase assays sold by Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMAP Kinase activity is “changed” if the level of activity is increased or decreased by 10% or more in a sample from cells, expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide, treated with a candidate modulator relative to MAP kinase activity in a sample from similar cells not treated with the candidate modulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDirect assays for tyrosine kinase activity using known synthetic or natural tyrosine kinase substrates and labeled phosphate are well known, as are similar assays for other types of kinases (e.g., Ser/Thr kinases). Kinase assays can be performed with both purified kinases and crude extracts prepared from cells expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide, treated with or without a Chemerin polypeptide, with or without a candidate modulator. Control reactions should be performed using mock-transfected cells, or extracts from them in order to exclude possible non-\n12529233.1 specific effects of some candidate modulators. Substrates can be either full length protein or synthetic peptides representing the substrate. Pinna & Ruzzene (\n1996, Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1314: 191-225, incorporated herein by reference) list a number of phosphorylation substrate sites useful for measuring kinase activities. A number of kinase substrate peptides are commercially available. One that is particularly useful is the “Src-related peptide,” RRLIEDAEYAARG (SEQ ID NO: 74; available from Sigma # A7433), which is a substrate for many receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Because the assay described below requires binding of peptide substrates to filters, the peptide substrates should have a net positive charge to facilitate binding. Generally, peptide substrates should have at least 2 basic residues and a free amino terminus. Reactions generally use a peptide concentration of 0.7-1.5 mM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays are generally carried out in a 25 μl volume comprising 5 μl of 5× kinase buffer (5 mg/mL BSA, 150 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mM MgCl\n2\n; depending upon the exact kinase assayed for, MnCl\n2 \ncan be used in place of or in addition to the MgCl\n2\n), 5 μl of 1.0 mM ATP (0.2 mM final concentration), γ-32P-ATP (100-500 cpm/pmol), 3 μl of 10 mM peptide substrate (1.2 mM final concentration), cell extract containing kinase to be tested (cell extracts used for kinase assays should contain a phosphatase inhibitor (e.g. 0.1-1 mM sodium orthovanadate)), and H\n2\nO to 25 μl. Reactions are performed at 30° C., and are initiated by the addition of the cell extract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinase reactions are performed for 30 seconds to about 30 minutes, followed by the addition of 45 μl of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Samples are spun for 2 minutes in a microcentrifuge, and 35 μl of the supernatant is spotted onto Whatman P81 cellulose phosphate filter circles. The filters are washed three times with 500 ml cold 0.5% phosphoric acid, followed by one wash with 200 ml of acetone at room temperature for 5 minutes. Filters are dried and incorporated 32P is measured by scintillation counting. The specific activity of ATP in the kinase reaction (e.g., in cpm/pmol) is determined by spotting a small sample (2-5 μl) of the reaction onto a P81 filter circle and counting directly, without washing. Counts per minute obtained in the kinase reaction (minus blank) are then divided by the specific activity to determine the moles of phosphate transferred in the reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTyrosine kinase activity is “changed” if the level of kinase activity is increased or decreased by 10% or more in a sample from cells, expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide, treated with a candidate modulator relative to kinase activity in a sample from similar cells not treated with the candidate modulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ng. Transcriptional Reporters for Downstream Pathway Activation:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intracellular signal initiated by binding of an agonist to a receptor, e.g., ChemerinR, sets in motion a cascade of intracellular events, the ultimate consequence of which is a rapid and detectable change in the transcription or translation of one or more genes. The activity of the receptor can therefore be monitored by measuring the expression of a reporter gene driven by control sequences responsive to ChemerinR activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “promoter” refers to the transcriptional control elements necessary for receptor-mediated regulation of gene expression, including not only the basal promoter, but also any enhancers or transcription-factor binding sites necessary for receptor-regulated expression. By selecting promoters that are responsive to the intracellular signals resulting from agonist binding, and operatively linking the selected promoters to reporter genes whose transcription, translation or ultimate activity is readily detectable and measurable, the transcription based reporter assay provides a rapid indication of whether a given receptor is activated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReporter genes such as luciferase, CAT, GFP, β-lactamase or β-galactosidase are well known in the art, as are assays for the detection of their products.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenes particularly well suited for monitoring receptor activity are the “immediate early” genes, which are rapidly induced, generally within minutes of contact between the receptor and the effector protein or ligand. The induction of immediate early gene transcription does not require the synthesis of new regulatory proteins. In addition to rapid responsiveness to ligand binding, characteristics of preferred genes useful to make reporter constructs include: low or undetectable expression in quiescent cells; induction that is transient and independent of new protein synthesis; subsequent shut-off of transcription requires new protein synthesis; and mRNAs transcribed from these genes have a short half-life. It is preferred, but not necessary that a transcriptional control element have all of these properties for it to be useful.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn example of a gene that is responsive to a number of different stimuli is the c-fos proto-oncogene. The c-fos gene is activated in a protein-synthesis-independent manner by growth factors, hormones, differentiation-specific agents, stress, and other known inducers of cell surface proteins. The induction of c-fos expression is extremely rapid, often occurring within minutes of receptor stimulation. This characteristic makes the c-fos regulatory regions particularly attractive for use as a reporter of receptor activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe c-fos regulatory elements include (see, Verma et al., 1987, Cell 51: 513-514): a TATA box that is required for transcription initiation; two upstream elements for basal transcription, and an enhancer, which includes an element with dyad symmetry and which is required for induction by TPA, serum, EGF, and PMA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 20 bp c-fos transcriptional enhancer element located between −317 and −298 bp upstream from the c-fos mRNA cap site, is essential for serum induction in serum starved NIH 3T3 cells. One of the two upstream elements is located at −63 to −57 and it resembles the consensus sequence for cAMP regulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe transcription factor CREB (cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein) is, as the name implies, responsive to levels of intracellular cAMP. Therefore, the activation of a receptor that signals via modulation of cAMP levels can be monitored by measuring either the binding of the transcription factor, or the expression of a reporter gene linked to a CREB-binding element (termed the CRE, or cAMP response element). The DNA sequence of the CRE is TGACGTCA (SEQ ID NO: 75). Reporter constructs responsive to CREB binding activity are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,919,649.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther promoters and transcriptional control elements, in addition to the c-fos elements and CREB-responsive constructs, include the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) gene promoter (cAMP responsive; Fink et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85:6662-6666); the somatostatin gene promoter (cAMP responsive; Montminy et al., 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 8.3:6682-6686); the proenkephalin promoter (responsive to cAMP, nicotinic agonists, and phorbol esters; Comb et al., 1986, Nature 323:353-356); the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy-kinase (PEPCK) gene promoter (cAMP responsive; Short et al., 1986, J. Biol. Chem. 261:9721-9726).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional examples of transcriptional control elements that are responsive to changes in GPCR activity include, but are not limited to those responsive to the AP-1 transcription factor and those responsive to NF-κB activity. The consensus AP-1 binding site is the palindrome TGA(C/G)TCA (Lee et al., 1987, Nature 325: 368-372; Lee et al., 1987, \nCell \n49: 741-752). The AP-1 site is also responsible for mediating induction by tumor promoters such as the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-β-acetate (TPA), and are therefore sometimes also referred to as a TRE, for TPA-response element. AP-1 activates numerous genes that are involved in the early response of cells to growth stimuli. Examples of AP-1-responsive genes include, but are not limited to the genes for Fos and Jun (which proteins themselves make up AP-1 activity), Fos-related antigens (Fra) 1 and 2, IκBα, ornithine decarboxylase, and annexins I and II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe NF-κB binding element has the consensus sequence GGGGACTTTCC (SEQ ID NO: 81). A large number of genes have been identified as NF-x3 responsive, and their control elements can be linked to a reporter gene to monitor GPCR activity. A small sample of the genes responsive to NF-κB includes those encoding IL-1β (Hiscott et al., 1993, Mol. Cell. Biol. 13: 6231-6240), TNF-α (Shakhov et al., 1990, J. Exp. Med. 171: 35-47), CCR5 (Liu et al., 1998, AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses 14: 1509-1519), P-selectin (Pan & McEver, 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 270: 23077-23083), Fas ligand (Matsui et al., 1998, J. Immunol. 161: 3469-3473), GM-CSF (Schreck & Baeuerle, 1990, Mol. Cell. Biol. 10: 1281-1286) and IκBα (Haskill et al., 1991, Cell 65: 1281-1289). Each of these references is incorporated herein by reference. Vectors encoding NF-κB-responsive reporters are also known in the art or can be readily made by one of skill in the art using, for example, synthetic NF-κB elements and a minimal promoter, or using the NF-κB-responsive sequences of a gene known to be subject to NF-κB regulation. Further, NF-κB responsive reporter constructs are commercially available from, for example, CLONTECH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA given promoter construct should be tested by exposing ChemerinR-expressing cells, transfected with the construct, to a Chemerin polypeptide. An increase of at least two-fold in the expression of reporter in response to Chemerin polypeptide indicates that the reporter is an indicator of ChemerinR activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to assay ChemerinR activity with a Chemerin-responsive transcriptional reporter construct, cells that stably express a ChemerinR polypeptide are stably transfected with the reporter construct. To screen for agonists, the cells are left untreated, exposed to candidate modulators, or exposed to a Chemerin polypeptide, and expression of the reporter is measured. The Chemerin-treated cultures serve as a standard for the level of transcription induced by a known agonist. An increase of at least 50% in reporter expression in the presence of a candidate modulator indicates that the candidate is a modulator of ChemerinR activity. An agonist will induce at least as much, and preferably the same amount or more, reporter expression than the Chemerin polypeptide. This approach can also be used to screen for inverse agonists where cells express a ChemerinR polypeptide at levels such that there is an elevated basal activity of the reporter in the absence of Chemerin or another agonist. A decrease in reporter activity of 10% or more in the presence of a candidate modulator, relative to its absence, indicates that the compound is an inverse agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo screen for antagonists, the cells expressing ChemerinR and carrying the reporter construct are exposed to a Chemerin polypeptide (or another agonist) in the presence and absence of candidate modulator. A decrease of 10% or more in reporter expression in the presence of candidate modulator, relative to the absence of the candidate modulator, indicates that the candidate is a modulator of ChemerinR activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControls for transcription assays include cells not expressing ChemerinR but carrying the reporter construct, as well as cells with a promoterless reporter construct. Compounds that are identified as modulators of ChemerinR-regulated transcription should also be analyzed to determine whether they affect transcription driven by other regulatory sequences and by other receptors, in order to determine the specificity and spectrum of their activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe transcriptional reporter assay, and most cell-based assays, are well suited for screening expression libraries for proteins for those that modulate ChemerinR activity. The libraries can be, for example, cDNA libraries from natural sources, e.g., plants, animals, bacteria, etc., or they can be libraries expressing randomly or systematically mutated variants of one or more polypeptides. Genomic libraries in viral vectors can also be used to express the mRNA content of one cell or tissue, in the different libraries used for screening of ChemerinR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the assays of receptor activity, including the GTP-binding, GTPase, adenylate cyclase, cAMP, phospholipid-breakdown, diacylglyceorl, inositol triphosphate, PKC, kinase and transcriptional reporter assays, can be used to determine the presence of an agent in a sample, e.g., a tissue sample, that affects the activity of the ChemerinR receptor molecule. To do so, ChemerinR polypeptide is assayed for activity in the presence and absence of the sample or an extract of the sample. An increase in ChemerinR activity in the presence of the sample or extract relative to the absence of the sample indicates that the sample contains an agonist of the receptor activity. A decrease in receptor activity in the presence of Chemerin or another agonist and the sample, relative to receptor activity in the presence of Chemerin polypeptide alone, indicates that the sample contains an antagonist of ChemerinR activity. If desired, samples can then be fractionated and further tested to isolate or purify the agonist or antagonist. The amount of increase or decrease in measured activity necessary for a sample to be said to contain a modulator depends upon the type of assay used. Generally, a 10% or greater change (increase or decrease) relative to an assay performed in the absence of a sample indicates the presence of a modulator in the sample. One exception is the transcriptional reporter assay, in which at least a two-fold increase or 10% decrease in signal is necessary for a sample to be said to contain a modulator. It is preferred that an agonist stimulates at least 50%, and preferably 75% or 100% or more, e.g., 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold or greater receptor activation than wild-type Chemerin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther functional assays include, for example, microphysiometer or biosensor assays (see Hafner, 2000, Biosens. Bioelectron. 15: 149-158, incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \nII. Diagnostic Assays Based upon the Interaction of ChemerinR and Chemerin:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSignaling through GPCRs is instrumental in the pathology of a large number of diseases and disorders. ChemerinR, which is expressed in cells of the lymphocyte lineages and which has been shown to act as a co-receptor for immunodeficiency viruses can have a role in immune processes, disorders or diseases. The ChemerinR expression pattern also includes bone and cartilage, indicating that this receptor can play a role in diseases, disorders or processes (e.g., fracture healing) affecting these tissues. Expression in adult parathyroid suggests possible importance in phosphocalic metabolism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of its expression in cells of the lymphocyte lineages, ChemerinR can be involved in the body's response to viral infections or in diseases induced by various viruses, including HIV types I and II, or bacteria. The expression pattern of ChemerinR and the knowledge with respect to disorders generally mediated by GPCRs suggests that ChemerinR can be involved in disturbances of cell migration, cancer, development of tumors and tumor metastasis, inflammatory and neo-plastic processes, wound and bone healing and dysfunction of regulatory growth functions, diabetes, obesity, anorexia, bulimia, acute heart failure, hypotension, hypertension, urinary retention, osteoporosis, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, restenosis, atherosclerosis, diseases characterised by excessive smooth muscle cell proliferation, aneurysms, diseases characterised by loss of smooth muscle cells or reduced smooth muscle cell proliferation, stroke, ischemia, ulcers, allergies, benign prostatic hypertrophy, migraine, vomiting, psychotic and neurological disorders, including anxiety, schizophrenia, manic depression, depression, delirium, dementia and severe mental retardation, degenerative diseases, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease, and dyskinasias, such as Huntington's disease or Gilles de la Tourett's syndrome and other related diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe interaction of ChemerinR with Chemerin can be used as the basis of assays for the diagnosis or monitoring of diseases, disorders or processes involving ChemerinR signaling. Diagnostic assays for ChemerinR-related diseases or disorders can have several different forms. First, diagnostic assays can measure the amount of ChemerinR and/or Chemerin polypeptide, genes or mRNA in a sample of tissue. Assays that measure the amount of mRNA encoding either or both of these polypeptides also fit in this category. Second, assays can evaluate the qualities of the receptor or the ligand. For example, assays that determine whether an individual expresses a mutant or variant form of either ChemerinR or Chemerin, or both, can be used diagnostically. Third, assays that measure one or more activities of ChemerinR polypeptide can be used diagnostically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA. Assays that Measure the Amount of ChemerinR or Chemerin\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemerinR and Chemerin levels can be measured and compared to standards in order to determine whether an abnormal level of the receptor or its ligand is present in a sample, either of which indicate probable dysregulation of ChemerinR signaling. Polypeptide levels are measured, for example, by immunohistochemistry using antibodies specific for the polypeptide. A sample isolated from an individual suspected of suffering from a disease or disorder characterized by ChemerinR activity is contacted with an antibody for ChemerinR or Chemerin, and binding of the antibody is measured as known in the art (e.g., by measurement of the activity of an enzyme conjugated to a secondary antibody).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother approach to the measurement of ChemerinR and/or Chemerin polypeptide levels uses flow cytometry analysis of cells from an affected tissue. Methods of flow cytometry, including the fluorescent labeling of antibodies specific for ChemerinR or Chemerin, are well known in the art. Other approaches include radioimmunoassay or ELISA. Methods for each of these are also well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of binding detected is compared to the binding in a sample of similar tissue from a healthy individual, or from a site on the affected individual that is not so affected. An increase of 10% or more relative to the standard is diagnostic for a disease or disorder characterized by ChemerinR dysregulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemerinR and Chemerin expression can also be measured by determining the amount of mRNA encoding either or both of the polypeptides in a sample of tissue. mRNA can be quantitated by quantitative or semi-quantitative PCR. Methods of “quantitative” amplification are well known to those of skill in the art, and primer sequences for the amplification of both ChemerinR and Chemerin are disclosed herein. A common method of quantitative PCR involves simultaneously co-amplifying a known quantity of a control sequence using the same primers. This provides an internal standard that can be used to calibrate the PCR reaction. Detailed protocols for quantitative PCR are provided in \nPCR Protocols, A Guide to Methods and Applications\n, Innis et al., Academic Press, Inc. N.Y., (1990), which is incorporated herein by reference. An increase of 10% or more in the amount of mRNA encoding ChemerinR or Chemerin in a sample, relative to the amount expressed in a sample of like tissue from a healthy individual or in a sample of tissue from an unaffected location in an affected individual is diagnostic for a disease or disorder characterized by dysregulation of ChemerinR signaling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. Qualitative Assays\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays that evaluate whether or not the ChemerinR polypeptide or the mRNA encoding it are wild-type or not can be used diagnostically. In order to diagnose a disease or disorder characterized by ChemerinR or Chemerin dysregulation in this manner, RNA isolated from a sample is used as a template for PCR amplification of Chemerin and/or ChemerinR. The amplified sequences are then either directly sequenced using standard methods, or are first cloned into a vector, followed by sequencing. A difference in the sequence that changes one or more encoded amino acids relative to the sequence of wild-type ChemerinR or Chemerin can be diagnostic of a disease or disorder characterized by dysregulation of ChemerinR signaling. It can be useful, when a change in coding sequence is identified in a sample, to express the variant receptor or ligand and compare its activity to that of wild type ChemerinR or Chemerin. Among other benefits, this approach can provide novel mutants, including constitutively active and null mutants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to standard sequencing methods, amplified sequences can be assayed for the presence of specific mutations using, for example, hybridization of molecular beacons that discriminate between wild-type and variant sequences. Hybridization assays that discriminate on the basis of changes as small as one nucleotide are well known in the art. Alternatively, any of a number of “minisequencing” assays can be performed, including, those described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,888,819, 6,004,744 and 6,013,431 (incorporated herein by reference). These assays and others known in the art can determine the presence, in a given sample, of a nucleic acid with a known polymorphism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf desired, array or microarray-based methods can be used to analyze the expression or the presence of mutation, in ChemerinR or Chemerin sequences. Array-based methods for minisequencing and for quantitation of nucleic acid expression are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC. Functional Assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiagnosis of a disease or disorder characterized by the dysregulation of ChemerinR signaling can also be performed using functional assays. To do so, cell membranes or cell extracts prepared from a tissue sample are used in an assay of ChemerinR activity as described herein (e.g., ligand binding assays, the GTP-binding assay, GTPase assay, adenylate cyclase assay, cAMP assay, phospholipid breakdown, diacyl glycerol or inositol triphosphate assays, PKC activation assay, or kinase assay). The activity detected is compared to that in a standard sample taken from a healthy individual or from an unaffected site on the affected individual. As an alternative, a sample or extract of a sample can be applied to cells expressing ChemerinR, followed by measurement of ChemerinR signaling activity relative to a standard sample. A difference of 10% or more in the activity measured in any of these assays, relative to the activity of the standard, is diagnostic for a disease or disorder characterized by dysregulation of ChemerinR signaling.\n\n\n \nModulation of ChemerinR Activity in a Cell According to the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe discovery of Chemerin as a ligand of ChemerinR provides methods of modulating the activity of a ChemerinR polypeptide in a cell. ChemerinR activity is modulated in a cell by delivering to that cell an agent that modulates the function of a ChemerinR polypeptide. This modulation can be performed in cultured cells as part of an assay for the identification of additional modulating agents, or, for example, in an animal, including a human. Agents include Chemerin polypeptides as defined herein, as well as additional modulators identified using the screening methods described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn agent can be delivered to a cell by adding it to culture medium. The amount to deliver will vary with the identity of the agent and with the purpose for which it is delivered. For example, in a culture assay to identify antagonists of ChemerinR activity, one will preferably add an amount of Chemerin polypeptide that half-maximally activates the receptors (e.g., approximately EC\n50\n), preferably without exceeding the dose required for receptor saturation. This dose can be determined by titrating the amount of Chemerin polypeptide to determine the point at which further addition of Chemerin has no additional effect on ChemerinR activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a modulator of ChemerinR activity is administered to an animal for the treatment of a disease or disorder, the amount administered can be adjusted by one of skill in the art on the basis of the desired outcome. Successful treatment is achieved when one or more measurable aspects of the pathology (e.g., tumor cell growth, accumulation of inflammatory cells) is changed by at least 10% relative to the value for that aspect prior to treatment.\n\n\n \nCandidate Modulators Useful According to the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nCandidate modulators can be screened from large libraries of synthetic or natural compounds. Numerous means are currently used for random and directed synthesis of saccharide, peptide, lipid, carbohydrate, and nucleic acid based compounds. Synthetic compound libraries are commercially available from a number of companies including, for example, Maybridge Chemical Co. (Trevillet, Cornwall, UK), Comgenex (Princeton, N.J.), Brandon Associates (Merrimack, N.H.), and Microsource (New Milford, Conn.). A rare chemical library is available from Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis.). Combinatorial libraries of small organic molecules are available and can be prepared. Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant and animal extracts are available from e.g., Pan Laboratories (Bothell, Wash.) or MycoSearch (NC), or are readily produceable by methods well known in the art. Additionally, natural and synthetically produced libraries and compounds are readily modified through conventional chemical, physical, and biochemical means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted previously herein, candidate modulators can also be variants of known polypeptides (e.g., Chemerin, antibodies) or nucleic acids (e.g., aptamers) encoded in a nucleic acid library. Cells (e.g., bacteria, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells) transformed with the library can be grown and prepared as extracts, which are then applied in ChemerinR binding assays or functional assays of ChemerinR activity.\n\n\n \nIII. Antibodies Useful According to the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides for antibodies to ChemerinR and Chemerin. Antibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, multispecific, human, humanized or chimeric antibodies, single-chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab′) fragments, etc. The antibodies of the invention can be any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA, and IgY), class (e.g., IgG1-4, IgA1-2), or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is an IgG isotype. In another preferred embodiment, the antibody is an IgG1 isotype. In another preferred embodiment, the antibody is an IgG2 isotype. In another preferred embodiment, the antibody is an IgG4 isotype.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the invention may bind specifically to a polypeptide or polypeptide fragment or variant of Chemerin. Preferably, the antibodies of the invention bind specifically to the full-length Chemerin polypeptide. Also preferably, the antibodies of the invention bind specifically to the 157 amino acid truncated Preprochemerin polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 73). Also preferably, the antibodies of the invention bind specifically to the 19 amino acid Chemerin polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 53). Also preferably, the antibodies of the invention bind specifically to the 9 amino acid Chemerin polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 59). Also preferably, the antibodies of the invention bind specifically to the Chemerin fragment FSKALPRS (SEQ ID NO: 89).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the invention may act as agonists or antagonists of the polypeptides of the invention. For example, the antibodies of the invention disrupt the Chemerin/ChemerinR interactions. The invention also features the antibodies that do not disrupt the Chemerin/ChemerinR interactions but disrupt the ChemerinR activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the invention may be used, for example, but not limited to, to purify, detect, and target the polypeptides of the invention, including both in vitro and in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic methods. For example, the antibodies of the invention can be used in immunoassays for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring levels of the polypeptides of the present invention in biological samples (\nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual\n, Ed. by Harlow and Lane (Cold Spring Harbor Press: 1988)). The antibodies of the invention may be used either alone or in combination with other compositions. The antibodies may further be recombinantly fused to a heterologous polypeptide at the N- or C-terminus or chemically conjugated (including covalently and non-covalently conjugations) to polypeptides or other compositions. The antibodies of the invention may also be modified by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibodies, including by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies can be made using standard protocols known in the art (See, for example, \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual\n, Ed. by Harlow and Lane (Cold Spring Harbor Press: 1988)). A mammal, such as a mouse, hamster, or rabbit can be immunized with an immunogenic form of the peptide (e.g., a ChemerinR or Chemerin polypeptide or an antigenic fragment which is capable of eliciting an antibody response, or a fusion protein as described herein above). Immunogens for raising antibodies are prepared by mixing the polypeptides (e.g., isolated recombinant polypeptides or synthetic peptides) with adjuvant. Alternatively, ChemerinR or Chemerin polypeptides or peptides are made as fusion proteins to larger immunogenic proteins. Polypeptides can also be covalently linked to other larger immunogenic proteins, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Alternatively, plasmid or viral vectors encoding ChemerinR or Chemerin, or a fragment of these proteins, can be used to express the polypeptides and generate an immune response in an animal as described in Costagliola et al., 2000, \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n105:803-811, which is incorporated herein by reference. In order to raise antibodies, immunogens are typically administered intradermally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly to experimental animals such as rabbits, sheep, and mice. In addition to the antibodies discussed above, genetically engineered antibody derivatives can be made, such as single chain antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe progress of immunization can be monitored by detection of antibody titers in plasma or serum. Standard ELISA, flow cytometry or other immunoassays can also be used with the immunogen as antigen to assess the levels of antibodies. Antibody preparations can be simply serum from an immunized animal, or if desired, polyclonal antibodies can be isolated from the serum by, for example, affinity chromatography using immobilized immunogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo produce monoclonal antibodies, antibody-producing splenocytes can be harvested from an immunized animal and fused by standard somatic cell fusion procedures with immortalizing cells such as myeloma cells to yield hybridoma cells. Such techniques are well known in the art, and include, for example, the hybridoma technique (originally developed by Kohler and Milstein, (1975) \nNature, \n256: 495-497), the human B cell hybridoma technique (Kozbar et al., (1983) \nImmunology Today, \n4:72), and the EBV-hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., (1985) \nMonoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy\n, Alan R. Liss, Inc. pp. 77-96). Hybridoma cells can be screened immunochemically for production of antibodies specifically reactive with a Chemerin or ChemerinR peptide or polypeptide, and monoclonal antibodies isolated from the media of a culture comprising such hybridoma cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody fragments of the invention may be generated by known techniques. For example, Fab and F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments of the invention may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments).\n\n\n \nIV. Therapeutic Approaches Based on the Interaction of Chemerin and ChemerinR\n\n\nComposition or Therapeutic Composition and Administration Thereof\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides composition or therapeutic compositions that contain a Chemerin polypeptide or a Chemerin nucleic acid sequence as described above. The therapeutic compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound including a Chemerin, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a preferred embodiment, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment, the composition of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, a composition will be administered in a single dosage in the range of 100 μg-100 mg/kg body weight, preferably in the range of 1 μg-100 μg/kg body weight. This dosage may be repeated daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or as considered appropriate by the treating physician. Alternatively, the therapeutically effective amount of the composition of the invention can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides methods of treatment and inhibition for a disease or disorder by administration to a subject of an effective amount of a composition or therapeutic composition of the invention, preferably a nucleic acid or a polypeptide Chemerin molecule. In one aspect, the composition is substantially free from substances that limit effect or produce undesired side-effects of Chemerin. The subject can be any animal, and is preferably a mammal, and preferably a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious delivery systems known in the art can be used to administer a composition of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the composition of the invention, receptor-mediated endocytosis, etc, which are incorporated by reference herein. Methods of introduction include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The compositions of the invention may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, it may be desirable to introduce the compositions or the therapeutic compositions of the invention into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection; intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious diseases or disorders can be treated with the compositions or therapeutic compositions of the invention. They include, but are not limited to, neoplasms located in the: colon, abdomen, bone, breast, digestive system, liver, pancreas, peritoneum, endocrine glands (adrenal, parathyroid, pituitary, testicles, ovary, thymus, thyroid), eye, head and neck, nervous (central and peripheral), lymphatic system, pelvic, skin, soft tissue, spleen, thoracic, and urogenital, as well as hypergammaglobulinemia, lymphoproliferative diseases, disorders, and/or conditions, paraproteinemias, purpura, sarcoidosis, Sezary Syndrome, Waldenstron's Macroglobulinemia, Gaucher's Disease, histiocytosis, and any other hyperproliferative disease.\n\n\n \nTransgenic Animals Useful According to the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nTransgenic animals expressing ChemerinR or Chemerin or variants thereof are useful to study the signaling through ChemerinR, as well as for the study of drugs or agents that modulate the activity of ChemerinR. A transgenic animal is a non-human animal containing at least one foreign gene, called a transgene, which is part of its genetic material. Preferably, the transgene is contained in the animal's germ line such that it can be transmitted to the animal's offspring. A number of techniques may be used to introduce the transgene into an animal's genetic material, including, but not limited to, microinjection of the transgene into pronuclei of fertilized eggs and manipulation of embryonic stem cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,191 by Wagner and Hoppe; Palmiter and Brinster, 1986, Ann. Rev. Genet., 20:465-499; French Patent Application 2593827 published Aug. 7, 1987, all of which are incorporated herein by reference). Transgenic animals can carry the transgene in all their cells or can be genetically mosaic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the method of conventional transgenesis, additional copies of normal or modified genes are injected into the male pronucleus of the zygote and become integrated into the genomic DNA of the recipient mouse. The transgene is transmitted in a Mendelian manner in established transgenic strains. Transgenes can be constitutively expressed or can be tissue specific or even responsive to an exogenous drug, e.g., Tetracycline. A transgenic animal expressing one transgene can be crossed to a second transgenic animal expressing a second transgene such that their offspring will carry and express both transgenes.\n\n\n \nKnock-Out Animals\n\n\n \n \n \nAnimals bearing a homozygous deletion in the chromosomal sequences encoding either ChemerinR or Chemerin or variants can be used to study the function of the receptor and ligand. Of particular interest is whether a Chemerin knockout has a distinct phenotype, which may point to whether Chemerin is the only ligand that binds ChemerinR or if it is a member of a family. Of further particular interest is the identification of identification of ChemerinR/Chemerin in specific physiological and/or pathological processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ni. Standard Knock Out Animals\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKnock out animals are produced by the method of creating gene deletions with homologous recombination. This technique is based on the development of embryonic stem (ES) cells that are derived from embryos, are maintained in culture and have the capacity to participate in the development of every tissue in the animals when introduced into a host blastocyst. A knock out animal is produced by directing homologous recombination to a specific target gene in the ES cells, thereby producing a null allele of the gene. The technology for making knock-out animals is well described (see, for example, Huszar et al., 1997, Cell, 88:131; and Ohki-Hamazaki et al., 1997, Nature, 390:165, both of which are incorporated herein by reference). One of skill in the art can generate a homozygous ChemerinR or Chemerin knock-out animal (e.g., a mouse) using the sequences for ChemerinR and Chemerin (disclosed herein and known in the art) to make the gene targeting construct.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nii. Tissue Specific Knock Out\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method of targeted homologous recombination has been improved by the development of a system for site-specific recombination based on the bacteriophage P1 site specific recombinase Cre. The Cre-loxP site-specific DNA recombinase from bacteriophage P1 is used in transgenic mouse assays in order to create gene knockouts restricted to defined tissues or developmental stages. Regionally restricted genetic deletion, as opposed to global gene knockout, has the advantage that a phenotype can be attributed to a particular cell/tissue (Marth, 1996, \nClin. Invest. \n97: 1999). In the Cre-loxP system one transgenic mouse strain is engineered such that loxP sites flank one or more exons of the gene of interest. Homozygotes for this so called ‘foxed gene’ are crossed with a second transgenic mouse that expresses the Cre gene under control of a cell/tissue type transcriptional promoter. Cre protein then excises DNA between loxP recognition sequences and effectively removes target gene function (Sauer, 1998, \nMethods, \n14:381). There are now many in vivo examples of this method, including, for instance, the inducible inactivation of mammary tissue specific genes (Wagner et al., 1997, \nNucleic Acids Res., \n25:4323). One of skill in the art can therefore generate a tissue-specific knock-out animal in which ChemerinR or Chemerin is homozygously eliminated in a chosen tissue or cell type.\n\n\n \nKits Useful According to the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides for kits useful for screening for modulators of ChemerinR activity, as well as kits useful for diagnosis of diseases or disorders characterized by dysregulation of ChemerinR signaling. Kits useful according to the invention can include an isolated ChemerinR polypeptide (including a membrane- or cell-associated ChemerinR polypeptide, e.g., on isolated membranes, cells expressing ChemerinR, or, on an SPR chip) and an isolated Chemerin polypeptide. A kit can also comprise an antibody specific for ChemerinR and/or an antibody for Chemerin. Alternatively, or in addition, a kit can contain cells transformed to express a ChemerinR polypeptide and/or cells transformed to express a Chemerin polypeptide. In a further embodiment, a kit according to the invention can contain a polynucleotide encoding a ChemerinR polypeptide and/or a polynucleotide encoding a Chemerin polypeptide. In a still further embodiment, a kit according to the invention may comprise the specific primers useful for amplification of ChemerinR or Chemerin as described below. All kits according to the invention will comprise the stated items or combinations of items and packaging materials therefor. Kits will also include instructions for use.\n\n\n \nExpression Vectors\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to vectors containing the Chemerin and host cells, as well as the production of the Chemerin polypeptide by recombinant techniques. The vector may be a phage, plasmid, viral, or retroviral vector. The Chemerin polynucleotides may be joined to a vector containing a selectable marker propagation in a host. The Chemerin polynucleotide should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter, as the phage lambda PL promoter, the \nE. coli \nlac, trp, phoA and tac promoters, the SV40 early and late promoters and promoters of retroviral LTRs. The expression vectors will further contain sites for transcription initiation, termination, and, in the transcribed region, a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the transcripts expressed by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiating codon at the beginning and a termination codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) appropriately positioned at the end of the polypeptide to be translated. The expressing vectors will also include one or more promoters. Suitable promoters which may be employed include, but are not limited to, retroviral LTR, the SV40 promoter, adenoviral promoters; heterologous promoters, such as the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter; the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) promoter; inducible promoters, such as the MMT promoter, the metallothionein promoter; heat shock promoters; the albumin promoter; the ApoAI promoter; human globin promoters; viral thymidine kinase promoters, such as the Herpes Simplex thymidine kinase promoter; retroviral LTRs (including the modified retroviral LTRs hereinabove described).; the .beta.-actin promoter; and human growth hormone promoters. The promoter also may be the native promoter which controls the genes encoding the polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs indicated, the expression vectors will preferably include at least one selectable marker. Such markers include dihydrofolate reductase, G418, glutamine synthase or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture and tetracycline, kanamycin or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in \nE. coli \nand other bacteria. Representative examples of appropriate hosts include, but are not limited to, bacterial cells, such as \nE. coli, Streptomyces \nand \nSalmonella typhimurium \ncells; fungal cells, such as yeast cells (e.g., \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae \nor \nPichia pastoris \n(ATCC Accession No. 201178)); insect cells such as \nDrosophila \nS2 and \nSpodoptera \nSf9 cells; animal cells such as CHO, NSO, COS, 293, and Bowes melanoma cells; and plant cells. Appropriate culture mediums and conditions for the above-described host cells are known in the art.\n\n\n \nGene Transfer Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nGene therapy has been studied and used for treating various types of diseases. Generally, gene therapy comprises delivering a gene of interest to cells affected with diseases for correction of abnormal conditions. The invention provides for gene transfer methods of the Chemerin gene for treatment of diseases including tumors/cancers such as cancers in lung, prostate, oesophagus, Pharynx, Colon-rectum, liver-bilary tract, stomach, larynx, pancreas, bladder, breast, colon-rectum, ovary, stomach, womb-leasing, pancreas, lung, liver, lymphoma, leukemia. Gene transfer of the Chemerin gene in accordance with the present invention can be accomplished through many means, including by both viral vectors and by non-viral methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe non-viral gene transfer methods include plasmid DNA expression vectors, liposomes, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and particle-mediated (gene gun) methods etc. All these methods are well known in the art and are incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe viral gene transfer methods include retrovirus (including lentivirus), adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, herpes simplex virus, vaccinia, fowlpox, canarypox virus, Sindbis virus etc, which are well known in the art. In one embodiment, the gene transfer relates to recombinant retrovirus vectors such as the virus based on Mouse Moloney Leukemia virus, the chimeric Moloney-Human lentiviral (HIV) vector etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the gene transfer relates to human adenoviruses. The human adenovirus is a 36 kb double-stranded DNA virus containing genes that express more than 50 gene products throughout its life cycle. By eliminating the E1 region of the vector, the virus lacks ability to self-replicate and space is made for placing therapeutic expression sequences. The adenovirus vectors have been shown to be especially efficient at transferring genes into most tissues after in vivo administration. In another particular embodiment, the adenovirus vector can be modified to exhibit tissue-specific, tumor-selective expression (Doronin, K et al. (2001) \nJ. Virology, \n75:3314-3324). In one example, the adenovirus promoter E1A region is deleted and replaced with a modified promoter for α-fectoprotein (AFP). The expression of this modified adenovirus vector is limited to hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hallenbeck, P L et al. (1999) \nHuman Gene Ther. \n10:1721-1733). In another example, the adenovirus E4 promoter region is deleted and replaced with the promoter for surfactant protein B (SPB). The expression of the modified adenovirus is limited to lung carcinoma cells (Doronin, K et al. (2001) \nJ. Virology, \n75:3314-3324).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the gene transfer relates to recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. The AAV vectors contain small, single-stranded DNA genomes and have been shown to transduce brain, skeletal muscle, and liver tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells targeted for gene transfer include any cells to which the delivery of the Chemerin gene is desired. Generally, the cells are those affected with diseases such as but not limited to tumoric cells. Various mammalian cell lines can also be employed for gene transfer, examples includes, but not limited to, COS-7 lines of monkey kidney fibroblasts, described by Gluzman, \nCell \n23:175 (1981), and other cell lines capable of expressing a compatible vector, for example, the C127, 3T3, CHO, HeLa and BHK cell lines. In particular, the cells are cell lines derived from tissues affected by dieseases, such as cancer cell lines.\n\n\n \nEx Vivo Therapeutic Approaches Based on the Interaction of Chemerin and ChemerinR\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ex vivo gene therapy involves removing cells from the blood or tissues of a subject, genetically modifying in vitro, and subsequently transplanting back into the same recipient. In one embodiment, a nucleic acid sequence is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting reombination cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art, including but not limited to transfection, electroporation, microinjection, infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequence, cell fusion, chromosome-mediated gene transfer, microcell-mediated gene transfer, shperoplast fusion, etc, all are known in the art. The gene transfer methods should provide for stable transfer of the nucleic acid sequence to the cell, so that the nucleic acid sequence is expressible in the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny. The resulting recombinant blood cells are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect, patient state, etc., and can be determined by one skilled in the art. Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired, available cell type, and include but are not limited to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, muscle cells, hepatocytes; blood cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, granulocytes; various stem or progenitor cells, in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, e.g., as obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, fetal liver, etc. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence encodes a Chemerin polypeptide including the polypeptides ranging from the truncated to the full-length and the variants of the Chemerin polypeptide that bind specifically to a ChemerinR polypeptide. In a preferred embodiment, the cell used for ex vivo gene therapy is autologous to the recipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment, cells used are dendritic cells. For example, dendritic cells can be derived from hematopoietic progenitors or from adherent peripheral blood monocytes. The cultured dendritic cells are then loaded with tumor-associated antigens. Tumor antigen loading can be accomplished by a variety of techniques including (1) pulsing with purified defined peptides or modified tumor lysate, (2) co-culture with apoptotic tumor cells, (3) transfection with RNA, (4) fusion with tumor cells, or (5) gene transfer with viral or non-viral gene transfer systems as described above. The loaded dendritic cells are injected into a subject for stimulating immune response of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, cells can be pulsed with different types of compositions, preferably proteins or peptides. Such technique is known to one skilled in the art and is described in Nestle et al. (1998) Nat. Med. 4:328-332. Briefly, cells are transferred into a suitable medium and incubated in vitro for an appropriate time with the composition. The cells are then washed and resuspended in a suitable volume of medium for in vivo transfer. In a preferred embodiment, the cells used for peptide pulsing are of the same species as the individual to whom the composition should be applied. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the cells are autologous to the recipient. In another particularly preferred embodiment, the cells are dendritic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticular examples of ex vivo dendritic cell gene therapy include those that have been assessed in melanoma (Nestle et al. (1998) \nNat. Med. \n4:328-332), renal cancer (Kurokawa et al. (2001), \nInt. J. Cancer, \n91:749-756), glioma (Yu et al (2001), Cancer Res., 61:842-847), breast and ovarian (Brossart et al. (2000), \nBlood, \n96:3102-3108), prostate (Burch et al. (2000), \nClin. Cancer Res., \n6:2175-2182), gastrointestinal, colon and lung (Fong et al. (2001) \nJ. Immunl., \n166:4254-4259).\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Gene Therapy\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides in vivo gene therapy methods. Such methods involve the direct administration of nucleic acid or a nucleic acid/protein complex into the individual being treated. For example, successful examples of animal models with in vivo gene therapy can be found in treatment of lung cancer (Zhang and Roth (1994), \nIn Vivo, \n8(5):755-769) and cutaneous melanoma (Gary et al. (1993), \nPNAS USA, \n90:11307-11311), etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid or protein is preferably Preprochemerin or ChemerinR (SEQ ID NO: 7), truncated Preprochemerin (SEQ ID NO: 72) or ChemerinR (SEQ ID NO: 1) of the invention. In vivo administration can be accomplished according to a number of established techniques including, but not limited to, injection of naked nucleic acid, viral infection, transport via liposomes and transport by endocytosis as described above. Suitable viral vectors include, for example, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus and retrovirus vectors etc as described in detail above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Preprochemerin or truncated Preprochemerin polynucleotides in a vector can be delivered to the interstitial space of tissues with a subject, including of muscle, skin, brain, lung, liver, spleen, bone marrow, thymus, heart, lymph, blood, bone, cartilage, pancreas, kidney, gall bladder, stomach, intestine, testis, ovary, uterus, rectum, nervous system, eye, gland, and connective tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the Preprochemerin polynucleotides or truncated Preprochemerin/Chemerin or truncated Preprochemerin polypeptides are complexed in a liposome preparation. Liposomal preparations for use in the present invention include cationic, anionic, and neutral preparations, all are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a retroviral vector containing a Preprochemerin or truncated Preprochemerin RNA sequence is used for in vivo gene therapy. In another embodiment of the invention, an adenovirus-associated virus vector containing a preprochemerin or truncated Preprochemerin polynucleotides is used. In another embodiment, an adenovirus vector containing a Preprochemerin polypeptide is used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the viral vectors for gene transfer are adenovirus vectors whose promoters are modified so that the expression of the vectors is limited to a specific tumor or a particular tissue. This type of vectors have the advantages of delivering the gene of interest to the targeted location, thus reducing the chance of harm due to the unspecific delivery of the viral vector to a variety of tissues including the normal cell tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment of the invention, the in vivo gene therapy includes administering the gene that encodes a Preprochemerin or truncated Preprochemerin polypeptide into a subject for stimulating immune response of the subject or therapeutic treatment of a disease. Preferably, the gene encoding a Preprochemerin or truncated Preprochemerin polypeptide is administered by a plasmid vector, or a viral vector, or non-viral methods. Preferably, the gene encoding a Preprochemerin or truncated Preprochemerin polypeptide is administered by a adenovirus vector whose expression is tissue-specific and/or tumor-selective.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polynucleotides encoding Preprochemerin or truncated Preprochemerin may be administered along with other polynucleotides encoding an angiogenic protein. Examples of angiogenic proteins include, but are not limited to, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors, VEGF-1, VEGF-2, VEGF-3, epidermal growth factor alpha and beta, platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor alpha, hepatocyte growth factor, insulin like growth factor, colony stimulating factor, macrophage colony stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor, and nitric oxide synthase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermining an effective amount of substance to be delivered can depend upon a number of factors including, for example, the chemical structure and biological activity of the substance, the age and weight of the animal, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, and the route of administration. The frequency of treatments depends upon a number of factors, such as the amount of polynucleotide constructs administered per dose, as well as the health and history of the subject. The precise amount, number of doses, and timing of doses will be determined by the attending physician or veterinarian.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the following examples, all chemicals are obtained from Sigma, unless stated. The cell culture media are from Gibco BRL and the peptides are from Bachem.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nCloning of Human ChemerinR Receptor\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman ChemerinR was cloned as described in Samson et al. (1998) (SEQ ID NOS: 1 and 2). As an example of one set of steps one could use to clone other ChemerinR polypeptides useful according to the invention, the method is described here. In order to clone the ChemerinR sequence, a classical cloning procedure was performed on human genomic DNA. A clone, designated HOP 102 (ChemerinR), was amplified from human genomic DNA by using degenerate oligonucleotides. \nHOP\n 102 shared 45-50% identity with fMLP and C5a receptors and somewhat lower similarities with the family of chemokine receptors (\nFIG. 5\n). This partial clone was used as a probe to screen a human genomic library and three overlapping lambda clones were isolated. A restriction map of the clones was established and a 1.7 kb XbaI fragment was subcloned in pBS SK+ (Stratagene) and sequenced on both strands. The sequence was found to include the \nHOP\n 102 probe entirely, with 100% identity. This novel gene was named ChemerinR (GenBank Accession No. Y14838).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmplification of coding sequence of ChemerinR resulted in a fragment of 1.1 kb. This fragment was subcloned into the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) vector and sequenced on both strands (\nFIGS. 1 and 2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mouse and rat ortholog genes are disclosed in \nFIGS. 3 and 4\n respectively.\n\n\n \nExample 2a\n\n\nPurification of the Natural Ligand of ChemerinR and Identification of Chemerin\n\n\n \n \n \nApproximately one liter of a human ascitic fluid from a patient with ovarian cancer was prefiltered and then filtered successively through 0.45 and 0.22 μm Millex filters (Millipore).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nstep\n 1, the ascite was directly loaded onto a C18 reverse-phase column (10 mm×100 mm POROS 20 R2 beads, Applied Biosystems) pre-equilibrated with 5% CH\n3\nCN/0.1% TFA at a flow-rate of 20 ml/min at room temperature. A 5-95% gradient of CH\n3\nCN in 0.1% TFA was then applied with a slope of 6%/min. 5-milliliter fractions were collected, and 20 μl of each fraction was set aside and assayed for [Ca\n2+\n] transients in ChemerinR-expressing CHO cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nstep\n 2, the active fractions (approx. 10 fractions eluting between 25 and 40% CH\n3\nCN) were pooled, adjusted at \npH\n 5, filtered through a 20 μm Millex filter (Millipore), diluted 3-fold in acetate buffer at pH 4.8 and then applied to a cation-exchange HPLC column (Polycat 9.6 mm×250 mm, Vydac) pre-equilibrated with acetate buffer at pH 4.8 and 4° C. A 0-1M gradient of NaCl in acetate buffer at pH 4.8 was applied with 10%/min at a flow-rate of 4 ml/min. 1-milliliter fractions were collected and a 25 μl-aliquot from each fraction was used for the [Ca\n2+\n] assay after desalting on a 10 kDa-cut-off membrane (Ultrafree, Millipore).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nstep\n 3, the active fractions (eluted with approx. 700 mM NaCl) were pooled and desalted onto a 10 kDa-cut-off Ultrafree membrane to approx. 10 mM NaCl concentration. The eluates from distinct cation-exchange HPLC runs were pooled and loaded onto a second cation-exchange HPLC column (Polycat 2.1 mm×250 mm, Vydac) pre-equilibrated with acetate buffer at pH 4.8 and 4° C. A 0-1 M gradient of NaCl in acetate buffer at pH 4.8 was applied at a flow-rate of 1 ml/min. with a slope of 2%/min 0.5-milliliter fractions were collected and a 20 μl-aliquot from each fraction was used for intracellular calcium assay after desalting onto a 10 kDa-cut-off Ultrafree membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nstep\n 4, the active fractions were pooled, diluted 8-fold with H\n2\nO/0.1% H\n3\nPO\n4 \nand loaded onto an analytical C18 reverse-phase column (4.6 mm×250 mm, Vydac) pre-equilibrated with 5% CH\n3\nCN/0.1% H\n3\nPO\n4 \nat a flow-rate of 1 ml/min at room temperature. A 5-95% gradient of CH\n3\nCN in 0.1% H\n3\nPO\n4 \nwas applied with a 0.3%/min. gradient between 25 and 40% of CH\n3\nCN. Individual UV absorption peaks (214 nm) were collected manually, and approx. 5% from each fraction volume was assayed for biological activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nstep\n 5, the active peaks (approximatively 28% CH\n3\nCN) were diluted 6-fold with H\n2\nO/0.1% TFA and directly loaded onto a second C18 reverse-phase column (1 mm×50 mm, Vydac) pre-equilibrated with 5% CH\n3\nCN/0.1% TFA at a flow-rate of 0.1 ml/min. at room temperature. A 5-95% gradient of CH\n3\nCN in 0.1% TFA was applied with a 0.3%/min. gradient between 30 and 45% of CH\n3\nCN. The final peak was collected manually at 40% CH\n3\nCN and analysed by mass spectrometry. 800 ml of ovarian cancer ascites fluid yielded 50 fmoles of Chemerin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active fraction was completely dried in a speed-vac and resuspended in 10 μl of 0.1M Tris at pH 8.7. After boiling the sample during 15 min at 95° C., the sample was incubated at 37° C. overnight in the presence of 250 ng of modified trypsin (Promega). The digested sample was then purified by solid-phase extraction onto a C18 ZipTip (Millipore). The eluted sample (1.5 μl in 70% CH\n3\nCN/0.1% TFA) was applied onto a MALDI target in the presence of 120 mg/ml dihydroxy-benzoic acid matrix and then analysed on a MALDI-Q-TOF prototype (Micromass). Eight peptides were predicted to derive from the product of the human tazarotene-induced gene (Tig)-2 (\nFIG. 20\n), covering 91 aminoacids out of the 143 aminoacid-long sequence of the Tig-2 gene product (after removal of the predicted signal peptide). However, the C-terminal peptide (peptide 8) was not tryptic, lacking the last six amino acids of the predicted protein. This observation indicated that the active compound might result from the proteolytic processing of the encoded precursor (\nFIGS. 12 and 13\n).\n\n\n \nExample 2b\n\n\nPurification of Human Native Chemerin (FIG. \n21\n)\n\n\n \n \n \nOne liter of ascitic fluid was filtered and loaded (50 ml per run) onto a reverse-phase column (10×100 mm, \nPoros\n 20 R2 beads, Applied Biosystems). A 5-95% CH\n3\nCN gradient (6%/min) in 0.1% TFA was applied, 5 ml fractions were collected and assayed for ChemR23 activation. Active fractions were adjusted to pH 4.8 and applied to a cation-exchange HPLC column (Polycat 9.6×250 mm, Vydac) in the presence of 10% CH\n3\nCN, eluted with a 0-1 M NaCl gradient (10%/min) in \nacetate buffer pH\n 5. Active fractions were desalted (Ultrafree, cut-off: 10 kDa, Millipore), loaded onto a second cation-exchange column (Polycat 2.1×250 mm, Vydac) and eluted with the same buffer (2%/min NaCl gradient). Active fractions (0.5 ml, desalted) were pooled, diluted 8-fold with 0.1% H3PO\n4 \nand loaded onto a C18 column (4.6×250 mm, Vydac). A 5-95% CH\n3\nCN gradient (0.3%/min) in 0.1% H\n3\nPO\n4 \nwas applied and individual UV absorption peaks (214 nm) were collected manually and assayed. The active fractions were loaded onto a second C18 column (2.1×250 mm, Vydac, 5-95% CH\n3\nCN in 0.1% TFA, 0.3%/min). The peaks were collected manually and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The use of human material collected for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes was approved by the ethical committee of the Medical School of the Universite Libre de Bruxelles.\n\n\n \nExample 2c\n\n\nMass Spectrometry Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe active fractions were vacuum dried, resuspended in 10 μl of 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.7, heated for 15 min at 95° C., incubated overnight at 37° C. with 250 ng of trypsin (Promega) and purified by solid-phase extraction (C18 ZipTip, Millipore). The digested peptides were eluted in 1.5 μl of 70% CH\n3\nCN/0.1% TFA onto a metallic MALDI target, dried and then mixed in 1.5 μl of matrix mix (2 mg/\nml\n 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 10 mg/ml (-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 2 mM fucose, 5 mM ammonium acetate). For proteic samples excised from SDS/acrylamide gels, the samples were processed as described (14). For determination of the N-terminus of the recombinant protein, the digested peptides were first separated onto a C18 column (1×250 mm, Vydac, 5-95% CH\n3\nCN in 0.1% TFA, 2%/min) and each HPLC fraction was analyzed separately. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a Q-TOF Ultima Global mass spectrometer equipped with a MALDI source (Micromass), and calibrated using the monoisotopic masses of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides from bovine serum albumin. Ionization was achieved using a nitrogen laser (337 nm beam, 10 Hz) and acquisitions were performed in a V mode reflectron position. Microsequencing was performed by argon-induced fragmentation after selection of the parent ion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEight peptides were predicted to derive from the product of the human tazarotene-induced gene (TIG)-2 (\nFIG. 22\n), covering 91 aminoacids out of the 143 aminoacid-long sequence of the TIG-2 gene product (after removal of the predicted signal peptide). However, the C-terminal peptide (peptide 8) was not tryptic lacking the last six amino acids of the predicted protein.

The supernatant containing Chemerin-SEAP-His6 is collected after centrifugation, filtered (0.45 μm) and stored at 4° C. after adding 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.02% sodium azide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor one-step affinity purification of the Chemerin fusion protein, the supernatant is applied to 1 ml of Hisbond resin (Qiagen). After washing, bound Chemerin-SEAP-His6 is eluted with a gradient of imidazol. The concentration of isolated Chemerin-SEAP-His6 is determined by a sandwich type enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Briefly microtiter plates are coated with anti-placental alkaline phosphatase antibody. After blocking with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate buffered saline, the samples are titrated and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, plates are incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-placental alkaline phosphatase diluted 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature, washed again, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 30 min. After washing, bound peroxidase is reacted with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. The reaction is stopped by adding 1 NH\n2\nSO\n4\n, and absorbance at 450 nm is measured. Alkaline phosphatase activity is determined by a chemiluminescent assay using the Great Escape™ detection kit (Clontech). Purified placental alkaline phophatase is used to generate a standard curve. The enzymatic activity is expressed as relative light units/sec.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR\n\n\n \n \n \nChemerinR and Chemerin transcripts were detected by quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan) in total or polyA+ RNA samples from human tissues and blood cell populations obtained commercially (Clontech and Ambion) or prepared locally (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen). Primers were 5′-GCAGACAAGCTGCCGGA-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 34) as forward, 5′-AGTTTGATGCAGGCCAGGC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 35) as reverse and 5′-AACCCGAGTGCAAAGTCAGGCCC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 36) as probe for Chemerin, 5′-GTCCCAGAACCACCGCAG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 37) as forward, 5′-AAGAAAGCCAGGACCCAGATG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 38) as reverse and 5′-TTCGCCTGGCTTACAT GGCCTGC-3′(SEQ ID NO: 39) as probe for ChemerinR and 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 40) as forward, 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 41) as reverse and 5′-AGCTCTCCCGCCGGCCTCTG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 42) as probe for the reference housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Standard curves were run systematically for the three genes, and the transcript copy number of proChemerin and ChemerinR was normalized to the GAPDH transcript copy number for each sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe investigated the presence of prochemerin and chemerinR transcripts in various human tissues and leukocyte populations by real-time RT-PCR (Taqman). In addition to immature dendritic cells, chemerinR transcripts were found primarily in spleen, lymph nodes and lung, and at lower levels in a number of other tissues (\nFIG. 24B\n). Abundant chemerin transcripts were found in liver, lung, pituitary and ovary (\nFIG. 24C\n), and lower levels could be detected in most tissues. Interestingly however, no expression of chemerin was found in peripheral blood leukocyte populations. Monoclonal antibodies generated against human chemerinR by genetic immunization (as described in Costagliola et al., 1998), and characterized by FACS on CHO-K1 cell lines expressing the receptor (data not shown) were used to confirm the presence of the receptor at the surface of dendritic cells and macrophages. High levels of chemerinR immunoreactivity were found on monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells, and chemerinR was downmodulated following maturation of the cells as a result of LPS or CD40L stimulation (\nFIGS. 24\n, D and E). Similarly, chemerinR immunoreactivity was observed at the surface of monocyte-derived human macrophages (\nFIG. 24F\n).\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nFunctional Assay for ChemerinR\n\n\n \n \n \nChemerinR-expres sing clones have been obtained by transfection of CHO-K1 cells to coexpressing mitochondrial apoaequorin and Gα16, limiting dilution and selection by northern blotting. Positive clones were used for screening with human ovarian cancer ascites extracts prepared as described above. A functional assay based on the luminescence of mitochondrial aequorin intracellular Ca\n2+\n release (Stables et al., 1997, \nAnal. Biochem. \n252:115-126; incorporated herein by reference) was performed as described (Detheux et al., 2000, \nJ. Exp. Med., \n192 1501-1508; incorporated herein by reference). Briefly, cells were collected from plates in PBS containing 5 mM EDTA, pelleted and resuspended at 5×10\n6 \ncells/ml in DMEM-F12 medium. Cells were incubated with 5 μM Coelenterazine H (Molecular Probes) for 4 hours at room temperature. Cells were then washed in DMEM-F12 medium and resuspended at a concentration of 0.5×10\n6 \ncells/ml. Cells were then mixed with test agonist peptides or plates containing tissue extracts and the light emission was recorded for 30 sec using a Microlumat luminometer (Perkin Elmer). Results are expressed as Relative Light Units (RLU).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 17\n shows the concentration response curve for the truncated PreprocHEMERIN peptide (SEQ ID NO: 73, \nFIG. 16\n) to ChemerinR expressed in CHO cells. The assay was carried out as described in the preceeding paragraph. As shown in the figure, the truncated PreprocHEMERIN molecule activates ChemerinR with an EC\n50 \nof 4.27 nM. Results are expressed as Relative Light Units (RLU).\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nActivation of Cells Expressing ChemerinR by Recombinant Chemerin\n\n\n \n \n \nThe conditioned medium of COS-7, CHO-K1 and 293 T cells transfected with pcDNA3 encoding Chemerin or pcDNA3 alone, was collected and used for aequorin assays on CHO cells expressing ChemerinR. Results are shown in \nFIG. 14\n. Increasing amounts of conditioned supernatant resulted in an increase in luminescence in aequorin system cells expressing ChemerinR.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nProduction of Antibodies Specific for Chemerin and ChemerinR\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies directed against Chemerin or ChemerinR were produced by repeated injections of plasmids encoding Chemerin or ChemerinR into mice. Sera were collected starting after the second injection and the titre and specificity of the antibodies was assessed by flow cytofluorometry with CHO-K1 cells transfected with the Chemerin or ChemerinR cDNA and CHO-K1 cells transfected with the cDNA of unrelated GPCR cDNA. Several sera were positive and were used for immunohistochemistry and other related applications, including flow cytometry analysis of human primary cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies were obtained from immune mice by standard hybridoma technology using the NSO murine myeloma cell line as immortal partner. Supernatants were tested for anti ChemerinR antibody activity using the test used for assessing the antisera. Cells from the positive wells were expanded and frozen and the supernatants collected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, BALB/c mice were injected with 100 μg pcDNA-ChemerinR, or with the Chemerin C-terminal octapeptide FSKALPRS. Sera were tested by FACS on the CHO-ChemerinR cell line, or by ELISA for the Chemerin peptide, and immune mice were used to generate monoclonal antibodies by standard hybridoma technology, using the NSO myeloma cell line. The Ig class of selected hybridomas was determined with a mouse mAB isotyping kit (IsoStrip, Boehringer Mannheim).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 15\n shows the results of experiments to characterize the antibodies raised against ChemerinR. A mixture of recombinant cells made up of ⅔ recombinant ChemerinR CHO cells and ⅓ mock-transfected CHO cells (negative control) was reacted with either a supernatant of cells expressing the \nanti ChemerinR\n 5C 1H2 monoclonal antibody (thick line) or a supernatant from cells with no known antibody activity (thin line, grey filling). After staining with FITC labeled anti mouse Ig these preparations were analyzed by flow cytofluorometry. Results are displayed as a histogram of the number of cells (Events axis) expressing a given fluorescence (FL1-H axis). Monoclonal 5C 1H2 allowed the discrimination of the ChemerinR recombinant sub-population of cells from the negative control cells, as evidenced by the relative proportions of both types of cells. The background fluorescence of the assay is given by the second staining (grey filling).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of anti-chemerinR antibodies to block receptor activation by chemerin was investigated using the aequorin assay on chemerinR-expressing CHO-K1 cells. We found that two antibodies (4C7 and 1H2) were able to efficiently inhibit calcium mobilization promoted by recombinant chemerin, in a concentration-dependent manner (\nFIG. 26A\n).\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nBinding Displacement Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nFor displacement experiments, ChemerinR-CHO-K1 cells (25,000 cells/tube) are incubated for 90 min. at 27° C. with 1 nM of SEAP-HIS6 or Chemerin-SEAP-HIS6 in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled Chemerin in 250 μl of binding buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.4; 1 mM Ca Cl\n2\n; 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) Fatty Acid-Free; 5 mM MgCl\n2\n). For saturation experiments, ChemerinR-CHO-K1 cells (25,000 cells/tube) are incubated for 90 min at 27° C. with increasing concentrations of Chemerin-SEAP-HIS6 in the presence or absence of 1 μM unlabeled Chemerin. After incubation, cells are washed 5 times and lysed in 50 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% triton X100. Samples are heated at 65° C. for 10 min to inactivate cellular phosphatases. Lysates are collected by centrifugation, and alkaline phosphatase activity in 25 μl of lysate is determined by the chemiluminescence assay described above.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nCompetition Binding Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nChemerinR expressing CHO-K1 cells were collected from plates with PBS supplemented with 5 mM EDTA, gently pelleted for 2 min at 1000×g, and resuspended in binding buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM CaCl\n2\n, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.5% BSA). Competition binding assays were performed in Minisorb tubes (Nunc), using the \n125\nI-YHSFFFPGQFAFS (SEQ ID NO: 91) peptide as tracer (specific activity: 600 Ci/mmol, 50,000 cpm per tube), variable concentrations of competitors, and 500,000 cells in a final volume of 0.1 ml. Total binding was measured in the absence of competitor, and nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. Samples were incubated for 90 min at 27° C. and then bound tracer was separated by filtration through GF/B filters presoaked in 0.5% BSA. Filters were counted in a ®-scintillation counter. Binding parameters were determined with the PRISM software (Graphpad Software) using nonlinear regression applied to a one-site competition model.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure-function analysis of peptides derived from the C-terminus of chemerin allowed to design a bioactive peptide (YHSFFFPGQFAFS (SEQ ID NO: 91), ECso of 28 nM on chemerinR-expressing CHO-K1 cells, using the aequorin-based assay) that could be labeled on its N-terminus tyrosine for binding studies. This iodinated peptide was used in a competition binding assay, using the unlabeled peptide or recombinant chemerin as competitors. As shown in \nFIG. 23C\n, the Ki values were estimated to 2.5±1.2 nM (pKi: 8.82±0.38) for recombinant Chemerin (filled circles) and 12.1±4.97 nM (pKi: 7.95±0.18) for the unlabel peptide (open square) (mean±s.e.m for 3 independent experiments).\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nIntracellular Cascade Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nGTPγ\n35\nS binding to membranes of cells expressing human ChemR23 was performed as described previously (Kotani et al. 2000). Briefly, membranes (10 μg) from CHO-hChemR23 cells, pretreated or not with PTX) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in GTPγS binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl\n2\n, 3μM GDP, 10 μg/ml saponin) containing different concentrations of peptides in 96 well microplates (Basic FlashPlates, New England Nuclear). [\n35\nS]-GTPγS (0.1 nM, Amersham-Pharmacia) was added, microplates were shaken for one minute and further incubated at 30° for 30 min. The incubation was stopped by centrifugation of the microplate for 10 min at 800 g and 4°, and aspiration of the supernatant. Microplates were counted in a TopCount (Packard, Downers, Ill.) for 1 min per well. Functional parameters were determined with the PRISM software (Graphpad Software) using nonlinear regression applied to a sigmoidal dose-response model.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe signaling pathways activated by chemerinR were investigated in CHO-K1 cells expressing the human receptor, but not G\nα16 \nor apoaequorin (CHO/chemerinR cells). Receptor activation was tested in a GTPγ[\n35\nS] binding assay, using membranes from CHO/chemerinR cells and human chemerin. The results show stimulation of ChemerinR expression CHO-K1 cells (EC\n50\n:7.8±0.4 nM, mean±s.e.m for 4 independent experiments, \nFIG. 23D\n). Furthermore, stimulation of these cells by human Chemerin at low nanomolar concentrations resulted in the release of intracellular calcium and inhibition of cAMP accumulation (not shown), as well as phosphorylation of the p42 and p44 MAP kinases (\nFIGS. 23\n E and F). All these effects were inhibited by Pertussis toxin pretreatment, demonstrating the involvement of G\ni \nfamily members. No activity of recombinant Chemerin or prochemerin was obtained in any of these assays on wild-type CHO-K1 cells (data not shown).\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nTissue Distribution of Chemerin and ChemerinR\n\n\n \n \n \nSemi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using gene-specific primers to hCHEMERIN and ChemerinR on polyA+ RNA and total RNA from various human tissues (CLONTECH and Ambion). Briefly, total RNA from blood cells were prepared with Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The hCHEMERIN primers were forward (5′-GCAGACAAGCTGCCGGA-3′; SEQ ID NO: 34), TaqMan probe (5′-AACCCGAGTGCAAAGTCAGGCCC-3′; SEQ ID NO: 36), and reverse (5′-AGTTTGATGCAGGCCAGGC-3′; SEQ ID NO: 35). The hChemerinR primers were forward (5′-GTCCCAGAACCACCGCAG-3′; SEQ ID NO: 37), TaqMan probe (5′-TTCGCCTGGCTTACATGGCCTGC-3′; SEQ ID NO: 39), and reverse (5′-AAGAAAGCCAGGACCCAGATG-3′; SEQ ID NO: 38). Primers designed to the housekeeping gene GAPDH Forward (5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′; SEQ ID NO: 40), TaqMan pobe (5′-AGCTCTCCCGCCGGCCTCTG-3′; SEQ ID NO: 42), and reverse (5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′; SEQ ID NO: 41) were used to produced reference mRNA profiles. The distribution of hCHEMERIN and ChemerinR in various tissues is shown in \nFIGS. 18 and 19\n, respectively. The level of expression of hCHEMERIN or ChemerinR are expressed as a ratio of hCHEMERIN or ChemerinR to GAPDH reference mRNA expression.\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\nExpression and Pharmacological Characterization of Human Chemerin\n\n\n \n \n \nThe recombinant Chemerin protein was purified by filtration through 0.45 μm Millex filters (Millipore) and separation through a cation-exchange HPLC column (Polycat 9.6×250 mm, Vydac, 0-1 M NaCl gradient in acetate buffer pH 5). The protein concentration in active fractions was determined following SDS/PAGE, by comparison with glutathione S-transferase and lysozyme standards after silver staining.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman Chemerin cDNA was cloned and expressed in CHO-K1 cells. The bioactive recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity from conditioned medium, and analyzed by mass spectrometry and SDS/PAGE, which confirmed C-terminal truncation after serine 157 (not shown). A monoclonal antibody, generated against a peptide (FSKALPRS, SEQ ID NO: 89) corresponding to the predicted C-terminal sequence of the gene product, was used to purify to homogeneity from CHO-K1 conditioned medium, an unprocessed form of the protein (prochemerin), which was confirmed by mass spectrometry to retain the six C-terminal aminoacids (not shown). The amount of purified recombinant Chemerin (\nFIG. 23A\n) and prochemerin (not shown) was determined by comparison with protein standards, following SDS/PAGE and silver staining. It was inferred that over 90% of prochemerin released by CHO-K1 cells was enzymatically processed into Chemerin. Comparison of the biological activity of the two purified proteins assayed in parallel on CHO-K1 cells expressing human ChemerinR (\nFIG. 23B\n) demonstrated that processed Chemerin (filled circles) was about a hundred fold more active (EC50: 4.5±0.7 nM, mean±s.e.m. for 7 independent experiments) than unprocessed prochemerin (open circles) (EC50: 393±116 nM, mean±s.e.m. for 3 independent experiments). The N-terminus of prochemerin and Chemerin was determined by mass spectrometry: a tryptic peptide (ELTEAQR, 845.45 Da, SEQ ID NO: 90) corresponding to amino-\nacids\n 21 to 27 of preprochemerin was identified by sequencing (data not shown), confirming the signal peptide cleavage site predicted by the SignalP software from Expasy (available on the World Wide Web at cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). ChemerinR is structurally and evolutionary related to the C5a and C3a receptors, the prostaglandin D2 receptor CRTH2, and the orphan GPR1 receptor (20). These receptors, as well as a large set of other characterized and orphan receptors, including most chemokine receptors, were shown to be totally unreactive to purified human Chemerin (data not shown). The activation of ChemerinR by a set of over 200 bioactive molecules, including all currently available chemokines, C5a, C3a, fMLP, bradykinin, PAF and leukotrienes, was also tested. All these agents were unable to promote receptor activation even at concentrations significantly higher (100 nM or 1 mM) than those reported to activate their own receptors. Chemerin and its receptor appear therefore as a specific signaling system, in contrast to the situation prevailing with inflammatory chemokines and their respective receptors. In order to investigate whether proteolytic activation of prochemerin is performed intracellularly in the secretory pathway, or is an extracellular process, potentially regulated by the activation of extracellular proteases, we tested the activation of human purified prochemerin in the medium of cultured cells and conditioned media. We could show that human prochemerin can be fully converted into a form active on ChemerinR, during the incubation (at 100 nM) in the culture medium of hamster CHO-K1 cells, simian Cos-7 cells or human HEK293 cells (data not shown), as well as in conditioned media from these cells (\nFIG. 24A\n). These data indicate that prochemerin processing is performed extracellularly, and that the active Chemerin product is not degraded further by the proteolytic activity, and is therefore stable in extracellular medium. Although the protease responsible for this processing is not known, the regulation of this enzyme activity is expected to control the extracellular generation of active Chemerin in vivo.\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\nHigh Affinity Activation of ChemerinR by C-Terminus Truncated Peptide of Chemerin\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to investigate the potential effect of peptides derived from the C-terminal domain of prochemerin, we first synthesized several peptides starting at position 139 of prochemerin, after the last cysteine (Table 2), and tested their ability to trigger intracellular calcium release in a cell line coexpressing the Chemerin receptor and apoaequorin, WE have use the arquorin assay as previously described in Detheux et al. (2000 \nJ. Exp. Med. \n192, 1501-1508). As shown in \nFIG. 25A\n and Table 2, the peptide corresponding to the C-terminal end of prochemerin (hProchemerin-25) was not able to activate the receptor under high concentration (mean EC\n50 \nof 160±21 μM), whereas the same peptide lacking the 6 last amino-acids (hChemerin-19) activated the Chemerin receptor with very high affinity (mean EC\n50 \nof 16.7±3.2 nM). As described before, the recombinant prochemerin was poorly active (mean EC\n50 \nof 393±116 nM) compared to the affinity of the processed recombinant Chemerin (mean EC\n50 \nof 4.5±0.7 nM). These results are consistent with the previously data showing the functional importance of the C-terminal processing of the prochemerin, which allows the transformation of a low affinity precursor to a high affinity form of the ligand. Surprisingly, these data also suggest that a sequence corresponding to the last 19 C-terminus amino acids of Chemerin seems to be sufficient for providing high affinity receptor activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo study the accuracy of the processing of the immature form of Chemerin, we further investigated the effect of C-terminal truncated peptides variants (Table 2). As shown in \nFIG. 25B\n and Table 2, addition of a single amino-acid (h[Lys-20] Chemerin-19) to the C-terminal end of the control peptide strongly affected the affinity (EC\n50 \nof 170 μM compared to a value of 16.7±3.2 nM for hChemerin-19). The same effect was observed after removal of at least 2 amino-acids (h[Phe18Ser19] Chemerin-19, EC\n50 \nof 220 μM; h[Ala17Phe18Ser19] Chemerin-19, EC\n50 \nof 130±10 μM). However, removal of only one amino-acid slightly impaired the response (h[Ser19] Chemerin-19, EC\n50\n=97±13 nM). From these data, the C-terminal end of the Chemerin appeared to be extremely precise, as addition of only one amino acid abrogated the high affinity intracellular calcium response. We also showed the functional importance of the Phenylalanine residue in \nposition\n 18 and, more slightly, the Serine in \nposition\n 19. Thus, C-terminal modification of the Chemerin seriously impaired the high affinity activation of its receptor, demonstrating the accuracy of the activating cleavage.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EC\n50\n value of the truncated Chemerin peptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO\n\n\nPeptide (name and sequence)\n\n\nMean EC50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\nHuman prochemerin-25\n\n\n  160 ± 21 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFAFSKALPRS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n\nHuman Chemerin-19\n\n\n 16.7 ± 3.2 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\nHuman [Lys20] Chemerin-19\n\n\n170 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFAFSK\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n\nHuman [ΔSer19] Chemerin-19\n\n\n   97 ± 13 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFAF\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n56\n\n\nHuman [ΔPhe18Ser19] Chemerin-19\n\n\n220 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFA\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n57\n\n\nHuman [ΔAla17Phe18Ser19] \n\n\n  130 ± 10 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nChemerin-19\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQRAGEDPHSFYFPGQF\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n58\n\n\nHuman [ΔPhe16Ala17Phe18Ser19] \n\n\ninactif\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nChemerin-19\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQRAGEDPHSFYFPGQ\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\nHuman Chemerin-7\n\n\n  220 ± 100 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\nHuman Chemerin-8\n\n\n    2 ± 1 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\nHuman Chemerin-9\n\n\n    7 ± 0.25 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYFPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n62\n\n\nHuman Chemerin-10\n\n\n  8.2 ± 2 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFYFPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\nHuman Chemerin-12\n\n\n 12.2 ± 3.4 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHSFYFPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n64\n\n\nHuman Chemerin-13\n\n\n 14 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPHSFYFPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n65\n\n\nHuman [Ala-1] Chemerin-9\n\n\n  496 ± 80 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAFPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n66\n\n\nHuman [Ala-2] Chemerin-9\n\n\n155.3 ± 41.6 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYAPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n67\n\n\nHuman [Ala-3] Chemerin-9\n\n\n 42.5 ± 7.5 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYFAGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n\nHuman [Ala-5] Chemerin-9\n\n\n 35.8 ± 5.9 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYFPGAFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n\nHuman [Ala-6] Chemerin-9\n\n\n    5 ± 1 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYFPGQAAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n70\n\n\nHuman [Ala-8] Chemerin-9\n\n\n   38 ± 7 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYFPGQFAAS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n71\n\n\nHuman [Ala-9] Chemerin-9\n\n\n 48.3 ± 5.7 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYFPGQFAFA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nThe Shorter C-Terminal Nonapeptide YFPGQFAFS has a High Affinity on ChemerinR\n\n\n \n \n \nWe then determined the minimum length of the C-terminal fragment able to activate the Chemerin receptor with high potency. Successive truncations of the N-terminal domain of the hChemerin-19 peptide were synthesized and tested using the aequorin assay (\nFIG. 25C\n). Truncations from \nresidue\n 1 to residue 10 (hChemerin-17 to hChemerin-9, \nFIG. 20\n and EC\n50 \nvalues in table 2) did not affect intracellular calcium signaling. However, removal of the Tyrosine residue in position 11 (hChemerin-8) resulted in a severely loss of affinity for the receptor (EC\n50 \nof 2±1 μM compared to a value of 16.7±3.2 nM for the control peptide: Human chemerin-19), and the response was completely abrogated for shorter peptide (hChemerin-7, EC\n50 \nof 220±100 μM). These results indicated that only the last 9 amino acids of Chemerin are necessary for high affinity receptor activation, as the EC\n50 \nof the nonapeptide is 7±0.25 nM, which is in the same range to the affinity of the recombinant Chemerin.\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\nAromatic residues in Chemerin C-Terminus are Necessary for ChemerinR Activiation\n\n\n \n \n \nSince multiple residues within the last 9 amino acids sequence of Chemerin appeared to be important for receptor activation, we examined the relative contribution of each amino acid of the YFPGQFAFS peptide in Chemerin receptor activation, by using an alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach. Eight different alanine-substituted hChemerin-9 analogs were synthesized and tested for intracellular calcium accumulation. As shown in \nFIG. 25D\n and Table 2, the EC\n50 \nof the Q5A, P3A and S9A mutated peptides was shifted to higher concentrations (EC\n50 \nof 35.8±5.9 nM, 42.5±7.5 nM and 48.3±5.7 nM respectively) as compared with the control peptide (mean EC\n50 \nof 7±0.25 nM). The EC\n50 \nof the F2A and Y1A peptides was more severely affected (EC\n50 \nof 155.3±41.6 nM and 496±80 nM, respectively), and alanine substitution of \nPhe\n 6 and \nPhe\n 8 dramatically impaired the functional response of Chemerin receptor (EC\n50 \nof 5±1 μM and 38±7 μM, respectively). These data suggested that aromatic Y1, F2, F6 and F8 residues play an important role in receptor activation.\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\nChemotaxis and Ca\n2+\n Mobilization Assays on Primary Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nMonocyte-derived DCs were generated by GM-CSF (50 ng/ml) and IL-13 (20 ng/ml) stimulation as previously described (17). Maturation of DCs was achieved following stimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS. Macrophages were obtained by incubating monocytes in Petriperm dishes (Haereus) for 6 days in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS and 10 ng/ml MCSF. Cell migration was evaluated using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber technique as described (18). For Ca2+ mobilization assays, monocyte-derived DCs or macrophages (10\n7 \ncells/ml in HBSS without phenol red but containing 0.1% BSA) were loaded with 5 μM FURA-2 (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37° C. in the dark. The loaded cells were washed twice, resuspended at 10\n6 \ncells/ml, kept for 30 min at 4° C. in the dark with or without the blocking 4C7 monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml), and transferred into the quartz cuvette of a luminescence spectrometer LS50B (PerkinElmer). Ca\n2+\n mobilization in response to recombinant Chemerin was measured by recording the ratio of fluorescence emitted at 510 nm after sequential excitation at 340 and 380 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biological function of Chemerin was further investigated on leukocyte populations. In accordance to the coupling of human ChemerinR through the G class of G proteins, its structural relatedness to chemoattractant receptors, and its expression in antigen-presenting cells, we showed that Chemerin acted as a chemotactic factor for these cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages were differentiated in vitro from human monocytes. Human recombinant Chemerin promoted in vitro migration of macrophages and immature dendritic cells (\nFIGS. 26\n B, C, and F), whereas no chemotaxis of mature dendritic cells was observed (data not shown). Maximal chemotactic responses were obtained for concentrations of 100 pM to 1 nM, according to the batch of recombinant Chemerin. Such bell-shaped chemotactic response, with a maximum corresponding to concentrations below the EC\n50 \nobserved in other functional assays, is typically observed for other chemotactic factors such as chemokines. The effect was completely abolished following treatment with Pertussis toxin (\nFIGS. 26\n C and F), demonstrating the involvement of the G\ni \nclass of G proteins. Migration of macrophages and dendritic cells was also inhibited by the antiChemerinR monoclonal antibody 4C7 (\nFIGS. 26\n C and F) without affecting RANTESinduced cell migration, demonstrating that the effect is specifically mediated by the ChemerinR. A checkerboard analysis showed that, when equal concentrations of Chemerin were present in both the lower and upper wells, no significant increase in cell migration was observed (\nFIGS. 26\n C and F). Thus, the migration of macrophages and immature dendritic cells induced by Chemerin is essentially a chemotactic effect rather than chemokinesis. We also investigated whether recombinant Chemerin could induce Ca\n2+\n mobilization in antigen-presenting cells. As expected, intracellular Ca\n2+\n levels increased in immature dendritic cells in response to recombinant Chemerin (\nFIG. 26D\n), whereas the 4C7 antibody inhibited the Ca\n2+\n response (\nFIG. 26E\n). Similar observations were made for macrophages (\nFIGS. 26\n G and H).\n\n\n \nExample 19\n\n\nBioactive Chemerin Concentration in Human Samples\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to investigate whether chemerin is frequently generated in pathological situations in human, we fractionated a set of inflammatory fluids and assayed the chemerin content by measuring the biological activity of the fractions on chemerinR, as compared to a standard curve made with purified recombinant chemerin. Significant levels of active chemerin, well within the active range (33 to 358 ng/ml, corresponding to 2 to 23 nM), were found in the majority of ascitic fluids resulting from ovary cancer, but also in ascitic fluids resulting from a liver cancer and from an ovary hyperstimulation syndrome, as well as in a pool of articular fluids from arthritic patients (Table 3). Interestingly, active chemerin was not detected in articular fluid pooled from patients with arthrosis (Table 3), nor in fractions from human hemofiltrate (not shown), demonstrating that its presence is linked to inflammatory situations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of Chemerin in ascitic (samples 1-17) and articular (\nsamples\n 18 and 19) fluids was estimated following two fractionation steps, by assaying the fractions on ChemerinR-expressing cells, using the aequorin-based assay and a standard curve made with purified recombinant human Chemerin. Articular fluids from arthritis and arthrosis patients were pooled for measurement, following centrifugation. 0. H.

Clones were characterized by assaying the conditioned medium on chemerinRexpres sing cells. In vitro proliferation rate was determined by BrdU incorporation as described\n30\n. For in vivo studies, cells were washed twice with PBS, and grafted (6×10\n5 \ncells in 0.1 ml PBS) subcutaneously into the back of 10-week-old C57B16 mice (5 to 11 mice per group, Harlan, The Netherlands). Perpendicular tumor diameters (D and d) were measured every 2 days, and the volume was estimated as V=π(d/2)(D/2)(d/2). Statistical analysis was performed by using the unpaired non parametric Mann-Whitney test. For microscopic analysis, tumors were embedded in OCT, snap-frozen in −80° C. isopentane and cut at 12 μm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) for routine analysis. All animal procedures were approved by the ethical committee of the Medical School of the Universite Libre de Bruxelles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biological function of Chemerin was further investigated in a mouse model in vivo. In accordance to the coupling of human ChemerinR through the G\n1 \nclass of G proteins, its structural relatedness to chemoattractant receptors, and its expression in dendritic cells, Chemerin acted as a chemotactic factor for these cells. Dendritic cells were differentiated in vitro from human monocytes. Human recombinant Chemerin was chemotactic in vitro for immature, but not mature, dendritic cells, with a maximal activity at 1 nM (See example 18 of the present application).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs active Chemerin was originally isolated from tumoral ascitis, we evaluated the significance of this expression in a tumor context, by investigating the consequence of Chemerin expression in a mouse tumor model in vivo. The mouse prochemerin and ChemerinR cDNAs were cloned. Following their expression in CHO-K1 cells, functional assays demonstrated that the human and mouse recombinant ligands were equally active on both the human and mouse receptors (data not shown). The melanoma cell line B16F0 was transfected with a bicistronic expression vector containing the mouse Chemerin cDNA (or a control vector), and stable cell lines were established. The expression of bioactive Chemerin was confirmed by measuring the activity of conditioned medium. The two selected cell lines released over a period of 24 hours about 125 ng/ml active Chemerin in the culture medium. Expression of Chemerin did not modify the growth rate of the cell lines, as assessed by measuring the proportion of cells in the various phases of the cell cycle (\nFIGS. 27A-C\n), or by directly counting cells over time (data not shown). However, following subcutaneous graft of the cells to syngenic mice, the phenotype of the developing tumors was profoundly modified by Chemerin expression. In three independent series, all mice receiving wild-type B 16F0 cells developed a rapidly growing tumor, in accordance with the literature, while a number of mice receiving Chemerin-expressing cells did not develop tumors up to four weeks after the graft. By combining the three series, 5 out of 24 mice grafted with Chemerin-expressing cells did not develop tumors (versus 0/24 in the control group, p<0.05, Fisher test). The size of the developing tumors was also much smaller for the Chemerin group (an average reduction of 70% 21-24 days after the graft of cells, \nFIG. 27D\n). The difference was significant from \nday\n 10 after the graft (p=0.02 to 0.004 according to time points, non-parametric Mann-Whitney test). Macroscopic analysis at the end of the observation period (12 to 30 days) revealed a number of phenotypic differences between the two groups. Chemerin-producing tumors were characterized by a more abundant vascularization, and a much lower extent of necrotic areas. These phenotypic differences were not the consequence of a difference in the size of the tumors, as they were observed as well following the selection of rare size-matched tumors belonging to the two groups. Microscopic analysis, following hematoxylin-eosin staining, confirmed these observations, particularly the major difference in the extent of necrosis, that occupies the largest part of control tumors, while being rare in Chemerin-producing tumors (\nFIGS. 27\n E and F).\n\n\n \nExample 21\n\n\nCalcium Flux\n\n\nThe Aequoscreen™ Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nChemerinR expressing clones were transfected to coexpress mithochondrial apoaequorin and Gα16.

For each measurement, 50 μl of cells (i.e. 5 000 cells) were injected into each well of the plate containing the ligands, and the emitted light is recorded (FDSS, Hamamatsu) during 20 seconds following cells injection. Results were expressed as Relative Light Units (RLU). Digitonin (50 μM, Sigma, cat no 37006) is used as positive controls of the cell response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intensity of the emitted light was integrated, yielding for each well one value representative of the emitted light.\n\n\n \nExample 22\n\n\nAromatic and Hydrophobic Residues in N-Terminus of the Nonapeptide YFPGQFAFS are Necessary for ChemerinR Activation\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to investigate the importance of the N-terminus part of the nonapetpide YFPGQFAFS, several peptides were synthesized and tested using the Calcium flux-Aequoscreen assay. As shown in \nFIGS. 28 to 32\n and Table 4, peptides containing an aromatic or hydrophobic residue on position N1 and N2 are in the same range of activity of the recombinant Chemerin. These data suggested that aromatic and hydrophobic residues play an important role in receptor activation.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEC50 value of the peptides modified by hydrophobic \n\n\n\n\n\n\nresidue (N-terminus) and EC50 value of the\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeptide modified in \nposition\n 9 by an Aspartate \n\n\n\n\n\n\nresidue and an amide function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO.\n\n\nSequence\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n92\n\n\nLFPGQFAFS\n\n\n66.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n93\n\n\nIFPGQFAFS\n\n\n25.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n94\n\n\nFLPGQFAFS\n\n\n29.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n95\n\n\nYLPGQFAFS\n\n\n3.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n96\n\n\nYVPGQFAFS\n\n\n43.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n97\n\n\nYFPGQFAFD-CONH2\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 23\n\n\nModification of the C terminal Part of the Nonapeptide YFPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to clarify the role of the C-terminal part in the interaction with ChemerinR, the Serine on \nposition\n 9 was mutated by an Aspartate residue and the carboxylic group on the C-term was replaced by an amide function. This peptide was tested using the Calcium flux-Aequoscreen assay.

Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nMacrophage and/or monocyte recruitment plays a role in the morbidity and mortality of a broad spectrum of diseases, including autoimmune diseases, granulomatous diseases, infectious diseases, osteoporosis, and coronary artery disease. For example, in atherosclerosis, early during lipid lesion formation, circulating monocytes adhere to the activated endothelium overlying the incipient plaque. Under appropriate conditions, the monocytes then migrate into the developing intima. In the intima, macrophage accumulate lipoprotein and excrete an excess of proteases relative to protease inhibitors. If the lipoproteins are oxidized, they are toxic to macrophage, which results in macrophage death and an increase in an unstable, necrotic, extracellular lipid pool. An excess of proteases results in loss of extracellular matrix and destabilization of the fibrous plaque. Plaque instability, is the acute cause of myocardial infarction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany molecules have been identified that are necessary for the recruitment of monocytes and other inflammatory cell types to sites of injury or insult. These molecules represent targets for the inhibition of monocytes recruitment. One class of such molecules is adhesion molecules, e.g., receptors, for monocytes. Another class of molecules includes inflammatory mediators, such as TNFα and related molecules, the interleukins, e.g., IL-1β, and chemokines, e.g., monocytes chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). As a result, agents which modulate the activity of chemokines are likely to be useful to prevent and treat a wide range of diseases. For example, Rollins et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,128) generally disclose analogs of MCP-1 that inhibit the monocyte chemoattractant activity of endogenous MCP-1. Analogs that are effective to inhibit endogenous MCP-1 are disclosed as analogs which are modified at 28-tyrosine, 24-arginine, 3-aspartate and/or in amino acids between residues 2-8 of MCP-1. In particular, Rollins et al. state that “[s]uccessful inhibition of the activity is found where MCP-1 is modified in one or more of the following ways: a) the 28-tyrosine is substituted by aspartate, b) the 24-arginine is substituted by phenylalanine, c) the 3-aspartate is substituted by alanine, and/or d) the 2-8 amino acid sequence is deleted” (col. 1, lines 49-54). The deletion of amino acids 2-8 of MCP-1 (“MCP-1(Δ2-8)”) results in a polypeptide that is inactive, i.e., MCP-1(Δ2-8) is not a chemoattractant (col. 5, lines 22-23).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent studies suggest that MCP-1(Δ2-8) exhibits a dominant negative effect, i.e., it forms heterodimers with wild-type MCP-1 that cannot elicit a biological effect (Zhang et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol., \n15:4851, 1995). Thus, MCP-1(Δ2-8) does not exhibit properties of a classic receptor antagonist. Moreover, MCP-1(Δ2-8) is unlikely to be widely useful for inhibition of MCP-1 activity in vivo, as MCP-1 (Δ2-8) is a large polypeptide with undesirable pharmacodynamic properties. Furthermore, it is unknown whether MCP-1(Δ2-8) is active as dominant-negative inhibitor of other chemokines associated with inflammation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, there is a need to identify agents that inhibit or enhance chemokine-induced macrophage and/or monocyte recruitment and which have desirable pharmacodynamic properties. Moreover, there is a need to identify agents that inhibit or enhance chemokine-induced activities of other cell types, such as lymphocytes, neutrophils or eosinophils. Further, there is a need to identify agents that are pan-selective chemokine inhibitors.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a therapeutic agent comprising an isolated and purified chemokine peptide, chemokine peptide variant, chemokine analog, or a derivative thereof. Preferably, the therapeutic agent of the invention inhibits the activity of more than one chemokine, although the agent may not inhibit the activity of all chemokines to the same extent. Alternatively, a preferred therapeutic agent of the invention specifically inhibits the activity of one chemokine to a greater extent than other chemokines. Yet another preferred therapeutic agent of the invention mimics the activity of a chemokine, e.g., it acts as an agonist. Thus, therapeutic agents that are chemokine antagonists and agonists are within the scope of the invention. A further preferred therapeutic agent of the invention is an agent that does not inhibit or mimic the activity of a chemokine but binds to or near the receptor for that chemokine, i.e., it is a neutral agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention features a peptide of the formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\n \n \n \n \nX\n0 \nis H,

Then the cross-reactivity of a non-human chemokine for the human receptor is assessed. A preferred chemokine is one from a species which has the least sequence homology to the corresponding human chemokine, but which still cross-reacts by binding to the human receptor. Regions which have a high degree of sequence similarity or identity are employed to prepare a peptide of the invention. For example, to identify peptide of TGF-beta having antagonist, agonist or neutral properties, the amino acid sequence of human TGF-beta can be compared to that of \nXenopus. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is envisioned that the therapeutic agents of the invention include compounds having a chiral center that can be isolated in optically active and racemic forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided are pharmaceutical compositions, delivery systems, and kits comprising the therapeutic agents of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides methods to treat chemokine-associated indications. For example, the invention provides a method of preventing or inhibiting an indication associated with chemokine-induced activity. The method comprises administering to a mammal afflicted with, or at risk of, the indication an amount of a compound of formula (I) effective to prevent or inhibit said activity. Preferably, the administration is effective to inhibit the activity of more than one chemokine (i.e., the peptide is a pan-selective inhibitor). These agents are useful to treat indications such as acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, a disease with an autoimmune component, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, gouty arthritis, brain inflammation, sepsis, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hemorrhagic shock, cardiogenic shock, hypovolemic shock, ischemia and reperfusion injury, multiple sclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, organ transplant rejection, allergy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and endometriosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides a method to increase, augment or enhance a chemokine-associated inflammatory response in a mammal, comprising administering to the mammal an amount of a compound of formula (I) effective to increase, augment or enhance said response. These therapeutic agents are useful to increase an inflammatory response to, for example, intracellular pathogens or parasites, which often are associated with a poor immune response. Thus, these agents may be useful to treat or prevent tuberculosis and malaria. Therefore, the invention also provides a therapeutic method to prevent or treat parasitic infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a method of preventing or inhibiting an indication associated with histamine release from basophils or mast cells. The method comprises administering to a mammal at risk of, or afflicted with, the indication an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a method of preventing or inhibiting an indication associated with monocyte, macrophage, neutrophil, B cell, T cell or eosinophil recruitment, or B cell or T cell activation or proliferation. The method comprises administering an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther provided is a therapeutic method to prevent or treat vascular indications, comprising administering to a mammal in need of such therapy an effective amount of a compound of formula (I), wherein the indication is coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, atherosclerosis or vasculitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a method to prevent or treat an autoimmune disorder. The method comprises administering to a mammal in need of such therapy an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther provided is a method to modulate the chemokine-induced activity of macrophage, B cells, T cells or other hematopoietic cells, e.g., neutrophils, eosinophils or mast cells, at a preselected physiological site. The method comprises administering a dosage comprising an effective amount of a compound of formula (I), wherein the dosage form is linked, either covalently or non-covalently, to a targeting moiety. The targeting moiety binds to a cellular component at the preselected physiological site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, it is also envisioned that an agent of the invention may be a targeting moiety, as some of the agents are selective chemokine inhibitors, rather than pan-chemokine inhibitors. For example, an agent of the invention may be useful in the targeted delivery of an isotope or other cytotoxic molecule to red cells for the treatment of disorders such as erythroid leukemia, erythroid myelosis, polycythemia vera or other erythroid dysplasias. Similarly, an agent of the invention that specifically targets a particular cell type may be useful in diagnostics. Thus, these agents can be radiolabeled (Chianelli et al., \nNucl. Med. Comm., \n18:437, 1997), or labeled with any other detectable signal, such as those useful in diagnostic imaging (e.g., MRI and CAT) to image sites of inflammation in disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus (type I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a therapeutic method to augment an immune response. The method comprises administering to a mammal an immunogenic moiety and an amount of a compound of formula (I), wherein the amount is effective to augment the immune response of the mammal to the immunogenic moiety. Thus, the invention also provides a vaccine comprising an immunogenic moiety and an amount of a compound of formula (I). As used herein, an “immunogenic moiety” means an isolated or purified composition or compound (e.g., a purified virus preparation or a native or recombinant viral or bacterial antigen) that, when introduced into an animal, preferably a mammal, results in a humoral and/or cellular immune response by the animal to the composition or compound. It is envisaged that the modified vaccine is delivered by the same routes as those used for unmodified immunogen (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular or orally).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a therapeutic method to prevent or inhibit asthma. The method comprises administering to a mammal in need of such therapy an effective amount of a compound of formula (I). Preferably, in this embodiment of the invention, a therapeutic agent is administered to the upper and/or lower respiratory tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther provided is a therapeutic method to prevent or inhibit viral, e.g., poxvirus, herpesvirus (e.g., \nHerpesvirus samiri\n), cytomegalovirus (CMV) or lentivirus, infection or replication. The method comprises administering to a mammal in need of such therapy an effective amount of a compound of formula (I). Preferably, the therapeutic agents are employed to prevent or treat HIV. More preferably, the agent is administered before, during or after the administration of an anti-viral agent, e.g., for HIV AZT, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, a protease inhibitor or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA therapeutic method to prevent or treat low bone mineral density is also provided. The method comprises administering to a mammal in need of such therapy an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a method of suppressing tumor growth in a vertebrate animal comprising administering to said vertebrate a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I). Preferably, the method increases or enhances macrophages, B cell-, T cell- or other immune cell-associated activity at a tumor site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther provided is a method for preventing or treating rheumatoid arthritis in a mammal, comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a method to prevent or treat organ transplant rejection. The method comprises administering an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther provided is a method for preventing or treating psoriasis in a mammal, comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a method to enhance wound healing. The method comprises administering an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther provided is a method for preventing or treating an allergy in a mammal, comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another embodiment of the invention is a method to prevent or inhibit an indication associated with elevated TNFα. The method comprises administering an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides methods whereby the pharmacokinetics of desirable pharmaceutical agents may be modulated. In particular, agents which are normally rapidly cleared from the circulation may be retained longer by the addition of a peptide of the invention that has affinity for the Duffy antigen on red blood cells. This methodology may be particularly suited to modifying the pharmacokinetics of other biologically active, pharmaceutically useful peptides, as well as larger polypeptide or proteins. For example, a Duffy binding peptide may be coupled or linked, either covalently or non-covalently, to a molecule such as recombinant human growth hormone (HGH) or insulin, and administered via a depo injection. By partitioning the modified HGH to the red blood cells, HGH may have much more suitable pharmacokinetics, with longer half lives and less rapid changes in plasma concentrations. In another example, insulin coupled to a peptide of the invention may be particularly useful as a treatment for the highly insulin-resistant type II diabetic whose disease has progressed significantly. It is also envisioned that other small molecules may be coupled to Duffy binding molecules in a manner which preserves the intended function of the active molecule and of the Duffy binding molecule.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nOne skilled in the art can, based on the description herein, utilize the present invention to its fullest extent.

These indications include, but are not limited to, endotoxic shock; Crohn's disease; fever, and flu-like symptoms; acute interstitial pneumonitis; septic and nonseptic shock; acute respiratory distress syndrome; thromboembolic conditions; bone resorption; arthritis; acute graft versus host disease; cerebral malaria; cachexia of tuberculosis or cancer; lung injury; and idiopathic fibrosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdentification of Therapeutic Agents Falling within the Scope of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgents useful in the practice of the invention include agents that inhibit or reduce (e.g., chemokine receptor antagonists), or increase, augment or enhance (e.g., chemokine receptor agonists), chemokine-induced activity, e.g., monocyte or macrophage recruitment. These agents can be identified in vitro or in vivo assays, such as the assays described hereinbelow. It is recognized that not all agents falling within the scope of the invention can inhibit or enhance chemokine-induced activity in vitro or in vivo. The therapeutic agents of the invention may be direct receptor binding agonists and/or antagonists, or may act by a different mechanism, e.g., duplex formation of antisense nucleic acid with chemokine mRNA, or by more than one mechanism, so as to result in the alteration of chemokine-induced activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vitro Chemotaxis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine whether an agent inhibits a chemokine-induced activity, such as macrophage recruitment, varying amounts of the agent are mixed with cells in the presence of a known chemoattractant. For example, a range of known concentrations of an agent, e.g., a chemokine peptide, is incubated with a defined number (e.g., 10\n4\n-10\n6\n) of human THP-1 monocyte cells in individual wells of the top compartment of a trans-well plate. Chemokine, at a concentration known to cause significant migration of THP-1 cells in the trans-well migration assay, is placed in the lower compartment of a trans-well plate. Cells are then incubated at 37° C. for a period sufficient to allow migration, e.g., 4 hours. After incubation, the cells are gently removed from the top of the filter with a pipette, 20 μl of 20 mM EDTA in simple PBS is added into each top well, and incubated for 20 minutes at 4° C. The filter is carefully flushed with media using a gentle flow, and removed. A standard curve consisting of a two-fold dilution series of THP-1 cells (in 29 μl) is placed to accurately quantify the number of cells that have migrated. Migrated cells are stained with 3 μl of MTT stock dye solution which is added directly into each well (5 mg/ml in RPMI-1640 without phenol red) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo., USA) and incubated at 37° C. for 4 hours. The media is carefully aspirated from each well, and the converted dye is solubilized by 20 μl of DMSO. Absorbance of converted dye is measured at a wavelength of 595 nm using an ELISA plate reader. The number of migrated cells in each well is then determined by interpolation of the standard curve (see also Imai et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n272:15036, 1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny method suitable for counting cells can be used, for example, counting with a hemocytometer, incubation of the cells with MTT (see above), or FACS analysis. A negative control assay is also performed, using TGFβ or another non-chemokine chemoattractant (e.g., IL1β or TNFα). To assess whether the agent is cytotoxic, the same concentrations of agent are incubated with THP-1 cells. Agents which 1) are not cytotoxic at levels which inhibit migration, 2) are ineffective at inhibiting the negative control-induced migration, and 3) reduce or inhibit chemokine-induced THP-1 migration, are agents which fall within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgents may also be screened in a chemotactic assay which employs human neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, platelets, lymphocytes or monocytes. For monocytes, 9 ml of fresh blood are transferred to a tube containing 1 ml of 3.8% sodium citrate, and left at room temperature for 15 minutes. 5 ml of this anti-coagulated blood are carefully layered over 3.5 ml Polymorphprep® (Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway), and centrifuged at 500 g for 35 minutes per the manufacturer's instructions. The top band at the sample/medium interface contains monocytes. The monocytes are carefully removed with a glass pipette, and reconstituted to the original volume (5 ml). The cells are washed with PBS plus 10% fetal calf serum, and centrifuged at 400 g for 10 minutes. The washing step is repeated three times before the cells are counted. Cells are resuspended at 1×10\n7 \ncells/ml in RPMI-1640+10% FCS. The monocytes are cultured for two days at 37° C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn day 2, the cells are counted, spun down, and reconstituted to 1×10\n7 \ncells/ml in Gey's balanced salt solution+1 mg/ml BSA. Chemotaxis is induced in a 48 or 96-well disposable chemotaxis chamber fitted with a 5-8 μm polycarbonate filter for monocytes, neutrophils or eosinophils, or a 3 μm filter for lymphocytes (Uguccioni et al., \nEur. J. Immunol., \n25:64, 1995; Loetscher et al., \nJ. Exp. Med., \n184:569, 1996; Weber et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n4166, 1995) (PVP free) (ChemoTX, Neuroprobe Inc., Cabin John, MD, USA). 29 μl of chemoattractant or control are added to the lower compartment of each well. The framed filter is aligned with the holes in the corner of the filter frame and place over the wells. 2½×10\n5 \nmonocytes in 25 μl of Gey's balanced salt solution+1 mg/ml BSA are added to the upper compartment. The agent is dissolved in Milli Q water and then serially diluted in the Gey's balanced salt solution. In most cases, the serially diluted agent is added to the upper compartment of the chemotaxis chamber. The chamber is incubated at 37° C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n2 \nfor 1.5 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnzyme Release\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe release of N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase from monocytes may be employed to determine whether a therapeutic agent inhibits a cytokine-associated activity. Samples of 1.2×10\n6 \nmonocytes in 0.3 ml of prewarmed medium (136 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1 mM CaCl\n2\n, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM D-glucose, and 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA) are pretreated for 2 minutes with cytochalasin B (2.7 mg/ml) and then stimulated with a chemokine in the presence or absence of the therapeutic agent. The reaction is stopped after 3 minutes by cooling on ice and centrifugation, and the enzyme activity is determined in the supernatant (Uguccioni et al., \nEur. J. Immunol., \n25:64, 1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe release of elastase from neutrophils may also be employed to determine whether a therapeutic agent inhibits a cytokine-associated activity (Pereri et al., \nJ. Exp. Med., \n1547, 1988; Clark-Lewis et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n269:16075, 1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCytosolic Free Ca\n2+\n Concentration [Ca\n2+\n]\ni \nChanges\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes loaded with Fura-2 (0.1 nmol/10\n5 \ncells) are stimulated with a chemokine in the presence or absence of the therapeutic agent, and [Ca\n2+\n]\ni\n-related fluorescence changes are recorded (Von Tschanner et al., \nNature, \n324:369, 1986). For example, to determine cytosolic Ca\n2+\n concentrations in monocytes, monocytes are incubated with 0.5 μM Fura-2/AM for 30 minutes at 37° C. in HEPES-buffered saline (145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM HEPES, and 10 mM glucose), pH 7.4, at 37° C., supplemented with 1% albumin (w/v) and 1 mM CaCl\n2\n. After loading with Fura-2, the cells are centrifuged for 5 minutes at 300 g and then resuspended in buffer containing no added albumin, to a cell density of 1.5×10\n6 \ncells/ml, and kept at room temperature until use. This protocol results in a cytosolic Fura-2 concentration of about 100 μM. Serial dilutions of chemokines in PBS plus 0.1% albumin (w/v) (sterile filtered) are added to aliquots (0.7 ml) of cell suspension. The Fura-2 fluorescence of the monocyte suspension is measured at 37° C. in a single excitation, single emission (500 nm) wavelength Perkin-Elmer LS5 fluorometer (Perkin-Elmer, http://www.perkinelmer.com). [Ca\n2+\n]\ni \nis calculated from changes in fluorescence measured at a single excitation wavelength of 340 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[Ca\n2+\n]\ni \nmeasurements in cells that are stably transformed with a molecularly cloned chemokine receptor which is not expressed in the corresponding non-transformed cells are performed essentially as described above. After loading with Fura-2/AM, cells (1×10\n6\n/ml) are kept in ice-cold medium (118 mM NaCl, 4.6 mM KCl, 25 mM NaHCO\n3\n, 1 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 11 mM glucose, 50 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.1% gelatin (pH 7.4). Aliquots (2 ml) of cell suspension are prewarmed at 37° C. for 5 minutes in 3-ml plastic cuvettes, and fluorescence is measured in a fluorometer (Johnson Foundation Biomedical Group) with magnetic stirring and temperature controlled at 37° C. Excitation is set at 340 nm, and emission is set at 510 nm. [Ca\n2+\n]\ni \nis calculated as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor studies in monocytes on cross-desensitization of calcium responses, chemokines are added sequentially with a 2-minute interval, and [Ca\n2+\n]\ni \ntransients are recorded. The concentrations used in these types of studies vary for each chemokine and re set at levels known to induce the maximal response for [Ca\n2+\n]\ni \nmobilization (see Forssmann et al., \nFEBS Lett., \n408:211, 1997; Sozzani et al., \nJ. Leukoc. Biol., \n57:788, 1995; Berkhout et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n272:16404, 1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemokine Binding and Binding Displacement\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, specific binding is calculated as the amount of labeled agent bound in the absence of cold competitor minus the amount of labeled agent bound in the presence of cold competitor. The amount of specific binding in the presence of varied amounts of cold competitor can be used to determine the association constant for the agent, as well as the number of binding sites on the cell for the agent, using, for example, Scatchard Analysis. The agent may be labeled by radiolabeling (e.g., iodination) or with a suitable biochemical tag (e.g., biotin) or by addition of a photoactivatable crosslinking group. Agents with an association constant lower than 100 μM (i.e., which bind more strongly than an agent with an association constant of 100 μM) and which have at least about 2,500, preferably at least 10,000, and more preferably greater than 25,000, binding sites per cell for at least one cell type which expresses a chemokine receptor, fall under the scope of this invention. THP-1 cells have at least about 5,000 MCP-1 receptors/cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, monocytes are suspended in RPMI 1640 medium without bicarbonate containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% azide. Radiolabeled chemokine peptide is incubated with 1-2×10\n6 \ncells, e.g., THP-1 cells, in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled chemokine for 15 minutes at 37° C. in a 96-well plate in a final volume of 0.2 ml (e.g., PBS+0.5% FCS). After the incubation, 0.5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (20 mM Tris, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.4) is added, and cells are collected onto a polyethyleneimine-treated Whatman GF/C filter using a Brandall cell harvester. Filters are washed with 4 ml of cold wash buffer, and the radioactivity bound to the filters is countered in a γ-counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor competition studies, the IC\n50 \nis calculated with a curve fitting program (GraFit, Erithacus Software, London, U.K.), using a four-parameter logistic, cpm\nbound\n=cpm\nmax\n/(1+([L]/IC\n50\n)\ns\n)=cpm\nns\n, where cpm\nmax \nrepresents the binding without competitor, [L] is the competitor, cpm\nns \nis the non-specific binding, and s is the slope factor. The cpm\nbound \nis corrected for “no cell” controls. To obtain the IQ and capacity of specific binding, data from homologous displacement experiments are fitted into a single-site ligand binding equation using the GraFit best fit program.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemokine binding to cells stably transformed with a molecularly cloned chemokine receptor is performed essentially as described above except that radiolabeled agent is diluted with unlabeled chemokine. Cells are incubated with radiolabeled agent plus or minus unlabeled chemokines for 30 minutes at 37° C. (see also Imai et al., supra; Sozzani et al., supra; Berkhout et al., supra; WO 97/22698).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding to the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe affinity of the therapeutic agent to DARC may be determined to any method known in the art. Agents which bind to DARC with a lower association constant (i.e., stronger binding) than they bind to chemokine receptors (i.e., a DARC selectivity ration of <1), and which bind to DARC with an association constant lower than 100 μM, preferably lower than 10 μM and more preferably lower than 1 μM, are useful in particular embodiments of the methods of the invention. In contrast, agents which do not bind DARC, or do not bind to DARC with an affinity that is greater than their affinity for chemokine receptors (i.e., a selectivity ration of >1), are useful in the practice of other embodiments of the methods of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of the Co-Mitogenic Activity of Chemokines\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany chemokines are co-mitogenic with low concentrations of FCS. Assays well known in the art for determination of DNA synthesis induced by any known chemokine plus a low concentration (<5%) of FCS on suitable cells (e.g., smooth muscle cells) in the presence or absence of the agent may be employed to screen agents for such inhibitory activity. See Porreca et al., \nJ. Vasc. Res., \n34:58, 1997, the disclosure of which in incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-Lentiviral Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo prepare cell lines that are susceptible to lentiviral infection as a result of the expression of a particular chemokine receptor, a molecularly cloned chemokine receptor is introduced into a cell line that does not otherwise express the chemokine receptor, e.g., HeLa-MAGI (Kimpton and Emerman, \nJ. Viral., \n66(5):3026, 1992) or U373-MAGI (Harrington and Geballe, \nJ. Viral., \n67:5939, 1993) cells, by infection with a retroviral vector. Expression of the chemokine receptor on the cell surface is demonstrated by immunostaining live cells using antibody. Expression of the RNA encoding the receptor is demonstrated by RT-PCR analysis. HeLa-MAGI and U373-MAGI express β-galactosidase after lentiviral infection. Incubation of infected cells with X-gal results in the deposit of a blue stain in these cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInfection of the chemokine receptor-stably transformed cell lines with HIV in the presence or absence of agent is performed in 12-well plates with 10-fold serial dilutions of 300 μl of virus in the presence of 30 μg/ml DEAE-Dextran as described (Kimpton and Emerman, supra). Viral stocks are normalized by ELISA or p24\ngag \n(Coulter Immunology, Miami, Fla., USA) or p27\ngag \n(Coulter Immunology, Miami, Fla., USA) for HIV-1 and HIV-2/SIV, respectively, using standards provided by the manufacturer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo days after infection, cells are fixed and stained for (3-galactosidase activity with X-gal. The cells are stained for 50-120 minutes at 37° C. The infectious titer is the number of blue cells per well multiplied by the dilution of virus and normalized to 1 ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor other methods useful to determine whether an agent inhibits lentiviral infection and/or replication, see also Cocchi et al., \nScience, \n270:1811, 1995, and W097/22698.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgonists\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine whether an agent of the invention is a chemokine receptor agonist, varying amounts of a labeled form of the agent, e.g., biotinylated, are mixed with cells that express the receptor. The affinity of the labeled agent for the cells is then determined. Agents that bind to receptors with a reasonable affinity and interact with the receptor by inducing signaling, are within the scope of the invention. While not encompassed by the term “agonist” or “antagonist”, agents that bind to or near the receptor but elicit no response are also within the scope of the invention, and are termed “neutral” agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgents with agonist activity may also be identified using the transwell migration assay, where the cells are placed in the upper compartment in the absence of agent, and the agent is placed at varying concentrations in the lower compartment in place of the chemokine. If the agent(s) have agonist activity, more cells are found in the lower compartment at the end of the assay in wells containing the agent(s) than in wells containing inactive control, i.e., agent or medium alone. Preferably, agents having agonist activity also stimulate migration of primary human cells, e.g., monocyte, in a transwell migration assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, weak agonists or neutral agonists (agents which bind to the receptor but do not inhibit binding of native chemokine and its subsequent signaling, nor do they induce signaling themselves) can be identified by screening the agents for ability to displace the binding of HIV gp120, specifically the V3 loop of gp120, to the surface of THP-1 cells or Jurkat cells. Cells are incubated with labeled (for example, radioiodinated) recombinant gp120 protein in an amount effective to bind to the virus receptor, in the presence or absence of various concentrations of the agent(s). Agents which reduce or abolish gp120 binding are agonists or neutral agents within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo Studies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA rapid method to determine whether an agent of the invention inhibits or augments an inflammatory response is to inject a selected chemokine into the skin of an animal in the presence or absence of an agent of the invention. At some later point in time, animals are sacrificed and the number of inflammatory cells in animals exposed to chemokine and the agent is compared to the number of inflammatory cells in animals to chemokine alone, e.g., by quantitative immunofluorescence, relative to control animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide Synthesis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present isolated, purified chemokine peptides, peptide variants or derivatives thereof, can be synthesized in vitro, e.g., by the solid phase peptide synthetic method. The solid phase peptide synthetic method is an established and widely used method, which is described in the following references: Stewart et al., \nSolid Phase Peptide Synthesis, \nW. H. Freedman Co., San Francisco, 1969; Merrifield, \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc., \n85:2149, 1963; Meienhofer in “Hormonal Proteins and Peptides,” ed.; C. H. Li, Academic Press, 2:48-267, 1973; Bavaay and Merrifield, “The Peptides,” eds. E. Gross and F. Meienhofer, 2:3-285, 1980; and Clark-Lewis et al., \nMeth. Enzymol., \n287:233, 1997. These peptides can be further purified by fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns; ethanol precipitation; reverse phase HPLC; chromatography on silica or on an anion-exchange resin such as DEAE; chromatofocusing; SDS-PAGE; ammonium sulfate precipitation; gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75; or ligand affinity chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce isolated and characterized, derivatives, e.g., chemically derived derivatives, of a given chemokine peptide can be readily prepared. For example, amides of the chemokine peptide or chemokine peptide variants of the present invention may also be prepared by techniques well known in the art for converting a carboxylic acid group or precursor, to an amide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSalts of carboxyl groups of a peptide or peptide variant of the invention may be prepared in the usual manner by contacting the peptide with one or more equivalents of a desired base such as, for example, a metallic hydroxide base, e.g., sodium hydroxide, a metal carbonate or bicarbonate base such, for example, sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate; or an amide base such as, for example, triethylamine, triethanolamine, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nN-acyl derivatives of an amino group of the chemokine peptide or peptide variants may be prepared by utilizing an N-acyl protected amino acid for the final condensation, or by acylating a protected or unprotected peptide. O-acyl derivatives may be prepared, for example, by acylation of a free hydroxyl peptide or peptide resin. Either acylation may be carried out using standard acylating reagents such as acyl halide, anhydrides, acyl imidazoles, and the like. Both N- and O-acylation may be carried out together, if desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the amino acid sequence of a chemokine peptide can be modified so as to result in a chemokine peptide variant. The modification includes the substitution of at least one amino acid residue in the peptide for another amino acid residue, including substitutions which utilize the D rather than L form, as well as other well known amino acid analogs, e.g., unnatural amino acids such as a-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe substituents R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nof the above generic formula may be attached to the free amine of the N-terminal amino acid by standard methods known in the art. For example, alkyl groups, e.g., (C\n1\n-C\n30\n)alkyl, may be attached using reductive alkylation. Hydroxyalkyl groups, e.g., (C\n1\n-C\n30\n)hydroxyalkyl, may also be attached using reductive alkylation wherein the free hydroxy group is protected with a t-butyl ester. Acyl groups, e.g., COE\n1\n, may be attached by coupling the free acid, e.g., E\n1\nCOOH, to the free amine of the N-terminal amino acid by mixing the completed resin with 3 molar equivalents of both the free acid and diisopropylcarbodiimide in methylene chloride for one hour. If the free acid contains a free hydroxy group, e.g., p-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, then the coupling should be performed with an additional 3 molar equivalents of HOBt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen R\n1 \nis —NH\n2\n, the synthesis of the peptide starts with an Fmoc-amino acid which is coupled to the Rink Amide MBHA resin. If R\n1 \nis —OH, the synthesis of the peptide starts with a Fmoc-amino acid which is coupled to Wang resin.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nc(Cys-Lys-Trp-Ile-Gln-Cys)-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:38)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe title peptide was synthesized on an Advanced ChemTech model 396 multiple peptide synthesizer (the “ACT 396 multiple peptide synthesizer”) (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, Ky., USA) using Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. A Rink Amide 4-methylbenzylhydrylamine (MBHA) resin (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA) with substitution of 0.58 mmol/g was used. The Fmoc amino acids (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA, and Chem-Impex, Wood Dale, Ill., USA) used were Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Ile-OH, and Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH. The synthesis was carried out on a 0.090 mmol scale. The Fmoc groups were removed by treatment with 25% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) for 5 min. Then a second deprotection was done for 25 min. In each coupling step, the Fmoc amino acid (4 eq, 0.36 mmol), N,N-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) (4 eq, 0.36 mmol), and 1-hydroxy-benzotriazole (HOBt) (4 eq, 0.36 mmol) in DMF (1.5 mL) were used. Double coupling was performed for each residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ACT 396 multiple peptide synthesizer was programmed to perform the following reaction cycle: 1) washing with DMF, 2) removing Fmoc protecting group with 25% piperidine in DMF for 5 and 25 minutes, 3) washing with DMF, 4) coupling with Fmoc amino acid in the presence of DIC and HOBt for 1 hour, 5) washing with DMF, and 6) repeat step 4. The resin was coupled successively according to the sequence of the title peptide. After the peptide chain was assembled and the last Fmoc-protecting group was removed, the resin was washed completely by using DMF and dichloromethane (DCM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo cleave the peptide off the resin, the peptide-resin was treated with a TFA solution containing 8% triisopropylsilane (TIS) for 2 hours at room temperature. The resin was filtered off and the filtrate was poured into 25 mL of ether. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation. This crude product was dissolved in 0.2N NH\n4\nOAc aqueous solution (180 mL) and the pH of the solution was adjusted to ˜8.5 by adding concentrated NH\n4\nOH. The solution was opened to the air for 72 hours at room temperature. The solution was acidified with HOAc after the oxidation reaction was complete.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting crude product was purified on a reverse-phase preparative HPLC system with a column (4×43 cm) of C\n18 \nDYNAMAX-100 A\n0 \n(Varian, Walnut Creek, Calif., USA). The column was eluted over approximately 1 hour using a linear gradient of 85% A: 15% B to 30% A: 70% B, where A was 0.1% TFA in water and B was 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile. The fractions were checked by analytical HPLC and those containing pure product were pooled and lyophilized to dryness to give 31.5 mg (45% yield) of a white solid. Purity was 95.4% based on the analytical HPLC analysis. Electro-spray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis gave the molecular weight at 776.3 (in agreement with the calculated molecular weight of 776.98).\n\n\n \nExample 2 \n\n\nc(Cys-Trp-Ile-Gln-Cys)-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:47)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe title peptide was synthesized by using a synthetic procedure analogous to the one described in Example 1. From 0.068 mmol Rink Amide MBHA resin, 13.1 mg of the desired product was obtained (yield=30%). Purity was 99% based on the analytical HPLC analysis. Electro-spray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis gave the molecular weight at 648.2 (in agreement with the calculated molecular weight of 648.81).\n\n\n \nExample 3 \n\n\nAc-DGln-c(Cys-Lys-Trp-Ile-Gln-Cys)-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:39)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe title peptide was synthesized by using a synthetic procedure analogous to the one described in Example 1. From 0.090 mmol Rink Amide MBHA resin, 31.5 mg of the desired product was obtained (yield=37%). Purity was 91.3% based on the analytical HPLC analysis. Electro-spray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis gave the molecular weight at 946.5 (in agreement with the calculated molecular weight of 947.15).\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\n(Ac=Lys=Trp=Ile=Gln=hCyc)=NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:57) \n\n\n \n \n \nThe title peptide was synthesized using Fmoc-chemistry on an Advanced ChemTech Apex peptide synthesizer (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, Ky., USA). 150 mg of 0.78 mmol/g (0.117 mmol) Rink Amide MBHA resin (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA) was placed in a reaction well and pre-swollen in 1.5 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) prior to synthesis. Cycle 1: The resin was treated with two 1.5 mL portions of 25% piperidine in DMF for 5 and 25 minutes, respectively, followed by 4 washes of 1.5 mL DMF. Amino acids stocks were prepared in N-methylpyrrollidinone (NMP) as 0.45N solutions containing 0.45N HOBt. DIC was prepared as a 1.8N solution in NMP. To the resin 1.55 mL of the first amino acid (0.7 mmol), Fmoc-homocysteine(Trt)-OH (Bachem, Torrance, Calif., USA), was added along with 0.39 mL (0.7 mmol) of DIC. After one hour of constant mixing, the coupling reagents were drained from the resin and the coupling step repeated. The resin was washed with two 1.5 mL aliquots of DMF for 1 minute. The process of assembling the peptide (deblock/wash/acylate/wash) was repeated for cycles 2-5 identical to that as described for cycle 1. The following amino acids were used: for cycle 2, Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH (Genzyme, Cambridge, Mass., USA); for cycle 3, Fmoc-Ile-OH (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA); for cycle 4, Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH (Genzyme, Cambridge, Mass., USA); and for cycle 5, Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA). The N-terminal Fmoc was removed with 25% piperidine in DMF, followed by four 1.5 mL DMF washes for 1 minute. To the resin 1.5 mL of 1N bromoacetic acid in NMP plus 0.5 mL of 1N DIC in NMP was added. The resin was mixed for 30 minutes, the well emptied, and the acetylation procedure repeated. The resin was washed with DMF, followed by 3 washes with dichloromethane (DCM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo the resin, 5 mL of the following reagent was added: 2% TIS, 5% water, 5% (w/v) dithiothrieitol (DTT), 88% TFA, and allowed to mix for 3.5 hours. The filtrate was collected into 40 mL of cold anhydrous ethyl ether. The precipitate was pelleted for 10 minutes at 3500 RPM in a refrigerated centrifuge. The ether was decanted, and the peptide re-suspended in fresh ether. The ether workup was performed a total of 3 times. Following the last ether wash the peptide was allowed to air dry to remove residual ether. The peptide was dissolved in 10% acetonitrile and analyzed by mass spectrometry and reverse-phase HPLC. HPLC analysis employing a 30×4.6 cm C18 column (Vydac) using a gradient of 2-60% acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) over 30 minutes. This analysis identified a product with >75% purity. Mass analysis employing electrospray ionization identified a main product containing a mass of 812.5 Da, which corresponded to the desired Br-peptide product. The crude product (˜95 mg) was diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/mL in 10% DMSO, the pH was adjusted to 6.0 with saturated ammonium carbonate in water. After 16 hours the peptide was re-examined by mass spectrometry analysis and HPLC. Mass spectrometery analysis identified a single species with a mass of 730.3, suggesting the Br was successfully displaced. The peptide solution was concentrated to ˜10 mL using a Genevac concentrator, and then purified on a preparative HPLC equipped with a C18 column using a similar elution gradient. The fractions were checked by analytical HPLC and those containing pure product were pooled and lyophilized to dryness to give 25.8 mg (30% yield) of a white solid. Purity was 95% based on the analytical HPLC analysis. Electro-spray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis gave the molecular weight at 730.3 (in agreement with the calculated molecular weight of 729.90).\n\n\n \nExample 5 \n\n\nc(Ahx-Lys-Trp-Ile-Gln-Asp)-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:41)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe title peptide was synthesized using Fmoc-chemistry on an Advanced ChemTech Apex peptide synthesizer (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, Ky., USA). 115 mg of 0.78 mmol/g (0.09 mmol) Rink Amide MBHA resin (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA) was placed in a reaction well and pre-swollen in 1.5 mL of DMF prior to synthesis.

The side-chain protecting group of Glu(O-2-PhiPr) and Dap(Mtt) were deblocked using ten, 5 mL washes of 5% TIS, 1% TFA in DCM for 2 minutes. Following the last wash the resin was washed with DCM and DMF twice respectively. The resin was treated with 25% piperdine twice for 2 minutes, followed by 4 DMF washes. An aliquot of resin (<1 mg) gave a positive Kaiser test (positive control). The resin was then treated with the following conditions to form the lactam: 2 mL of 0.5N HOBt, 2 mL of 0.5N PyBop and 1 mL of 2M DIEA, twice for 4 hours with constant stirring. A follow-up Kaiser test was still positive indicating incomplete lactam formation. A second round of lactam forming conditions was employed: 1 mL 0.5N HOAT, 1 mL of 0.5N HATU and 1 mL of 1N DIEA, for 2 hours with constant stirring. A follow-up Kaiser test showed no blue color change indicating no presence of a free amine. The resin was washed with DMF, followed by 3 washes with DCM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo the resin, 5 mL of the following reagent was added: 2% triisopropylsilane, 5% water, 5% (w/v) dithiothrieitol, 88% trifluoroacetic acid, and allowed to mix for 3.5 hours. The filtrate was collected into 40 mL of cold anhydrous ethyl ether. The precipitate was pelleted for 10 minutes at 3500 RPM in a refrigerated centrifuge. The ether was decanted, and the peptide re-suspended in fresh ether. The ether workup was performed a total of 3 times. Following the last ether wash the peptide was allowed to air dry to remove residual ether. The peptide was dissolved in 10% acetonitrile and analyzed by mass spectrometry. A single product with a mass of 840.5 Da was identified, which corresponded to the desired lactam-peptide product. The crude product (˜65 mg) was purified on a preparative HPLC equipped with a C18 column using a suitable elution gradient. The fractions were checked by analytical HPLC and those containing pure product were pooled and lyophilized to dryness to give 23 mg of a white solid. Purity was 84% based on the analytical HPLC analysis. Electro-spray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis gave the molecular weight at 840.5 (in agreement with the calculated molecular weight of 839.99).\n\n\n \nExample 8 \n\n\nc(Glutaryl-Lys-Trp-Ile-Gln-Orn)-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:67)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe title peptide was synthesized using Fmoc-chemistry on an Advanced ChemTech Apex peptide synthesizer (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, Ky., USA). 115 mg of 0.78 mmol/g (0.09 mmol) Rink Amide MBHA resin (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA) was placed in a reaction well and pre-swollen in 1.5 mL of DMF prior to synthesis. Cycle 1: The resin was treated with two 1.5 mL portions of 25% piperidine in DMF for 5 and 25 minutes, respectively, followed by 4 washes of 1.5 mL DMF. Amino acids stocks were prepared in (NMP) as 0.45N solutions containing 0.45N HOBt. DIC was prepared as a 0.75N solution in NMP. To the resin 1.1 mL of the first amino acid (0.49 mmol), Fmoc-Orn(Mtt)-OH (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA) was added along with 0.65 mL (0.49 mmol) of DIC. After one hour of constant mixing the coupling reagents were drained from the resin, and the coupling step repeated. The resin wash washed with two 1.5 mL aliquots of DMF for 1 minute. The process of assembling the peptide (deblock/wash/acylate/wash) was repeated for cycles 2-5 identical to that as described for cycle 1. The following amino acids were used: for cycle 2, Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH (Genzyme, Cambridge, Mass., USA); for cycle 3, Fmoc-Ile-OH (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA); for cycle 4, Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH (Genzyme, Cambridge, Mass., USA); and for cycle 5, Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA). The N-terminal Fmoc was removed with 25% piperidine in DMF, followed by four 1.5 mL DMF washes for 1 minute. DIEA, 0.7 mL of 4N in NMP, along with 1.1 mL of 0.45N glutaric anhydride in NMP was added to the resin and mixed for 30 minutes, and repeated once. The resin was washed with DMF, followed by 3 washes with dichloromethane (DCM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe side-chain protecting group of Orn(Mtt) was deblocked using ten, 5 mL washes of 5% TIS, 1% TFA in DCM for 2 minutes.

A follow-up Kaiser test was still positive indicating incomplete lactam formation. A second round of lactam forming conditions was employed: 1 mL 0.5N HOAT, 1 mL of 0.5N HATU and 1 mL of IN DIEA, for 2 hours with constant stirring. A follow-up Kaiser test showed no blue color change indicating no presence of a free amine. The resin was washed with DMF, followed by 3 washes with DCM. To the resin, 5 mL of the following reagent was added: 2% triisopropylsilane, 5% water, 5% (w/v) dithiothrieitol, 88% trifluoroacetic acid, and allowed to mix for 3.5 hours.

Following the last ether wash the peptide was allowed to air dry to remove residual ether. The peptide was dissolved in 10% acetonitrile and analyzed by mass spectrometry. A single product with a mass of 783.6 Da was identified, which corresponded to the desired lactam-peptide product. The crude product (˜65 mg) was purified on a preparative HPLC equipped with a C18 column using a suitable elution gradient. The fractions were checked by analytical HPLC and those containing pure product were pooled and lyophilized to dryness to give 12 mg of a white solid. Purity was 99% based on the analytical HPLC analysis. Electro-spray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis gave the molecular weight at 783.6 (in agreement with the calculated molecular weight of 782.93).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples

are preferably administered so as to achieve serum levels of about 0.01 pM to about 100 nM, more preferably at doses of about 0.01 pM to about 5nM, and even more preferably at doses of about 0.1 pM to about 2 nM, of the therapeutic agent. To achieve these levels, the agent may be administered at dosages of at least 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg, more preferably about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg, and even more preferably about 0.1 to about 30 mg/kg, of body weight, although other dosages may provide beneficial results. The amount administered will vary depending on various factors including, but not limited to, the agent chosen, the disease, whether prevention or treatment is to be achieved, and if the agent is modified for bioavailability and in vivo stability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more suitable unit dosage forms comprising the therapeutic agents of the invention, which may optionally be formulated for sustained release, can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, or parenteral, including by rectal, buccal, vaginal and sublingual, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, intrapulmonary and intranasal routes. The formulations may, where appropriate, be conveniently presented in discrete dosage forms and may be prepared by any of the methods well known to pharmacy. Such methods may include the step of bringing into association the therapeutic agent with liquid carriers, solid matrices, semi-solid carriers, finely divided solid carriers or combinations thereof, and then, if necessary, introducing or shaping the product into the desired delivery system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the therapeutic agents of the invention are prepared for oral administration, they are preferably combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipients to form a pharmaceutical formulation, or unit dosage form. The total active ingredients in such formulation comprise from 0.1 to 99.9% by weight of the formulation. By “pharmaceutically acceptable” it is meant the carrier, diluent, excipients, and/or salt must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation, and not deleterious to the recipient thereof The active ingredient for oral administration may be present as a powder or as granules; as a solution, a suspension or an emulsion; or in achievable base as a synthetic resin for ingestion of the active ingredients from a chewing gum. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, douches, lubricants, foams or sprays containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. Formulations suitable for rectal administration may be presented as suppositories.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations containing the therapeutic agents of the invention can be prepared by procedures known in the art using well known and readily available ingredients. Examples of excipients, diluents, and carriers that are suitable for such formulations include the following fillers and extenders such as starch, sugars, mannitol, and silicic derivatives; binding agents such as carboxymethyl cellulose, HPMC and other cellulose derivatives, alginates, gelatin, and polyvinyl-pyrrolidone; moisturing agents such as glycerol; disintegrating agents such as calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate; agents for retarding dissolution such as paraffin; resorption accelerators such as quarternary ammonium compounds; surface active agents such as acetyl alcohol, glycerol monostearate; adsorptive carriers such as kaolin and bentonite; and lubricants such as talc, calcium and magnesium stearate, and solid polyethyl glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, tablets and caplets containing the agents of the invention can include buffering agents such as calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide and magnesium carbonate. Caplets and tablets can also include inactive ingredients such as cellulose, pregelatinized starch, silicon dioxide, hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, talc, titanium dioxide, benzoic acid, citric acid, corn starch, mineral oil, polypropylene glycol, sodium phosphate, and zinc stearate, and the like. Hard or soft gelatin capsules containing an agent of the invention can contain inactive ingredients such as gelatin, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate, starch, talc, and titanium dioxide, and the like, as well as liquid vehicles such as polyethylene glycols (PEGs) and vegetable oil. Moreover, enteric coated caplets or tablets of an agent of the invention are designed to resist disintegration in the stomach and dissolve in the more neutral to alkaline environment of the duodenum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic agents of the invention can also be formulated as elixirs or solutions for convenient oral administration or as solutions appropriate for parenteral administration, for instance by intramuscular, subcutaneous or intravenous routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical formulations of the therapeutic agents of the invention can also take the form of an aqueous or anhydrous solution or dispersion, or alternatively the form of an emulsion or suspension.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the therapeutic agent may be formulated for parenteral administration and may be presented in unit dose form in ampules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion containers or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese formulations can contain pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles and adjuvants which are well known in the art. It is possible, for example, to prepare solutions using one or more organic solvent(s) that is/are acceptable from the physiological standpoint, chosen, in addition to water, from solvents such as acetone, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, glycol ethers such as the products sold under the name “Dowanol”, polyglycols and polyethylene glycols, C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl esters of short-chain acids, preferably ethyl or isopropyl lactate, fatty acid triglycerides such as the products marketed under the name “Miglyol”, isopropyl myristate, animal, mineral and vegetable oils and polysiloxanes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the compound of this invention can be administered in a sustained release composition such as those described in the following patents and patent applications. U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,659 teaches sustained release compositions comprising a bioactive agent and a polyester. U.S. Pat. No. 5,595,760 teaches sustained release compositions comprising a bioactive agent in a gelable form. U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,221 teaches polymeric sustained release compositions comprising a bioactive agent and chitosan. U.S. Pat. No. 5,916,883 teaches sustained release compositions comprising a bioactive agent and cyclodextrin. The teachings of the foregoing patents and applications are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of immediate or of sustained release compositions depends on the type of indications targeted. If the indication consists of an acute or over-acute disorder, a treatment with an immediate form will be preferred over the same with a prolonged release composition. On the contrary, for preventive or long-term treatments, a prolonged release composition will generally be preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic agents of the invention can be delivered via patches for transdermal administration. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,560,922 for examples of patches suitable for transdermal delivery of a therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor administration to the upper (nasal) or lower respiratory tract by inhalation, the therapeutic agents of the invention are conveniently delivered form an insufflator, nebulizer or pressurized pack or other convenient means of delivering an aerosol spray.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe local delivery of the therapeutic agents of the invention can also be by a variety of techniques which administer the agent at or near the site of disease. Examples include local delivery catheters, shunts and stents or other implantable devices, site specific carriers, direct injection, or direct applications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical administration, the therapeutic agents may be formulated as is known in the art for direct application to a target area. Conventional forms for this purpose include would dressings, coated bandages or other polymer covering, ointments, creams, lotions, pastes, jellies, sprays, and aerosols, as well as in toothpaste and mouthwash, or by other suitable forms, e.g., via a coated condom. The active ingredients can also be delivered via iontophoresis, e.g., as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,140,122; 4,383,529; or 4,051,842.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations and compositions described herein may also contain other ingredients such as antimicrobial agents, or preservatives. Furthermore, the active ingredients may also be used in combination with other therapeutic agents, for example, oral contraceptives, bronchodilators, anti-viral agents, steroids and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that while the invention has been described in conjunction with the detailed description thereof, that the foregoing description is intended to illustrate and not to limit the scope of the invention. Other aspects, advantages, and modifications are within the claims. Also, the contents of each references cited herein is incorporated by reference in its entirety."

FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds, compositions comprising an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound and methods to treat or prevent a condition, such as pain, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound.\n\n\n \n\n\n2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nChronic pain is a major contributor to disability and is the cause of much suffering. The successful treatment of severe and chronic pain is a primary goal of the physician, with opioid analgesics being preferred drugs for doing so.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUntil recently, there was evidence of three major classes of opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), with each class having subtype receptors. These receptor classes are known as µ, δ and κ. As opiates have a high affinity for these receptors while not being endogenous to the body, research followed in order to identify and isolate the endogenous ligands to these receptors. These ligands were identified as enkephalins, endorphins and dynorphins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent experimentation has led to the identification of a cDNA encoding an opioid receptor-like (ORL-1) receptor with a high degree of homology to the known receptor classes. The ORL-1 receptor was classified as an opioid receptor based only on structural grounds, as the receptor did not exhibit pharmacological homology. It was initially demonstrated that non-selective ligands having a high affinity for µ, δ and κ receptors had low affinity for the ORL-1 receptor. This characteristic, along with the fact that an endogenous ligand had not yet been discovered, led to the term \"orphan receptor\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubsequent research led to the isolation and structure of the endogenous ligand of the ORL-1 receptor (\ni\n.\ne\n., nociceptin). This ligand is a seventeen amino acid peptide structurally similar to members of the opioid peptide family.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe discovery of the ORL-1 receptor presents an opportunity in drug discovery for novel compounds that can be administered for pain management or other syndromes modulated by this receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe publications \"From Hit to Lead: Combining Two Complementary Methods\" and \"\nFrom Hit to Lead: Analyzing Structure-Profile Relationships\" of Poulain et al.

One skilled in the art will recognize that, e.g., acid addition salts of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be prepared by reaction of the compounds with the appropriate acid via a variety of known methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention disclosed herein is also meant to encompass all solvates of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds. \"Solvates\" are known in the art and are considered to be a combination, physical association and/or solvation of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound with a solvent molecule, e.g., a disolvate, monosolvate or hemisolvate when the solvent molecule:Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound molecule ratio is 2:1, 1:1 or 1:2, respectively. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances, the solvate can be isolated, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated into the crystal lattice of a crystalline solid. Thus, \"solvate,\" as used herein, encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of the invention can be present as a solvated form with a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as water, methanol, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention include both solvated and unsolvated Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound forms. As \"hydrate\" relates to a particular subgroup of solvates, i. e., where the solvent molecule is water, hydrates are included within the solvates of the invention. Preparation of solvates is known in the art. For example, \nM. Caira et al., J. Pharmaceut. Sci., 93(3):601-611 (2004\n), describes the preparation of solvates of fluconazole with ethyl acetate and with water. Similar preparations of solvates, hemisolvate, hydrates, and the like are described by \nE.C. van Tonder et al., AAPS Pharm. Sci. Tech., 5(1):Article 12 (2004\n), and \nA.L. Bingham et al., Chem. Commun., 603-604 (2001\n). A typical, non-limiting, process involves dissolving the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound in a desired amount of the desired solvent (organic, water or mixtures thereof) at temperatures above about 20°C to about 25°C, cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals, and isolating the crystals by known methods, e.g., filtration. Analytical techniques, for example, infrared spectroscopy, can be used to show the presence of the solvent in a crystal of the solvate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention disclosed herein is also meant to encompass all prodrugs of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds. \"Prodrugs\" are known in the art and, while not necessarily possessing any pharmaceutical activity as such, are considered to be any covalently bonded carrier(s) that releases the active parent drug \nin vivo.\n In general, such prodrugs will be a functional derivative of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of Formulas (I), (II), (III) and/or (IV) which is readily convertible \nin vivo, e.g.,\n by being metabolized, into the required Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of Formulas (I), (II), (III) and/or (IV). Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described in, for example, \nDesign of Prodrugs, H. Bundgaard ed., Elsevier (1985\n); \"\nDrug and Enzyme Targeting, Part A,\" K. Widder et al. eds., Vol. 112 in Methods in Enzymology, Academic Press (1985\n); \nBundgaard, \"\nDesign and Application of Prodrugs,\n\" Chapter 5 (pp. 113-191) in A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, P. Krogsgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard eds., Harwood Academic Publishers (1991\n); \nBundgaard et al., Adv. Drug Delivery Revs. 8:1-38 (1992\n); \nBundgaard et al., J. Pharmaceut. Sci. 77:285 (1988\n); and \nKakeya et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 32:692 (1984\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, one or more hydrogen, carbon or other atoms of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be replaced by an isotope of the hydrogen, carbon or other atoms. Such a \"radiolabeled,\" \"radiolabeled form\", and the like of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound, each of which is encompassed by the invention, is useful as a research and/or diagnostic tool in metabolism pharmacokinetic studies and in binding assays. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, and \n36\nCl, respectively. Radiolabeled compounds of the invention can be prepared by methods known in the art. For example, tritiated compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared by introducing tritium into the particular compound of Formula (I), for example, by catalytic dehalogenation with tritium. This method can include reacting a suitably halogen-substituted precursor of a compound of Formula (I) with tritium gas in the presence of a suitable catalyst, for example, Pd/C, in the presence or absence of a base. Other suitable methods for preparing tritiated compounds can be found in \nFiler, Isotopes in the Physical and Biomedical Sciences, Vol. 1, Labeled Compounds (Part A), Chapter 6 (1987\n). \n14\nC-labeled compounds can be prepared by employing starting materials having a \n14\nC carbon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms. The invention is also meant to encompass all such possible forms as well as their racemic and resolved forms or any mixture thereof. When a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound contains an olefinic double bond or other center of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended to include all \"geometric isomers,\" e.g., both E and Z geometric isomers.

Compound \n \nL2\n \n can be reductively aminated with a suitably functionalized 4-piperidone (containing a Z-R\n1\n group on the piperidine nitrogen and substituents A and B) using sodium triacetoxyborohydride and an acid such as acetic acid in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane to provide compound \n \nL3\n.\n The BOC protecting group can be removed under acid conditions (for example, using hydrogen chloride in ethyl acetate) to provide compound \n \nA4\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound \n \nA4\n \n can be converted to the 4-methoxybenzoyl derivative compound \n \nM1\n \n using 4-methoxy-benzoylchloride in a suitable solvent in the presence of an organic or inorganic base. Compound \n \nM1\n \n can be reduced to compound \n \nM2\n,\n \ne\n.\ng\n., using lithium aluminum hydride. As described in Scheme D, compound \n \nM2\n \n can be converted to compound \n \nM3\n \n using ethoxycarbonyl isocyanate in a microwave reactor. Alternatively, compound \n \nA4\n \n can be reacted with a cyclizing reagent, such as ethyl 2-chloro-2-oxoacetate or ethyl 3-chloro-3-oxopropanoate, and a base such as triethylamine in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane to provide compound \n \nM4\n.\n Compound \n \nM4\n \n can be converted to compound \n \nA5\n \n using an alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium ethoxide in a suitable solvent such as ethanol.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound \n \nN1\n \n can be converted to compound \n \nN2\n \n using lithium diisopropylamide in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran followed by treatment with a D having a leaving group substituent, e.g., iodomethane. Compound \n \nN2\n \n can be converted to compound \n \nN3\n \n in a two step procedure. First, the ester can be hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid using an aqueous base such as sodium hydroxide. This can be followed by treatment with diphenylphosphoryl azide and benzyl alcohol under Curtius rearrangement conditions. The benzyloxycarbonyl group of compound \n \nN3\n \n can be removed under hydrogenolysis conditions, \ne\n.\ng\n., using palladium on charcoal, to provide compound \n \nN4\n.\n Compound \n \nN4\n \n can be converted to compound \n \nN5\n \n by reaction with a substituted or unsubstituted 2-halo-1-nitrobenzene, such substituted or unsubstituted as 2-fluoro-1-nitrobenzene, in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile. Compound \n \nN5\n \n can be converted to compound \n \nN6\n \n in a two step procedure. First, reduction of the nitro group can be carried out by hydrogenation using a metal catalyst such as Raney nickel in a suitable solvent such as ethanol. This can be followed by reaction with a cyclizing reagent, such as ethyl 2-chloro-2-oxoacetate or ethyl 3-chloro-3-oxopropanoate, and a base such as triethylamine and a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane. Compound \n \nN6\n \n can be converted to compound \n \nN7\n \n using an alkali metal alkoxide, such as sodium ethoxide, in a suitable solvent, such as ethanol, followed by removal of the protecting group R under standard conditions. The -Z-R\n1\n group can be attached to compound \n \nN7\n \n as described in Scheme A, \ne\n.\ng\n., using either alkylation or reductive amination conditions, to provide compound \n \nN8\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound \n \nO1\n \n can be reacted with a substituted or unsubstituted 1,2-phenylenediamine and a catalytic amount of an acid such as acetic acid in a suitable solvent such as toluene with azeotropic water removal in a Dean-Stark apparatus to provide compound \n \nO2\n.\n Compound \n \nO2\n \n can be cyclized to compound \n \nO3\n \n by reaction with cyclizing reagent, such as a di-acid chloride, e.g., oxalyl dichloride or malonyl dichloride, in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane under high dilution conditions.

Louie and J.F. Hartwig, Tetrahedron Lett. 36(21):3609-3612 (1995\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n4.7 Therapeutic Uses of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the invention, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are administered to an animal in need of treatment or prevention of a Condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be used to treat or prevent any condition treatable or preventable by inhibiting the activity of the ORL-1 receptor. Examples of conditions that are treatable or preventable by inhibiting the activity of the ORL-1 receptor include, but are not limited to, pain (CNS effect), memory disorders, obesity, constipation, depression, dementia, and Parkinsonism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be used to treat or prevent any condition treatable or preventable by activating the ORL-1 receptor. Examples of conditions that are treatable or preventable by activating the ORL-1 receptor include, but are not limited to, pain (PNS effect), anxiety, cough, diarrhea, blood pressure disorder (via vasodilation and via diuresis), epilepsy, anorexia/cachexia, urinary incontinence, and drug abuse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds can be used to treat or prevent acute or chronic pain. Examples of pain that can be treated or prevented using a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound include, but are not limited to, cancer pain, neuropathic pain, labor pain, myocardial infarction pain, pancreatic pain, colic pain, post-operative pain, headache pain, muscle pain, arthritic pain, and pain associated with a periodontal disease, including gingivitis and periodontitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds can also be used to treat or prevent pain associated with inflammation or with an inflammatory disease in an animal. Such pain can arise where there is an inflammation of the body tissue which can be a local inflammatory response or a systemic inflammation. For example, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be used to treat or prevent pain associated with inflammatory diseases including, but not limited to, organ transplant rejection; reoxygenation injury resulting from organ transplantation (see \nGrupp et al., J. Mol, Cell Cardiol. 31:297-303 (1999\n)) including, but not limited to, transplantation of the heart, lung, liver, or kidney; chronic inflammatory diseases of the joints, including arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and bone diseases associated with increased bone resorption; inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ileitis, ulcerative colitis, Barrett's syndrome, and Crohn's disease; inflammatory lung diseases, such as asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and chronic obstructive airway disease; inflammatory diseases of the eye, including corneal dystrophy, trachoma, onchocerciasis, uveitis, sympathetic ophthalmitis and endophthalmitis; chronic inflammatory disease of the gum, including gingivitis and periodontitis; tuberculosis; leprosy; inflammatory diseases of the kidney, including uremic complications, glomerulonephritis and nephrosis; inflammatory disease of the skin, including sclerodermatitis, psoriasis and eczema; inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, including chronic demyelinating diseases of the nervous system, multiple sclerosis, AIDS-related neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease, infectious meningitis, encephalomyelitis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and viral or autoimmune encephalitis; autoimmune diseases, including Type I and Type II diabetes mellitus; diabetic complications, including, but not limited to, diabetic cataract, glaucoma, retinopathy, nephropathy (such as microaluminuria and progressive diabetic nephropathy), gangrene of the feet, atherosclerotic coronary arterial disease, peripheral arterial disease, nonketotic hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar coma, foot ulcers, joint problems, and a skin or mucous membrane complication (such as an infection, a shin spot, a candidal infection or necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum), immune-complex vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); inflammatory disease of the heart, such as cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease hypercholesterolemia, and artherosclerosis; as well as various other diseases that can have significant inflammatory components, including preeclampsia, chronic liver failure, brain and spinal cord trauma, and cancer. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can also be used to treat or prevent pain associated with inflammatory disease that can, for example, be a systemic inflammation of the body, exemplified by gram-positive or gram negative shock, hemorrhagic or anaphylactic shock, or shock induced by cancer chemotherapy in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., shock associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Such shock can be induced, e.g., by a chemotherapeutic agent that is administered as a treatment for cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds can also be used to treat or prevent pain associated with nerve injury (i. e., neuropathic pain). Chronic neuropathic pain is a heterogenous disease state with an unclear etiology. In chronic neuropathic pain, the pain can be mediated by multiple mechanisms. This type of pain generally arises from injury to the peripheral or central nervous tissue. The syndromes include pain associated with spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, phantom pain, causalgia, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy and lower back pain. The chronic pain is different from acute pain in that chronic neuropathic pain patients suffer the abnormal pain sensations that can be described as spontaneous pain, continuous superficial burning and/or deep aching pain. The pain can be evoked by heat-, cold-, and mechano-hyperalgesia, or by heat-, cold-, or mechano-allodynia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChronic neuropathic pain can be caused by injury or infection of peripheral sensory nerves. It includes, but is not limited to, pain from peripheral nerve trauma, herpes virus infection, diabetes mellitus, causalgia, plexus avulsion, neuroma, limb amputation, and vasculitis. Neuropathic pain can also be caused by nerve damage from chronic alcoholism, human immunodeficiency virus infection, hypothyroidism, uremia, or vitamin deficiencies. Stroke (spinal or brain) and spinal cord injury can also induce neuropathic pain. Cancer-related neuropathic pain results from tumor growth compression of adjacent nerves, brain, or spinal cord. In addition, cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can cause nerve injury. Neuropathic pain includes but is not limited to pain caused by nerve injury such as, for example, the pain from which diabetics suffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds can be used to treat or prevent a migraine including, but not limited to, migraine without aura (\"common migraine\"), migraine with aura (\"classic migraine\"), migraine without headache, basilar migraine, familial hemiplegic migraine, migrainous infarction, and migraine with prolonged aura.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, some of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are agonists at the ORL-1 receptor, and some of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are antagonists at the ORL-1 receptor. In another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is an agonist at the ORL-1 receptor and an agonist at a µ, κ and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a µ opioid receptor. In another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is an antagonist at the ORL-1 receptor and an agonist at a µ, κ and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a µ opioid receptor. In another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is an agonist at the ORL-1 receptor and an antagonist at a µ, κ and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a µ opioid receptor. In another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is an antagonist at the ORL-1 receptor and an antagonist at a µ, κ and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a µ opioid receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides methods for inhibiting ORL-1 receptor function in a cell, comprising contacting a cell capable of expressing the ORL-1 receptor with an amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound effective to inhibit ORL-1 receptor function in the cell. This method can be adapted for use \nin vitro\n as part of an assay to select compounds that may be useful for treating or preventing a Condition in an animal. Alternatively, this method can be adapted for use \nin vivo,\n (\ni\n.\ne\n., in an animal such as a human) by contacting a cell in the animal with an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound. In one embodiment, the method is useful for treating or preventing pain in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention. In another embodiment, the method is useful for treating or preventing a memory disorder, obesity, constipation, depression, dementia, or Parkinsonism in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to methods for activating ORL-1 receptor function in a cell, comprising contacting a cell capable of expressing the ORL-1 receptor with an amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound effective to activate ORL-1 receptor function in the cell. This method can be adapted for use \nin vitro\n as part of an assay to select compounds useful for treating or preventing, pain, anxiety, cough, diarrhea, high blood pressure, epilepsy, anorexia/cachexia, urinary incontinence, or drug abuse. Alternatively, the method can be adapted for use \nin vivo\n (\ni\n.\ne\n., in an animal such as a human), by contacting a cell in the animal with an effective amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine compound. In one embodiment the method is useful for treating or preventing pain in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention. In another embodiment, the method is useful for treating or preventing anxiety, cough, diarrhea, high blood pressure, epilepsy, anorexia/cachexia, urinary incontinence, or drug abuse in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of tissue comprising cells capable of expressing the ORL-1 receptor include but are not limited to brain, spinal cord, vas deferens, and gastrointestinal tract tissue. Methods for assaying cells that express the ORL-1 receptor are known in the art; for example, see \nY. Shimohigashi et al., \"\nSensitivity of opioid receptor-like receptor ORL1 for chemical modification on nociceptin, a naturally occurring nociceptive peptide,\n\" J. Biol. Chem. 271(39):23642-23645 (1996\n); \nM. Narita et al., \"\nIdentification of the G-protein coupled ORL1 receptor in the mouse spinal cord by [35S]-GTPγS binding and immunohistochemistry,\n\" Brit.

Lazareno, \"\nMeasurement of agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to cell membranes,\n\" Methods in Molecular Biology 106:231-245 (1999\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n4.8 Therapeutic/Prophylactic Administration and Compositions of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDue to their activity, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are advantageously useful in human and veterinary medicine. As described above, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are useful for treating or preventing a Condition in an animal in need thereof. The Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds of the invention can be administered to any animal requiring modulation of the opioid and/or ORL-1 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen administered to an animal, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be administered as a component of a composition that comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The invention compositions, which comprise a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound, can be administered orally. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can also be administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (\ne.g\n., oral, rectal, and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and can be administered together with a second therapeutically active agent. Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, \ne.g\n., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, multiparticulates, capsules, etc., and can be used to administer a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of administration include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, parenteral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectal, by inhalation, or topical, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The method of administration is left to the discretion of the practitioner. In most instances, administration will result in the release of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound into the bloodstream.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn specific embodiments, it can be desirable to administer a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound locally. This can be achieved, for example and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, \ne.g\n., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository or enema, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, it can be desirable to introduce a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound into the central nervous system or gastrointestinal tract by any suitable route, including intraventricular, intrathecal, and epidural injection, and enema. Intraventricular injection can be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPulmonary administration can also be employed, \ne.g\n., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent, or via perfusion in a fluorocarbon or synthetic pulmonary surfactant. In certain embodiments, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and excipients such as triglycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of the invention is incorporated for parenteral administration by injection (\ne.g\n., continuous infusion or bolus injection), the formulation for parenteral administration can be in the form of a suspension, solution, emulsion in an oily or aqueous vehicle, and such formulations can further comprise pharmaceutically necessary additives such as one or more stabilizing agents, suspending agents, dispersing agents, and the like. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound of the invention can also be in the form of a powder for reconstitution as an injectable formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (\nsee\n \nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n); and \nTreat et al., Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer 317-327 and 353-365 (1989\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be delivered in a controlled-release system or sustained-release system (\nsee, e.g.,\n \nGoodson, \"\nDental Applications\n\" (pp. 115-138) in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Vol. 2, Applications and Evaluation, R.S. Langer and D.L. Wise eds., CRC Press (1984\n)). Other controlled- or sustained-release systems discussed in the review by \nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n) can be used. In one embodiment, a pump can be used (\nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n); \nSefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987\n); \nBuchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980\n); and \nSaudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989\n)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (\nsee\n \nMedical Applications of Controlled Release (Langer and Wise eds., 1974\n); \nControlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance (Smolen and Ball eds., 1984\n); \nRanger and Peppas, J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61 (1983\n); \nLevy et al., Science 228:190 (1985\n); \nDuring et al., Ann. Neurol. 25:351 (1989\n); and \nHoward et al., J. Neurosurg. 71:105 (1989\n)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release system can be placed in proximity of a target of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound, \ne.g\n., the spinal column, brain, or gastrointestinal tract, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention compositions can optionally comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient so as to provide the form for proper administration to the animal. Such a pharmaceutical excipient can be a diluent, suspending agent, solubilizer, binder, disintegrant, preservative, coloring agent, lubricant, and the like. The pharmaceutical excipient can be a liquid, such as water or an oil, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. The pharmaceutical excipient can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating, and coloring agents can be used. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is sterile when administered to an animal. Water is a particularly useful excipient when a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid excipients, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients also include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The invention compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. Specific examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients that can be used to formulate oral dosage forms are described in the \nHandbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, American Pharmaceutical Association (1986\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the composition is in the form of a capsule (\nsee, e.g.,\n \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,698,155\n \n). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical excipients are described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., 19th ed. 1995\n), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a composition adapted for oral administration to human beings. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound to be orally delivered can be in the form of tablets, capsules, gelcaps, caplets, lozenges, aqueous or oily solutions, suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, for example. When a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is incorporated into oral tablets, such tablets can be compressed, tablet triturates, enteric-coated, sugar-coated, film-coated, multiply compressed or multiply layered. Techniques and compositions for making solid oral dosage forms are described in \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets\n (Lieberman, Lachman and Schwartz, eds., 2nd ed.) published by Marcel Dekker, Inc. Techniques and compositions for making tablets (compressed and molded), capsules (hard and soft gelatin) and pills are also described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1553-1593 (Arthur Osol, ed., 16th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton, PA 1980\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid oral dosage forms include aqueous and nonaqueous solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and solutions and/or suspensions reconstituted from non-effervescent granules, optionally containing one or more suitable solvents, preservatives, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, diluents, sweeteners, coloring agents, flavoring agents, and the like. Techniques and composition for making liquid oral dosage forms are described in \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems, (Lieberman, Rieger and Banker, eds.) published by Marcel Dekker, Inc.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is to be injected parenterally, it can be, \ne.g\n., in the form of an isotonic sterile solution. Alternatively, when a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is to be inhaled, it can be formulated into a dry aerosol or can be formulated into an aqueous or partially aqueous solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn orally administered Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can contain one or more agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In these latter platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time-delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate can also be used. Oral compositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate. In one embodiment, the excipients are of pharmaceutical grade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compounds can be formulated for intravenous administration. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration comprise sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions can also include a solubilizing agent. A Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound for intravenous administration can optionally include a local anesthetic such as benzocaine or prilocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound is administered by injection, an ampule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be administered by controlled-release or sustained-release means or by delivery devices that are known to those in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos.: 3,845,770\n \n; \n \n3,916,899\n \n; \n \n3,536,809\n \n; \n \n3,598,123\n \n; \n \n4,008,719\n \n; \n \n5,674,533\n \n; \n \n5,059,595\n \n; \n \n5,591,767\n \n; \n \n5,120,548\n \n; \n \n5,073,543\n \n; \n \n5,639,476\n \n; \n \n5,354,556\n \n; and \n \n5,733,566\n \n, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide controlled- or sustained-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, multiparticulates, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled- or sustained-release formulations known to those in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active ingredients of the invention. The invention thus encompasses single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled- or sustained-release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControlled- or sustained-release pharmaceutical compositions can have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled or non-sustained-release counterparts. In one embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release composition comprises a minimal amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound to treat or prevent the Condition or a symptom thereof in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled- or sustained-release compositions include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased compliance. In addition, controlled- or sustained-release compositions can favorably affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound, and can thus reduce the occurrence of adverse side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControlled- or sustained-release compositions can initially release an amount of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound that promptly produces the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, and gradually and continually release other amounts of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. To maintain a constant level of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound in the body, the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound can be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled- or sustained-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions, including but not limited to, changes in pH, changes in temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or availability of water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound that is effective for the treatment or prevention of a condition can be determined by standard clinical techniques.

The rats are group-housed and have free access to food and water at all times, except prior to oral administration of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound when food is removed for 16 hours before dosing. A control group acts as a comparison to rats treated with a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound. The control group is administered the carrier for the Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound. The volume of carrier administered to the control group is the same as the volume of carrier and Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound administered to the test group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAcute Pain\n:\n To assess the actions of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound for the treatment or prevention of acute pain, the rat tail flick test can be used. Rats are gently restrained by hand and the tail exposed to a focused beam of radiant heat at a point 5 cm from the tip using a tail flick unit (Model 7360, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy). Tail flick latencies are defined as the interval between the onset of the thermal stimulus and the flick of the tail. Animals not responding within 20 seconds are removed from the tail flick unit and assigned a withdrawal latency of 20 seconds. Tail flick latencies are measured immediately before (pre-treatment) and 1, 3, and 5 hours following administration of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound. Data are expressed as tail flick latency(s) and the percentage of the maximal possible effect (% MPE), \ni\n.\ne\n., 20 seconds, is calculated as follows: \n \n \n%\n \nMPE\n \n=\n \n \n \n \npost administration latency\n \n \n-\n \n \npre\n \n-\n \nadministration latency\n \n \n \n \n20\n \n \n \ns pre\n \n-\n \nadministration latency\n \n \n \n \n \nx\n \n \n \n100\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rat tail flick test is described in \nF.E. D'Amour et al., \"\nA Method for Determining Loss of Pain Sensation,\n\" J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 72:74-79 (1941\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcute pain can also be assessed by measuring the animal's response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining the paw withdrawal threshold (\"PWT\"), as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nInflammatory Pain\n \n: To assess the actions of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound for the treatment or prevention of inflammatory pain, the Freund's complete adjuvant (\"FCA\") model of inflammatory pain is used. FCA-induced inflammation of the rat hind paw is associated with the development of persistent inflammatory mechanical hyperalgesia and provides reliable prediction of the anti-hyperalgesic action of clinically useful analgesic drugs (\nL. Bartho et al., \"\nInvolvement of Capsaicin-sensitive Neurones in Hyperalgesia and Enhanced Opioid Antinociception in Inflammation,\n\" Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacol. 342:666-670 (1990\n)). The left hind paw of each animal is administered a 50 µL intraplantar injection of 50% FCA. 24 hour post injection, the animal is assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining the PWT, as described below. Rats are then administered a single injection of 1, 3, 10 or 30mg/kg of either a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound; 30mg/kg of a control selected from Celebrex, indomethacin or naproxen; or carrier. Responses to noxious mechanical stimuli are then determined 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours post administration. Percentage reversal of hyperalgesia for each animal is defined as: \n \n \n%\n \n \n \nReversal\n \n=\n \n \n \n \npost administration PWT\n \n \n-\n \n \npre\n \n-\n \nadministration PWT\n \n \n \n \n \nbaseline PWT\n \n \n-\n \n \npre\n \n-\n \nadministration PWT\n \n \n \n \n \n \nx\n \n \n \n100\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nNeuropathic Pain\n:\n To assess the actions of a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound for the treatment or prevention of neuropathic pain, either the Seltzer model or the Chung model can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the Seltzer model, the partial sciatic nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain is used to produce neuropathic hyperalgesia in rats (\nZ. Seltzer et al., \"\nA Novel Behavioral Model of Neuropathic Pain Disorders Produced in Rats by Partial Sciatic Nerve Injury,\n\" Pain 43:205-218 (1990\n)). Partial ligation of the left sciatic nerve is performed under isoflurane/O\n2\n inhalation anaesthesia. Following induction of anesthesia, the left thigh of the rat is shaved and the sciatic nerve exposed at high thigh level through a small incision and is carefully cleared of surrounding connective tissues at a site near the trocanther just distal to the point at which the posterior biceps semitendinosus nerve branches off of the common sciatic nerve. A 7-0 silk suture is inserted into the nerve with a 3/8 curved, reversed-cutting mini-needle and tightly ligated so that the dorsal 1/3 to ½ of the nerve thickness is held within the ligature. The wound is closed with a single muscle suture (4-0 nylon (Vicryl)) and vetbond tissue glue. Following surgery, the wound area is dusted with antibiotic powder. Sham-treated rats undergo an identical surgical procedure except that the sciatic nerve is not manipulated. Following surgery, animals are weighed and placed on a warm pad until they recover from anesthesia. Animals are then returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animal is assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, prior to surgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1, 3, and 5 hours after drug administration for rear paw of the animal. Percentage reversal of neuropathic hyperalgesia is defined as: \n \n \n%\n \n \n \nReversal\n \n=\n \n \n \n \npost administration PWT\n \n \n-\n \n \npre\n \n-\n \nadministration PWT\n \n \n \n \n \nbaseline PWT\n \n \n-\n \n \npre\n \n-\n \nadministration PWT\n \n \n \n \n \n \nx\n \n \n \n100\n \n \n \n In the Chung model, the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain is used to produce mechanical hyperalgesia, thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia in rats. Surgery is performed under isoflurane/O\n2\n inhalation anaesthesia. Following induction of anaesthesia, a 3 cm incision is made and the left paraspinal muscles are separated from the spinous process at the L\n4\n - S\n2\n levels. The L\n6\n transverse process is carefully removed with a pair of small rongeurs to identify visually the L\n4\n - L\n6\n spinal nerves. The left L\n5\n (or L\n5\n and L\n6\n) spinal nerve(s) is isolated and tightly ligated with silk thread. A complete hemostasis is confirmed and the wound is sutured using non-absorbable sutures, such as nylon sutures or stainless steel staples. Sham-treated rats undergo an identical surgical procedure except that the spinal nerve(s) is not manipulated. Following surgery animals are weighed, administered a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of saline or ringers lactate, the wound area is dusted with antibiotic powder and they are kept on a warm pad until they recover from the anesthesia. Animals are then returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animals are assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, prior to surgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1, 3, and 5 hours after being administered a Heterocyclic-Substituted Piperidine Compound for the left rear paw of the animal. The animal can also be assessed for response to noxious thermal stimuli or for tactile allodynia, as described below. The Chung model for neuropathic pain is described in \nS.H. Kim, \"\nAn Experimental Model for Peripheral Neuropathy Produced by Segmental Spinal Nerve Ligation in the Rat,\n\" Pain 50(3):355-363 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nResponse to Mechanical Stimuli as an Assessment of Mechanical Hyperalgesia\n:\n The paw pressure assay can be used to assess mechanical hyperalgesia. For this assay, hind paw withdrawal thresholds (PWT) to a noxious mechanical stimulus are determined using an analgesymeter (Model 7200, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy) as described in \nC. Stein, \"\nUnilateral Inflammation of the Hindpaw in Rats as a Model of Prolonged Noxious Stimulation: Alterations in Behavior and Nociceptive Thresholds,\n\" Pharmacol. Biochem. and Behavior 31:451-455 (1988\n). The maximum weight that can be applied to the hind paw is set at 250 g and the end point is taken as complete withdrawal of the paw. PWT is determined once for each rat at each time point and either only the affected (ipsilateral) paw is tested, or both the ipsilateral and contralateral (non-injured) paw are tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nResponse to Thermal Stimuli as an Assessment of Thermal Hyperalgesia\n \n: The plantar test can be used to assess thermal hyperalgesia. For this test, hind paw withdrawal latencies to a noxious thermal stimulus are determined using a plantar test apparatus (commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy) following the technique described by \nK. Hargreaves et al., \"\nA New and Sensitive Method for Measuring Thermal Nociception in Cutaneous Hyperalgesia,\n\" Pain 32(1):77-88 (1988\n). The maximum exposure time is set at 32 seconds to avoid tissue damage and any directed paw withdrawal from the heat source is taken as the end point. Three latencies are determined at each time point and averaged. Either only the affected (ipsilateral) paw is tested, or both the ipsilateral and contralateral (non-injured) paw are tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAssessment of Tactile Allodynia\n:\n To assess tactile allodynia, rats are placed in clear, plexiglass compartments with a wire mesh floor and allowed to habituate for a period of at least 15 minutes. After habituation, a series of von Frey monofilaments are presented to the plantar surface of the left (operated) foot of each rat. The series of von Frey monofilaments consists of six monofilaments of increasing diameter, with the smallest diameter fiber presented first. Five trials are conducted with each filament with each trial separated by approximately 2 minutes. Each presentation lasts for a period of 4-8 seconds or until a nociceptive withdrawal behavior is observed. Flinching, paw withdrawal or licking of the paw are considered nociceptive behavioral responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments disclosed in the examples that are intended as illustrations of a few aspects of the invention and any embodiments that are functionally equivalent are within the scope of this invention.
