Compounds of formula I are distinguished by having valuable therapeutic properties. They can be used in the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch disorders are acute and/or chronic neurological disorders, in particular acute or chronic pain, urinary incontinence, gastrointestinal reflux disorder, liver damage or failure whether drug or disease induced, obesity or Fragile-X or autism, acute, traumatic and chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and anxiety, depression and drug dependency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the central nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays a unique role in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group, namely the ionotropic receptors, forms ligand-controlled ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) belong to the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein coupled receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt present, eight different members of these mGluR's are known and of these some even have sub-types. According to their sequence homology, signal transduction mechanisms and agonist selectivity, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups:\n\n \n \n \nmGluR1 and mGluR5 belong to group I, mGluR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II and mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8 belong to group III.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nLigands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the first group can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as chronic and acute pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are ischemia, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficiency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia, gastrointestinal reflux disorder and depressions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisorders mediated full or in part by mGluR5 are for example acute, traumatic and chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and anxiety, depression, pain and drug dependency \n(\n \nExpert Open.

All starting materials (e.g. compound IV) are known compounds, which can be either prepared according to known methods from commercially available products or are directly commercially available.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\nwherein the substituents R\n1\n, R\n1\n and R\n3\n are as described above and wherein R\n3\n is other than hydrogen.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\nwherein the substituents R\n1\n and R\n2\n are as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula III-A (compounds of formula III wherein R\n3\n is H and X is Cl) may be prepared in accordance with the description in scheme 1 or according to \n \nWO2002/044189\n \n starting from commercially available products. Then, a compound of formula III-A and a compound of formula NH\n2\nR\n2\n are dissolved in dry dioxane. 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene, cesium carbonate and tri(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium chloroform complex are added, and the reaction mixture is stirred under microwave irradiation for 50 minutes at about 150 °C. The reaction mixture is then evaporated and purified in conventional manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I can be manufactured readily according to methods known per se and taking into consideration the nature of the compound to be converted into a salt. Inorganic or organic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula I. Compounds which contain the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, for example sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or the like, basic amines or basic amino acids are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of acidic compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, as already mentioned above, metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and can be used for the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders, such as acute or chronic pain, urinary incontinence, liver damage or failure whether drug or disease induced, obesity or Fragile-X or autism, acute, traumatic and chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and anxiety, depression and drug dependency as shown in references such as\"\nEuropean Journal of Pharmacology (2004), 497(1), 25-27\n.\"; \"\nJournal of Hepatology (2003), 38(2), 179-187\n\"\n; and\n \"\nHepatology (Philadelphia) (2000), 31(3), 649-655\n\"\n.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are especially useful as analgesics. Treatable kinds of pain include inflammatory pain such as arthritis and rheumatoid disease, vasculitis, neuropathic pain such as trigeminal or herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy pain, causalgia, hyperalgesia, severe chronic pain, post-operative pain and pain associated with various conditions like cancer, angina, renal or billiay colic, menstruation, migraine and gout.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:\n\n \n \n \nFor binding experiments, cDNA encoding human mGlu 5a receptor was transiently transfected into EBNA cells using a procedure described by \nSchlaeger and Christensen [Cytotechnology 15:1-13 (1998\n)]. Cell membrane homogenates were stored at -80°C until the day of assay where upon they were thawed and resuspended and polytronised in 15 mM Tris-HCl, 120 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 25 mM CaCl\n2\n, 25 mM MgCl\n2\n binding buffer at pH 7.4 to a final assay concentration of 20 µg protein/ well.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nSaturation isotherms were determined by addition of twelve [\n3\nH]MPEP concentrations (0.04-100 nM) to these membranes (in a total volume of 200 µl) for 1 h at 4°C. Competition experiments were performed with a fixed concentration of [\n3\nH]MPEP (2nM) and IC\n50\n values of test compounds evaluated using 11 concentrations (0.3-10,000nM). Incubations were performed for 1 h at 4°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the end of the incubation, membranes were filtered onto unifilter (96-well white microplate with bonded GF/C filter preincubated 1 h in 0.1% PEI in wash buffer, Packard BioScience, Meriden, CT) with a Filtermate 96 harvester (Packard BioScience) and washed 3 times with cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 buffer. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 µM MPEP. The radioactivity on the filter was counted (3 min) on a Packard Top-count microplate scintillation counter with quenching correction after addition of 45 µl of microscint 40 (Canberra Packard S.A., Zürich, Switzerland) and shaking for 20 min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor functional assays, [Ca\n2+\n]i measurements were performed as described previously by \nPorter et al. [Br. J. Pharmacol. 128:13-20 (1999\n)] on recombinant human mGlu 5a receptors in HEK-293 cells. The cells were dye loaded using Fluo 4-AM (obtainable by FLUKA, 0.2µM final concentration). [Ca\n2+\n]i measurements were performed using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices Corporation, La Jolla, CA, USA). Antagonist evaluation was performed following a 5 min preincubation with the test compounds followed by the addition of a submaximal addition of agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibition (antagonists) curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation giving IC\n50\n, and Hill coefficient using iterative non linear curve fitting software (Xcel fit).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor binding experiments the Ki values of the compounds tested are given. The Ki value is defined by the following formula: \n \n \n \nK\n \ni\n \n \n=\n \n \nIC\n \n50\n \n \n/\n \n \n1\n \n+\n \nL\n \n/\n \n \nK\n \nd\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nin which the IC\n50\n values are those concentrations of the compounds tested which cause 50 % inhibition of the competing radioligand ([\n3\nH]MPEP). Lis the concentration of radioligand used in the binding experiment and the K\nd\n value of the radioligand is empirically determined for each batch of membranes prepared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are mGluR 5a receptor antagonists. The activities of compounds of formulae I, Ia and Ib as measured in the assay described above and as presented in the table hereafter are in the range of K\ni\n < 400 nM.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExample\n \nKi (nM)\n \nExample\n \nKi (nM)\n \n \n \n \n1\n \n26\n \n9\n \n61\n \n \n \n2\n \n37\n \n14\n \n45\n \n \n \n3\n \n42\n \n17\n \n128\n \n \n \n4\n \n40\n \n19\n \n29\n \n \n \n5\n \n167\n \n20\n \n87\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragées, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such as carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragées and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are provided to further elucidate the invention:\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\n(3-Chloro-phenyl)-(2-methyl-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridin-4-yl)-amine\n\n\n \n \n \n4-Chloro-2-methyl-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine (100 mg, 0.54 mmol) \n(Example A)\n and 3-chloroaniline (90 mg, 0.70 mmol) were dissolved in 3 ml dry dioxane. 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene (63 mg, 0.1 mmol), cesium carbonate (350 mg, 1.08 mmol) and tri(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium chloroform complex (56 mg, 0.05 mmol) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 16 hrs at 120°C.

The crude product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (heptane / ethyl acetate 9:1 -> 0:100 gradient).
