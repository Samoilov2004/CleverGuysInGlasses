Cellular responses to growth factors, neurotransmitters, hormones and a variety of other signal molecules are initiated through calcium-dependent processes. The importance of calcium ion as a second messenger is emphasised by many different mechanisms which work together to maintain calcium homeostasis. Changes in intracellular free calcium ion concentration represent the most wide-spread and important signalling event for regulating a plethora of cellular responses. A widespread route for calcium ion entry into the cell is through store-operated channels (SOCs), i.e. many cell types employ store-operated calcium ion entry as their principal pathway for calcium ion influx. This mechanism is engaged following calcium ion release from stores, where the depleted stores lead to activation of calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCRAC channels, a subfamily of store-operated channels, are activated by the release of calcium from intracellular stores, particularly from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These channels are key factors in the regulation of a wide range of cellular function, including muscle contraction, protein and fluid secretion and control over cell growth and proliferation and hence play an essential role in various diseases such as immune disorders and allergic responses. Among several biophysically distinct store-operated currents the best characterized and most calcium ion selective one is the CRAC current. Thus, CRAC channels mediate essential functions from secretion to gene expression and cell growth and form a network essential for the activation of immune cells that establish the adaptive immune response. Recently two proteins, stromal interaction molecule (STIM1) and CRAC Modulator 1 (CRACM1 or Orai1), have been identified as the essential components that fully reconstitute and amplify CRAC currents in heterologous expression systems with a similar biophysical fingerprint. In mammals, there exist several homologs of these proteins: STIM1 and STIM2 in the endoplasmic reticulum and CRACM1, CRACM2, and CRACM3 in the plasma membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCRAC currents were initially discovered in lymphocytes and mast cells, and at the same time have been characterized in various cell lines such as S2 \ndrosophila\n, DT40 B cells, hepatocytes, dendritic, megakaryotic, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. In lymphocytes and in mast cells, activation through antigen or Fc receptors initiates the release of calcium ion from intracellular stores caused by the second messenger inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P\n3\n), which in turn leads to calcium ion influx through CRAC channels in the plasma membrane. Store-operated Ca\n2+ \ncurrents characterized in smooth muscle, A431 epidermal cells, endothelial cells from various tissues, and prostate cancer cell lines show altered biophysical characteristics suggesting a distinct molecular origin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, calcium ion influx across the cell membrane is important in lymphocyte activation and adaptive immune responses. [Ca\n2+\n]-oscillations triggered through stimulation of the TCR (T-cell antigen receptor) have been demonstrated to be prominent, and appear to involve only a single calcium ion influx pathway, the store-operated CRAC channel. See, e.g., Lewis “Calcium signalling mechanisms in T lymphocytes,” Annu. Rev. Immunol. 19, (2001), 497-521; Feske et al. “Ca\n++ \ncalcineurin signalling in cells of the immune system,” Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun 311, (2003), 1117-1132; Hogan et al. “Transcriptional regulation by calcium, calcineurin, and NFAT,” Genes Dev. 17, (2003) 2205-2232.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well established now that intracellular calcium plays an important role in various cellular functions, and that its concentration is regulated by calcium ion influx through calcium channels on the cell membrane. Calcium ion channels, which are located in the nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, and skeletal systems and are modulated by membrane potential, are called voltage-operated Ca\n2+ \n(VOC) channels. These channels are classified into L, N, P, Q, R, and T subtypes. Excessive Ca\n2+ \ninflux through the VOC channels causes hypertension and brain dysfunction. In contrast, calcium ion channels on inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes, mast cells, and neutrophils, can be activated regardless of their membrane potential. This type of calcium ion channel has been reported to act in the crisis and exacerbation of inflammation and autoimmune diseases. In the T cells, it has been reported that the early stages of activation consist of pre- and post-Ca\n2+ \nevents. The stimulation of T cell receptors induces pre-Ca\n2+ \nevents, including the generation of IP3, followed by the release of Ca\n2+ \nfrom the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In post-Ca\n2+ \nevents, depletion of Ca\n2+ \nin the ER induces the activation of CRAC channels, and capacitative Ca\n2+ \ninflux through the CRAC channel sustains high intracellular Ca\n2+ \nconcentration ([Ca\n2+\n]i). This prolonged high [Ca2+]i activates cytosolic signal transduction to produce lipid mediators (e.g., LTD\n4\n), cytokines [e.g., interleukin-2 (IL-2)], and matrix metalloproteinases, which participate in the pathogenesis of inflammation and autoimmune diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese facts suggest that CRAC channel modulators can be useful for the treatment of diseases caused by the activation of inflammatory cells without side effects observed in steroids. Since VOC channel modulators would cause adverse events in the nervous and cardiovascular systems, it may be necessary for CRAC channel modulators to exhibit sufficient selectivity over VOC channels if they are to be used as anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, CRAC channel modulators have been said to be useful in treatment, prevention and/or amelioration of diseases or disorders associated with calcium release-activated calcium channel including, but not limited to, inflammation, glomerulonephritis, uveitis, hepatic diseases or disorders, renal diseases or disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis, dermatitis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory muscle disease, allergic rhinitis, vaginitis, interstitial cystitis, scleroderma, osteoporosis, eczema, allogeneic or xenogeneic transplantation, graft rejection, graft-versus-host disease, lupus erythematosus, type I diabetes, pulmonary fibrosis, dermatomyositis, thyroiditis, myasthenia gravis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, cystic fibrosis, chronic relapsing hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, allergic conjunctivitis, hepatitis and atopic dermatitis, asthma, Sjogren's syndrome, cancer and other proliferative diseases, and autoimmune diseases or disorders.

Currently, 1 in 4 deaths in India is due to cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide because of its high incidence and mortality, with 5-year survival estimates of ˜10% for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It has been reported that further investigations on the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and chemoresistance of lung cancer are needed to improve the survival rate (Jemal A, et al., \nCancer Statistics, CA Cancer. J. Clin., \n56, 106-130, 2006). There are four major types of NSCLC, namely, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, bronchioalveolar carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the most common types of NSCLC based on cellular morphology (Travis et al., \nLung Cancer Principles and Practice\n, Lippincott-Raven, New York, 361-395, 1996). Adenocarcinomas are characterized by a more peripheral location in the lung and often have a mutation in the K-ras oncogene (Gazdar et al., \nAnticancer Res., \n14, 261-267, 1994). Squamous cell carcinomas are typically more centrally located and frequently carry p53 gene mutations (Niklinska et al., \nFolia Histochem. Cytobiol., \n39, 147-148, 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe majority of NSCLCs are characterized by the presence of the ras mutation thereby rendering the patient relatively insensitive to treatment by known kinase inhibitors. As a result, current treatments of lung cancer are generally limited to cytotoxic drugs, surgery, and radiation therapy. There is a need for treatments which have fewer side effects and more specifically target the cancer cells, are less invasive, and improve the prognosis of patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe identification of lung tumor-initiating cells and associated markers may be useful for optimization of therapeutic approaches and for predictive and prognostic information in lung cancer patients. Accordingly, a need remains for new methods of predicting, evaluating and treating patients afflicted with lung cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere still remains an unmet and dire need for small molecule modulators having specificity towards Stim1 and/or Orai1 in order to regulate and/or modulate activity of CRAC channels, particularly for the treatment of diseases and disorders associated with the CRAC.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compounds of formula (I), methods for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and methods

release-activated calcium (CRAC) inhibitors, and methods for identifying therapeutics for treating and of diagnosing cancer. In certain embodiments, the CRAC inhibitor is a compound of Formula I, IA, IA-II, IA-III or IA-IV as in any of the embodiments described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present inventors have discovered that cancer cells which express ORAI (such as ORAI1, ORAI2, or ORAI3) or STIM (such as STIM1 or STIM2) are susceptible to treatment with calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) inhibitors. These types of cancer cells are expressed in many patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is a method of treating a patient suffering from NSCLC by administering to the patient an effective amount of a CRAC inhibitor. In a preferred embodiment, at least some of the cancer cells express ORAI1, STIM1, or STIM2. The CRAC inhibitor may be used as a monotherapy or as an adjunctive therapy with one or more other methods of treating lung cancer (or NSCLC). In certain embodiments, the CRAC inhibitor is a compound of Formula I, IA, IA-II, IA-III or IA-IV as in any of the embodiments described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment is a method of treating a patient suffering from NSCLC by altering flow of calcium into at least some of the cancerous cells, preferably by increasing expression levels of a calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel and/or a STIM protein in the plasma membrane of at least some of the cancerous cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another embodiment is a method for identifying a candidate agent for treating NSCLC. The method includes (a) determining (i) whether a candidate agent modulates a calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel, and/or (ii) whether a candidate agent modulates expression of Stim protein of a CRAC channel, or both; and (b) selecting the candidate agent based on its ability to modulate a CRAC channel and/or Stim protein of a CRAC channel\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the candidate agent can alter a flow of calcium into a cancerous cell. For instance, the candidate agent may selectively modulate a CRAC channel or STIM protein. Preferably, the candidate agent selectively inhibits a CRAC channel or STIM protein. For instance, the CRAC channel which is inhibited may be selected from CRACM1/Orai1, CRACM2/Orai2 and CRACM3/Orai3. In another embodiment, the candidate agent inhibits a STIM protein located on the endoplasmic veticular membrane of a cell. In particular embodiments, the STIM protein is selected from the STIM family of transmembrane proteins, such as STIM1 or STIM2. According to a preferred embodiment, the STIM protein is STIM1. In certain embodiments, the candidate agent is a compound of Formula I, IA, IA-II, IA-III or IA-IV as in any of the embodiments described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another embodiment is a pharmaceutical composition for treating NSCLC comprising (a) a candidate agent effective for treatment of NSCLC identified according to the method above, together with (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient. In certain embodiments, the candidate agent is a compound of Formula I, IA, IA-II, IA-III or IA-IV, as in any of the embodiments described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another embodiment is a method of treating a patient suffering from NSCLC by administering to the patient (a) an effective amount of a candidate agent identified according to the method above, or (b) one or more pharmaceutical compositions comprising (i) a candidate agent effective for treatment of NSCLC identified according to the method above, together with (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient, where the total amount of candidate agent provided by the pharmaceutical compositions provide a therapeutic effective amount of the candidate agent. In certain embodiments, the candidate agent is a compound of Formula I, IA, IA-II, IA-III or IA-IV as in any of the embodiments described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another embodiment is a method for determining whether a human is predisposed to lung cancer or suffering from lung cancer by detecting the level of a calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel and/or a STIM protein in lung cells (such as cancerous cells). In one embodiment, the method includes detection of an elevated level of an Orai and/or STIM protein. For example, the method can include detecting increased levels of a STIM protein in a cancerous cell.

Examples of non-mammals include, but are not limited to, birds, and fish. In one embodiment of the methods and compositions provided herein, the mammal is a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “treat,” “treating” or “treatment,” as used herein, include alleviating, abating or ameliorating a disease, disorder or condition symptoms, preventing additional symptoms, ameliorating or preventing the underlying causes of symptoms, inhibiting the disease, disorder or condition, e.g., arresting the development of the disease, disorder or condition, relieving the disease, disorder or condition, causing regression of the disease, disorder or condition, relieving a condition caused by the disease, disorder or condition, or stopping the symptoms of the disease, disorder or condition either prophylactically and/or therapeutically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “target protein” refers to a protein or a portion of a protein capable of being bound by, or interacting with a compound described herein, such as a compound capable of modulating a STIM protein and/or an Orai protein. In certain embodiments, a target protein is a STIM protein. In other embodiments, a target protein is an Orai protein, and in yet other embodiments, the compound targets both STIM and Orai proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “STIM protein” refers to any protein situated in the endoplasmic reticular or plasma membrane which activates an increase in rate of calcium flow into a cell by a CRAC channel. (STIM refers to a stromal interaction molecule.) As used herein, “STIM protein” includes but is not limited to, mammalian STIM-1, such as human and rodent (e.g., mouse) STIM-1, \nDrosophila melanogaster \nD-STIM, \nC. elegans \nC-STIM, \nAnopheles gambiae \nSTIM and mammalian STIM-2, such as human and rodent (e.g., mouse) STIM-2. As described herein, such proteins have been identified as being involved in, participating in and/or providing for store-operated calcium entry or modulation thereof, cytoplasmic calcium buffering and/or modulation of calcium levels in or movement of calcium into, within or out of intracellular calcium stores (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated by “activate” or “activation” it is meant the capacity of a STIM protein to up-regulate, stimulate, enhance or otherwise facilitate calcium flow into a cell by a CRAC channel. It is envisaged that cross-talk between the STIM protein and the CRAC channel may occur by either a direct or indirect molecular interaction. Suitably, the STIM protein is a transmembrane protein which is associated with, or in close proximity to, a CRAC channel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is known in the art that STIM1 is an essential component of CRAC channel activation. The present inventors have observed that STIM1 and STIM2 is expressed in certain NSCLC cell lines. Moreover, CRACM1/\nOrai\n 1 and CRACM3/Orai3 are excessively expressed in certain NSCLC cell lines. Although not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, CRAC and STIM proteins potentially contribute to activation of proliferative pathways in NSCLC cells in the following manner: (i) excessive dysregulation of STIM in NSCLC cells results in incorrect plasma membrane accumulation of STIM and (ii) at the plasma membrane, STIM activates CRAC (by either a direct or indirect interaction), which results in excessive calcium influx into the cell and promotion of transcription, proliferation and invasiveness in NSCLC cells. Hence, inhibition of the CRAC channel or the STIM pathway is an effective treatment for NSCLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an “Orai protein” includes Orai1 (SEQ ID NO: 1 as described in WO 07/081,804), Orai2 (SEQ ID NO: 2 as described in WO 07/081,804), or Orai3 (SEQ ID NO: 3 as described in WO 07/081,804). Orai1 nucleic acid sequence corresponds to GenBank accession number NM-032790, Orai2 nucleic acid sequence corresponds to GenBank accession number BC069270 and Orai3 nucleic acid sequence corresponds to GenBank accession number NM-152288. As used herein, Orai refers to any one of the Orai genes, e.g., Orai1, Orai2, and Orai3 (see Table I of WO 07/081,804). As described herein, such proteins have been identified as being involved in, participating in and/or providing for store-operated calcium entry or modulation thereof, cytoplasmic calcium buffering and/or modulation of calcium levels in or movement of calcium into, within or out of intracellular calcium stores (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum). In alternative embodiments, an Orai protein may be labelled with a tag molecule, by way of example only, an enzyme fragment, a protein (e.g. c-myc or other tag protein or fragment thereof), an enzyme tag, a fluorescent tag, a fluorophore tag, a chromophore tag, a Raman-activated tag, a chemiluminescent tag, a quantum dot marker, an antibody, a radioactive tag, or combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “fragment” or “derivative” when referring to a protein (e.g. STIM, Orai) means proteins or polypeptides which retain essentially the same biological function or activity in at least one assay as the native protein(s). For example, the fragment or derivative of the referenced protein preferably maintains at least about 50% of the activity of the native protein, at least 75%, or at least about 95% of the activity of the native protein, as determined, e.g., by a calcium influx assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “amelioration” refers to an improvement in a disease or condition or at least a partial relief of symptoms associated with a disease or condition. As used herein, amelioration of the symptoms of a particular disease, disorder or condition by administration of a particular compound or pharmaceutical composition refers to any lessening of severity, delay in onset, slowing of progression, or shortening of duration, whether permanent or temporary, lasting or transient that are attributed to or associated with administration of the compound or composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “modulate,” as used herein, means to interact with a target protein either directly or indirectly so as to alter the activity of the target protein, including, by way of example only, to inhibit the activity of the target, or to limit or reduce the activity of the target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “modulator” refers to a compound that alters an activity of a target (e.g., a target protein). For example, in some embodiments, a modulator causes an increase or decrease in the magnitude of a certain activity of a target compared to the magnitude of the activity in the absence of the modulator. In certain embodiments, a modulator is an inhibitor, which decreases the magnitude of one or more activities of a target. In certain embodiments, an inhibitor completely prevents one or more activities of a target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “modulation” with reference to intracellular calcium refers to any alteration or adjustment in intracellular calcium including but not limited to alteration of calcium concentration in the cytoplasm and/or intracellular calcium storage organelles, e.g., endoplasmic reticulum, or alteration of the kinetics of calcium fluxes into, out of and within cells. In aspect, modulation refers to reduction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “inhibits”, “inhibiting”, or “inhibitor” of SOC channel activity or CRAC channel activity, as used herein, refer to inhibition of store operated calcium channel activity or calcium release activated calcium channel activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “acceptable” with respect to a formulation, composition or ingredient, as used herein, means having no persistent detrimental effect on the general health of the subject being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable,” molecular entities and compositions that are physiologically tolerable and do not typically produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction, such as gastric upset, and dizziness, when administered to a human. Preferably, as used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means approved by a regulatory agency of the federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutical composition” refers to a mixture of a compound of the present invention with other chemical components, such as carriers, stabilizers, diluents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, and/or excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be administered by various routes of administration including, but not limited to, intravenous, oral, aerosol, parenteral, ophthalmic, pulmonary and topical administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount,” as used herein, refer to a sufficient amount of an agent or a compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disease or condition being treated. The result is reduction and/or alleviation of the signs, symptoms, or causes of a disease, or any other desired alteration of a biological system. For example, an “effective amount” for therapeutic uses is the amount of a compound of the present invention required to provide a clinically significant decrease in disease symptoms. In some embodiments, an appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case is determined using techniques, such as a dose escalation study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “enhance” or “enhancing,” as used herein, means to increase or prolong either in potency or duration a desired effect. Thus, in regard to enhancing the effect of therapeutic agents, the term “enhancing” refers to the ability to increase or prolong, either in potency or duration, the effect of other therapeutic agents on a system. An “enhancing-effective amount,” as used herein, refers to an amount adequate to enhance the effect of another therapeutic agent in a desired system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “carrier,” as used herein, refers to relatively nontoxic chemical compounds or agents that facilitate the incorporation of a compound into cells or tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “diluent” refers to chemical compounds that are used to dilute the compound of interest prior to delivery. In some embodiments, diluents are used to stabilize compounds because they provide a more stable environment. Salts dissolved in buffered solutions (which also provide pH control or maintenance) are utilized as diluents, including, but not limited to a phosphate buffered saline solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “cancerous cell” is meant a cell from the lung, inclusive of a pre-malignant cell, a neoplastic cell, a malignant cell, a tumorigenic cell, a non-tumorigenic cell and a lung cancer stern cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “intracellular calcium” refers to calcium located in a cell without specification of a particular cellular location. In contrast, “cytosolic” or “cytoplasmic” with reference to calcium refers to calcium located in the cell cytoplasm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an effect on intracellular calcium is any alteration of any aspect of intracellular calcium, including but not limited to, an alteration in intracellular calcium levels and location and movement of calcium into, out of or within a cell or intracellular calcium store or organelle. For example, in some embodiments, an effect on intracellular calcium is an alteration of the properties, such as, for example, the kinetics, sensitivities, rate, amplitude, and electrophysiological characteristics, of calcium flux or movement that occurs in a cell or portion thereof. In some embodiments, an effect on intracellular calcium is an alteration in any intracellular calcium-modulating process, including, store-operated calcium entry, cytosolic calcium buffering, and calcium levels in or movement of calcium into, out of or within an intracellular calcium store. Any of these aspects are assessed in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, evaluation of calcium or other ion (particularly cation) levels, movement of calcium or other ion (particularly cation), fluctuations in calcium or other ion (particularly cation) levels, kinetics of calcium or other ion (particularly cation) fluxes and/or transport of calcium or other ion (particularly cation) through a membrane. An alteration is any such change that is statistically significant. Thus, for example, in some embodiments, if intracellular calcium in a test cell and a control cell is said to differ, such differences are a statistically significant difference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModulation of intracellular calcium is any alteration or adjustment in intracellular calcium including but not limited to alteration of calcium concentration or level in the cytoplasm and/or intracellular calcium storage organelles, e.g., endoplasmic reticulum, alteration in the movement of calcium into, out of and within a cell or intracellular calcium store or organelle, alteration in the location of calcium within a cell, and alteration of the kinetics, or other properties, of calcium fluxes into, out of and within cells. In some embodiments, intracellular calcium modulation involves alteration or adjustment, e.g. reduction or inhibition, of store-operated calcium entry, cytosolic calcium buffering, calcium levels in or movement of calcium into, out of or within an intracellular calcium store or organelle, and/or basal or resting cytosolic calcium levels. The modulation of intracellular calcium involves an alteration or adjustment in receptor-mediated ion (e.g., calcium) movement, second messenger-operated ion (e.g., calcium) movement, calcium influx into or efflux out of a cell, and/or ion (e.g., calcium) uptake into or release from intracellular compartments, including, for example, endosomes and lysosomes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “involved in”, with respect to the relationship between a protein and an aspect of intracellular calcium or intracellular calcium regulation means that when expression or activity of the protein in a cell is reduced, altered or eliminated, there is a concomitant or associated reduction, alteration or elimination of one or more aspects of intracellular calcium or intracellular calcium regulation. Such an alteration or reduction in expression or activity occurs by virtue of an alteration of expression of a gene encoding the protein or by altering the levels of the protein. A protein involved in an aspect of intracellular calcium, such as, for example, store-operated calcium entry, thus, are one that provides for or participates in an aspect of intracellular calcium or intracellular calcium regulation. For example, a protein that provides for store-operated calcium entry are a STIM protein and/or an Orai protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a protein that is a component of a calcium channel is a protein that participates in multi-protein complex that forms the channel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “cation entry” or “calcium entry” into a cell refers to entry of cations, such as calcium, into an intracellular location, such as the cytoplasm of a cell or into the lumen of an intracellular organelle or storage site. Thus, in some embodiments, cation entry is, for example, the movement of cations into the cell cytoplasm from the extracellular medium or from an intracellular organelle or storage site, or the movement of cations into an intracellular organelle or storage site from the cytoplasm or extracellular medium. Movement of calcium into the cytoplasm from an intracellular organelle or storage site is also referred to as “calcium release” from the organelle or storage site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “cell response” refers to any cellular response that results from ion movement into or out of a cell or within a cell. In some embodiments, the cell response is associated with any cellular activity that is dependent, at least in part, on ions such as, for example, calcium. Such activities optionally include, for example, cellular activation, gene expression, endocytosis, exocytosis, cellular trafficking and apoptotic cell death.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “immune cells” include cells of the immune system and cells that perform a function or activity in an immune response, such as, but not limited to, T-cells, B-cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, plasma cells, white blood cells, antigen presenting cells and natural killer cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “cytokine” or “cytokines” refers to small soluble proteins secreted by cells that in some embodiments, alter the behavior or properties of the secreting cell or another cell. Cytokines bind to cytokine receptors and trigger a behavior or property within the cell, for example, cell proliferation, death or differentiation. Exemplary cytokines include, but are not limited to, interleukins (e.g., IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-1.alpha., IL-1.beta., and IL-1 RA), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), oncostatin M, erythropoietin, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interferons, B7.1 (also known as CD80), B7.2 (also known as B70, CD86), TNF family members (TNF-.alpha., TNF-.beta., LT-.beta., CD40 ligand, Fas ligand, CD27 ligand, CD30 ligand, 4-1BBL, Trail), and MIF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Store operated calcium entry” or “SOCE” refers to the mechanism by which release of calcium ions from intracellular stores is coordinated with ion influx across the plasma membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCellular calcium homeostasis is a result of the summation of regulatory systems involved in the control of intracellular calcium levels and movements. Cellular calcium homeostasis is achieved, at least in part, by calcium binding and by movement of calcium into and out of the cell across the plasma membrane and within the cell by movement of calcium across membranes of intracellular organelles including, for example, the endoplasmic reticulum, sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and endocytic organelles including endosomes and lysosomes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMovement of calcium across cellular membranes is carried out by specialized proteins. For example, calcium from the extracellular space enters the cell through various calcium channels and a sodium/calcium exchanger and is actively extruded from the cell by calcium pumps and sodium/calcium exchangers. Calcium is also released from internal stores through inositol trisphosphate or ryanodine receptors and is likely taken up by these organelles by means of calcium pumps.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalcium enters cells by any of several general classes of channels, including but not limited to, voltage-operated calcium (VOC) channels, store-operated calcium (SOC) channels, and sodium/calcium exchangers operating in reverse mode. VOC channels are activated by membrane depolarization and are found in excitable cells like nerve and muscle and are for the most part not found in nonexcitable cells. Under some conditions, Ca\n2+ \nalso enters cells via Na\n+\n—Ca\n2+ \nexchangers operating in reverse mode.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEndocytosis provides another process by which cells take up calcium from the extracellular medium through endosomes. In addition, some cells, e.g., exocrine cells, release calcium via exocytosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCytosolic calcium concentration is tightly regulated with resting levels usually estimated at approximately 0.1.mu.M in mammalian cells, whereas the extracellular calcium concentration is typically about 2 mM. This tight regulation facilitates transduction of signals into and within cells through transient calcium flux across the plasma membrane and membranes of intracellular organelles. There is a multiplicity of intracellular calcium transport and buffer systems in cells that serve to shape intracellular calcium signals and maintain the low resting cytoplasmic calcium concentration. In cells at rest, the principal components involved in maintaining basal calcium levels are calcium pumps and leaks in the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. Disturbance of resting cytosolic calcium levels effects transmission of such signals and give rise to defects in a number of cellular processes. For example, cell proliferation involves a prolonged calcium signalling sequence. Other cellular processes include, but are not limited to, secretion, signalling, and fertilization, involve calcium signalling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell-surface receptors that activate phospholipase C(PLC) create cytosolic Ca\n2+ \nsignals from intra- and extra-cellular sources. An initial transient rise of [Ca\n2+\n]\ni \n(intracellular calcium concentration) results from the release of Ca\n2+ \nfrom the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is triggered by the PLC product, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (P\n3\n), opening IP\n3 \nreceptors in the ER (Streb et al. Nature, 306, 67-69, 1983). A subsequent phase of sustained Ca\n2+ \nentry across the plasma membrane then ensues, through specialized store operated calcium (SOC) channels (in the case of immune cells the SOC channels are calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels) in the plasma membrane. Store-operated Ca\n2+ \nentry (SOCE) is the process in which the emptying of Ca\n2+ \nstores itself activates Ca\n2+ \nchannels in the plasma membrane to help refill the stores (Putney, Cell Calcium, 7, 1-12, 1986; Parekh et al, Physiol. Rev. 757-810; 2005). SOCE does more than simply provide Ca\n2+ \nfor refilling stores, but itself generates sustained Ca\n2+ \nsignals that control such essential functions as gene expression, cell metabolism and exocytosis (Parekh and Putney, Physiol. Rev. 85, 757-810 (2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn lymphocytes and mast cells, activation of antigen or Fc receptors causes the release of Ca\n2+ \nfrom intracellular stores, which in turn leads to Ca\n2+ \ninflux through CRAC channels in the plasma membrane. The subsequent rise in intracellular Ca\n2+ \nactivates calcineurin, a phosphatase that regulates the transcription factor NFAT. In resting cells, NFAT is phosphorylated and resides in the cytoplasm, but when dephosphorylated by calcineurin, NFAT translocates to the nucleus and activates different genetic programmes depending on stimulation conditions and cell type. In response to infections and during transplant rejection, NFAT partners with the transcription factor AP-1 (Fos-Jun) in the nucleus of “effector” T cells, thereby trans activating cytokine genes, genes that regulate T cell proliferation and other genes that orchestrate an active immune response (Rao et al., Annu Rev Immunol, 1997; 15:707-47). In contrast, in T cells recognizing self antigens, NFAT is activated in the absence of AP-1, and activates a transcriptional programme otherwise known as “anergy” that suppresses autoimmune responses (Macian et al., Transcriptional mechanisms underlying lymphocyte tolerance. Cell. 2002 Jun. 14; 109(6):719-31). In a subclass of T cells, known as regulatory T cells which suppress autoimmunity mediated by self-reactive effector T cells, NFAT partners with the transcription factor FOXP3 to activate genes responsible for suppressor function (Wu et al., Cell, 2006 Jul. 28; 126(2):375-87; Rudensky A Y, Gavin M, Zheng Y. Cell. 2006 Jul. 28; 126(2):253-256).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) carries out a variety processes. The ER has a role as both an agonist-sensitive Ca\n2+ \nstore and sink, protein folding/processing takes place within its lumen. Here, numerous Ca\n2+\n-dependent chaperone proteins ensure that newly synthesized proteins are folded correctly and sent off to the appropriate destination. The ER is also involved in vesicle trafficking, release of stress signals, regulation of cholesterol metabolism, and apoptosis. Many of these processes require intraluminal Ca\n2+\n, and protein misfolding, ER stress responses, and apoptosis are all likely induced by depleting the ER of Ca\n2+ \nfor prolonged periods of time. Because of its role as a source of Ca\n2+\n, it is clear that ER Ca\n2+ \ncontent must fall after stimulation. However, to preserve the functional integrity of the ER, it is vital that the Ca\n2+ \ncontent does not fall too low or is maintained at a low level. Replenishment of the ER with Ca\n2+ \nis therefore a central process to all eukaryotic cells. Because a fall in ER Ca\n2+ \ncontent activates store-operated Ca\n2+ \nchannels in the plasma membrane, a major function of this Ca\n2+ \nentry pathway is believed to be maintenance of ER Ca\n2+ \nlevels that are necessary for proper protein synthesis and folding. However, store-operated Ca\n2+ \nchannels have other important roles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe understanding of store operated calcium entry was provided by electrophysiological studies which established that the process of emptying the stores activated a Ca\n2+ \ncurrent in mast cells called Ca\n2+ \nrelease-activated Ca\n2+ \ncurrent or I\nCRAC\n. I\nCRAC \nis non-voltage activated, inwardly rectifying, and remarkably selective for Ca\n2+\n. It is found in several cell types mainly of hemopoietic origin. I\nCRAC \nis not the only store-operated current, and it is now apparent that store-operated influx encompasses a family of Ca\n2+\n-permeable channels, with different properties in different cell types. I\nCRAC \nwas the first store-operated Ca\n2+ \ncurrent to be described and remains a popular model for studying store-operated influx.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffects of compounds or agents on intracellular calcium can be monitored using various screening/identification methods which provide for a direct or indirect evaluation or measurement of cellular (including cytosolic and intracellular organelle or compartment) calcium and/or movement of ions into, within or out of a cell, organelle, calcium store or portions thereof (e.g., a membrane). A variety of methods can be used for evaluating calcium levels and ion movements or flux. The particular method used and the conditions employed would depend on whether a particular aspect of intracellular calcium is being monitored or assessed. For example, in some aspects, reagents and conditions may be used for specifically evaluating store-operated calcium entry, resting cytosolic calcium levels, calcium buffering and calcium levels and uptake by or release from intracellular organelles and calcium stores. Alternately, the effect of a compound or agent on intracellular calcium can be monitored or assessed using, for example, a cell, an intracellular organelle or calcium storage compartment, a membrane (including, e.g., a detached membrane patch or a lipid bilayer) or a cell-free assay system (e.g., outside-out membrane vesicle). Generally, some aspect of intracellular calcium is monitored or assessed in the presence of test agent and compared to a control, e.g., intracellular calcium in the absence of test agent.\n\n\n \nDiseases, Disorders or Conditions\n\n\n \n \n \nClinical studies demonstrate that the CRAC channel is absolutely required for the activation of genes underlying the T cell response to antigen. Sustained calcium entry is needed for lymphocyte activation and adaptive immune response. Calcium entry into lymphocytes occurs primarily through the CRAC channels. Increased calcium leads to NFAT activation and expression of cytokines required for immune response. Inhibiting the store operated calcium entry is an efficient way to prevent T cell activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of CRAC channel activity with the compounds that modulate intracellular calcium levels provide a means for providing immunosuppressive therapy as demonstrated by the elimination of store-operated calcium entry noted in patients with severe-combined immunodeficiency (SCID). T cells, fibroblasts, and in some cases B cells, from patients with T cell immunodeficiency or SCID having a principal defect in T cell activation show a strong defect in store-operated calcium entry. SCID patients lack adaptive immune response, but without any impairment or toxicity in major organs. The SCID patient phenotype indicates that inhibition of CRAC channels is an effective strategy for immunosuppression.\n\n\n \nDiseases/Disorders Involving Inflammation and Diseases/Disorders Related to the Immune System\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, diseases, disorders or conditions that are treated or prevented using compounds disclosed herein that are capable of modulating intracellular calcium levels, compositions thereof, and methods provided herein to identify compounds capable of modulating intracellular calcium levels, include diseases, conditions or disorders involving inflammation and/or that are related to the immune system. These diseases include, but are not limited to, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, glomerulonephritis, neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, and disorders of the immune system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activation of neutrophils (PMN) by inflammatory mediators is partly achieved by increasing cytosolic calcium concentration. Store-operated calcium influx in particular is thought to play an important role in PMN activation. It has been shown that trauma increases PMN store-operated calcium influx and that prolonged elevations of cytosolic calcium concentration due to enhanced store-operated calcium influx likely alters stimulus-response coupling to chemotaxins and contribute to PMN dysfunction after injury. Modulation of PMN cytosolic calcium concentration through store-operated calcium channels might therefore be useful in regulating PMN-mediated inflammation and spare cardiovascular function after injury, shock or sepsis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalcium plays a critical role in lymphocyte activation. Activation of lymphocytes, e.g., by antigen stimulation, results in rapid increases in intracellular free calcium concentrations and activation of transcription factors, including nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), NF-.kappa.B, JNK1, MEF2 and CREB. NFAT is a key transcriptional regulator of the IL-2 (and other cytokine) genes. A sustained elevation of intracellular calcium level is required to keep NFAT in a transcriptionally active state, and is dependent on store-operated calcium entry. Reduction or blocking of store-operated calcium entry in lymphocytes blocks calcium-dependent lymphocyte activation. Thus, in some embodiments, modulation of a STIM protein and/or an Orai protein, and particularly store-operated calcium entry (e.g., reduction in, elimination of store-operated calcium entry), in lymphocytes is a method for treating immune and immune-related disorders, including, for example, chronic immune diseases/disorders, acute immune diseases/disorders, autoimmune and immunodeficiency diseases/disorders, diseases/disorders involving inflammation, organ transplant graft rejections and graft-versus-host disease and altered (e.g., hyperactive) immune responses. For example, in some embodiments treatment of an autoimmune disease/disorder involves reducing, blocking or eliminating store-operated calcium entry in lymphocytes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of immune disorders include, for example, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease, dermatitis, osteoarthritis, asthma, inflammatory muscle disease, allergic rhinitis, vaginitis, interstitial cystitis, scleroderma, osteoporosis, eczema, allogeneic or xenogeneic transplantation (organ, bone marrow, stem cells and other cells and tissues) graft rejection, graft-versus-host disease, lupus erythematosus, inflammatory disease, type I diabetes, pulmonary fibrosis, dermatomyositis, Sjogren's syndrome, thyroiditis (e.g., Hashimoto's and autoimmune thyroiditis), myasthenia gravis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, chronic relapsing hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, allergic conjunctivitis and atopic dermatitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, compounds disclosed herein that are capable of modulating intracellular calcium levels, compositions thereof, and methods provided herein to identify compounds capable of modulating intracellular calcium levels, are used in connection with treatment of malignancies, including, but not limited to, malignancies of lymphoreticular origin, bladder cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, endometrial cancer, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and rectal cancer. Store-operated calcium entry is thought to play an important role in cell proliferation in cancer cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of SOCE is sufficient to prevent tumor cell proliferation. The pyrazole derivative BTP-2, a direct I\nCRAC \nblocker inhibits SOCE and proliferation in Jurkat cells and in colon cancer cells. Moreover, sustained SOCE requires mitochondrial Ca\n2+ \nuptake and that prevention of mitochondrial Ca\n2+ \nuptake leads to SOCE inhibition. Stimulation of Jurkat cells induces sustained SOCE and activation of the Ca\n2+\n-dependent phosphatase calcineurin that dephosphorylates NFAT, promoting expression of interleukin-2 and proliferation. In other embodiments, compounds capable of modulating intracellular calcium levels inhibit SOCE and are used in the treatment of cancer or other proliferative diseases or conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, diseases, disorders or conditions that are treated or prevented using compounds disclosed herein that are capable of modulating intracellular calcium levels, compositions thereof, and methods provided herein to identify compounds capable of modulating intracellular calcium levels, include, for example, hepatic or liver diseases and disorders. These diseases, conditions or disorders include but are not limited to liver injury, for example, due to transplantation, hepatitis and cirrhosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStore-operated calcium entry has been implicated in chronic liver disease as well as transplantation injury after cold preservation-warm deoxygenation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, diseases, conditions or disorders that are treated or prevented using the compounds disclosed herein that are capable of modulating intracellular calcium levels, compositions thereof, and methods provided herein to identify compounds capable of modulating intracellular calcium levels, include kidney or renal diseases and disorders. Mesangial cell hyperplasia is often a key feature of such diseases and disorders. In other embodiments, such diseases and disorders are caused by immunological or other mechanisms of injury, including IgAN, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis or lupus nephritis. Imbalances in the control of mesangial cell replication also appear to play a key role in the pathogenesis of progressive renal failure. The turnover of mesangial cells in normal adult kidney is very low with a renewal rate of less than 1%. A prominent feature of glomerular/kidney diseases is mesangial hyperplasia due to elevated proliferation rate or reduced cell loss of mesangial cells. When mesangial cell proliferation is induced without cell loss, for example due to mitogenic stimulation, mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis does result. Data have indicated that regulators of mesangial cell growth, particularly growth factors, are thought to act by regulating store-operated calcium channels. In yet other embodiments, modulators of store-operated calcium influx aids in the treatment of glomerular diseases by inhibiting mesangial cell proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, compounds described herein modulate intracellular calcium, such as but not limited to, modulation (e.g. reduction or inhibition) of SOC channel activity, such as inhibition of CRAC channel activity (e.g. inhibition of I\nCRAC\n, inhibition of SOCE), in an immune system cell (e.g., a lymphocyte, white blood cell, T cell, B cell), a fibroblast (or a cell derived from a fibroblast), or an epidermal, dermal or skin cell (e.g., a keratinocyte). In some embodiments, the step of modulating one or more proteins involved in modulating intracellular calcium (e.g. a STIM protein and/or Orai protein) involves, for example, reducing the level, expression of, an activity of, function of and/or molecular interactions of a protein. For instance, if a cell exhibits an increase in calcium levels or lack of regulation of an aspect of intracellular calcium modulation, e.g., store-operated calcium entry, then in other embodiments, modulating involves reducing the level of, expression of, an activity or function of, or a molecular interaction of a protein, e.g. a STIM protein and/or Orai protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of Identifying Therapeutic Agents for NSCLC\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides a method of identifying a therapeutic agent for treating NSCLC wherein the agent inhibits one or more plasma membrane calcium transportation pathways. The method includes determining whether a candidate agent can modulate all or part of the CRAC/STIM pathway in a NSCLC cell which, in turn, modifies one or more cancer-related properties of the epithelial cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “cancer-related properties” is meant any physiological and/or pathological manifestation of a cell which results from cancer of the cell. Within the scope is promotion of transcription, proliferation of the cell, death of the cell (such as apoptosis and necrosis) and invasiveness, wherein invasiveness is inclusive of metastasis, migration and loss of adhesion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that in general forms, a candidate agent may directly modulate a CRAC channel. In an alternative form, a candidate agent may modulate a STIM protein to thereby alter calcium flow into a cancerous cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of the present invention, “alter” or “alteration” includes within its scope a decrease, lowering or otherwise down-regulation of calcium flow across a plasma membrane. It is envisaged that alteration of calcium flow into a cancerous cell includes selective alteration of calcium flow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be readily appreciated that the mechanism of “modulation”, “modulator” or “modulating” includes within its scope any interaction which interferes with, inhibits, blocks or hinders or activates or augments either the calcium-flow related activity of the CRAC channel and/or STIM protein. In certain embodiments, the modulator is an inhibitor. In other embodiments, the modulator is an antagonist. In yet other embodiments, the modulator is an agonist. In further embodiments, the modulator is an activator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the candidate agent selectively modulates a CRAC channel and/or STIM protein. In another embodiment, the candidate agent selectively inhibits a CRAC channel and/or a STIM protein. In yet another embodiment, the candidate agent alters calcium flow by inhibition of a CRAC channel and/or STIM protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, modulators may be peptides, proteins such as antibodies or other organic molecules (such as small organic molecules), with a desired biological activity and half-life. It is envisaged that both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed to either the entire protein or a biologically-active fragment thereof are suitable modulators.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “biologically-active fragment” is meant a fragment, portion, region or segment of a protein which displays at least 10%, preferably at least 25%, more preferably at least 50% and even more preferably at least 70%, 80% or 90% of the biological activity of the entire or full-length protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn relation to a CRAC channel, biological activity is calcium transport activity. With regard to a STIM protein, the biological activity is the ability to activate calcium transport into a cell by either a direct or indirect interaction with a CRAC channel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art that antibodies employed for therapeutic applications in humans must have specific properties which make these antibodies suitable for use in humans. Generally, therapeutic antibodies are “humanised”, wherein the antibody typically comprises over 90% human sequence and the complementary determining regions of murine antibodies. Humanised antibodies are particularly advantageous for medical applications due to the decreased likelihood of eliciting a foreign body immune reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt in envisaged that humanised antibodies may be directed to any STIM such as, but not limited to, STIM1 and STIM2. In one embodiment, the humanised antibody is directed to STIM1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other particular embodiments, the modulating agent is an antibody directed to a CRAC channel. In an alternative particular embodiment, the antibody directed to a CRAC channel is directed to CRACM1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is readily contemplated that effective modulating agents include other potential CRAC channel inhibitors which may be useful according to the present invention. Suitable examples include, but are not limited to, SKF-96365, T182, YM-58483, BTP-2, lanthanides such as, gadolinium and other CRAC channel modulators compounds as disclosed, for example, in PCT or US patent applications assigned to Synta Pharmaceuticals viz.

RNA interference, such as siRNA, provides an attractive method for silencing of potential therapeutic gene targets by sequence-specific cleavage of cognate mRNA. Takeshita and Ochiya (\nCancer Sci, \n2006, 97: 689-696) provide numerous examples of the therapeutic potential of RNA interference against cancer and is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “gene” is used herein to describe a discrete nucleic acid locus, unit or region within a genome that may comprise one or more of introns, exons, splice sites, open reading frames and 5′ and/or 3′ non-coding regulatory sequences such as a promoter and/or a polyadenylation sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore a person of skill in the art will readily appreciate that the invention contemplates a genetic construct which comprises one or more nucleotide sequences capable of directing synthesis of an RNA molecule, where the nucleotide sequence is selected from:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(i) a nucleotide sequence transcribable to an RNA molecule comprising an RNA sequence which is substantially homologous to an RNA sequence encoded by a nucleotide sequence of interest;\n \n(ii) a reverse complement of the nucleotide sequence of (i);\n \n(iii) a combination of the nucleotide sequences of (i) and (ii),\n \n(iv) multiple copies of nucleotide sequences of (i), (ii) or (iii), optionally separated by a spacer sequence;\n \n(v) a combination of the nucleotide sequences of (i) and (ii), wherein the nucleotide sequence of (ii) represents an inverted repeat of the nucleotide sequence of (i), separated by a spacer sequence; and\n \n(vi) a combination as described in (v), wherein the spacer sequence comprises an intron sequence spliceable from said combination;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nWhere the nucleotide sequence comprises an inverted repeat separated by a non-intron spacer sequence, upon transcription, the presence of the non-intron spacer sequence facilitates the formation of a stem-loop structure by virtue of the binding of the inverted repeat sequences to each other. The presence of the non-intron spacer sequence causes the transcribed RNA sequence (also referred to herein as a “transcript”) so formed to remain substantially in one piece, in a form that may be referred to herein as a “hairpin”. Alternatively, where the nucleotide sequence comprises an inverted repeat where the spacer sequence comprises an intron sequence, upon transcription, the presence of intron/exon splice junction sequences on either side of the intron sequence facilitates the removal of what would otherwise form into a loop structure. The resulting transcript comprises a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule, optionally with overhanging 3′ sequences at one or both ends. Such a dsRNA transcript is referred to herein as a “perfect hairpin”. The RNA molecules may comprise a single hairpin or multiple hairpins including “bulges” of single-stranded DNA occurring in regions of double-stranded DNA sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending upon the application, the RNA molecule may be directed to a single target or alternatively, a plurality of targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the RNA molecule encodes CRACM1/Orai1, CRACM2/Orai1 or CRACM3/Orai1 and/or STIM1 or STIM2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPersons skilled in the art will be aware that therapeutic agents of the invention for the treatment of cancer may be identified by any number of methods. Accordingly, the method of identifying therapeutic agents involves determination of whether a candidate agent can directly modulate a CRAC channel and/or modulate STIM proteins. In one embodiment, the method involves determining whether the candidate agent can alter a flow of calcium into a cell by modulating a CRAC channel and/or STIM protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the therapeutic agents of the invention for the treatment of NSCLC may be identified by way of screening libraries of molecules such as synthetic chemical libraries, including combinatorial libraries, by methods such as described in Nestler & Liu, 1998\n, Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen, \n1, 113 and Kirkpatrick et al., 1999\n, Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen, \n2, 211.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also contemplated that libraries of naturally-occurring molecules may be screened by known methods, such as those described in Kolb, 1998\n, Prog. Drug. Res. \n51, 185. Similarly, the molecules may also be identified from a molecular libraries program (MLP) such as that offered by the National Institute of Health (NIH), USA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore rational approaches to designing therapeutic agents for the treatment of NSCLC may employ X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, computer assisted screening of structural databases, computer-assisted modelling, or more traditional biophysical techniques which detect molecular binding interactions, as are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStructural bioinformatics may also be used to identify candidate agents for treating NSCLC. A review of structural bioinformatics approaches to drug discovery is provided in Fauman et al., 2003\n, Meth. Biochem. Anal. \n44:477, and \nNature \nReviews Drug Discovery\n \n7, 783 (September 2008), both of which are incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComputer-assisted structural database searching and bioinformatic approaches are becoming increasingly utilized as a procedure for identifying and/or engineering agonists and antagonist molecules. Examples of database searching methods may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,752,019 and International Publication No. WO 97/41526 (directed to identifying EPO mimetics) and U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,158,891 and 5,680,331 which are directed to more general computational approaches to protein modeling and structural mimicry of protein activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, other applicable methods include any of a variety of biophysical techniques which identify molecular interactions. Such methods include, but are not limited to, competitive radioligand binding assays, electrophysiology, analytical ultracentrifugation, microcalorimetry, surface plasmon resonance and optical biosensor-based methods, such as those provided in \nChapter\n 20 of CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN PROTEIN SCIENCE Eds. Coligan et al., (John Wiley & Sons, 1997), which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA person skilled in the art will appreciate that modulating agents may be in the form of a binding partner and as such, identified by interaction assays such as yeast two-hybrid approaches. Two-hybrid screening methods are provided in \nChapter\n 20 of CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN PROTEIN SCIENCE Eds. Coligan et al., (John Wiley & Sons, 1997) which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical Composition and Method of Treatment of NSCLC\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also contemplated that in one aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition that includes a therapeutic agent effective for treatment of cancer identified by a method described above, together with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating cancer in a human by administering to the human a therapeutic agent effective for treatment of cancer identified by a method described above. The therapeutic agent, such as a CRAC inhibitor, may be used as a monotherapy or as an adjunctive therapy with one or more other methods of treating NSCLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the therapeutic agent effective for treatment of cancer is in the form of a small organic molecule or peptide formulated with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient suitable for oral administration, as a transdermal patch or other non-invasive route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another aspect, the present invention includes a method of treating a patient suffering from NSCLC by administering to the patient an effective amount of a CRAC inhibitor. The CRAC inhibitor may be used as a monotherapy or as an adjunctive therapy with one or more other methods of treating lung cancer (or NSCLC) which include chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of lung cancer such as, for example, Cisplatin (Platinol®), Etoposide (VP-16; VePesid®), Carboplatin (Paraplatin®), Paclitaxel (Taxol®), Docetaxel (Taxotere®), Vinorelbine tartarate (Novelbine®), Doxorubicin (Adriamycin®), Vincristine Sulphate (Oncovin®), Ifosfamide (Ifex®) and Gemcitabine hydrochloride (Gemzar®).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs an adjunctive therapy, a CRAC inhibitor may be used along with the a standard chemotherapy for lung cancer, which typically consists of combinations of two or more of, for example, Cisplatin (Platinol®), Etoposide (VP-16; VePesid®), Carboplatin (Paraplatin®), Paclitaxel (Taxol®), Docetaxel (Taxotere®), Vinorelbine tartarate (Novelbine®), Doxorubicin (Adriamycin®), Vincristine Sulphate (Oncovin®), Ifosfamide (Ifex®) and Gemcitabine hydrochloride (Gemzar®). Such standard chemotherapy combination therapy has been shown to improve the overall response to treatment. Well-known drug pairings in standard chemotherapy combination therapy include paclitaxel plus carboplatin, cisplatin plus vinorelbine tartarate, cisplatin plus etoposide, and carboplatin plus etoposide. Concurrent radiotherapy is very often used with the standard chemotherapy combinations of cisplatin plus etoposide or carboplatin plus etoposide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther chemotherapeutic agents that may be used to treat lung cancer include, for example, Cyclophosphamide (Neosar®), Methotrexate, Lomustine (CCNU) and Topotecan hydrochloride (Hycamtin®).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma as an adjunctive therapy, a CRAC inhibitor may be used in combination with Gemcitabine hydrochloride (Gemzar®), a chemotherapeutic drug that has unique activity against many solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Combination therapy with gemcitabine, cisplatin and vinorelbine tartarate has been found to be safe and very active in persons with advanced NSCLC. Another treatment option for NSCLC patients with advanced disease is alternating chemo-radiotherapy (e.g., cisplatin and etoposide, followed by radiotherapy).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient” includes a solid or liquid filler, diluent or encapsulating substance that may be safely used in systemic administration. Depending upon the particular route of administration, a variety of carriers known in the art may be used. These carriers may be selected from sugars, starches, cellulose and its derivatives, malt, gelatine, talc, calcium sulfate, vegetable oils, synthetic oils, polyols, alginic acid, phosphate buffered solutions, emulsifiers, isotonic saline and salts such as mineral acid salts including hydrochlorides, bromides and sulfates, organic acids such as acetates, propionates and malonates and pyrogen-free water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA useful reference describing pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents and excipients is Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co. N.J. USA, 1991), which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny safe route of administration may be employed for providing a patient with the therapeutic agent or pharmaceutical composition of the invention. For example, oral, rectal, parenteral, sublingual, buccal, intravenous, intra-articular, intra-muscular, intra-dermal, subcutaneous, inhalational, intraocular, intraperitoneal, intracerebroventricular and transdermal administration may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable dosage forms include, but are not limited to, tablets, dispersions, suspensions, injections, solutions, syrups, troches, capsules, suppositories, aerosols, and transdermal patches. These dosage forms may also include injecting or implanting controlled releasing devices designed specifically for this purpose or other forms of implants modified to act additionally in this fashion. Controlled release of the therapeutic agent may be effected by coating the same, for example, with hydrophobic polymers including acrylic resins, waxes, higher aliphatic alcohols, polylactic and polyglycolic acids and certain cellulose derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. In addition, the controlled release may be effected by using other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for oral or parenteral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, sachets or tablets each containing a pre-determined amount of one or more therapeutic agents of the invention, as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, a non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy such as by bringing into association one or more agents as described above with the carrier which constitutes one or more ingredients. The compositions can be prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the agents of the invention with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, optionally, shaping the product into the desired presentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above compositions may be administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation, and in such amount as is pharmaceutically-effective. The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present invention, should be sufficient to effect a beneficial response in a patient over an appropriate period of time. The quantity of agent(s) to be administered may depend on the subject to be treated inclusive of the age, sex, weight and general health condition thereof, factors that will depend on the judgement of the practitioner.\n\n\n \nDiagnostic Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the present invention is directed towards diagnostic methods for NSCLC which utilise CRAC channels and STIM proteins as diagnostic markers. In one particular aspect, the invention provides a diagnostic method for determining whether a patient may be responsive to treatment with a therapeutic agent that alters calcium influx via the CRAC and/or STIM pathway by measuring levels of plasma membrane associated STIM in a cancerous cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one particular embodiment, the invention provides a diagnostic method for determining if a human is predisposed to or is suffering from NSCLC by detecting excessive levels of STIM protein in a cancerous cell, such as a cell from a lung.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another particular aspect, the diagnostic method of the present invention includes measurement of the ratio of one particular form of STIM relative to another particular form of STIM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an additional embodiment, the present invention provides a diagnostic method to detect activation of CRAC channel expression in lung cells. It is envisaged that CRAC channel expression may be analysed by either protein-based or nucleic acid-based techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus “predisposed” and “predisposition” are used in the context of a probability that an individual may display clinical symptoms of NSCLC, or that any existing, manifest clinical symptoms of NSCLC are the result of an underlying biochemical cause.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be readily appreciated by a person of skill in the art that a number of methods may be utilised to measure the expression levels of STIM on the plasma membrane of a cancerous cell. By way of example only, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis using labelled antibodies is readily amenable to quantitative measurement of cell surface expression of proteins. For example, immunofluorescence and other fluorescence microscopy methods can also be used to stain tissue to detect levels of STIM. Other conventional immunohistochemistry techniques may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, relative protein expression levels may be determined by other protein-based methods which include immunoassays, for example, ELISA and immunoblotting to detect relative expression levels of one or more of the proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProteomic pattern analysis provides an alternative diagnostic method which is particularly useful for global expression pattern analysis of proteins. Methods of cancer diagnosis using proteomic patterns are provided in Conrads et al., \nExpert Rev Mol Diagn. \n2003 July; 3(4):411-20 and is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, a plurality of the proteins may be used in a protein library displayed in a number of ways, e.g., in phage display or cell display systems or by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, or more specifically, differential two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). These particular embodiments may generally be referred to as “proteomic” or “protein profiling” methods, such as described, for example, in Chapters 3.9.1 and 22 of CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN PROTEIN SCIENCE Eds. Coligan et al., John Wiley & Sons NY USA (1996-2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments relating to protein arrays, a cancer-associated protein of the invention (such as a NSCLC-associated protein) is located at an identifiable address on the array.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn exemplary embodiments, the protein array includes a substrate which is immobilized, impregnated, bound or otherwise coupled to a cancer-associated protein (such as a NSCLC-associated protein), or a fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe substrate may be a chemically-derivatized aluminium chip, a synthetic membrane such as PVDF or nitrocellulose, a glass slide or microtiter plates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetection of substrate-bound proteins may be performed using mass spectrometry, ELISA, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence microscopy or by colorimetric detection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diagnostic methods of the invention may involve measuring expression levels of a nucleic acid encoding a STIM protein and/or a CRAC channel. In this regard, nucleotide sequence variations in a promoter, for example, may affect the steady state levels of a CRAC channel gene transcript in one or more cells of an affected or predisposed individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also contemplated that relative levels of nucleic acids may be measured and/or compared in the diagnostic methods of the present invention. By way of example, a CRAC and/or STIM mRNA level may be measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeasurement of relative levels of a nucleic acid level compared to an expressed level of a reference nucleic acid may be conveniently performed using a nucleic acid array.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid array technology has become well known in the art and examples of methods applicable to array technology are provided, for example, in Chapter 22 of CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY Eds. Ausubel et al. (John Wiley & Sons NY USA 1995-2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn array can be generated by various methods, e.g., by photolithographic methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,143,854; 5,510,270; and 5,527,681), mechanical methods (e.g., directed-flow methods as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,261), pin-based methods (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,514), and bead-based techniques (e.g., as described in International Application No. PCT/US93/04145).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference is also made to Affymetrix nucleic acid array systems such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,858,659 and 6,300,063, which provide specific teaching in relation to nucleic acid array-based detection of disease-related polymorphisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another particular form of this embodiment, quantitative or semi-quantitative PCR using primers corresponding to CRAC channel-encoding nucleic acids or STIM-encoding nucleic acids may be used to quantify relative expression levels of a CRAC channel nucleic acid or STIM nucleic acid to thereby determine whether an individual is predisposed to or suffering from NSCLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCR amplification is not linear and hence end point analysis does not always allow for the accurate determination of nucleic acid expression levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReal-time PCR analysis provides a high throughput means of measuring gene expression levels. It uses specific primers, and fluorescence detection to measure the amount of product after each cycle. Hydridization probes utilise either quencher dyes or fluorescence directly to generate a signal. This method may be used to validate and quantify nucleic acid expression differences in cells or tissues obtained from cancer sufferers compared to cells or tissues obtained from non-sufferers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following general methodology described herein provides the manner and process of making and using the compound of the present invention and are illustrative rather than limiting. Further modification of provided methodology and additionally new methods may also be devised in order to achieve and serve the purpose of the invention. Accordingly, it should be understood that there may be other embodiments which fall within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the specification hereto.\n\n\n \nGeneral Method of Preparation of Compound of Formula (I)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be prepared by the following processes. Unless otherwise indicated, all the variables when used in the below formulae are to be understood to present those groups described above in relation to formula (IA). These methods can similarly be applied to other compounds of formula (I) (e.g, (IA-I), (IA-II), (IA-III) and (IA-IV).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nScheme\n 1 provides a general process for synthesis of a compound of formula (IA) wherein L\n1 \n& L\n2 \ntogether are —NH—CO—, R′″ is hydrogen or halogen, and all other variables R, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, T, U, V, W, A and Cy are as described above in relation to formula (IA)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound of \nformula\n 1 can be reacted with a compound of formula 2 (e.g., phenyl hydrazine) to form a compound of \nformula\n 3. The compound of \nformula\n 3 can then be nitrated, e.g., using a mixture of concentrated H\n2\nSO\n4 \nand concentrated HNO\n3 \nto form a compound of \nformula\n 4. Reduction of the compound of \nformula\n 4, such as with FeCl\n3 \nand hydrazine in the presence of activated charcoal, yields the corresponding amine compound of formula 5a wherein R′″ is Hydrogen. Alternately halogenation followed by reduction of the compound of \nformula\n 4, yields the corresponding amine compound of formula 5b wherein R′″ is Halogen. The compound of formula 5a or 5b can be coupled with various other intermediates in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent to provide a compound of formula (IA). The compound of formula 5a or 5b can be coupled with i. Cy-A-COOH using one or more amide coupling reagents such as (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphoniumhexafluoro phosphate (BOP reagent) or N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC); ii. with acid chlorides of formula Cy-A-COCl; or iii. isocyanates of formula Cy-NCO where A is NH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nScheme\n 2 provides a general process for synthesis of a compound of formula (IA) wherein L\n1 \n& L\n2 \ntogether i —NH—CO—, R′″ is hydrogen or halogen and all other variables R, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, T, U, V, W, A and Cy are those described above in relation to formula (IA).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep-1: A ketone of formula a can be condensed with an ester of formula b in the presence of a base such as a metal alkoxide, e.g., sodium ethoxide, to give a diketone of \nformula\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep-2: The compound of \nformula\n 1 can be converted to a pyrazole compound of formula 2a by reacting it with hydrazine. The compound of formula 2a can be reacted with a compound of formula 2b wherein L\ng \nis a leaving group (such as a halogen) in the presence of a suitable base such as an alkali metal carbonate, e.g., Cs\n2\nCO\n3\n, to give a compound of \nformula\n 4, which can be subjected to a similar sequence of transformations as described above in \nscheme\n 1 to afford a compound of formula IA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 2A provides a general process for synthesis of a compound of formula (IA) wherein L\n1 \n& L\n2 \ntogether is —CO—NH—, R′″ is hydrogen or Halogen and all other variables R, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, T, U, V, W, A and Cy are those described above in relation to formula (IA).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of formula 2a can be reacted with a compound of formula 2c wherein L\ng \nis a leaving group (such as a halogen) in the presence of a suitable base such as an alkali metal carbonate, e.g., Cs\n2\nCO\n3\n, to give a compound of formula 4a, which can then be hydrolysed to give a compound of formula 5c. The compound of formula 5c can be coupled with Cy-A-NH\n2 \nusing one or more amide coupling reagents such as (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphoniumhexafluoro phosphate (BOP reagent) or N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar methodologies with certain modifications as known to those skilled in the art can be used to synthesize compounds of formula (I), (IA-I) or (IA-II) wherein the variables are to be understood to present those groups described above in relation to formula (I), (IA-I), (IA-II), (IA-III) or (IA-IV) using suitable intermediates and reagents.\n\n\n \nEXPERIMENTAL\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following abbreviations are used throughout this disclosure: EDC.HCl [N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride], HOBt [Hydroxybenzotriazole], TEA (triethylamine), DMF (dimethyl formamide), AcOEt (ethyl acetate), DCM (dichloromethane), DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide, THF (tetrahydrofuran). Unless otherwise mentioned, work-up implies distribution of reaction mixture between the aqueous and organic phases indicated within parentheses, separation and drying over Na\n2\nSO\n4 \nof the organic layer and evaporating the solvent to afford a residue.

In-Vitro CRAC Channel Inhibition Assay in Jurkat Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition of CRAC channels was determined following thapsigargin (Sigma, Cat # T9033) induced endoplasmic calcium release in Jurkat cells. (see Yasurio Yonetoky et. al Bio. & Med. Chem. 14 (2006) 4750-4760). Cells were centrifuged and re-suspended in equal volumes ° f Ca\n2+ \nand Mg\n2+ \nfree Hanks buffer and Fluo-8 NW dye (ABD Bioquest, Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif.) loading solution at 2×10\n5 \ncells/100 μl/well in 96-well black plate. Plate is incubated at 37° C./5% CO\n2 \nfor 30 mM followed by further 15 mM incubation at room temperature. Test compounds (DMSO stocks diluted in Ca\n2+ \nand Mg\n2+ \nfree Hanks buffer) at desired concentrations were added to the wells and incubated for 15 mM. Thapsigargin (1 μM final concentration) was added to the wells and incubated for 15 min to inhibit the Sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca\n2+ \nATPase pump thereby depleting endoplasmic calcium and raising cytosolic calcium concentrations. Store-operated calcium entry was initiated by adding extracellular Ca\n2+ \nto a final concentration of 1.8 mM. Fluorescence was monitored over 5 mM on a plate reader (BMG Labtech., Germany) with excitation at 485 nm and an emission wavelength at 520 nm. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. IC\n50 \nfor each compound was determined based on the percent inhibition of thapsigargin-induced calcium influx into cells.

The mRNA expression of Orai1, Stim1, and Stim2 was significantly reduced upon treating the cells with Compound B as evident by qualitative PCR. See \nFIG. 4\n.\n\n\n \nExample V\n\n\nDetermination of Cytotoxicity in NCI-H460 Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nCytotoxicity of a test compound (Compound B) was determined using a lactate dehydrogenase assay kit (Cayman Chemicals, MI) as per the manufacturer's instructions with some minor modifications. Briefly, 20,000 cells/well in complete RPMI-1640 media were seeded in a 96-well tissue culture plate and incubated overnight at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. The test compound was added to the wells in triplicate at the desired concentrations. Doxorubicin and/or 1% Triton-X were used as a positive control. After 48 h, the media was removed and assayed for lactate dehydrogenase in a colorimetric assay. Optical density was measured on a microplate reader (BMG Labtech., Germany) at 490 nM. Data were analyzed using Graphpad Prism (Graphpad software; San Diego Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data indicated that the Compound B was not cytotoxic in the NCI-H460 cell line, as evidenced by undetectable levels of lactate dehydrogenase in the media.\n\n\n \nExample VI\n\n\nEvaluation of Anti-Tumor Efficacy in Female Balb/c Nude Mice Bearing NCI-H460 Human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Xenografts\n\n\n \n \n \nA subcutaneous xenograft lung carcinoma model was used to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of test compounds. Taxol was used as the positive control. The model was established by the transplantation of NCI-H460 cells (5×10\n6\n) subcutaneously on the right flank of each animal (0.1 mL/mouse). When the average tumor volume reached around 170 mm\n3\n, 30 nude mice were selected based on tumor volume and randomly assigned into six animals per treatment group. Animals were orally administered 30 mg/kg of the test compound (Compound A) BID for 15 days. During the treatment period, the implanted tumors were measured by caliper three times a week in a blind fashion. The tumors were measured for the maximum width (X) and length (Y) and the tumor volumes (V) were calculated using the formula: V=(X\n2\nY)/2. The animal body weights were also measured at the same time. Data were analyzed using Graphpad Prism (Graphpad software; San Diego Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the test compound resulted in a 32% reduction in tumor growth without any significant change in body weight. A 36% reduction in tumor growth with significant reduction of body weight was observed in animals treated by intravenous administration of taxol. See \nFIG. 5\n.\n\n\n \nExample VII\n\n\nEvaluation of Usefulness of CRAC Channel Modulators in Various Anti-Inflammatory and Autoimmune Disorders Using In-Vivo Animal Models\n\n\n \n \n \ni. Concanavalin (Con) A induced Hepatitis in Female Balb/C mice: Con A is often used to prepare experimental animals with high levels of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, because these cells are involved in the development of viral infections in humans. In this model, animals are administered test compounds orally 1 hour prior to intravenous administration of Con A. Blood samples are collected after 24 hours for determination of Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) in serum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n% reduction in serum SGOT & SGPT upon administration of the test compound can be studied.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nii. TNCB induced contact hypersensitivity in female Balb/c mice: Contact hypersensitivity is a simple in vivo assay of cell-mediated immune function. In this procedure, exposure of epidermal cells to exogenous haptens results in a delayed type hypersensitive reaction that can be measured and quantified. Briefly, 7% TNCB solution is applied to the abdominal region of 8 week old Balb/c mice. Ear thickness is measured 7 days after TNCB sensitization. Compounds are administered orally followed by an application of 1% TNCB to inside and outside of ear pinnae. Ear thickness is measured 24 h after TNCB challenge\n\n\n \n \n \n \n% reduction in ear inflammation upon administration of the test compound can be studied.\n\n\n \n \n \n \niii. Foot paw Delayed Type Hypersensitivity in male Balb/c mice: DTH swelling responses can be used to follow the activity of immunosuppressive molecules and/or suppressor T cells in vivo. Intradermal antigen (methylated BSA) injections are given to mice (at base of tail) on \nday\n 0 and \nday\n 7. Compounds are administered once daily from \nday\n 0 to \nday\n 10 Methylated BSA is injected into the right hind footpad of animals on \nday\n 10. Weight difference induced by antigen is determined by weighing the right and left hind paws 24 h after injection of methylated BSA (day 11).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n% reduction in antigen-induced paw inflammation in mice can be studied.\n\n\n \n \n \n \niv. OVA-Induced Asthma in Guinea Pigs: Pulmonary eosinophilia and airway remodelling in conjunction with altered neural control of airway tone and airway epithelial desquamation contributes to Airway Hyper-responsiveness (AHR) in asthma. For determination of eosinophil reduction, animals are sensitized with OVA on d0, d7, and d14 followed by another round (0.1% w/v) through inhalation on d19 & d20. Compounds are administered orally 1 h before OVA challenge (0.3%). BAL fluid is collected on d22 for differential count and cytokine estimation. For determination of change in respiratory parameters, animals are subjected to whole body plethysmography immediately after ova challenge. % reduction in blood eosinophils along with a concurrent improvement in respiration upon administration of the test compound can be studied.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nv. Collagen-induced arthritis in male DBA/1 Ola HSD mice: Collagen induced arthritis in rodent models have been widely used to illustrate and understand the development of the disease besides serving as a surrogate for validation of therapeutic targets for human rheumatoid arthritis. Mice were anesthetized with Isoflurane and given 150 μl of Bovine Type II collagen in Freund's complete adjuvant injections (\nday\n 0 and day 21). Treatment is initiated on \nstudy day\n 0 and continued once daily, every day (po, qd). Starting on day 18, clinical scores are given daily for each of the paws (right front, left front, right rear, left rear) and continued till the day of sacrifice (day 34). Daily administration of the test compound at to alleviates arthritic symptoms, disease progression, and incidence by % compared to the control animals can be studied.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther in-vivo models wherein the effect of CRAC channel modulators in various Anti-inflammatory and Autoimmune disorders can be tested include Chronic Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis in C57/B16.1 mice: Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system and widely used as an animal model of Multiple Sclerosis. Animals are administered pertussis toxin intravenously and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) subcutaneously on \nday\n 0. Treatment is initiated at \nday\n 0 and continued till sacrifice. Development of EAE is observed between day 9 to day 42. At the end of the treatment period, animals are sacrificed for histopathological analysis as well as cytokine estimation in plasma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the invention herein has been described with reference to particular embodiments, it is to be understood that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles and applications of the present invention.
