No. 11/692,870 filed Mar. 28, 2007 which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/617,645 filed Dec. 28, 2006, the latter two of which claim the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/826,720, filed Sep. 22, 2006 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/828,590 filed Oct. 6, 2006; all of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are compounds, methods of making such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and medicaments containing such compounds, and methods of using such compounds and compositions to inhibit the activity of tyrosine kinases.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nBruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, is a key signaling enzyme expressed in all hematopoietic cells types except T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Btk plays an essential role in the B-cell signaling pathway linking cell surface B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation to downstream intracellular responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBtk is a key regulator of B-cell development, activation, signaling, and survival (Kurosaki, \nCurr Op Imm, \n2000, 276-281; Schaeffer and Schwartzberg, \nCurr Op Imm \n2000, 282-288). In addition, Btk plays a role in a number of other hematopoetic cell signaling pathways, e.g., Toll like receptor (TLR) and cytokine receptor-mediated TNF-α production in macrophages, IgE receptor (FcepsilonRl) signaling in Mast cells, inhibition of Fas/APO-1 apoptotic signaling in B-lineage lymphoid cells, and collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation.

Designations such as “C\n1\n-C\n6 \nheterocycle” refer only to the number of carbon atoms in the ring and do not refer to the total number of atoms in the ring. It is understood that the heterocylic ring can have additional heteroatoms in the ring. Designations such as “4-6 membered heterocycle” refer to the total number of atoms that are contained in the ring (i.e., a four, five, or six membered ring, in which at least one atom is a carbon atom, at least one atom is a heteroatom and the remaining two to four atoms are either carbon atoms or heteroatoms). In heterocycles that have two or more heteroatoms, those two or more heteroatoms can be the same or different from one another. Heterocycles can be optionally substituted.

Without being bound by theory, the diverse roles played by Btk signaling in various hematopoietic cell functions, e.g., B-cell receptor activation, show that small molecule Btk inhibitors are useful for reducing the risk of or treating a variety of diseases affected by or affecting many cell types of the hematopoetic lineage including, e.g., autoimmune diseases, heteroimmune conditions or diseases, inflammatory diseases, cancer (e.g., B-cell proliferative disorders), and thromboembolic disorders. Further, the irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds described herein can be used to inhibit a small subset of other tyrosine kinases that share homology with Btk by having a cysteine residue (including a \nCys\n 481 residue) that can form a covalent bond with the irreversible inhibitor. See, e.g., protein kinases in \nFIG. 1\n. Thus, a subset of tyrosine kinases other than Btk are also expected to be useful as therapeutic targets in a number of health conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the methods described herein can be used to treat an autoimmune disease, which includes, but is not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, Still's disease, juvenile arthritis, lupus, diabetes, myasthenia gravis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Ord's thyroiditis, Graves' disease Sjögren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Addison's disease, opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, ankylosing spondylitisis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, aplastic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, coeliac disease, Goodpasture's syndrome, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, optic neuritis, scleroderma, primary biliary cirrhosis, Reiter's syndrome, Takayasu's arteritis, temporal arteritis, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Wegener's granulomatosis, psoriasis, alopecia universalis, Behçet's disease, chronic fatigue, dysautonomia, endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, neuromyotonia, scleroderma, and vulvodynia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the methods described herein can be used to treat heteroimmune conditions or diseases, which include, but are not limited to graft versus host disease, transplantation, transfusion, anaphylaxis, allergies (e.g., allergies to plant pollens, latex, drugs, foods, insect poisons, animal hair, animal dander, dust mites, or cockroach calyx), type I hypersensitivity, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further embodiments, the methods described herein can be used to treat an inflammatory disease, which includes, but is not limited to asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, appendicitis, blepharitis, bronchiolitis, bronchitis, bursitis, cervicitis, cholangitis, cholecystitis, colitis, conjunctivitis, cystitis, dacryoadenitis, dermatitis, dermatomyositis, encephalitis, endocarditis, endometritis, enteritis, enterocolitis, epicondylitis, epididymitis, fasciitis, fibrositis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, laryngitis, mastitis, meningitis, myelitis myocarditis, myositis, nephritis, oophoritis, orchitis, osteitis, otitis, pancreatitis, parotitis, pericarditis, peritonitis, pharyngitis, pleuritis, phlebitis, pneumonitis, pneumonia, proctitis, prostatitis, pyelonephritis, rhinitis, salpingitis, sinusitis, stomatitis, synovitis, tendonitis, tonsillitis, uveitis, vaginitis, vasculitis, and vulvitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the methods described herein can be used to treat a cancer, e.g., B-cell proliferative disorders, which include, but are not limited to diffuse large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, plasma cell myeloma, plasmacytoma, extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma, nodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, mediastinal (thymic) large B cell lymphoma, intravascular large B cell lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma, burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further embodiments, the methods described herein can be used to treat thromboembolic disorders, which include, but are not limited to myocardial infarct, angina pectoris (including unstable angina), reocclusions or restenoses after angioplasty or aortocoronary bypass, stroke, transitory ischemia, peripheral arterial occlusive disorders, pulmonary embolisms, and deep venous thromboses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSymptoms, diagnostic tests, and prognostic tests for each of the above-mentioned conditions includ, e.g., \nHarrison's Principles of Internal Medicine©,” \n16th ed., 2004, The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Dey et al. (2006), Cytojournal 3(24), and the “Revised European American Lymphoma” (REAL) classification system (see, e.g., the website maintained by the National Cancer Institute).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of animal models of are useful for establishing a range of therapeutically effective doses of irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds for treating any of the foregoing diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, dosing of irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds for treating an autoimmune disease can be assessed in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthitis. In this model, arthritis is induced in Balb/c mice by administering anti-collagen antibodies and lipopolysaccharide. See Nandakumar et al. (2003), \nAm. J. Pathol \n163:1827-1837.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, dosing of irreversible Btk inhibitors for the treatment of B-cell proliferative disorders can be examined in, e.g., a human-to-mouse xenograft model in which human B-cell lymphoma cells (e.g. Ramos cells) are implanted into immunodefficient mice (e.g., “nude” mice) as described in, e.g., Pagel et al. (2005), Clin Cancer Res 11(13):4857-4866.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimal models for treatment of thromboembolic disorders are also known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic efficacy of the compound for one of the foregoing diseases can be optimized during a course of treatment. For example, a subject being treated can undergo a diagnostic evaluation to correlate the relief of disease symptoms or pathologies to inhibition of in vivo Btk activity achieved by administering a given dose of an irreversible Btk inhibitor. Cellular assays can be used to determine in vivo activity of Btk in the presence or absence of an irreversible Btk inhibitor. For example, since activated Btk is phosphorylated at tyrosine 223 (Y223) and tyrosine 551 (Y551), phospho-specific immunocytochemical staining of P-Y223 or P-Y551-positive cells can be used to detect or quantify activation of Bkt in a population of cells (e.g., by FACS analysis of stained vs unstained cells). See, e.g., Nisitani et al. (1999), \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA \n96:2221-2226. Thus, the amount of the Btk inhibitor inhibitor compound that is administered to a subject can be increased or decreased as needed so as to maintain a level of Btk inhibition optimal for treating the subject's disease state.\n\n\n \nCompounds\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the following description of irreversible Btk compounds suitable for use in the methods described herein, definitions of referred-to standard chemistry terms may be found in reference works (if not otherwise defined herein), including Carey and Sundberg “Advanced Organic Chemistry 4th Ed.” Vols. A (2000) and B (2001), Plenum Press, New York. In addition, nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for Btk (e.g., human Btk) are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,469. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclature employed in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those known in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Btk inhibitor compounds described herein are selective for Btk and kinases having a cysteine residue in an amino acid sequence position of the tyrosine kinase that is homologous to the amino acid sequence position of \ncysteine\n 481 in Btk. See, e.g., kinases in \nFIG. 1\n Inhibitor compounds described herein include a Michael acceptor moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, an irreversible inhibitor compound of Btk used in the methods described herein is identified or characterized in an in vitro assay, e.g., an acellular biochemical assay or a cellular functional assay. Such assays are useful to determine an in vitro IC\n50 \nfor an irreversible Btk inhibitor compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, an acellular kinase assay can be used to determine Btk activity after incubation of the kinase in the absence or presence of a range of concentrations of a candidate irreversible Btk inhibitor compound. If the candidate compound is in fact an irreversible Btk inhibitor, Btk kinase activity will not be recovered by repeat washing with inhibitor-free medium. See, e.g., J. B. Smaill, et al. (1999), \nJ. Med. Chem. \n42(10):1803-1815. Further, covalent complex formation between Btk and a candidate irreversible Btk inhibitor is a useful indicator of irreversible inhibition of Btk that can be readily determined by a number of methods (e.g., mass spectrometry). For example, some irreversible Btk-inhibitor compounds can form a covalent bond with \nCys\n 481 of Btk (e.g., via a Michael reaction).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCellular functional assays for Btk inhibition include measuring one or more cellular endpoints in response to stimulating a Btk-mediated pathway in a cell line (e.g., BCR activation in Ramos cells) in the absence or presence of a range of concentrations of a candidate irreversible Btk inhibitor compound. Useful endpoints for determining a response to BCR activation include, e.g., autophosphorylation of Btk, phosphorylation of a Btk target protein (e.g., PLC-γ), and cytoplasmic calcium flux.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh throughput assays for many acellular biochemical assays (e.g., kinase assays) and cellular functional assays (e.g., calcium flux) are documented methodologies. In addition, high throughput screening systems are commercially available (see, e.g., Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, Mass.; Air Technical Industries, Mentor, Ohio; Beckman Instruments, Inc. Fullerton, Calif.; Precision Systems, Inc., Natick, Mass., etc.). These systems typically automate entire procedures including all sample and reagent pipetting, liquid dispensing, timed incubations, and final readings of the microplate in detector(s) appropriate for the assay. Automated systems thereby allow the identification and characterization of a large number of irreversible Btk compounds without undue effort.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIrreversible Btk inhibitor compounds can used for the manufacture of a medicament for treating any of the foregoing conditions (e.g., autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, allergy disorders, B-cell proliferative disorders, or thromboembolic disorders).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the irreversible Btk inhibitor compound used for the methods described herein inhibits Btk or a Btk homolog kinase activity with an in vitro IC\n50 \nof less than 10 μM. (e.g., less than 1 μM, less than 0.5 μM, less than 0.4 μM, less than 0.3 μM, less than 0.1, less than 0.08 μM, less than 0.06 μM, less than 0.05 μM, less than 0.04 μM, less than 0.03 μM, less than less than 0.02 μM, less than 0.01, less than 0.008 μM, less than 0.006 μM, less than 0.005 μM, less than 0.004 μM, less than 0.003 μM, less than less than 0.002 μM, less than 0.001, less than 0.00099 μM, less than 0.00098 μM, less than 0.00097 μM, less than 0.00096 μM, less than 0.00095 μM, less than 0.00094 μM, less than 0.00093 μM, less than 0.00092, or less than 0.00090 μM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the irreversible Btk inhibitor compound selectively and irreversibly inhibits an activated form of its target tyrosine kinase (e.g., a phosphorylated form of the tyrosine kinase). For example, activated Btk is transphosphorylated at \ntyrosine\n 551. Thus, in these embodiments the irreversible Btk inhibitor inhibits the target kinase in cells only once the target kinase is activated by the signaling events.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDescribed herein are compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6).

Protecting groups are used to block some or all reactive moieties and prevent such groups from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed. In one embodiment, each protective group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal. Protective groups can be removed by acid, base, and hydrogenolysis. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and t-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and may be used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may be blocked with base labile groups such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as t-butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may also be blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids may be blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties may be protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as exemplified herein, or they may be blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups may be blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAllyl blocking groups are useful in then presence of acid- and base- protecting groups since the former are stable and can be subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid can be deprotected with a Pd\n0 \n-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate may be attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically blocking/protecting groups may be selected from:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther protecting groups, plus a detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal are described in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y., 1999, and Kocienski, Protective Groups, Thieme Verlag, New York, N.Y., 1994, which are incorporated herein by reference for such disclosure.\n\n\n \nSynthesis of Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, provided herein are methods of making and methods of using tyrosine kinase inhibitor compounds described herein.

In other embodiments, enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomers, enantiomers, and mixtures thereof are considered as part of the compositions described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods and formulations described herein include the use of N-oxides, crystalline forms (also known as polymorphs), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds described herein, as well as active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity. In some situations, compounds may exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the scope of the compounds presented herein. In addition, the compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6) in unoxidized form can be prepared from N-oxides of compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6) by treating with a reducing agent, such as, but not limited to, sulfur, sulfur dioxide, triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus trichloride, tribromide, or the like in a suitable inert organic solvent, such as, but not limited to, acetonitrile, ethanol, aqueous dioxane, or the like at 0 to 80° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as prodrugs. A “prodrug” refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound described herein, which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug is a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. To produce a prodrug, a pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. The prodrug can be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, once a pharmaceutically active compound is known, prodrugs of compounds can be designed (if desired) (for examples of this procedure applied to other compounds, see, e.g., Nogrady (1985) \nMedicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach, \nOxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392; Silverman (1992), The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, pages 352-401, Saulnier et al., (1994), \nBioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, \nVol. 4, p. 1985).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a derivative as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some cases, some of the compounds herein-described are prodrugs for another derivative or active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they are easier to administer than the parent drug. They are, for instance, bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug optionally has improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. Prodrugs may be designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. In some embodiments, the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. See, e.g., Fedorak et al., \nAm. J. Physiol., \n269:G210-218 (1995); McLoed et al., \nGastroenterol, \n106:405-413 (1994); Hochhaus et al., \nBiomed. Chrom., \n6:283-286 (1992); J. Larsen and H. Bundgaard, \nInt. J.

Stella, \nPro\n-\ndrugs as Novel Delivery Systems, \nVol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series; and Edward B. Roche, \nBioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, \nAmerican Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, all incorporated by reference for such disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSites on the aromatic ring portion of compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6) can be susceptible to various metabolic reactions, therefore incorporation of appropriate substituents on the aromatic ring structures, such as, by way of example only, halogens can reduce, minimize or eliminate this metabolic pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds described herein include isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in the various formulas and structures presented herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature.

Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., \n2\nH, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn additional or further embodiments, the compounds described herein are metabolized upon administration to an organism in need to produce a metabolite that is then used to produce a desired effect, including a desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds described herein may be formed as, and/or used as, pharmaceutically acceptable salts.

Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and may be formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Solvates of compounds described herein can be conveniently prepared or formed during the processes described herein.

In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the compounds and methods provided herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that a reference to a salt includes the solvent addition forms or crystal forms thereof, particularly solvates or polymorphs. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are often formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds described herein may be in various forms, including but not limited to, amorphous forms, milled forms and nano-particulate forms. In addition, compounds described herein include crystalline forms, also known as polymorphs. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound.

Any acid-base combination that results in the liberation of carbon dioxide can be used in place of the combination of sodium bicarbonate and citric and tartaric acids, as long as the ingredients were suitable for pharmaceutical use and result in a pH of about 6.0 or higher.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the formulations described herein, which include compounds of Formula (A1-A6), are solid dispersions. Methods of producing such solid dispersions include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,343,789, 5,340,591, 5,456,923, 5,700,485, 5,723,269, and U.S. Pub. Appl 2004/0013734. In still other embodiments, the formulations described herein are solid solutions. Solid solutions incorporate a substance together with the active agent and other excipients such that heating the mixture results in dissolution of the drug and the resulting composition is then cooled to provide a solid blend which can be further formulated or directly added to a capsule or compressed into a tablet. Methods of producing such solid solutions include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,151,273, 5,281,420, and 6,083,518.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical solid oral dosage forms including formulations described herein, which include a compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6), can be further formulated to provide a controlled release of the compounds Formula (A1-A6). Controlled release refers to the release of the compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6), from a dosage form in which it is incorporated according to a desired profile over an extended period of time. Controlled release profiles include, for example, sustained release, prolonged release, pulsatile release, and delayed release profiles. In contrast to immediate release compositions, controlled release compositions allow delivery of an agent to a subject over an extended period of time according to a predetermined profile. Such release rates can provide therapeutically effective levels of agent for an extended period of time and thereby provide a longer period of pharmacologic response while minimizing side effects as compared to conventional rapid release dosage forms. Such longer periods of response provide for many inherent benefits that are not achieved with the corresponding short acting, immediate release preparations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the solid dosage forms described herein can be formulated as enteric coated delayed release oral dosage forms, i.e., as an oral dosage form of a pharmaceutical composition as described herein which utilizes an enteric coating to affect release in the small intestine of the gastrointestinal tract. The enteric coated dosage form is optionally a compressed or molded or extruded tablet/mold (coated or uncoated) containing granules, powder, pellets, beads or particles of the active ingredient and/or other composition components, which are themselves coated or uncoated. The enteric coated oral dosage form is optionally a capsule (coated or uncoated) containing pellets, beads or granules of the solid carrier or the composition, which are themselves coated or uncoated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “delayed release” as used herein refers to the delivery so that the release can be accomplished at some generally predictable location in the intestinal tract more distal to that which would have been accomplished if there had been no delayed release alterations. In some embodiments the method for delay of release is coating. Any coatings should be applied to a sufficient thickness such that the entire coating does not dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids at pH below about 5, but does dissolve at pH about 5 and above. It is expected that any anionic polymer exhibiting a pH-dependent solubility profile can be used as an enteric coating in the methods and compositions described herein to achieve delivery to the lower gastrointestinal tract. In some embodiments the polymers described herein are anionic carboxylic polymers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the coating optionally, and usually does, contain a plasticizer and possibly other coating excipients such as colorants, talc, and/or magnesium stearate. Suitable plasticizers include triethyl citrate (Citroflex 2), triacetin (glyceryl triacetate), acetyl triethyl citrate (Citroflec A2), Carbowax 400 (polyethylene glycol 400), diethyl phthalate, tributyl citrate, acetylated monoglycerides, glycerol, fatty acid esters, propylene glycol, and dibutyl phthalate. In particular, anionic carboxylic acrylic polymers usually will contain 10-25% by weight of a plasticizer, especially dibutyl phthalate, polyethylene glycol, triethyl citrate and triacetin. Coating techniques such as spray or pan coating are employed to apply coatings. The coating thickness must be sufficient to ensure that the oral dosage form remains intact until the desired site of topical delivery in the intestinal tract is reached.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nColorants, detackifiers, surfactants, antifoaming agents, lubricants (e.g., carnuba wax or PEG) are optionally added to the coatings besides plasticizers to solubilize or disperse the coating material, and to improve coating performance and the coated product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the formulations described herein, which include compounds of Formula (A1-A6), are delivered using a pulsatile dosage form. A pulsatile dosage form is capable of providing one or more immediate release pulses at predetermined time points after a controlled lag time or at specific sites. Pulsatile dosage forms including the formulations described herein, which include a compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6), are administered, for example using a variety of pulsatile formulations known in the including, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,011,692, 5,017,381, 5,229,135, and 5,840,329. Other pulsatile release dosage forms suitable for use with the present formulations include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,871,549, 5,260,068, 5,260,069, 5,508,040, 5,567,441 and 5,837,284. In one embodiment, the controlled release dosage form is pulsatile release solid oral dosage form including at least two groups of particles, (i.e. multiparticulate) each containing the formulation described herein. The first group of particles provides a substantially immediate dose of the compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6), upon ingestion by a mammal The first group of particles can be either uncoated or include a coating and/or sealant. The second group of particles includes coated particles, which includes from about 2% to about 75%, from about 2.5% to about 70%, or from about 40% to about 70%, by weight of the total dose of the compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6), in said formulation, in admixture with one or more binders. The coating includes a pharmaceutically acceptable ingredient in an amount sufficient to provide a delay of from about 2 hours to about 7 hours following ingestion before release of the second dose. Suitable coatings include one or more differentially degradable coatings such as, by way of example only, pH sensitive coatings (enteric coatings) such as acrylic resins (e.g., Eudragit® EPO, Eudragit® L30D-55, Eudragit® FS 30D Eudragit® L100-55, Eudragit® L100, Eudragit® S100, Eudragit® RD100, Eudragit® E 100, Eudragit® L12.5, Eudragit® S12.5, and Eudragit® NE30D, Eudragit® NE 40D®) either alone or blended with cellulose derivatives, e.g., ethylcellulose, or non-enteric coatings having variable thickness to provide differential release of the formulation that includes a compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther types of controlled release systems suitable for use with the formulations described herein include, e.g., polymer-based systems, such as polylactic and polyglycolic acid, plyanhydrides and polycaprolactone; porous matrices, nonpolymer-based systems that are lipids, including sterols, such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and fatty acids, or neutral fats, such as mono-, di- and triglycerides; hydrogel release systems; silastic systems; peptide-based systems; wax coatings, bioerodible dosage forms, compressed tablets using binders and the like. See, e.g., Liberman et al., \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms, \n2 Ed., Vol. 1, pp. 209-214 (1990); Singh et al., \nEncyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, \n2\nnd \nEd., pp. 751-753 (2002); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,327,725, 4,624,848, 4,968,509, 5,461,140, 5,456,923, 5,516,527, 5,622,721, 5,686,105, 5,700,410, 5,977,175, 6,465,014 and 6,932,983.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, pharmaceutical formulations are provided that include particles of the compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6), described herein and at least one dispersing agent or suspending agent for oral administration to a subject. The formulations may be a powder and/or granules for suspension, and upon admixture with water, a substantially uniform suspension is obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid formulation dosage forms for oral administration can be aqueous suspensions selected from the group including, but not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous oral dispersions, emulsions, solutions, elixirs, gels, and syrups. See, e.g., Singh et al., \nEncyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, \n2\nnd \nEd., pp. 754-757 (2002). In addition to the particles of compounds of Formula (A1-A6), the liquid dosage forms include additives, such as: (a) disintegrating agents; (b) dispersing agents; (c) wetting agents; (d) at least one preservative, (e) viscosity enhancing agents, (f) at least one sweetening agent, and (g) at least one flavoring agent. In some embodiments, the aqueous dispersions can further include a crystalline inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aqueous suspensions and dispersions described herein can remain in a homogenous state, as defined in The USP Pharmacists' Pharmacopeia (2005 edition, chapter 905), for at least 4 hours. The homogeneity should be determined by a sampling method consistent with regard to determining homogeneity of the entire composition. In one embodiment, an aqueous suspension can be re-suspended into a homogenous suspension by physical agitation lasting less than 1 minute. In another embodiment, an aqueous suspension can be re-suspended into a homogenous suspension by physical agitation lasting less than 45 seconds. In yet another embodiment, an aqueous suspension can be re-suspended into a homogenous suspension by physical agitation lasting less than 30 seconds. In still another embodiment, no agitation is necessary to maintain a homogeneous aqueous dispersion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of disintegrating agents for use in the aqueous suspensions and dispersions include, but are not limited to, a starch, e.g., a natural starch such as corn starch or potato starch, a pregelatinized starch such as National 1551 or Amijel®, or sodium starch glycolate such as Promogel® or Explotab®; a cellulose such as a wood product, methylcrystalline cellulose, e.g., Avicel®, Avicel® PH101, Avicel® PH102, Avicel® PH105, Elcema® P100, Emcocel®, Vivacel®, Ming Tia®, and SoIkaFloc®, methylcellulose, croscarmellose, or a cross-linked cellulose, such as cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose (Ac-Di-Sol®), cross-linked carboxymethylcellulose, or cross-linked croscarmellose; a cross-linked starch such as sodium starch glycolate; a cross-linked polymer such as crospovidone; a cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone; alginate such as alginic acid or a salt of alginic acid such as sodium alginate; a clay such as Veegum® HV (magnesium aluminum silicate); a gum such as agar, guar, locust bean, Karaya, pectin, or tragacanth; sodium starch glycolate; bentonite; a natural sponge; a surfactant; a resin such as a cation-exchange resin; citrus pulp; sodium lauryl sulfate; sodium lauryl sulfate in combination starch; and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the dispersing agents suitable for the aqueous suspensions and dispersions described herein include, for example, hydrophilic polymers, electrolytes, Tween® 60 or 80, PEG, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; commercially known as Plasdone), and the carbohydrate-based dispersing agents such as, for example, hydroxypropylcellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose ethers (e.g., HPC, HPC-SL, and HPC-L), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose ethers (e.g. HPMC K100, HPMC K4M, HPMC K15M, and HPMC K100M), carboxymethylcellulose sodium, methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose acetate stearate, noncrystalline cellulose, magnesium aluminum silicate, triethanolamine, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymer (Plasdone®, e.g., S-630), 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)-phenol polymer with ethylene oxide and formaldehyde (also known as tyloxapol), poloxamers (e.g., Pluronics F68®, F88®, and F108®, which are block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide); and poloxamines (e.g., Tetronic 908®, also known as Poloxamine 908®, which is a tetrafunctional block copolymer derived from sequential addition of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide to ethylenediamine (BASF Corporation, Parsippany, N.J.)).

Emulsions are dispersions of one immiscible phase in another, usually in the form of droplets. Generally, emulsions are created by vigorous mechanical dispersion. SEDDS, as opposed to emulsions or microemulsions, spontaneously form emulsions when added to an excess of water without any external mechanical dispersion or agitation. An advantage of SEDDS is that only gentle mixing is required to distribute the droplets throughout the solution. Additionally, water or the aqueous phase can be added just prior to administration, which ensures stability of an unstable or hydrophobic active ingredient. Thus, the SEDDS provides an effective delivery system for oral and parenteral delivery of hydrophobic active ingredients. SEDDS may provide improvements in the bioavailability of hydrophobic active ingredients. Methods of producing self-emulsifying dosage forms include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,858,401, 6,667,048, and 6,960,563.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuiable intranasal formulations include, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,476,116, 5,116,817 and 6,391,452. Suitable intranasal formulations that include a compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6), are prepared, for example, as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents. See, for example, Ansel, H. C. et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Sixth Ed. (1995). Preferably these compositions and formulations are prepared with suitable nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients. The choice of suitable carriers is dependent upon the exact nature of the nasal dosage form desired, e.g., solutions, suspensions, ointments, or gels. Nasal dosage forms generally contain large amounts of water in addition to the active ingredient. Minor amounts of other ingredients such as pH adjusters, emulsifiers or dispersing agents, preservatives, surfactants, gelling agents, or buffering and other stabilizing and solubilizing agents may also be present. The nasal dosage form should be isotonic with nasal secretions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor administration by inhalation, the compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6), described herein is in a form, for example, as an aerosol, a mist or a powder. Pharmaceutical compositions described herein are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit is determined, for example, by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, such as, by way of example only, gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator is formulated containing a powder mix of the compound described herein and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBuccal formulations that include compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6), is administered, for example, using a variety of formulations such as, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,229,447, 4,596,795, 4,755,386, and 5,739,136. In addition, the buccal dosage forms described herein optionally further include a bioerodible (hydrolysable) polymeric carrier that also serves to adhere the dosage form to the buccal mucosa. The buccal dosage form is fabricated so as to erode gradually over a predetermined time period, wherein the delivery of the compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6), is provided essentially throughout. Buccal drug delivery avoids the disadvantages encountered with oral drug administration, e.g., slow absorption, degradation of the active agent by fluids present in the gastrointestinal tract and/or first-pass inactivation in the liver. With regard to the bioerodible (hydrolysable) polymeric carrier, virtually any such carrier can be used, so long as the desired drug release profile is not compromised, and the carrier is compatible with the compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6), and any other components that may be present in the buccal dosage unit. Generally, the polymeric carrier comprises hydrophilic (water-soluble and water-swellable) polymers that adhere to the wet surface of the buccal mucosa. Examples of polymeric carriers useful herein include acrylic acid polymers and co, e.g., those known as “carbomers” (Carbopol®, which may be obtained from B.F. Goodrich, is one such polymer). Other components may also be incorporated into the buccal dosage forms described herein include, but are not limited to, disintegrants, diluents, binders, lubricants, flavoring, colorants, preservatives, and the like. For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions optionally take the form of tablets, lozenges, or gels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransdermal formulations described herein are administered, for example, using a variety of devices such as, but not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,598,122, 3,598,123, 3,710,795, 3,731,683, 3,742,951, 3,814,097, 3,921,636, 3,972,995, 3,993,072, 3,993,073, 3,996,934, 4,031,894, 4,060,084, 4,069,307, 4,077,407, 4,201,211, 4,230,105, 4,292,299, 4,292,303, 5,336,168, 5,665,378, 5,837,280, 5,869,090, 6,923,983, 6,929,801 and 6,946,144.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the transdermal formulations described herein include at least three components: (1) a formulation of a compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6); (2) a penetration enhancer; and (3) an aqueous adjuvant. In addition, transdermal formulations optionally include additional components such as, gelling agents, creams and ointment bases, and the like. In some embodiments, the transdermal formulation further include a woven or non-woven backing material to enhance absorption and prevent the removal of the transdermal formulation from the skin. In other embodiments, the transdermal formulations described herein maintain a saturated or supersaturated state to promote diffusion into the skin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations suitable for transdermal administration of compounds described herein optionally employ transdermal delivery devices and transdermal delivery patches and can be lipophilic emulsions or buffered, aqueous solutions, dissolved and/or dispersed in a polymer or an adhesive. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents. Still further, transdermal delivery of the compounds described herein is optionally accomplished by means of iontophoretic patches and the like. Additionally, transdermal patches optionally provide controlled delivery of the compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6). The rate of absorption is slowed, for example, by using rate-controlling membranes or by trapping the compound within a polymer matrix or gel. Conversely, absorption enhancers can be used to increase absorption. An absorption enhancer or carrier includes, for example, absorbable pharmaceutically acceptable solvents to assist passage through the skin. For example, transdermal devices are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound to the skin of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and means to secure the device to the skin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations that include a compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6), suitable for intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection may include physiologically acceptable sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers, diluents, solvents, or vehicles including water, ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol, polyethylene-glycol, glycerol, cremophor and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. Formulations suitable for subcutaneous injection may also contain additives such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the growth of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, such as parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor intravenous injections, compounds described herein may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. For other parenteral injections, appropriate formulations may include aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, preferably with physiologically compatible buffers or excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParenteral injections may involve bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in a form suitable for parenteral injection as a sterile suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, delivery systems for pharmaceutical compounds may be employed, such as, for example, liposomes and emulsions. In certain embodiments, compositions provided herein can also include an mucoadhesive polymer, selected from among, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, carbomer (acrylic acid polymer), poly(methylmethacrylate), polyacrylamide, polycarbophil, acrylic acid/butyl acrylate copolymer, sodium alginate and dextran.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the compounds described herein may be administered topically and can be formulated into a variety of topically administrable compositions, such as solutions, suspensions, lotions, gels, pastes, medicated sticks, balms, creams or ointments. Such pharmaceutical compounds can contain solubilizers, stabilizers, tonicity enhancing agents, buffers and preservatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as enemas, rectal gels, rectal foams, rectal aerosols, suppositories, jelly suppositories, or retention enemas, containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides, as well as synthetic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, PEG, and the like. In suppository forms of the compositions, a low-melting wax such as, but not limited to, a mixture of fatty acid glycerides, optionally in combination with cocoa butter is first melted.\n\n\n \nExamples of Methods of Dosing and Treatment Regimens\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein can be used in the preparation of medicaments for the inhibition of Btk or a homolog thereof, or for the treatment of diseases or conditions that would benefit, at least in part, from inhibition of Btk or a homolog thereof. In addition, a method for treating any of the diseases or conditions described herein in a subject in need of such treatment, involves administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), or Formula (D1-D6), described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutically acceptable N-oxide, pharmaceutically active metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, in therapeutically effective amounts to said subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions containing the compound(s) described herein can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, the compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease or condition, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease or condition. Amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status, weight, and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn prophylactic applications, compositions containing the compounds described herein are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease, disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a “prophylactically effective amount or dose.” In this use, the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. When used in a patient, effective amounts for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient's disease or condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case wherein the patient's status does improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be given continuously; alternatively, the dose of drug being administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a “drug holiday”). The length of the drug holiday can vary between 2 days and 1 year, including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12 days, 15 days, 20 days, 28 days, 35 days, 50 days, 70 days, 100 days, 120 days, 150 days, 180 days, 200 days, 250 days, 280 days, 300 days, 320 days, 350 days, or 365 days. The dose reduction during a drug holiday may be from 10%-100%, including, by way of example only, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 100%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. Patients can, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease or condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the subject or host in need of treatment, and is determined according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 0.02-5000 mg per day, or from about 1-1500 mg per day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered simultaneously (or over a short period of time) or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compound. The unit dosage may be in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Aqueous suspension compositions can be packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers. Alternatively, multiple-dose reclosable containers can be used, in which case it is typical to include a preservative in the composition. By way of example only, formulations for parenteral injection may be presented in unit dosage form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules, or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing ranges are merely suggestive, as the number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime is large, and considerable excursions from these recommended values are not uncommon Such dosages may be altered depending on a number of variables, not limited to the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD\n50 \n(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED\n50 \n(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD\n50 \nand ED\n50\n. Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED\n50 \nwith minimal toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.\n\n\n \nCombination Treatments\n\n\n \n \n \nThe irreversible Btk inhibitor compositions described herein can also be used in combination with other well known therapeutic reagents that are selected for their therapeutic value for the condition to be treated. In general, the compositions described herein and, in embodiments where combinational therapy is employed, other agents do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. The initial administration ise made, for example, according to established protocols, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration are modified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, it may be appropriate to administer at least one irreversible Btk inhibitor compound described herein in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds described herein is nausea, then it may be appropriate to administer an anti-nausea agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein may be enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant may have minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient may be increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient may simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient may experience a synergistic benefit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particular choice of compounds used will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol. The compounds may be administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of compounds used. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is based on an evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutically-effective dosages can vary when the drugs are used in treatment combinations. Methods for experimentally determining therapeutically-effective dosages of drugs and other agents for use in combination treatment regimens are described in the literature. For example, the use of metronomic dosing, i.e., providing more frequent, lower doses in order to minimize toxic side effects, has been described extensively in the literature Combination treatment further includes periodic treatments that start and stop at various times to assist with the clinical management of the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor combination therapies described herein, dosages of the co-administered compounds will of course vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the disease or condition being treated and so forth. In addition, when co-administered with one or more biologically active agents, the compound provided herein may be administered either simultaneously with the biologically active agent(s), or sequentially. If administered sequentially, the attending physician will decide on the appropriate sequence of administering protein in combination with the biologically active agent(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn any case, the multiple therapeutic agents (one of which is a compound of Formula (A1-A6), (B1-B6), (C1-C6), or (D1-D6) described herein) may be administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneously, the multiple therapeutic agents may be provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (by way of example only, either as a single pill or as two separate pills). One of the therapeutic agents may be given in multiple doses, or both may be given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses may vary from more than zero weeks to less than four weeks. In addition, the combination methods, compositions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only two agents; the use of multiple therapeutic combinations are also envisioned.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is understood that the dosage regimen to treat, prevent, or ameliorate the condition(s) for which relief is sought, can be modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These factors include the disorder from which the subject suffers, as well as the age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the subject. Thus, the dosage regimen actually employed can vary widely and therefore can deviate from the dosage regimens set forth herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical agents which make up the combination therapy disclosed herein may be a combined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for substantially simultaneous administration. The pharmaceutical agents that make up the combination therapy may also be administered sequentially, with either therapeutic compound being administered by a regimen calling for two-step administration. The two-step administration regimen may call for sequential administration of the active agents or spaced-apart administration of the separate active agents. The time period between the multiple administration steps may range from, a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the properties of each pharmaceutical agent, such as potency, solubility, bioavailability, plasma half-life and kinetic profile of the pharmaceutical agent. Circadian variation of the target molecule concentration may also determine the optimal dose interval.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the compounds described herein also may be used in combination with procedures that may provide additional or synergistic benefit to the patient. By way of example only, patients are expected to find therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit in the methods described herein, wherein pharmaceutical composition of a compound dislcosed herein and /or combinations with other therapeutics are combined with genetic testing to determine whether that individual is a carrier of a mutant gene that is known to be correlated with certain diseases or conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein and combination therapies can be administered before, during or after the occurrence of a disease or condition, and the timing of administering the composition containing a compound can vary. Thus, for example, the compounds can be used as a prophylactic and can be administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. The compounds and compositions can be administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. The administration of the compounds can be initiated within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, within the first 6 hours of the onset of the symptoms, or within 3 hours of the onset of the symptoms. The initial administration can be via any route practical, such as, for example, an intravenous injection, a bolus injection, infusion over 5 minutes to about 5 hours, a pill, a capsule, transdermal patch, buccal delivery, and the like, or combination thereof. A compound should be administered as soon as is practicable after the onset of a disease or condition is detected or suspected, and for a length of time necessary for the treatment of the disease, such as, for example, from about 1 month to about 3 months. The length of treatment can vary for each subject, and the length can be determined using the known criteria. For example, the compound or a formulation containing the compound can be administered for at least 2 weeks, between about 1 month to about 5 years, or from about 1 month to about 3 years.\n\n\n \n \nExemplary Therapeutic Agents for Use in Combination with an Irreversible Btk Inhibitor Compound\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the subject is suffering from or at risk of suffering from an autoimmune disease, an inflammatory disease, or an allergy disease, an irreversible Btk inhibitor compound can be used in with one or more of the following therapeutic agents in any combination: immunosuppressants (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporin, rapamicin, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mercaptopurine, mycophenolate, or FTY720), glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone, cortisone acetate, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, triamcinolone, beclometasone, fludrocortisone acetate, deoxycorticosterone acetate, aldosterone), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., salicylates, arylalkanoic acids, 2-arylpropionic acids, N-arylanthranilic acids, oxicams, coxibs, or sulphonanilides), Cox-2-specific inhibitors (e.g., valdecoxib, celecoxib, or rofecoxib), leflunomide, gold thioglucose, gold thiomalate, aurofin, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquinine, minocycline, TNF-α binding proteins (e.g., infliximab, etanercept, or adalimumab), abatacept, anakinra, interferon-β, interferon-γ, interleukin-2, allergy vaccines, antihistamines, antileukotrienes, beta-agonists, theophylline, or anticholinergics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the subject is suffering from or at risk of suffering from a B-cell proliferative disorder (e.g., plasma cell myeloma), the subjected can be treated with an irreversible Btk inhibitor compound in any combination with one or more other anti-cancer agents. In some embodiments, one or more of the anti-cancer agents are proapoptotic agents.

Briefly, 4-phenoxybenzoic acid (48 g) is added to thionyl chloride (100 mL) and heated under gentle reflux for 1 hour. Thionyl chloride is removed by distillation, the residual oil dissolved in toluene and volatile material removed at 80° C./20 mbar. The resulting acid chloride is dissolved in toluene (200 mL) and tetrahydrofuran (35 mL). Malononitrile (14.8 g) is added and the solution and stirred at −10° C. while adding diisopropylethylethylamine (57.9 g) in toluene (150 mL), while maintaining the temperature below 0° C. After 1 hour at 0° C., the mixture is stirred at 20° C. overnight. Amine hydrochloride is removed by filtration and the filtrate evaporated in vacuo. The residue is taken up in ethyl acetate and washed with 1.25 M sulphuric acid, then with brine and dried over sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvents gives a semisolid residue which is treated with a little ethyl acetate to give 4.1 g of 1,1-dicyano-2-hydroxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene as a white solid (m.p. 160-162° C.). The filtrate on evaporation gives 56.58 (96%) of 1,1-dicyano-2-hydroxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene as a grey-brown solid, which is sufficiently pure for further use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1,1-Dicyano-2-hydroxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene (56.5 g) in acetonitrile (780 mL) and methanol (85 mL) is stirred under nitrogen at 0° C. while adding diisopropylethylamine (52.5 mL) followed by 2M trimethylsilyldiazomethane (150 mL) in THF. The reaction is stirred for 2 days at 20° C., and then 2 g of silica is added (for chromatography). The brown-red solution is evaporated in vacuo, the residue dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed well with water then brine, dried and evaporated. The residue is extracted with diethyl ether (3×250 mL), decanting from insoluble oil. Evaporation of the ether extracts gives 22.5 g of 1,1-dicyano-2-methoxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene as a pale orange solid. The insoluble oil is purified by flash chromatography to give 15.0 g of a red-orange oil. 1,1-Dicyano-2-methoxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene (22.5 g) and 1,1-dicyano-2-methoxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene oil (15 g) are treated with a solution of hydrazine hydrate (18 mL) in ethanol (25 mL) and heated on the steambath for 1 hour. Ethanol (15 mL) is added followed by water (10 mL). The precipitated solid is collected and washed with ethanol:water (4:1) and then dried in air to give 3-amino-4-cyano-5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)pyrazole as a pale orange solid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3-Amino-4-cyano-5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)pyrazole (29.5 g) is suspended in formamide (300 mL) and heated under nitrogen at 180° C. for 4 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled to 30° C. and water (300 mL is added. The solid is collected, washed well with water, then with methanol and dried in air to give of 4-amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine.\n\n\n \nExample 1a\n\n\nSynthesis of 1-(3-(4-amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl)prop-2-en-1-one (Compound 4)\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis of \ncompound\n 4; a) polymer-bound triphenylphosphine (TPP), diisopropyl diazodicarboxylate (DIAD), tetrahydrofuran (THF); b) HC1/dioxane; then acryloyl chloride, triethylamine (TEA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds described herein were synthesized by following the steps oultined in \nScheme\n 1.

The diluted compounds were then added to each well (final DMSO concentration was 0.01%) and incubated at 37 degree in 5% CO\n2 \nincubator for one hour. Afterwards, 100 μl of a calcium-sensitive dye (from the \nCalcium\n 3 assay kit, Molecular Devices) was added to each well and incubated for an additional hour. The compound-treated cells were stimulated with a goat anti-human IgM antibody (80 ug/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and read in the FlexStation 11384 using a λ\nEx\n=485 nm and λ\nEm\n=538 nm for 200 seconds.

First, after recombinant Btk was pretreated with compounds, its activity was not recovered by repeat washing with inhibitor-free medium (see, e.g., J. B. Smaill, et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n1999, 42, 1803). Second, a major mass peak was observed by mass spectrometry corresponding to the molecular weight of a 1:1 covalent complex between \ncompound\n 4 and Btk (Compound 4: 440 Da, recombinant Btk kinase domain: 33,487 Da; Complex: expected 33,927 Da, observed 33,927 Da).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese compounds are highly potent inhibitors of Btk kinase activity with IC\n50\ns in the sub-nanomolar to single digit nanomolar range for in vitro kinase activity. Their IC\n50\ns in the (Ramos cell) Ca\n2+\n flux assay ranged from 3 to 92 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf note, we found that three types of Michael acceptors, acrylamide, vinyl sulfonamide and propargylamide, exhibited strong interactions with Btk. Adding a trans-oriented methyl group to the vinyl group decreased potency as shown by compound 5, which was 28-fold less potent than 4. This presumably relates to the reduced electrophilicity of the more substituted olefin. \nCompound\n 15 with a tertiary amine group gained back some potency compared to 5, even though it still suffered a potency drop relative to compound 13. \nCompound\n 10 was about 6-fold more potent than 9, presumably due to the difference in the electrophile orientation. Finally, R configuration was determined as the slightly preferred absolute stereochemistry configuration by two sets of enantiomers (11 vs. 12 and 13 vs. 14).\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nInhibition of Btk\n\n\n \n \n \nWe further characterized the properties of these compounds by assaying a number of cellular biochemical and functional endpoints. In particular, we sought to assess the selectivity of these compounds for inhibition of Btk versus the closely related protein kinases Lck, Lyn, and Syk. In anti-IgM-stimulated Ramos cells (a human B cell line), we assayed Btk-dependent phosphorylation of PLC-γ1; Lyn and Syk-dependent phosphorylation of \ntyrosine\n 551 on Btk; and BCR-activated calcium flux. We also measured the effect of \ncompound\n 4 on Jurkat cells, a human T cell line in which Lck and Itk, but not Btk are required for T cell receptor mediated Ca\n2+\n flux. As shown in Table 3, \ncompound\n 4 exhibited significant selectivity for Btk in cellular assays. In anti-IgM stimulated Ramos cells, \ncompound\n 4 inhibited the phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 with an IC\n50\n=0.014 μM, while the Lyn and Syk-dependent phosphorylation of \ntyrosine\n 551 on Btk was inhibited more weakly (IC\n50\n>7.5 μM). Thus, \ncompound\n 4 exhibits a >500-fold selectivity between Btk and Lyn or Syk in cells. Further, \ncompound\n 4 was 11-fold less active in inhibiting Ca\n2+\n flux than in Ramos cells, supporting the expected selectivity for B versus T cells.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCellular assay data for \ncompound\n 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBtk\na\n \n\n\nLck\na\n \n\n\nLyn\na\n \n\n\nBtk p551\nb\n \n\n\npPLC-γ1\nb\n \n\n\nRamos Ca Flux\nb\n \n\n\nJurkat Ca Flux\nb\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCmpd\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n0.72\nb\n \n\n\n97\n\n\n14\n\n\n>7.5\n\n\n0.014\n\n\n0.0405\n\n\n0.466\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nKi (app)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nb\nIC\n50\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nUse of \nCompound\n 4 to Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe in vivo efficacy of \ncompound\n 4 was evaluated in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthitis.

The plasma concentrations of \ncompound\n 4 that induced this maximum effect were in the 0.6-1.7 μM range at T\nmax \n(2 hr) and did not need to be sustained at high levels for 24 hours to achieve efficacy, which is not surprising for an irreversible inhibitor. Based on sequence analysis and molecular modeling, the irreversible inhibitors described herein are proposed to form a covalent bond with \nCys\n 481 of Btk (e.g., the Michael reaction acceptor portion of the compounds described herein react with the \nCys\n 481 residue of Btk). Based on sequence homology analysis (\nFIG. 1\n), the compounds presented herein are also expected to act as irreversible inhibitors of kinases having a \nCys\n 481 or a homologous cysteine residue, but to bind reversibly with kinases having a different amino acid at the 481 position within a catalytic domain sequence that is otherwise homologous to that of Btk.

The mixture is gently blended and poured into a mold to form a lozenge suitable for buccal administration.\n\n\n \nExample 8d\n\n\nInhalation Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare a pharmaceutical composition for inhalation delivery, 20 mg of a compound of Formula (A1-A6) is mixed with 50 mg of anhydrous citric acid and 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The mixture is incorporated into an inhalation delivery unit, such as a nebulizer, which is suitable for inhalation administration.\n\n\n \nExample 8e\n\n\nRectal Gel Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare a pharmaceutical composition for rectal delivery, 100 mg of a compound of Formula (A1-A6) is mixed with 2.5 g of methylcelluose (1500 mPa), 100 mg of methylparapen, 5 g of glycerin and 100 mL of purified water. The resulting gel mixture is then incorporated into rectal delivery units, such as syringes, which are suitable for rectal administration.\n\n\n \nExample 8f\n\n\nTopical Gel Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare a pharmaceutical topical gel composition, 100 mg of a compound of Formula (A1-A6) is mixed with 1.75 g of hydroxypropyl celluose, 10 mL of propylene glycol, 10 mL of isopropyl myristate and 100 mL of purified alcohol USP.

A panel of phospho-specific antibodies that recognize activating phosphorylation sites on Syk, Btk, BLNK, PLC-g1, PLC-g2, ERK, and AKT were used and tested the effects of \nCompound\n 4 on both basal phosphorylation and phosphorylation following BCR stimulation driven by anti-IgM or anti-IgG cross-linking. We examined phosphorylation patterns in both a \nCompound\n 4 sensitive cell line (DOHH2) and a \nCompound\n 4 resistant cell line (Ramos).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCompound\n 4 inhibits most BCR-stimulus induced phosphorylation events with similar potency in both cell lines. However, when we examined basal phosphorylation levels, we found higher basal phosphorylation in DOHH2 compared to Ramos, with phospho-ERK in particular indicating higher levels of basal or tonic signaling in DOHH2. Furthermore, \nCompound\n 4 significantly decreased pERK levels in unstimulated DOHH2 cells (IC50<10 nM), but not in Ramos cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA panel of nine Btk expressing B cell lymphoma cell lines was screened for basal pERK levels. Seven lines expressed significantly higher levels of basal pERK, and of these, 5 were sensitive to Compound 4 (GI50<1.3 uM), while the two cell lines with low pERK levels were resistant to \nCompound\n 4. This data shows that tonic BCR signaling contributes to the survival of a subset of lymphoma cell lines, and that inhibition of this signaling by \nCompound\n 4 is correlated with induction of apoptosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo additional experiments demonstrate that sensitivity to \nCompound\n 4 is correlated with high levels of lines pERK. First 1 uM of \nCompound\n 4 reduces expression of the known ERK transcriptional target Egr-1 within 1 hr, with maximal downregulation (10-fold) achieved by 4 hr. Second, in the lymphoma cell line WSU-DLCL2, BCR cross-linking by anti-IgG (30 ug/ml) overcome inhibition of pERK by \nCompound\n 4, showing that strong BCR stimulus activates parallel pathways to pERK that do not require Btk. BCR stimulus also rescues WSU-DLCL2 from \nCompound\n 4 induced cytotoxicity, further confirming that inhibition of pERK is correlated with apoptosis induction by \nCompound\n 4. Taken together these data show high levels of pERK or ERK transcriptional targets such as Egr-1 serve as useful markers for lymphomas in which tonic BCR signaling is contributing to cell survival and that these lymphomas are particularly sensitive to BCR pathway inhibitors such as \nCompound\n 4."

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims benefit of the provisional U.S. Application Ser. No. 60/728,924, filed 21 Oct. 2005, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n1. Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates generally to using certain camptothecin-based compounds that are useful for treating various cancers, particularly in combination with radiotherapy.\n\n\n2. Background of the Invention\n\n\nCancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. and accounts for the deaths of 1 of every 4 Americans. The American Cancer Society estimates that 556,000 Americans died from cancer in 2003. Cancer therapy is presently based on three different approaches, namely chemotherapy, radiation therapy (i.e. radiotherapy) and surgery. Radiotherapy is often used as adjuvant or secondary treatment following surgical procedures to remove a cancerous tumor or in combination with chemotherapy.\n\n\nThe radiotherapeutic approach to eradicating malignant cells found in cancerous tumors was first introduced during the late 1800s and is currently used with curative intent or for palliation in approximately half of all cancer patients. Radiotherapy remains a component of the standard of care for most locally advanced solid tumors. Local recurrence remains a major obstacle to achieving cure of many locally advanced solid tumors treated with definitive radiation therapy. This local recurrence translates directly into poor likelihood of long-term survival.\n\n\nThe ability of radiation therapy to eradicate malignant cells critically depends upon the intratumoral content of molecular oxygen, a potent radiosensitizer involved in mediating DNA damage. The microenvironment of solid tumors is hypoxic compared with normal tissue, and this hypoxia is associated with decreased radiosensitivity. Recent preclinical data suggest that intratumoral hypoxia, particularly in conjunction with an acid microenvironment, may be directly or indirectly mutagenic. Investigations of the prognostic significance of the pretreatment oxygenation status of tumors in patients with head and neck or cervical cancer have demonstrated that increased hypoxia, typically designated in these studies as pO\n2 \nlevels below 2.5-10 mm Hg, is associated with decreased local tumor control and higher rates of disease and lower overall survival. Hypoxia-directed therapies in the radiation oncology setting include treatment using hyperbaric oxygen, fluosol infusion, carbogen breathing, and electron-affinic and hypoxic-cell sensitizers.\n\n\nThe most well-studied, hypoxia-directed strategy for cancer treatment is the use of electron-affinic radiosensitizers, which mimic the actions of oxygen but are more slowly metabolized. During the past 2 decades, the nitroimidazole compounds misonidazole, nimorazole, and etanidazole have been extensively evaluated by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and the Danish Association of Head and Neck Cancer (DAHANCA) as adjuncts to radiation therapy in carcinomas of the head and neck, cervix, and lung (Grigsby et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1999; 44:513-517; Lee et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1989; 16:465-470; Lee et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1995; 32:567-576; Overgaard et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1989; 16:1069-1072; Overgaard et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1989; 16:1065-1068; Overgaard Int J Radiat Biol 1989; 56:801-811; Overgaard et al. Radiother Oncol 1998; 46:135-146; Wasserman et al. Radiother Oncol 1991; 20(suppl 1):129-135. Most of these studies reported disappointing local control and survival outcomes, but a few recent studies appear to support the use of nitroimidazole compounds with radiation therapy. Other cancer treatment protocols currently employ radiosensitizers activated by ionizing radiation, e.g., X-rays. Examples of X-ray-activated radiosensitizers include, but are not limited to, the following: metronidazole, desmethylmisonidazole, pimonidazole, mitomycin C, RSU 1069, SR 4233, E09, RB 6145, nicotinamide, 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR), 5-iododeoxyuridine (IUdR), bromodeoxycytidine, fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR), hydroxyurea, cisplatin, and therapeutically effective analogs and derivatives of the same.\n\n\nSome therapeutic compounds, which are known as being cytotoxic per se, hence susceptible of being used in the therapy of cancer, are also endowed with radiosensitization activity as they are capable of inducing DNA radiation damage in response to ionizing radiation. So far, the possibility of combining both cytotoxic agents, e.g. a given radiosensitizer and radiotherapy, with the expectation of getting a supra-additive antitumor effect in comparison to the single cytotoxic alone, is of utmost importance in cancer therapy. Among the several compounds endowed with antitumor activity and also known as possessing radiosensitization activity see, for instance, cisplatin, gemcitabine, navelbine, tomudex, nicotinamide, paclitaxel, docetaxel, simvastatin and topotecan.\n\n\nWe have now discovered that the chemotherapeutic activity of certain camptothecin (CPT) derivatives is enhanced by appending various electronic-affinic groups to provide a single compound for use as a chemoradiosensitizer. The compounds of the invention are considerably less toxic than camptothecin and topotecan. This invention defines a new series of radiosensitizing camptothecin derivatives that are useful for treating various types of cancer. We have also discovered that certain known CPT derivatives are useful in the process of sensitizing a subject's tumor cells to radiation, wherein the process comprises administering a CPT derivative to a subject and then exposing the tumor cells in the subject to radiation.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention provides methods of sensitizing tumor cells in a subject to radiation, said method comprising a) administering to the subject in need thereof a camptothecin-based compound comprising one or more radiosensitizing electron-affinic groups; and b) exposing the tumor cells in the subject to a unit dose of radiation.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention provides methods of sensitizing tumor cells to radiation, said method comprising: a) administering to a human or animal subject in need thereof a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof having formula (I), below, and b) exposing the subject to a unit dose of ionizing radiation.

Overview\n\n\nThere are several aspects to this invention. One is based on the discovery that certain known camptothecin-based compounds are useful for treating a neoplasm in mammalian subjects by administering such compound to the subjects in combination with radiotherapy, i.e., the treatment of tumors with radioactive substances or radiation from a source external to the subject. Another aspect is based on the discovery that camptothecin-based compounds can be modified by positioning at least one electron-affinic group around the camptothecin structure to enhance their value in combination with radiotherapy. Another aspect of the invention is based on the discovery of certain novel compounds that are useful for treating cancer by administering the novel compounds alone or in combination with radiotherapy. These discoveries lead to other aspects of the invention discussed hereinafter.\n\n\n2. Definitions\n\n\nThe term “radiosensitizer” refers to a compound or medicament which is capable of increasing the sensitivity of a tumor cell to ionizing radiation, thus improving the likelihood of tumor cell destruction upon exposure to such radiation.\n\n\nThe term “ionizing radiation” is the one conventionally adopted in the therapeutic field of cancer treatment and includes photons having enough energy for chemical bond ionization such as, for instance, α, β and γ rays (also known as alpha, beta, and gamma rays) from radioactive nuclei as well as x-rays. The radiation may be high-LET (linear energy transfer) or low-LET. LET is the energy transferred per unit length of the distance. High LET is said to be densely ionizing radiation and Low LET is said to be sparsely ionizing radiation. Representative examples of high-LET are neutrons and α particles. Representative examples of low-LET are x-ray and γ rays. Low LET radiation including both x-rays and γ rays is most commonly used for radiotherapy of cancer patients. The radiation may be used for external radiation therapy that is usually given on an outpatient basis or for internal radiation therapy that uses radiation that is placed very close to or inside the tumor. In case of internal radiation therapy, the radiation source is usually sealed in a small holder called an implant. Implants may be in the form of thin wires, plastic tubes called catheters, ribbons, capsules, or seeds. The implant is put directly into the body. Internal radiation therapy may require a hospital stay. The ionizing radiation source is provided as a unit dose of radiation and is preferably an x-ray tube since it provides many advantages, such as convenient adjustable dosing where the source may be easily turned on and off, minimal disposal problems, and the like. A unit dose of radiation is generally measured in gray (Gy). The ionizing radiation source may also comprise a radioisotope, such as a solid radioisotopic source (e.g., wire, strip, pellet, seed, bead, or the like), or a liquid radioisotopic filled balloon. In the latter case, the balloon has been specially configured to prevent leakage of the radioisotopic material from the balloon into the body lumen or blood stream. Still further, the ionizing radiation source may comprise a receptacle in the catheter body for receiving radioisotopic materials like pellets or liquids. The radioisotopic material may be selected to emit α, β and γ radiation. Usually, α and β radiation are preferred since they may be quickly absorbed by surrounding tissue and will not penetrate substantially beyond the wall of the body lumen being treated. Accordingly, incidental irradiation of the heart and other organs adjacent to the treatment region can be substantially eliminated. The total number of units provided will be an amount determined to be therapeutically effective by one skilled in treatment using ionizing radiation. This amount will vary with the subject and the malignant cells or neoplasm being treated. The amount may vary but a patient may receive a dosage of about 30-75 Gy over several weeks.\n\n\nThe term “anti-neoplastic effect” refers to inhibiting or retarding the growth of a malignant cell, or in the case of a subject having a malignant tumor, the rate of tumor growth is decreased, the volume of such tumor is reduced, or the tumor is eliminated entirely.\n\n\nThe term “electron-affinic” refers to an attraction a moiety has for electrons that causes the affinic moiety to enter into and remain in chemical combination with one or more electrons. Typically an electron-affinic moiety is chemically reducible (i.e. an oxidizing group). Representative electron affinic moieties are presented herein.\n\n\n“Synergistic,” as used herein, means that the therapeutic results from treatment of a neoplasm in a subject with (i) a radiosensitizer in combination with (ii) ionizing radiation are improved over what would be obtained by summing the results of (i) alone with (ii) alone. The improvement may be better anti-neoplastic effect or other beneficial results.\n\n\nThe term “CPT” is an abbreviation for camptothecin, also known as (S)-4-ethyl-4-hydroxy-1H-pyrano-[3′,4′:6,7]indolizino[1,2-b]quinoline-3,14(4H,12H)-dione. The compound is readily available from numerous sources, e.g., Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. The chemical formula of camptothecin and its numbering system are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the structure above and in the rest of the application the wedged bond (for example, the bond showing attachment of hydroxyl group at C20) indicates its attachment to a chiral carbon and is coming out of the plane. Analogously, a dotted bond indicates its attachment to a chiral carbon and it is going into the plane. The compound has a hydroxy at the 20-position that is esterified to make the compounds of this invention.\n\n\nThe term “alkyl” refers to a monovalent, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having the indicated number of carbon atoms. For example, a “C 1-6 alkyl” or an “alkyl of 1-6 carbons” or “Alk 1-6” would refer to any alkyl group containing one to six carbons in the structure. “C 1-20 alkyl” refers to any alkyl group having one to twenty carbons. Alkyl may be a straight chain (i.e. linear) or a branched chain. Lower alkyl refers to an alkyl of 1-6 carbons. Representative examples of lower alkyl radicals include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, isopentyl, amyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, tert-pentyl and the like. Higher alkyl refers to alkyls of seven carbons and above. These include n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl, n-decyl, n-dodecyl, n-tetradecyl, n-hexadecyl, n-octadecyl, n-eicosyl, and the like, along with branched variations thereof. The radical may be optionally substituted with substituents at positions that do not significantly interfere with the preparation of compounds falling within the scope of this invention and that do not significantly reduce the efficacy of the compounds. The alkyl is optionally substituted with one to five substituents independently selected from the group consisting of halo, lower alkoxy, hydroxy, cyano, nitro, phenyl, amino, halogenated lower alkyl, halogenated lower alkoxy, hydroxycarbonyl, lower alkoxycarbonyl, lower alkylcarbonyloxy, and lower alkylcarbonylamino.\n\n\nThe term “Alkylene” refers to divalent saturated aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups preferably having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms that are either straight-chained (linear) or branched. This term is exemplified by linear groups such as methylene (—CH\n2\n—), ethylene (—CH\n2\nCH\n2\n—), n-propylene (—CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n—) and branched groups such as iso-propylene (—CH\n2\nCH(CH\n3\n)—) or (—CH(CH\n3\n)CH\n2\n—) and the like.\n\n\nThe term “alkoxy” refers to a monovalent radical of the formula RO—, where R is an alkyl as defined herein.

While known cycloalkyl compounds may have up to 30 or more carbon atoms, generally there will be three to seven carbons in the ring. The latter include, for example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and cycloheptyl. The radical may be optionally substituted with substituents at positions that do not significantly interfere with the preparation of compounds falling within the scope of this invention and that do not significantly reduce the efficacy of the compounds.

Examples of such a 2-ring system include quinoline, isoquinoline, purine, indolizine, 4H-quinolizine, 3H-pyrrolizine, coumaran, coumarin, isocoumarin, 4-methylcoumarin, 3-chloro-H-methylcoumarin, chromone, benzofuran, benzothiophene, benzothiazole, indole, and the like. A 3-ring system will generally have 12 to 14 atoms included in the ring. Examples of such a 3-ring system include carbazole, acridine, and the like. A 4-ring fused system will generally have 16 to 18 atoms included in the chain. Examples of such a 4-ring system include isothebaine and the like. The radical may be optionally substituted with substituents at positions that do not significantly interfere with the preparation of compounds falling within the scope of this invention and that do not significantly reduce the efficacy of the compounds. The radical is optionally substituted with one to five substituents independently selected from the group consisting of halo, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, hydroxy, cyano, nitro, phenyl, amino, halogenated lower alkyl, halogenated lower alkoxy, hydroxycarbonyl, lower alkoxycarbonyl, lower alkylcarbonyloxy, lower alkylcarbonylamino, sugar and phosphosugar.\n\n\nOther chemical terms are given their standard meaning as understood by one of skill in the art with guidance from standard texts and dictionaries. Under standard nomenclature used throughout this disclosure, the terminal portion of the substituent is described first, followed by adjacent functionality toward the point of attachment. Thus, for example, a “aminocarbonyl” group refers to a —C(O)NH\n2 \ngroup, a “loweralkoxymethyl” group refers to a —CH\n2\n(loweralkoxy) group, a “amino lower alkoxy” group refers to a -(loweralkoxy)amino group, etc.\n\n\n3. Method of Treatment of the Invention\n\n\na. Types of Cancer Treated\n\n\nThis invention relates to the treatment of cancer. More specifically, the invention is directed to the treatment of a subject, particularly a mammal such as a human, having a neoplasm by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a novel compound of formula (II) to the subject for a period of time sufficient to produce an anti-neoplastic result. The treatment may optionally include the step of directing ionizing radiation to the neoplasm. The neoplasm may also be treated by administering a CPT-based compound as described herein, and exposing the neoplasm to an effective amount of ionizing radiation, i.e. at least a unit dose.\n\n\nThe term cancer is to be considered in the broadest general definition as a malignant neoplasm, an abnormal mass of tissue, the growth of which exceeds and is uncoordinated with that of normal tissues and persists in the same excessive manner after cessation of the stimuli that evoked the change. It might be added that the abnormal mass is purposeless, preys on the host, and is virtually autonomous. A cancer can also be considered as a malignant tumor. A further discussion of neoplasia is found at “Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease,” Sixth Edition, by R. S. Cotran, V. Kumar, and T. Collins, Chapter 8 (W.B. Saunders Company). This information from \nChapter\n 8 is incorporated herein by reference. The following Table 1 provides examples of the types of cancers, i.e., malignant tumors or neoplasia that may be treated by administering a compound of this invention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTissue of Origin\n\n\nMalignant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComposed of One Parenchymal Cell Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMesenchymal tumors\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnective tissue and derivatives\n\n\nFibrosarcoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLiposarcoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nChondrosarcoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOsteogenic sarcoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndothelial and related tissues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood vessels\n\n\nAngiosarcoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLymph vessels\n\n\nLymphangiosarcoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynovium\n\n\nSynovial sarcoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMesothelium\n\n\nMesothelioma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrain coverings\n\n\nInvasive meningioma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood cells and related cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHematopoietic cells\n\n\nLeukemias\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLymphoid tissue\n\n\nMalignant lymphomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuscle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmooth\n\n\nLeiomyosarcoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStriated\n\n\nRhabdomyosarcoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpithelial tumors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStratified squamous\n\n\nSquamous cell or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nepidermoid carcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasal cells of skin or adnexa\n\n\nBasal cell carcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpithelial lining\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlands or ducts\n\n\nAdenocarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPapillary carcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCystadenocarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRespiratory passages\n\n\nBronchogenic carcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBronchial adenoma (carcinoid)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeuroectoderm\n\n\nMalignant melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenal epithelium\n\n\nRenal cell carcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiver cells\n\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrinary tract epithelium (transitional)\n\n\nTransitional cell carcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlacental epithelium (trophoblast)\n\n\nChoriocarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesticular epithelium (germ cells)\n\n\nSeminoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEmbryonal carcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Than One Neoplastic Cell-Mixed Tumors,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsually Derived From One Germ Layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalivary glands\n\n\nMalignant mixed tumor of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsalivary gland origin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreast\n\n\nMalignant cystosarcoma phyllodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenal anlage\n\n\nWilms tumor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Than One Neoplastic Cell Type Derived\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom More Than One Germ Layer-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeratogenous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotipotential cells in gonads or in\n\n\nImmature teratoma,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nembryonic rests\n\n\nteratocarcinoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb. Treatment with Drug Alone\n\n\nThe novel compounds of the invention are thus useful in the treatment of a neoplasm, e.g. leukemia and solid tumors, such as colon, colo-rectal, ovarian, mammary, prostate, lung, kidney and also melanoma tumors. The dosage range adopted will depend on the route of administration and on the age, weight and condition of the patient being treated. The compounds may be administered, for example, by the parenteral route, for example, intramuscularly, intravenously or by bolus infusion.\n\n\nAs used herein, a patient or subject is a vertebrate having cancer or other diseases. Preferably, the subject is a warm-blooded animal, particularly a mammal which includes both human and non-human mammals. Examples of non-human mammals include but are not limited to farm animals, such as cows, sheep, pigs, goats, horses, and llama, and pets, such as dogs and cats. More preferably, the subject is a human. The compounds are shown herein as Formula II and are described in more detail hereinafter. For this aspect of the invention, a therapeutically effective amount of the compound is administered to a subject in need thereof for a period of time sufficient to obtain an antineoplastic effect.\n\n\nWith mammals, including humans, the effective amounts can be administered on the basis of body surface area. The interrelationship of dosages varies for animals of various sizes and species, and for humans (based on mg/m\n2 \nof body surface) is described by E. J. Freireich et al., Cancer Chemother. Rep., 50(4):219 (1966). Body surface area may be approximately determined from the height and weight of an individual (see, e.g., Scientific Tables, Geigy Pharmaceuticals, Ardsley, N.Y. pp. 537-538 (1970)). A suitable dose range is from 1 to 1000 mg of equivalent per m\n2 \nbody surface area of a compound of the invention, for instance from 50 to 500 mg/m\n2\n.\n\n\nc. Treatment with Drug and Radiotherapy\n\n\nAnother aspect of this invention is a method of treating a neoplasm in a subject, which method comprises a) administering to the subject a compound of formula (I) as described herein, and b) exposing the subject's neoplasm to ionizing radiation. The compound is generally administered in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable excipient in accordance with a treatment schedule.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “treatment schedule” refers to the amount, order and timing in which the subject is administered a camptothecin-based compound and exposed to a unit dose of ionizing radiation. The drug administration and radiation exposure may not necessarily be carried out sequentially. Radiation exposure can be carried out after a single dose or after multiple doses of a camptothecin-based compound in order to get the optimum results. For all of the administering routes, the exact timing of administration of the dosages as well as exposure to radiation can be varied to achieve optimal results. Generally, if using \nIntralipid\n 20 as the carrier for the CPT derivative, the actual dosage of CPT derivative reaching the patient will be less. This is due to some loss of the CPT derivative on the walls of the syringes, needles and preparation vessels, which is prevalent with the \nIntralipid\n 20 suspension. When a carrier, such as cottonseed oil is used, this above described loss is not so prevalent because the CPT derivative does not adhere as much to the surface of syringes, etc. One of skill in the art would routinely alter the amounts in view of such loss of drug to syringe walls, etc.\n\n\nAnother important feature of the method provided by the present invention relates to the relatively low apparent overall toxicity of the CPT derivatives administered in accordance with the teachings herein. Overall toxicity can be judged using various criteria. For example, loss of body weight in a subject over 10% of the initially recorded body weight (i.e., before treatment) can be considered as one sign of toxicity. In addition, loss of overall mobility and activity and signs of diarrhea or cystitis in a subject can also be interpreted as evidence of toxicity.\n\n\nAnother aspect of this invention is a method for treating cancer in a warm-blooded animal, which method comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention as defined herein. A compound useful in this invention is administered to an appropriate subject in need of these compounds in a therapeutically effective dose by a medically acceptable route of administration such as orally, parentally (e.g., intramuscularly, intravenously, subcutaneously, interperitoneally), transdermally, rectally, by inhalation and the like.\n\n\nAnother aspect of this invention is the use of a camptothecin-based compound, as identified herein, for the preparation of a pharmaceutical for the treatment of a neoplasm in a subject in combination with radiotherapy.\n\n\nd. Sensitizing Cells\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention is a method of sensitizing tumor cells to radiation, said method comprising: a) administering to a human or animal subject in need thereof a compound comprising a camptothecin derivative comprising one or more radiosensitizing electron-affinic groups; and b) exposing said subject to a unit dose of radiation. In some embodiments, steps a) and b) are applied according to a treatment schedule effective to produce a synergistic anti-neoplastic effect. Preferably at least one of the radiosensitizing electron-affinic groups is a nitro-substituted carbocyclic or a nitro-substituted heterocyclic aromatic moiety that is attached to the C5, C7, C9, C10, C11, C12 or C20 position of the CPT. The radio sensitizing compounds of the present invention are prepared by linking the “electron-affinic group” to the C5, C7, C9, C10, C11, C12 or C20 carbons of the core of the camptothecin derivative. The length and nature of the linker between the camptothecin and the “electron-affinic group” may be altered. In some embodiments, the carbocyclic or heterocyclic moiety is aromatic and is preferably at the C7, C9, C10, C11, C12 or C20 position. In some preferred embodiments, the carbocyclic or heterocyclic moiety is (+) or (−)-2-(2,4,5,7-tetranitro-9-fluorenylideneaminooxy)-propionic acid (TAPA) or 2-(2,4,5,7-tetranitro-9-fluorenylideneaminooxy)-ethanoic acid.\n\n\nRadiosensitizers by definition increase the sensitivity of cancerous cells to the toxic effects of ionizing radiation. While not wanting to be limited to any particular theory, several mechanisms for the mode of action of radiosensitizers have been suggested. Hypoxic cell radiosensitizers (e.g., 2-nitroimidazole compounds, and benzotriazine dioxide compounds) promote reoxygenation of hypoxic tissue and/or catalyze generation of damaging oxygen radicals. Nonhypoxic cell radiosensitizers (e.g., halogenated pyrimidines) can be analogs of DNA bases and preferentially incorporate into the DNA of cancer cells and thereby promote the radiation ion-induced breaking of DNA molecules and/or prevent the normal DNA repair mechanisms. Various other potential mechanisms of action have been hypothesized for radiosensitizers in the treatment of disease. A discussion of radiosensitizer agents is provided in Rowinsky-E K, Oncology-Huntingt., October 1999; 13 (10 Suppl 5): 61-70; Chen-A Y et al., Oncology-Huntingt. October 1999; 13 (10 Suppl 5): 39-46; Choy-H, Oncology-Huntingt. October 1999; 13 (10 Suppl 5): 23-38; and Herscher-L L et al, Oncology-Huntingt. October 1999; 13 (10 Suppl 5): 11-22.\n\n\nA method is also provided for killing tumor cells in a warm-blooded animal which includes the steps of administering to the warm-blooded animal a pharmaceutical composition as described above in an amount effective to radiosensitize the tumor cells, followed by, after a time interval sufficient to enhance radiosensitization of the tumor cells, irradiating the tumor cells with a dose of radiation effective to kill the tumor cells.\n\n\nAfter administration of the radiosensitizing composition to the tumor cells and the passage of a time interval sufficient to enhance radiosensitization of the tumor cells, the tumor cells are irradiated with a dose of radiation effective to destroy the tumor cells. Generally, the patient will receive a total radiation dosage of about 60 to 76 Gy over seven to eight weeks, each individual radiation dose to be given within approximately 1 to 4 hours after administration of the radiosensitizer. Such sequences of radiosensitization treatments and irradiation are repeated as needed to abate and, optimally, reduce or eliminate, the spread of the malignancy.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention provides methods of sensitizing tumor cells to radiation, said method comprising: a) administering to a human or animal subject in need thereof a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof having formula (I), below, and b) exposing the subject to a unit dose of ionizing radiation. In other aspect, this invention provides a method where steps a) and b) are applied to a treatment schedule effective to produce a synergistic anti-neoplastic effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein W is alkyl-C(O)—, or R\n1\nY-L-C(O), provided that when W is alkyl-C(O)—, at least one of R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, or R\n6 \nis nitro;\n\n\nL is a bond or linear alkylene (1-8) group, optionally substituted with lower alkyl or substituted lower alkyl, wherein one or two methylene (—CH\n2\n—) units of the linear alkylene group is optionally replaced with O, S or NH;\n\n\nY is ═NO—, —N(H)O—, ═N—, —NR—, O, S, or a bond;\n\n\nR is H, alkyl, or substituted alkyl;\n\n\nR\n1 \nis optionally substituted carbocyclic, heterocyclic, or fused 2-, 3- or 4-ring heterocyclic;\n\n\nR\n2 \nis hydrogen, halo, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, hydroxy, R\nQ\nY, R\nQ\nY-L-C(O)O—, cyano, nitro, amino, halogenated lower alkyl, halogenated lower alkoxy, hydroxycarbonyl, formyl, lower alkoxycarbonyl, tri lower alkylsilyl, lower alkylcarbonyloxy, lower alkoxycarbonyloxy, sugar, phosphosugar, O-quinone, substituted lower alkyl aminomethyl, lower alkylcarbonylamino, lower alkylcarbonyloxy methyl, optionally substituted lower alkylcarbonyloxy methyl, substituted vinyl, 1-hydroxy-2-nitroethyl, alkoxycarbonylethyl, aminocarbonyl, alkylcarbonyl, benzoylmethyl, benzylcarbonyloxymethyl, lower alkyliminomethyl or lower alkoxymethyl;\n\n\nR\n3 \nis hydrogen, halo, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, hydroxy, R\nQ\nY-L-C(O)O—, cyano, nitro, amino, halogenated lower alkyl, halogenated lower alkoxy, hydroxycarbonyl, formyl, lower alkoxycarbonyl, CH\n2\nNR\n7\nR\n8 \n(where each of R\n7 \nand R\n8 \nis independently H, alkyl of 1-6 carbons, optionally substituted phenyl, hydroxy lower alkyl, amino lower alkyl, or mono- or dialkylamino lower alkyl, or R\n7 \nand R\n8 \ntaken together with —N— represent a cyclic amino-), CH\n2\nR\n9 \n(where R\n9 \nis lower alkoxy, cyano, amino lower alkoxy, mono- or di-lower alkylamino lower alkoxy, lower alkylthio, amino lower alkylthio, or mono- or di-lower alkylamino lower alkylthio), NR\n10\nR\n11 \n(where each of R\n10 \nand R\n11 \nis independently hydrogen, lower alkyl, phenyl, hydroxy lower alkyl, or amino lower alkyl, or R\n10 \nand R\n11 \ntaken together with —N— represent a cyclic amino), trialkylsilyl, dialkylamino alkyl, lower alkylcarbonyloxy, lower alkoxycarbonyloxy, sugar, phosphosugar, O-quinone, substituted lower alkyl aminomethyl, or lower alkylcarbonylamino or R\n3 \ntogether with R\n4 \nis furan, dihydrofuran or 1,4-oxazine-2-one;

Synthesis of Compounds of the Invention\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention are prepared by reacting a known camptothecin-based compound having a free hydroxyl or an amine group with an appropriate electron-affinic moiety. Many camptothecin-based compounds are generally available in the art and would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nAs Camptothecin (CPT) exhibits antineoplastic activity, several synthetic and semisynthetic analogs of CPT have been reported in the literature. A number of attempts have been made not only to reduce its toxicity while maintaining antitumor activity by converting CPT into its derivatives but also to make it more water soluble by chemical modifications. Scientists continue to develop analogs in order to improve the pharmacokinetics, drug resistance, clinical efficacy, and toxicity profile of CPT. Based on the knowledge about total synthesis and semi-synthesis of CPT analogs, there are numerous possible ways of attaching electron-affinic groups at various positions on the CPT molecule. The radiosensitizing compounds of this invention can be prepared by linking the electron-affinic group to any of the C5, C7, C9, C10, C11, C12 or C20 carbons of CPT using a variety of methods. The following Schemes 1 to 7 demonstrate a few representative examples of the same.\n\n\nC20 Analogs\n\n\nCompounds having electron-affinic groups at C20 may be prepared by reacting CPT or a CPT analog with a carboxylic acid of the formula R\n1\nY-(T)\nn\n-X—COOH wherein R\n1\n, Y, (T)\nn\n, and X are as defined herein.\n\n\nFor example, an electron-affinic group, such as tetranitrofluorene, can be attached to the 20 position via an ester linkage by treating a CPT analog with 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and (+)-2-(2,4,5,7-tetranitro-9-fluorenylideneaminooxy)-propionic acid (TAPA) (commercially available from Wiley) in dry methylene chloride at room temperature to provide the ester 1.1 as shown below (Scheme 1). Optionally the imine double bond in ester 1.1 can be reacted with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride (NaBH\n4\n) to give the amine 1.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above reaction can be carried out with a suitable CPT analog that is substituted at any of the 5, 7, 9, 10, 11 or 12 positions. The CPT analog may be substituted with substituents known in the art or that can be prepared by one of skill in the art.

and the like.\n \n\n\nIt will be recognized by one of skill in the art that other similar compounds may be prepared by following the teachings set forth in the above articles and modifying with appropriate art-recognized steps.\n\n\nSeveral other derivatives of tetranitrofluorene similarly can be attached at the 20 position of CPT or a CPT analog. These tetranitrofluorenes can be synthesized in one step via condensation of tetranitrofluoren-9-one (commercially available from Aldrich) and an amine of the formula NH\n2\n—O-(T)\nn\n-X—COOH, wherein (T)\nn \nand X are as defined herein. The imine 2.1 then reacts with CPT or a CPT analog to give the C20 esters 2.2, wherein R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, and R\n6 \nare as defined herein (Scheme 2). Optionally, the imine double bond in ester 2.2 can be reacted with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride (NaBH\n4\n) to give the amine 2.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, other electron-affinic groups such as nitroimidazole, nitrotriazole, nitrothiazole, etc. can be linked at the 20 position of CPT or CPT analogs. Thus, coupling of CPT or a CPT analog with CDI (1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole) followed by reaction of the intermediate 20-carbonylimidazolide with alcohols gives analogs where the radiosensitizing group is attached via a carbonate linkage (X═O). The length and nature of the linker between CPT and the electron-affinic group may be altered. It is possible to prepare analogs in which electron-affinic group is either closer or further away from the CPT molecule. For example, reaction with 4-nitrobenzoic acid gives the corresponding 4-nitrobenzoate 3.1 where the electron-affinic group is very close to the CPT molecule. While reaction with CDI (for conditions, see US Pub. No. US 2002/0040155 A1) followed by 2-(2-nitro-imidazol-1-yl)ethanol gives the corresponding carbonate 3.2 where the electron-affinic group is away from the CPT molecule. It is also possible to prepare analogs with multiple radiosensitizing groups attached to a single linker. For example, reaction of 2-nitroimidazole with glycidyl chloride provides alcohol A (US Pub. No. US 2002/0040155 A1) which then reacts with CPT to give a carbonate 3.3 containing 2 radiosensitizing groups linked at C20 (Scheme 3).\n\n\nThe structure of CPT is shown in the following schemes as:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFor analogs of CPT, the structure is shown as above and the additional substituent is shown with its position on the CPT molecule.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nC9 and C10 Analogs\n\n\n\nElectron-affinic groups also can be linked at 9 or 10 positions. Condensation of 9- or 10-amino CPT (J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 2689-2700) with nitro-substituted ketones gives the corresponding imines. For example, 2,4,5,7-tetranitrofluoren-9-one (commercially available from Aldrich) gives the corresponding imine 4.1 with radiosensitizing tetranitrofluorenyl group at 9 or 10 position (Scheme 4). Reduction of the double bond in imine 4.1 with reducing agents such as NaBH\n4 \nfollowed by acylation of 20-hydroxy group with acyl halide gives the amine 4.2. Several other nitroaldehydes or nitroketones also react similarly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, 9- or 10-hydroxy CPT (J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 2689-2700) can be converted to the corresponding phenolic esters containing electron-affinic groups. Depending on the polarity of solvent used (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003, 13, 3739-3741), either mono- or di-ester is formed (Scheme 5). The carboxylic acids 2.1 used in \nScheme\n 2 react with either 9- or 10-hydroxy CPT in presence of 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl-carbodiimide (EDCI) in a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF) to give the corresponding mono-esters 5.1. Alternatively, if the reaction is carried out in a nonpolar solvent such as methylene chloride, the corresponding di-esters 5.2 are formed. The imine bond in mono-ester 5.1 on reduction with reducing agents such as NaBH\n4 \nfollowed by acylation of 20-hydroxy group with acyl halide gives the corresponding amine 5.3. The imine bond in di-ester 5.2 on reduction with reducing agents such as NaBH\n4 \ngives the corresponding amine 5.4. Similarly, other carboxylic acids containing electron-affinic groups can be used in this reaction. Also, CPT analogs that contain 9- or 10-hydroxy group and additional substituents in the molecule can also be converted to their di-esters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nC7 Analogs\n\n\n\nThe 7-hydroxyalkyl CPT analogs, where R′ is alkylene (Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1991, 39(10) 2574-2580) can be similarly acylated as shown above for the 9- or 10-hydroxy analogs, using carboxylic acids 2.1 to give the corresponding mono-esters 6.1 or di-esters 6.2 (Scheme 6). The imine bond in mono-ester 6.1 on reduction with reducing agents such as NaBH\n4 \nfollowed by acylation of 20-hydroxy group with acyl halide gives the corresponding amine 6.3. The imine bond in di-ester 6.2 on reduction with reducing agents such as NaBH\n4 \ngives the corresponding amine 6.4. Similarly, other carboxylic acids containing electron-affinic groups can be used in this reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nC11 and C12 Analogs\n\n\n\n11- or 12-hydroxy CPT can be converted to the corresponding phenolic esters containing the electron-affinic groups at 11 or 12 positions. 11-hydroxy CPT is known in the literature (U.S. Pat. No. 4,604,463). Starting with 12-amino CPT (J. Med. Chem. 1986, 29, 2358 and J. Med. Chem. 1987, 30, 1774), the corresponding 12-hydroxy CPT can be synthesized using the known two-step method (U.S. Pat. No. 4,604,463). The 11- or 12-hydroxy CPT are similarly acylated as shown above for the 7, 9, or 10-hydroxy analogs, using carboxylic acids 2.1 to give the corresponding mono-esters 7.1 or di-esters 7.2 (Scheme 7). The imine bond in mono-ester 7.1 on reduction with reducing agents such as NaBH\n4 \nfollowed by acylation of 20-hydroxy group with acyl halide gives the corresponding amine 7.3. The imine bond in di-ester 7.2 on reduction with reducing agents such as NaBH\n4 \ngives the corresponding amine 7.4. Similarly, other carboxylic acids containing electron-affinic groups can be used in this reaction. Also, CPT analogs that contain 11 or 12-hydroxy group and additional substituents in the molecule can also be used in this reaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the reactions shown in Scheme 3 can also be applied for 7, 9, 10, 1, or 12-hydroxy CPT to give the corresponding CPT analogs containing various other electron-affinic groups.\n\n\nC5 Analogs\n\n\nThe semi-synthesis of 5-substituted CPT analogs has been reported in the literature (Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 1995, 5(1), 77-82 and Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 1999; 9(12), 1633-1638). One 5-substituted CPT analog, 5-(2-hydroxyethoxy) CPT (The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 2004, 44, 723-736), is already in clinical trials. Using the synthetic strategy reported in the above-mentioned references, electron affinic groups can be linked to the 5 position of a CPT molecule or analog.\n\n\nSeveral other CPT analogs containing sugar, phosphosugar, or O-quinone moiety at C5, C7, C9, C10, C11, C12, or C20 position can also be prepared by attaching those moieties via an ether linkage. These analogs can be obtained via one step coupling reaction of the corresponding hydroxy CPT analog, with a sugar, a phosphosugar, or a quinone respectively. Representative examples of sugar and phosphosugar are given in the definition section above. Representative examples of quinone include, but are not limited to, unsubstituted and optionally substituted benzoquinones, unsubstituted and optionally substituted naphthoquinones, etc. For example, an unsubstituted benzoquinone can be attached at C9 of CPT via an ether linkage by coupling of 9-hydroxy CPT with 2-chlorobenzoquinone (commercially available at Sigma-Aldrich). Other examples of commercially available quinones at Sigma-Aldrich include, but are not limited to, 2,3-Dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone, 2,5-Dibromo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, and 2,3-Dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone, etc.\n\n\n6. Pharmaceutical Composition of the Invention\n\n\nThis aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition useful for treating cancer in a warm-blooded animal, which composition comprises a compound of the invention, as defined by formula II herein, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The composition is prepared in accordance with known formulation techniques to provide a composition suitable for oral, topical, transdermal, rectal, inhalation, or parenteral (intravenous, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal) administration, and the like. Detailed guidance for preparing compositions of the invention are found by reference to the 18\nth \nor 19\nth \nEdition of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Published by the Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. 18040. The pertinent portions are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nUnit doses or multiple dose forms are contemplated, each offering advantages in certain clinical settings. The unit dose would contain a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired effect(s) in the setting of treating cancer. The multiple dose form may be particularly useful when multiples of single doses, or fractional doses, are required to achieve the desired ends. Either of these dosing forms may have specifications that are dictated by or directly dependent upon the unique characteristic of the particular compound, the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and any limitations inherent in the art of preparing the particular compound for treatment of cancer.\n\n\nA unit dose will contain a therapeutically effective amount sufficient to treat cancer in a subject and may contain from about 1.0 to 1000 mg of compound, for example about 50 to 500 mg.\n\n\nThe compound will preferably be administered orally in a suitable formulation as an ingestible tablet, a buccal tablet, capsule, caplet, elixir, suspension, syrup, trouche, wafer, lozenge, and the like. Generally, the most straightforward formulation is a tablet or capsule (individually or collectively designated as an “oral dosage unit”). Suitable formulations are prepared in accordance with a standard formulating techniques available that match the characteristics of the compound to the excipients available for formulating an appropriate composition. A tablet or capsule will contain about 50 to about 500 mg of a compound of Formula (I).\n\n\nThe form may deliver a compound rapidly or may be a sustained-release preparation. The compound may be enclosed in a hard or soft capsule, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated with beverages, food or otherwise into the diet. The percentage of the final composition and the preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently range between 1 and 90% of the weight of the final form, e.g., tablet. The amount in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained. Preferred compositions according to the current invention are prepared so that an oral dosage unit form contains between about 5 to about 50% by weight (% w) in dosage units weighing between 50 and 1000 mg.\n\n\nThe suitable formulation of an oral dosage unit may also contain: a binder, such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch, gelatin; sweetening agents such as lactose or sucrose; disintegrating agents such as corn starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; or flavoring such a peppermint, oil of wintergreen or the like. Various other material may be present as coating or to otherwise modify the physical form of the oral dosage unit. The oral dosage unit may be coated with shellac, a sugar or both. Syrup or elixir may contain the compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as a preservative, a dye and flavoring. Any material utilized should be pharmaceutically-acceptable and substantially non-toxic. Details of the types of excipients useful may be found in the nineteenth edition of “Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy,” Mack Printing Company, Easton, Pa. See particularly chapters 91-93 for a fuller discussion.\n\n\nA compound may be administered parenterally, e.g., intravenously, intramuscularly, intravenously, subcutaneously, or interperitonically. The carrier or excipient or excipient mixture can be a solvent or a dispersive medium containing, for example, various polar or non-polar solvents, suitable mixtures thereof, or oils. As used herein “carrier” or “excipient” means a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and includes any and all solvents, dispersive agents or media, coating(s), antimicrobial agents, iso/hypo/hypertonic agents, absorption-modifying agents, and the like. The use of such substances and the agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, use in therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Moreover, other or supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the final composition.\n\n\nSolutions of the compound may be prepared in suitable diluents such as water, ethanol, glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycol(s), various oils, and/or mixtures thereof, and others known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile solutions, dispersions, emulsions, and sterile powders. The final form must be stable under conditions of manufacture and storage. Furthermore, the final pharmaceutical form must be protected against contamination and must, therefore, be able to inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria or fungi. A single intravenous or intraperitoneal dose can be administered. Alternatively, a slow long term infusion or multiple short term daily infusions may be utilized, typically lasting from 1 to 8 days. Alternate day or dosing once every several days may also be utilized.\n\n\nSterile, injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating a compound in the required amount into one or more appropriate solvents to which other ingredients, listed above or known to those skilled in the art, may be added as required. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients as required. Sterilizing procedures, such as filtration, then follow. Typically, dispersions are made by incorporating the compound into a sterile vehicle which also contains the dispersion medium and the required other ingredients as indicated above. In the case of a sterile powder, the preferred methods include vacuum drying or freeze drying to which any required ingredients are added.\n\n\nIn all cases the final form, as noted, must be sterile and must also be able to pass readily through an injection device such as a hollow needle. The proper viscosity may be achieved and maintained by the proper choice of solvents or excipients. Moreover, the use of molecular or particulate coatings such as lecithin, the proper selection of particle size in dispersions, or the use of materials with surfactant properties may be utilized.\n\n\nPrevention or inhibition of growth of microorganisms may be achieved through the addition of one or more antimicrobial agents such as chlorobutanol, ascorbic acid, parabens, thermerosal, or the like. It may also be preferable to include agents that alter the tonicity such as sugars or salts.\n\n\nIn some cases, e.g., where a compound of the invention is quite water insoluble, it may be useful to provide liposomal delivery. The system restrains the compound of the invention by incorporating, encapsulating, surrounding, or entrapping the compound of the invention in, on, or by lipid vesicles or liposomes, or by micelles.\n\n\nUsefully, the compound of the invention is solubilized in liposomes. The liposomes may include, for example, lipids such as cholesterol, phospholipids, or micelles comprised of surfactant such as, for example, sodium dodecylsulfate, octylphenolpolyoxyethylene glycol, or sorbitan mono-oleate. Typically, the compound of the invention binds to the lipid bilayer membrane of the liposome with high affinity. The liposome bound prodrug can preferably intercalate between the acyl chains of the lipid. The lactone ring of the camptothecin-derivative, membrane-bound compound of the invention is thereby removed from the aqueous environment inside and outside of the liposome and further protected from hydrolysis. Since the liposome-bound drug is protected from hydrolysis, the antitumor activity of the drug is preserved. For a compound of the invention which has a lower affinity for the liposome membrane and thus disassociates from the liposome membrane to reside in the interior of liposome, the pH of the interior of the liposomes may be reduced thereby preventing hydrolysis of such compound of the invention.\n\n\nA useful group of liposomal delivery systems which may be used in accordance with the present invention include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,552,156 and 5,736,156, which are herein incorporated in their entireties by reference. Other liposomal delivery systems which may be employed in accordance with the present invention include liposomes containing active agents aggregated with lipids or surfactants as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,827,533 and 5,882,679; lipid vesicles formed with alkyl ammonium fatty acid salts as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,874,105; liposomes for encapsulating active agent dry powder compositions as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,783,211; liposomal drug delivery systems for topical patches as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,718,914; the liposomes described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,237; the liposome and lipid complex compositions described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,549,910 and 5,077,057; the liposomes used for sustained release of steroidal drugs as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,043,165; the liposomes described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556; and the liposomes described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,161; all of which are herein incorporated in their entireties by reference.\n\n\nUnilamellar liposomes, also referred to as single lamellar vesicles, are spherical vesicles comprised of one lipid bilayer membrane which defines a closed compartment. The bilayer membrane is composed of two layers of lipids; an inner layer and an outer layer. The outer layer of lipid molecules are oriented with their hydrophilic head portions toward the external aqueous environment and their hydrophobic tails pointed downward toward interior of the liposome. The inner layer of lipid lays directly beneath the outer layer; the lipids are oriented with their heads facing the aqueous interior of the liposome and their tails toward the tails of outer layer of lipid.\n\n\nMultilamellar liposomes, also referred to as multilamellar vesicles, are composed of more than one lipid bilayer membrane, which membranes define more than one closed compartment. The membranes are concentrically arranged so that the different membranes are separated by compartments much like an onion skin.\n\n\nThus, some or all of the compound of the invention is located in one or more of the compartments of a liposome or micelle, or the compound of the invention is bound to the membrane of the liposome. Where a compound is bound to a lipid membrane, at least the lactone ring of some or all of the compound of the invention binds to the lipid membrane of the liposome, and where the liposome contains more than one bilayer membrane the compound of the invention is bound to at least 1 membrane. Those compounds of the invention that have a high affinity for such membrane tend to remain bound to the membrane. Those compounds of the invention with a low affinity for liposome membrane, will at least partially disassociate from the liposome membrane and reside in the liposome compartment.\n\n\nMicelles as defined herein are spherical receptacles comprised of a single, monolayer membrane which defines a closed compartment and the membrane is comprised of surfactant molecules oriented so that the hydrocarbon tails are oriented toward the compartment and the polar head portions are oriented toward the external aqueous environment. The compounds of the invention, when associated with micelles, are either in the compartment, bound to the micelle membrane, or bound to the outside surface of the micelle.\n\n\nLiposomes have been used successfully to administer medications to cancer patients, and have been shown to be useful clinically in the delivery of anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and cisplatinum complexes. Forssen, et al., Cancer Res. 1992, 52: 3255-3261; Perex-Soler, et al., Cancer Res. 1990, 50: 4260-4266; and, Khokhar, et al., J. Med. Chem. 1991, 34: 325-329, all of which are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference.\n\n\nSimilarly, micelles have also been used to deliver medications to patients, (Broden et al., Acta Pharm Suec. 19: 267-284 (1982)) and micelles have been used as drug carriers and for targeted drug delivery, (D. D. Lasic, Nature 335: 279-280 (1992); and, Supersaxo et al., Pharm Res. 8: 1280-1291 (1991)), including cancer medications, (Fung et al., Biomater. Artif. Cells. Artif. Organs 16: 439 et seq. (1988); and Yokoyama et al., Cancer Res. 51: 3229-3236 (1991)), all of which are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference.\n\n\nThe liposomes and/or micelles containing the compound of the invention can be administered to a cancer patient, typically intravenously. The liposomes and/or micelles are carried by the circulatory system to the cancer cells where the membrane of the vesicle fuses to the membrane of the cancer cell thereby releasing the compound of the invention to the cancer cell, or where the liposomes and/or micelles to be taken up by the cancer cells, the compound of the invention diffuses from the liposomes and/or micelles to be taken up by the cancer cells.\n\n\nAny lipid mixture of lipids which forms liposomes and/or micelles is suitable for use in the present invention. Phosphatidylcholines, including, for example, L-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DPMC), 1-α-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and L-α-distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) are suitable. Also, phosphatidylglycerols, including, for example, L-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) are suitable. The DMPC and DMPG are both fluid phase at 37, for example, L-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) are suitable. The DMPC and DMPG are both fluid phase at 37° C., while DSPC is solid phase at 37° C. Since the presence of negatively charged lipid in the liposome membrane causes the liposomes to repel each other, small amounts, such as, for example about 10%, of an negatively charged lipid, such as distearolphosphotidylglycerol (DSPG), may be incorporated in to the DSPC liposomes. Other suitable phospholipids include: phosphatidyl-ethanolamides, phosphatidylinositols, and phosphatidic acids containing lauric, myristic, palmitic, paimitoleic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, arachidonic, behenic and lignoceric acid. Another suitable lipid includes cholesterol.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 6,096,336 provides further guidance for preparing liposomal compositions useful in this invention and is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe present invention is not limited in scope by the exemplified embodiments, which are intended as illustrations of single aspects of the invention only. Any methods that are functionally equivalent are within the scope of the invention. Various modifications of the invention in addition to those described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and accompanying figures. Such modifications fall within the scope of the appended claims.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nIn the following descriptions, optical rotations were measured at 20-25° C. with an Atago Polax-2L polarimeter. \n1\nH and \n13\nC spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity Inova NMR Spectrometer operating at 300 and 75 MHz, respectively.

Prior to treatment, the tumor grew exponentially following implantation into the flanks of the mice and reached a diameter of 8 mm (268.08 cu. mm) by day 7 to 10. The mice were injected i.p. with \ncompound\n 13 at MTD using a single injection and then irradiated with a radiation dose of 22 Gy 24 h after the injection. Control groups of mice bearing 8 mm diameter tumors were treated with vehicle alone, or radiation alone, or drug alone. After treatment, tumor sizes were measured by caliper every day. Daily measurement of the tumor diameters (d1, d2) in two orthogonal directions were used to calculate the tumor volume (tumor volume=π/6{(d1+d2)/2}\n3\n) using the approximation that the tumors were spherical (results shown in \nFIG. 1\n). The values of time (days) required to grow the tumor to twice their initial size after various treatments were calculated as tumor doubling time (TDT) (±SE) for evaluating the treatment effects. Survival times and curative effects after treatment were also be observed and recorded.

The MTD40 (maximum tolerated dose at day 40) values were determined. In the consecutive type studies, 6 mice were dosed at moderate doses of 10, 70, or 106.98, or 141.47, or 187.1 mg/kg. If no severe and irreversible toxicity (euthanasia is required) occurred at these doses, additional 6 animals were initiated at a dose which is 1.3225-1.5283 times higher than the previous non-toxic doses. Sequential dosages (261.94, or 366.72, or 500 mg/kg) were increased until severe and irreversible toxicity (whereby euthanasia is required) occurs. If severe and irreversible toxicity was observed at these doses, the drug doses (50, or 30 mg/kg) were reduced. The result of this exercise was two dosages, one apparently nonlethal and the other lethal if severe and irreversible toxicity occurred and euthanasia was required. Six mice were dosed at each dosage. If no severe and irreversible toxicity occurred at the lower dosage and at least one with severe and irreversible toxicity at the higher dose, then the lower dose was considered to the MTD. These new camptothecin analogs were administered to C3H/HeN mice by i.p. injection. Drug toxicity was evaluated on mice, checked daily for 45 days. The toxicity parameters reported were the MTD40. The MTD is defined as the highest dose causing no severe irreversible toxicity in one treatment group, but at least one animal exhibiting severe and irreversible toxicity and being euthanized at next higher dose.

The cells were incubated in a CO\n2 \nincubator at 37° C. for 5 hours for attachment to the bottom of Petri dishes. Drugs were made up fresh in medium at ten times the final concentration, and then 0.3 ml of this stock solution was added to the 2.7 mL of medium containing 5% bovine calf serum (BCS) in the dish. The cells were then incubated with drugs for 72 hours at 37° C. At the end of incubation the drug-containing media were decanted, the dishes were rinsed with 4 ml of Hank's Balance Salt Solution (HBSS), 5 ml of fresh medium containing 15% BCS was added, and the dishes were returned to the incubator for colony formation. The cell colonies stained with methylene blue (0.5% in ethanol) were counted using colony counter after incubation for 8 days for HCT116 cells and PC-3 cells and 9 days for VM46 cells, respectively. Cell survival was calculated and the values of IC50 (the drug concentration producing 50% inhibition of colony formation) were determined for each tested compound. Results are provided in Table 6.

The three compounds that did not display any in vitro chemotherapeutic effect, namely compound 14, \ncompound\n 15, and compound 18, are analogs of Irinotecan: a semisynthetic camptothecin derivative introduced in the 1980's. Irinotecan is a prodrug metabolized by carboxylesterases to an active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38) which then exerts its cytotoxic effect (Ando Y. al. N Engl Med 2002; 346(18):1414-1415). Accordingly, Irinotecan derivatives can be expected not to display any in vitro chemotherapeutic activity but display only in vivo activity after getting metabolized in the body, which is consistent with the lack of in vitro activity seen for the 3 Irinotecan analogs mentioned above."

No. 61/078,302, filed Jul. 3, 2008; to U.S. Ser. No. 61/081,861, filed Jul. 18, 2008. The entire contents of each of these provisional applications are hereby incorporated by reference in the present application.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention relates to a double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) targeting X-Box Protein 1 (XBP-1), and methods of using the dsRNA to inhibit expression of XBP-1.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nX-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that is involved in the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR). XBP-1 is known to be active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER consists of a system of folded membranes and tubules in the cytoplasm of cells. Proteins and lipids are manufactured and processed in the ER. When unusual demands are placed on the ER, “ER stress” occurs. ER stress can be triggered by a viral infection, gene mutations, exposure to toxins, aggregation of improperly folded proteins or a shortage of intracellular nutrients. The result can be Type II diabetes, metabolic syndrome, a neurological disorder or cancer.\n\n\nTwo XBP-1 isoforms are known to exist in cells: spliced XBP-1S and unspliced XBP-1U. Both isoforms of XBP-1 bind to the 21-bp Tax-responsive element of the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) in vitro and transactivate HTLV-1 transcription. HTLV-1 is associated with a rare form of blood dyscrasia known as Adult T-cell Leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and a myelopathy, tropical spastic paresis.\n\n\nDouble-stranded RNA molecules (dsRNA) have been shown to block gene expression in a highly conserved regulatory mechanism known as RNA interference (RNAi). WO 99/32619 (Fire et al.) disclosed the use of a dsRNA of at least 25 nucleotides in length to inhibit the expression of genes in \nC. elegans\n. dsRNA has also been shown to degrade target RNA in other organisms, including plants (see, e.g., WO 99/53050, Waterhouse et al.; and WO 99/61631, Heifetz et al.), \nDrosophila \n(see, e.g., Yang, D., et al., \nCurr. Biol\n. (2000) 10:1191-1200), and mammals (see WO 00/44895, Limmer; and DE 101 00 586.5, Kreutzer et al.).\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention provides compositions containing double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) and methods for inhibiting the expression of an XBP-1 gene in a cell or mammal. The invention also provides compositions and methods for treating pathological conditions and diseases caused by the expression of XBP-1 gene, such as metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes or metabolic syndrome), cardiovascular disease, protein folding diseases or cancer. The dsRNAs included in the compositions featured herein include a dsRNA having an RNA strand (the antisense strand) having a region which is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and is substantially complementary to at least part of an mRNA transcript of the XBP-1 gene.\n\n\nIn one aspect, a dsRNA for inhibiting expression of an XBP-1 gene includes at least two sequences that are complementary to each other. The dsRNA includes a sense strand having a first sequence and an antisense strand having a second sequence. The antisense strand includes a nucleotide sequence that is substantially complementary to at least part of an mRNA encoding XBP-1, and the region of complementarity is less than 30 nucleotides in length, and at least 15 nucleotides in length. Generally, the dsRNA is 19 to 24, e.g., 19 to 21 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments the dsRNA is from about 10 to about 15 nucleotides in length, and in other embodiments the dsRNA is from about 25 to about 30 nucleotides in length. The dsRNA, upon contacting with a cell expressing XBP-1, inhibits the expression of an XBP-1 gene by at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35% or at least 40%, such as when assayed by a method as described herein. In one embodiment, the Factor VII dsRNA is formulated in a stable nucleic acid particle (SNALP).\n\n\nFor example, the dsRNA molecules featured herein can include a first sequence of the dsRNA that is selected from the group consisting of the sense sequences of Tables 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12 and a second sequence that is selected from the group consisting of the antisense sequences of Tables 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12. The dsRNA molecules featured herein can include naturally occurring nucleotides or can include at least one modified nucleotide, such as a 2′-O-methyl modified nucleotide, a nucleotide having a 5′-phosphorothioate group, and a terminal nucleotide linked to a conjugate group, such as to a cholesteryl derivative, to vitamin E, or to a dodecanoic acid bisdecylamide group. Alternatively, the modified nucleotide may be chosen from the group of: a 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro modified nucleotide, a 2′-deoxy-modified nucleotide, a locked nucleotide, an abasic nucleotide, 2′-amino-modified nucleotide, 2′-alkyl-modified nucleotide, morpholino nucleotide, a phosphoramidate, and a non-natural base comprising nucleotide. Generally, such modified sequence will be based on a first sequence of said dsRNA selected from the group consisting of the sense sequences of Tables 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12 and a second sequence selected from the group consisting of the antisense sequences of Tables 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides a cell containing at least one of the dsRNAs featured in the invention. The cell is generally a mammalian cell, such as a human cell.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting the expression of an XBP-1 gene in an organism, generally a human subject. The composition typically includes one or more of the dsRNAs described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or delivery vehicle. In one embodiment, the composition is used for treating cancer, e.g., a cancer of the liver.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method for inhibiting the expression of an XBP-1 gene in a cell by performing the following steps:\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) introducing into the cell a double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA), wherein the dsRNA includes at least two sequences that are complementary to each other. The dsRNA has a sense strand comprising a first sequence and an antisense strand having a second sequence; the antisense strand has a region of complementarity that is substantially complementary to at least a part of a mRNA encoding XBP-1, and where the region of complementarity is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and where the dsRNA, upon contact with a cell expressing the XBP-1, inhibits expression of the XBP-1 gene by at least 20%, at least 30%, or at least 40%; and\n \n(b) maintaining the cell produced in step (a) for a time sufficient to obtain degradation of the mRNA transcript of XBP-1 gene, thereby inhibiting expression of the XBP-1 gene in the cell.\n \n \n \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the method is for inhibiting gene expression in a cell infected with HTLV-1, such as a tumor cell.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods for treating, preventing or managing pathological processes mediated by XBP-1 expression, e.g., a metabolic disease such as diabetes (e.g., Type II diabetes or metabolic syndrome), or cardiovascular disease. The method can include administering to a patient in need of such treatment, prevention or management a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more of the dsRNAs featured in the invention. In one embodiment the patient has metabolic syndrome. For example, a patient with metabolic syndrome can have one of more of high cholesterol, obesity, and/or insulin insensitivity. In some embodiments, a patient with metabolic syndrome will also have heart disease. In another embodiment, the patient has a dyslipidemia or a disorder associated with a dyslipidemia. For example, in one embodiment the patient has atherosclerosis, which is often associated with hypercholesterolemia. In another embodiment, the patient has cancer or a neurological disorder. In yet another embodiment, the patient (e.g., a human patient) is infected with a retrovirus, such as HTLV-1. In another embodiment, the patient has a disorder or condition caused by the HTVL-1, such as a myelopathy, e.g., tropical spastic paresis. In one embodiment, administration of the dsRNA targeting XBP-1 alleviates or relieves the severity of at least one symptom of the XBP-1 mediated disorder in the patient.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention provides a vector for inhibiting the expression of an XBP-1 gene in a cell. In one embodiment, the vector includes at least one regulatory sequence operably linked to a nucleotide sequence that encodes at least one strand of one of a dsRNA featured in the invention.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention provides a cell containing a vector for inhibiting the expression of an XBP-1 gene in a cell.

The invention also provides compositions and methods for treating pathological conditions and diseases, such as a metabolic disease or a cardiovascular disease, in a mammal caused by the expression of the XBP-1 gene. dsRNA directs the sequence-specific degradation of mRNA through a process known as RNA interference (RNAi).\n\n\nThe dsRNAs of the compositions featured herein include an RNA strand (the antisense strand) having a region which is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and is substantially complementary to at least part of an mRNA transcript of the XBP-1 gene. The use of these dsRNAs enables the targeted degradation of mRNAs of genes that are implicated in replication and or maintenance of cancer cells in mammals. Very low dosages of XBP-1 dsRNAs in particular can specifically and efficiently mediate RNAi, resulting in significant inhibition of expression of the XBP-1 gene. The methods and compositions containing the XBP-1 dsRNA are useful for treating pathological processes mediated by XBP-1 expression, e.g., a metabolic disease or cardiovascular disease.\n\n\nThe following detailed description discloses how to make and use the compositions containing dsRNAs to inhibit the expression of the XBP-1 gene, as well as compositions and methods for treating diseases and disorders caused by the expression of these genes, such as leukemia. The pharmaceutical compositions featured in the invention include a dsRNA having an antisense strand comprising a region of complementarity which is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and is substantially complementary to at least part of an RNA transcript of the XBP-1 gene, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions featured in the invention also include a dsRNA having an antisense strand having a region of complementarity which is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and is substantially complementary to at least part of an RNA transcript of the XBP-1 gene.\n\n\nAccordingly, in some aspects, pharmaceutical compositions containing the XBP-1 dsRNA and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, methods of using the compositions to inhibit expression of the XBP-1 gene, and methods of using the pharmaceutical compositions to treat diseases caused by expression of the XBP-1 gene are featured in the invention.\n\n\nI. Definitions\n\n\nFor convenience, the meaning of certain terms and phrases used in the specification, examples, and appended claims, are provided below. If there is an apparent discrepancy between the usage of a term in other parts of this specification and its definition provided in this section, the definition in this section shall prevail.\n\n\n“G,” “C,” “A,” “T” and “U” each generally stand for a nucleotide that contains guanine, cytosine, adenine, thymidine and uracil as a base, respectively. However, it will be understood that the term “ribonucleotide” or “nucleotide” can also refer to a modified nucleotide, as further detailed below, or a surrogate replacement moiety. The skilled person is well aware that guanine, cytosine, adenine, thymidine and uracil may be replaced by other moieties without substantially altering the base pairing properties of an oligonucleotide comprising a nucleotide bearing such replacement moiety. For example, without limitation, a nucleotide comprising inosine as its base may base pair with nucleotides containing adenine, cytosine, or uracil. Hence, nucleotides containing uracil, guanine, or adenine may be replaced in the nucleotide sequences of dsRNA featured in the invention by a nucleotide containing, for example, inosine. In another example, adenine and cytosine anywhere in the oligonucleotide can be replaced with guanine and uracil, respectively to form G:U Wobble base pairing with the target mRNA. Sequences containing such replacement moieties are suitable for the compositions and methods featured the invention.\n\n\nAs used herein, “XBP-1” refers to \nX-Box Protein\n 1, which is also known as Tax-responsive element-binding \nprotein\n 5, TREB5, and XBP2. XBP-1 sequence can be found as NCBI GeneID:7494 and RefSeq ID number:NM\n—\n005080 (human) (\nFIG. 1\n) and NM\n—\n013842 (mouse, \nFIG. 2\n). A dsRNA featured in the invention can target a specific XBP-1 isoform, e.g., the spliced form (XBP-1S) or the unspliced form (XBP-1U), or a dsRNA featured in the invention can target both isoforms by binding to a common region of the mRNA transcript.\n\n\nAs used herein, “target sequence” refers to a contiguous portion of the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA molecule formed during the transcription of the XBP-1 gene, including mRNA that is a product of RNA processing of a primary transcription product.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “strand comprising a sequence” refers to an oligonucleotide comprising a chain of nucleotides that is described by the sequence referred to using the standard nucleotide nomenclature.\n\n\nAs used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term “complementary,” when used to describe a first nucleotide sequence in relation to a second nucleotide sequence, refers to the ability of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the first nucleotide sequence to hybridize and form a duplex structure under certain conditions with an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the second nucleotide sequence, as will be understood by the skilled person. Such conditions can, for example, be stringent conditions, where stringent conditions may include: 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM PIPES pH 6.4, 1 mM EDTA, 50° C. or 70° C. for 12-16 hours followed by washing. Other conditions, such as physiologically relevant conditions as may be encountered inside an organism, can apply. The skilled person will be able to determine the set of conditions most appropriate for a test of complementarity of two sequences in accordance with the ultimate application of the hybridized nucleotides.\n\n\nThis includes base-pairing of the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the first nucleotide sequence to the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the second nucleotide sequence over the entire length of the first and second nucleotide sequence. Such sequences can be referred to as “fully complementary” with respect to each other herein. However, where a first sequence is referred to as “substantially complementary” with respect to a second sequence herein, the two sequences can be fully complementary, or they may form one or more, but generally not more than 4, 3 or 2 mismatched base pairs upon hybridization, while retaining the ability to hybridize under the conditions most relevant to their ultimate application. However, where two oligonucleotides are designed to form, upon hybridization, one or more single stranded overhangs, such overhangs shall not be regarded as mismatches with regard to the determination of complementarity. For example, a dsRNA comprising one oligonucleotide 21 nucleotides in length and another oligonucleotide 23 nucleotides in length, wherein the longer oligonucleotide comprises a sequence of 21 nucleotides that is fully complementary to the shorter oligonucleotide, may yet be referred to as “fully complementary” for the purposes described herein.\n\n\n“Complementary” sequences, as used herein, may also include, or be formed entirely from, non-Watson-Crick base pairs and/or base pairs formed from non-natural and modified nucleotides, in as far as the above requirements with respect to their ability to hybridize are fulfilled. Such non-Watson-Crick base pairs includes, but not limited to, G:U Wobble or Hoogstein base pairing.\n\n\nThe terms “complementary,” “fully complementary” and “substantially complementary” herein may be used with respect to the base matching between the sense strand and the antisense strand of a dsRNA, or between the antisense strand of a dsRNA and a target sequence, as will be understood from the context of their use.\n\n\nAs used herein, a polynucleotide which is “substantially complementary to at least part of” a messenger RNA (mRNA) refers to a polynucleotide which is substantially complementary to a contiguous portion of the mRNA of interest (e.g., encoding XBP-1). For example, a polynucleotide is complementary to at least a part of an XBP-1 mRNA if the sequence is substantially complementary to a non-interrupted portion of an mRNA encoding XBP-1.\n\n\nThe term “double-stranded RNA” or “dsRNA,” as used herein, refers to a complex of ribonucleic acid molecules, having a duplex structure comprising two anti-parallel and substantially complementary, as defined above, nucleic acid strands. The two strands forming the duplex structure may be different portions of one larger RNA molecule, or they may be separate RNA molecules. Where the two strands are part of one larger molecule, and therefore are connected by an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides between the 3′-end of one strand and the 5′ end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure, the connecting RNA chain is referred to as a “hairpin loop.” Where the two strands are connected covalently by means other than an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides between the 3′-end of one strand and the 5′ end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure, the connecting structure is referred to as a “linker.” The RNA strands may have the same or a different number of nucleotides. The maximum number of base pairs is the number of nucleotides in the shortest strand of the dsRNA minus any overhangs that are present in the duplex. In addition to the duplex structure, a dsRNA may comprise one or more nucleotide overhangs. For example, a dsRNA can have a dinucleotide overhang at the 3′ end at one or both of the sense or antisense strands, such as a dTdT (deoxythymidine-deoxythymidine) or a dTsdT (deoxythymidine-(thiophosphate linker)-deoxythymidine) dinucleotide overhang at one or both of the 3′ ends of the sense or antisense strands.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “nucleotide overhang” refers to the unpaired nucleotide or nucleotides that protrude from the duplex structure of a dsRNA when a 3′-end of one strand of the dsRNA extends beyond the 5′-end of the other strand, or vice versa. “Blunt” or “blunt end” means that there are no unpaired nucleotides at that end of the dsRNA, i.e., no nucleotide overhang. A “blunt ended” dsRNA is a dsRNA that is double-stranded over its entire length, i.e., no nucleotide overhang at either end of the molecule.\n\n\nThe term “antisense strand” refers to the strand of a dsRNA which includes a region that is substantially complementary to a target sequence. As used herein, the term “region of complementarity” refers to the region on the antisense strand that is substantially complementary to a sequence, for example a target sequence, as defined herein. Where the region of complementarity is not fully complementary to the target sequence, the mismatches may be in the internal or terminal regions of the molecule. Generally, the most tolerated mismatches are in the terminal regions, e.g., within 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2 nucleotides of the 5′ and/or 3′ terminus.\n\n\nThe term “sense strand,” as used herein, refers to the strand of a dsRNA that includes a region that is substantially complementary to a region of the antisense strand.\n\n\nThe term “identity” is the relationship between two or more polynucleotide sequences, as determined by comparing the sequences. Identity also means the degree of sequence relatedness between polynucleotide sequences, as determined by the match between strings of such sequences. While there exist a number of methods to measure identity between two polynucleotide sequences, the term is well known to skilled artisans (see, e.g., Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press (1987); and Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov., M. and Devereux, J., eds., M. Stockton Press, New York (1991)). “Substantially identical,” as used herein, means there is a very high degree of homology (e.g., 100% sequence identity) between the sense strand of the dsRNA and the corresponding part of the target gene. However, dsRNA having greater than 90%, or 95% sequence identity may be used in the present invention, and thus sequence variations that might be expected due to genetic mutation, strain polymorphism, or evolutionary divergence can be tolerated. The dsRNA is typically 100% complementary to the target RNA, but in some embodiments, the dsRNA may contain single or multiple base-pair random mismatches between the RNA and the target gene.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “SNALP” refers to a stable nucleic acid-lipid particle. A SNALP represents a vesicle of lipids coating a reduced aqueous interior comprising a nucleic acid such as an iRNA agent or a plasmid from which an iRNA agent is transcribed. SNALPs are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 20060240093, 20070135372, and U.S. Ser. No. 61/045,228 filed Apr. 15, 2008. These applications are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n“Introducing into a cell,” when referring to a dsRNA, means facilitating uptake or absorption into the cell, as is understood by those skilled in the art. Absorption or uptake of dsRNA can occur through unaided diffusive or active cellular processes, or by auxiliary agents or devices. The meaning of this term is not limited to cells in vitro; a dsRNA may also be “introduced into a cell,” wherein the cell is part of a living organism. In such instance, introduction into the cell will include the delivery to the organism. For example, for in vivo delivery, dsRNA can be injected into a tissue site or administered systemically. In vivo delivery can also be by a beta-glucan delivery system, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,032,401 and 5,607,677, and U.S. Publication No. 2005/0281781. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,032,401 and 5,607,677, and U.S. Publication No. 2005/0281781 are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In vitro introduction into a cell includes methods known in the art such as electroporation and lipofection.\n\n\nThe terms “silence,” “inhibit the expression of,” “down-regulate the expression of,” “suppress the expression of,” and the like, in as far as they refer to the XBP-1 gene, herein refer to the at least partial suppression of the expression of the XBP-1 gene, as manifested by a reduction of the amount of XBP-1 mRNA which may be isolated from a first cell or group of cells in which the XBP-1 gene is transcribed and which has or have been treated such that the expression of the XBP-1 gene is inhibited, as compared to a second cell or group of cells substantially identical to the first cell or group of cells but which has or have not been so treated (control cells). The degree of inhibition is usually expressed in terms of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nin\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nin\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ntreated\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nin\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, the degree of inhibition may be given in terms of a reduction of a parameter that is functionally linked to XBP-1 gene expression, e.g., the amount of protein encoded by the XBP-1 gene which is secreted by a cell, or the number of cells displaying a certain phenotype, e.g., apoptosis. In principle, XBP-1 gene silencing may be determined in any cell expressing XBP-1, either constitutively or by genomic engineering, and by any appropriate assay. However, when a reference is needed in order to determine whether a given dsRNA inhibits the expression of the XBP-1 gene by a certain degree and therefore is encompassed by the instant invention, the assay provided in the Examples below shall serve as such reference.\n\n\nFor example, in certain instances, expression of the XBP-1 gene is suppressed by at least about 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, or 50% by administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide featured in the invention. In some embodiments, the XBP-1 gene is suppressed by at least about 60%, 70%, or 80% by administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide featured in the invention. In some embodiments, the XBP-1 gene is suppressed by at least about 85%, 90%, or 95% by administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide featured in the invention.\n\n\nAs used herein in the context of XBP-1 expression, the terms “treat,” “treatment,” and the like, refer to relief from or alleviation of pathological processes mediated by XBP-1 expression. In the context of the present invention insofar as it relates to any of the other conditions recited herein below (other than pathological processes mediated by XBP-1 expression), the terms “treat,” “treatment,” and the like mean to relieve or alleviate at least one symptom associated with such condition, or to slow or reverse the progression of such condition, such as the slowing and progression of hepatic carcinoma.\n\n\nAs used herein, the phrases “therapeutically effective amount” and “prophylactically effective amount” refer to an amount that provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment, prevention, or management of pathological processes mediated by XBP-1 expression or an overt symptom of pathological processes mediated by XBP-1 expression. The specific amount that is therapeutically effective can be readily determined by an ordinary medical practitioner, and may vary depending on factors known in the art, such as, e.g., the type of pathological processes mediated by XBP-1 expression, the patient's history and age, the stage of pathological processes mediated by XBP-1 expression, and the administration of other anti-pathological processes mediated by XBP-1 expression agents.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “pharmaceutical composition” comprises a pharmacologically effective amount of a dsRNA and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, “pharmacologically effective amount,” “therapeutically effective amount” or simply “effective amount” refers to that amount of an RNA effective to produce the intended pharmacological, therapeutic or preventive result. For example, if a given clinical treatment is considered effective when there is at least a 25% reduction in a measurable parameter associated with a disease or disorder, a therapeutically effective amount of a drug for the treatment of that disease or disorder is the amount necessary to effect at least a 25% reduction in that parameter.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a carrier for administration of a therapeutic agent. Such carriers include, but are not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The term specifically excludes cell culture medium. For drugs administered orally, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preservatives. Suitable inert diluents include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, and lactose, while corn starch and alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin, while the lubricating agent, if present, will generally be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “transformed cell” is a cell into which a vector has been introduced from which a dsRNA molecule may be expressed.\n\n\nII. Double-Stranded Ribonucleic Acid (dsRNA)\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the invention provides double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) molecules for inhibiting the expression of an XBP-1 gene in a cell or mammal, e.g., in a human having a metabolic disease, such as diabetes, or cardiovascular disease, where the dsRNA includes an antisense strand having a region of complementarity which is complementary to at least a part of an mRNA formed in the expression of the XBP-1 gene, and where the region of complementarity is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and where said dsRNA, upon contact with a cell expressing said XBP-1 gene, inhibits the expression of said XBP-1 gene by at least 30% as assayed by, for example, a PCR or branched DNA (bDNA) based method. The dsRNA includes two RNA strands that are sufficiently complementary to hybridize to form a duplex structure. One strand of the dsRNA (the antisense strand) includes a region of complementarity that is substantially complementary, and generally fully complementary, to a target sequence, derived from the sequence of an mRNA formed during the expression of the XBP-1 gene, the other strand (the sense strand) includes a region that is complementary to the antisense strand, such that the two strands hybridize and form a duplex structure when combined under suitable conditions. Generally, the duplex structure is between 15 and 30, more generally between 18 and 25, yet more generally between 19 and 24, and most generally between 19 and 21 base pairs in length. Similarly, the region of complementarity to the target sequence is between 15 and 30, more generally between 18 and 25, yet more generally between 19 and 24, and most generally between 19 and 21 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the dsRNA is between 10 and 15 nucleotides in length, and in other embodiments, the dsRNA is between 25 and 30 nucleotides in length. The dsRNA featured in the invention may further include one or more single-stranded nucleotide overhangs.\n\n\nThe dsRNA can be synthesized by standard methods known in the art as further discussed below, e.g., by use of an automated DNA synthesizer, such as are commercially available from, for example, Biosearch, Applied Biosystems, Inc. In one embodiment, the XBP-1 gene is the human XBP-1 gene. In specific embodiments, the first sequence is selected from the group consisting of the sense sequences of Tables 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12, and the second sequence is selected from the group consisting of the antisense sequences of Tables 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12. Alternative antisense agents that target elsewhere in the target sequence provided in Tables 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12 can readily be determined using the target sequence and the flanking XBP-1 sequence.\n\n\nThe dsRNA will include at least two nucleotide sequence selected from the groups of sequences provided in Tables 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12. One of the two sequences is complementary to the other of the two sequences, with one of the sequences being substantially complementary to a sequence of an mRNA generated in the expression of the XBP-1 gene. As such, the dsRNA will include two oligonucleotides, where one oligonucleotide is described as the sense strand in Tables 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12 and the second oligonucleotide is described as the antisense strand in Tables 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12.\n\n\nThe skilled person is well aware that dsRNAs comprising a duplex structure of between 20 and 23, but specifically 21, base pairs have been hailed as particularly effective in inducing RNA interference (Elbashir et al., EMBO 2001, 20:6877-6888). However, others have found that shorter or longer dsRNAs can be effective as well. In the embodiments described above, by virtue of the nature of the oligonucleotide sequences provided in Tables 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12, the dsRNAs featured in the invention can include at least one strand of a length of minimally 21 nt. It can be reasonably expected that shorter dsRNAs having one of the sequences of Tables 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12 minus only a few nucleotides on one or both ends may be similarly effective as compared to the dsRNAs described above. Hence, dsRNAs having a partial sequence of at least 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more contiguous nucleotides from one of the sequences of Tables 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12, and differing in their ability to inhibit the expression of the XBP-1 gene in a FACS assay as described herein below by not more than 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30% inhibition from a dsRNA comprising the full sequence, are contemplated by the invention. Further, dsRNAs that cleave within a desired XBP-1 target sequence can readily be made using the corresponding XBP-1 antisense sequence and a complementary sense sequence.\n\n\nIn addition, the dsRNAs provided in 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12 identify a site in the XBP-1 mRNA that is susceptible to RNAi based cleavage. As such the present invention further features dsRNAs that target within the sequence targeted by one of the agents of the present invention. As used herein a second dsRNA is said to target within the sequence of a first dsRNA if the second dsRNA cleaves the message anywhere within the mRNA that is complementary to the antisense strand of the first dsRNA. Such a second dsRNA will generally consist of at least 15 contiguous nucleotides from one of the sequences provided in Tables 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12 coupled to additional nucleotide sequences taken from the region contiguous to the selected sequence in the XBP-1 gene. For example, the last 15 nucleotides of SEQ ID NO:1 combined with the next six nucleotides from the target XBP-1 gene produces a single strand agent of 21 nucleotides that is based on one of the sequences provided in Tables 2, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12.\n\n\nThe dsRNA featured in the invention can contain one or more mismatches to the target sequence. In one embodiment, the dsRNA featured the invention contains no more than 3 mismatches. If the antisense strand of the dsRNA contains mismatches to a target sequence, it the area of mismatch is typically not located in the center of the region of complementarity. If the antisense strand of the dsRNA contains mismatches to the target sequence, the mismatch is typically restricted to 5 nucleotides from either end, for example 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 nucleotide from either the 5′ or 3′ end of the region of complementarity. For example, for a 23 nucleotide dsRNA strand which is complementary to a region of the XBP-1 gene, the dsRNA generally does not contain any mismatch within the central 13 nucleotides. The methods described within the invention can be used to determine whether a dsRNA containing a mismatch to a target sequence is effective in inhibiting the expression of the XBP-1 gene. Consideration of the efficacy of dsRNAs with mismatches in inhibiting expression of the XBP-1 gene is important, especially if the particular region of complementarity in the XBP-1 gene is known to have polymorphic sequence variation within the population.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, at least one end of the dsRNA has a single-stranded nucleotide overhang of 1 to 4, generally 1 or 2 nucleotides. dsRNAs having at least one nucleotide overhang have unexpectedly superior inhibitory properties than their blunt-ended counterparts. Moreover, the present inventors have discovered that the presence of only one nucleotide overhang strengthens the interference activity of the dsRNA, without affecting its overall stability. dsRNA having only one overhang has proven particularly stable and effective in vivo, as well as in a variety of cells, cell culture mediums, blood, and serum. Generally, the single-stranded overhang is located at the 3′-terminal end of the antisense strand or, alternatively, at the 3′-terminal end of the sense strand. The dsRNA may also have a blunt end, generally located at the 5′-end of the antisense strand. Such dsRNAs have improved stability and inhibitory activity, thus allowing administration at low dosages, i.e., less than 5 mg/kg body weight of the recipient per day. In one embodiment, the antisense strand of the dsRNA has a 1-10 nucleotide overhang at the 3′ end and/or the 5′ end. In one embodiment, the sense strand of the dsRNA has a 1-10 nucleotide overhang at the 3′ end and/or the 5′ end. In another embodiment, one or more of the nucleotides in the overhang is replaced with a nucleoside thiophosphate.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the dsRNA is chemically modified to enhance stability. The nucleic acids featured in the invention may be synthesized and/or modified by methods well established in the art, such as those described in “Current protocols in nucleic acid chemistry,” Beaucage, S. L. et al. (Edrs.), John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y., USA, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Specific examples of dsRNA compounds useful in this invention include dsRNAs containing modified backbones or no natural internucleoside linkages. As defined in this specification, dsRNAs having modified backbones include those that retain a phosphorus atom in the backbone and those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the backbone. For the purposes of this specification, and as sometimes referenced in the art, modified dsRNAs that do not have a phosphorus atom in their internucleoside backbone can also be considered to be oligonucleosides.\n\n\nModified dsRNA backbones include, for example, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3′-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3′-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, and boranophosphates having normal 3′-5′ linkages, 2′-5′ linked analogs of these, and those) having inverted polarity wherein the adjacent pairs of nucleoside units are linked 3′-5′ to 5′-3′ or 2′-5′ to 5′-2′. Various salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also included.\n\n\nRepresentative U.S. patents that teach the preparation of the above phosphorus-containing linkages include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,687,808; 4,469,863; 4,476,301; 5,023,243; 5,177,195; 5,188,897; 5,264,423; 5,276,019; 5,278,302; 5,286,717; 5,321,131; 5,399,676; 5,405,939; 5,453,496; 5,455,233; 5,466,677; 5,476,925; 5,519,126; 5,536,821; 5,541,316; 5,550,111; 5,563,253; 5,571,799; 5,587,361; and 5,625,050, each of which is herein incorporated by reference\n\n\nModified dsRNA backbones that do not include a phosphorus atom therein have backbones that are formed by short chain alkyl or cycloalkyl internucleoside linkages, mixed heteroatoms and alkyl or cycloalkyl internucleoside linkages, or ore or more short chain heteroatomic or heterocyclic internucleoside linkages. These include those having morpholino linkages (formed in part from the sugar portion of a nucleoside); siloxane backbones; sulfide, sulfoxide and sulfone backbones; formacetyl and thioformacetyl backbones; methylene formacetyl and thioformacetyl backbones; alkene containing backbones; sulfamate backbones; methyleneimino and methylenehydrazino backbones; sulfonate and sulfonamide backbones; amide backbones; and others having mixed N, O, S and CH2 component parts.\n\n\nRepresentative U.S. patents that teach the preparation of the above oligonucleosides include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,034,506; 5,166,315; 5,185,444; 5,214,134; 5,216,141; 5,235,033; 5,64,562; 5,264,564; 5,405,938; 5,434,257; 5,466,677; 5,470,967; 5,489,677; 5,541,307; 5,561,225; 5,596,086; 5,602,240; 5,608,046; 5,610,289; 5,618,704; 5,623,070; 5,663,312; 5,633,360; 5,677,437; and, 5,677,439, each of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nIn other suitable dsRNA mimetics, both the sugar and the internucleoside linkage, i.e., the backbone, of the nucleotide units are replaced with novel groups. The base units are maintained for hybridization with an appropriate nucleic acid target compound. One such oligomeric compound, an dsRNA mimetic that has been shown to have excellent hybridization properties, is referred to as a peptide nucleic acid (PNA). In PNA compounds, the sugar backbone of an dsRNA is replaced with an amide containing backbone, in particular an aminoethylglycine backbone. The nucleobases are retained and are bound directly or indirectly to aza nitrogen atoms of the amide portion of the backbone. Representative U.S. patents that teach the preparation of PNA compounds include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,539,082; 5,714,331; and 5,719,262, each of which is herein incorporated by reference. Further teaching of PNA compounds can be found in Nielsen et al., Science, 1991, 254, 1497-1500.\n\n\nMost embodiments featured in the invention include dsRNAs with phosphorothioate backbones and oligonucleosides with heteroatom backbones, and in particular —CH\n2\n—NH—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—N(CH\n3\n)—O—CH\n2\n— [known as a methylene (methylimino) or MMI backbone], —CH\n2\n—O—N(CH\n3\n)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—N(CH\n3\n)—N(CH\n3\n)—CH\n2\n— and —N(CH\n3\n)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— [wherein the native phosphodiester backbone is represented as —O—P—O—CH\n2\n—] of the above-referenced U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,677, and the amide backbones of the above-referenced U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,240.

(Sanghvi, Y. S., Crooke, S.

No. 5,750,692, also herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nAnother modification of the dsRNAs featured in the invention involves chemically linking to the dsRNA one or more moieties or conjugates which enhance the activity, cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the dsRNA. Such moieties include but are not limited to lipid moieties such as a cholesterol moiety (Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acid. Sci. USA, 199, 86, 6553-6556), cholic acid (Manoharan et al., Biorg. Med. Chem. Let., 1994 4 1053-1060), a thioether, e.g., beryl-5-tritylthiol (Manoharan et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 1992, 660, 306-309; Manoharan et al., Biorg. Med. Chem. Let., 1993, 3, 2765-2770), a thiocholesterol (Oberhauser et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1992, 20, 533-538), an aliphatic chain, e.g., dodecandiol or undecyl residues (Saison-Behmoaras et al., EMBO J, 1991, 10, 1111-1118; Kabanov et al., FEBS Lett., 1990, 259, 327-330; Svinarchuk et al., Biochimie, 1993, 75, 49-54), a phospholipid, e.g., di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol or triethyl-\nammonium\n 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-Hphosphonate (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 3651-3654; Shea et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1990, 18, 3777-3783), a polyamine or a polyethylene glycol chain (Manoharan et al., Nucleosides & Nucleotides, 1995, 14, 969-973), or adamantane acetic acid (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 3651-3654), a palmityl moiety (Mishra et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1995, 1264, 229-237), or an octadecylamine or hexylamino-carbonyloxycholesterol moiety (Crooke et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1996, 277, 923-937).\n\n\nRepresentative U.S. patents that teach the preparation of such dsRNA conjugates include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,828,979; 4,948,882; 5,218,105; 5,525,465; 5,541,313; 5,545,730; 5,552,538; 5,578,717, 5,580,731; 5,591,584; 5,109,124; 5,118,802; 5,138,045; 5,414,077; 5,486,603; 5,512,439; 5,578,718; 5,608,046; 4,587,044; 4,605,735; 4,667,025; 4,762,779; 4,789,737; 4,824,941; 4,835,263; 4,876,335; 4,904,582; 4,958,013; 5,082,830; 5,112,963; 5,214,136; 5,082,830; 5,112,963; 5,214,136; 5,245,022; 5,254,469; 5,258,506; 5,262,536; 5,272,250; 5,292,873; 5,317,098; 5,371,241, 5,391,723; 5,416,203, 5,451,463; 5,510,475; 5,512,667; 5,514,785; 5,565,552; 5,567,810; 5,574,142; 5,585,481; 5,587,371; 5,595,726; 5,597,696; 5,599,923; 5,599,928 and 5,688,941, each of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nIt is not necessary for all positions in a given compound to be uniformly modified, and in fact more than one of the aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a single compound or even at a single nucleoside within an dsRNA. The present invention also includes dsRNA compounds which are chimeric compounds. “Chimeric” dsRNA compounds or “chimeras,” in the context of this invention, are dsRNA compounds, particularly dsRNAs, which contain two or more chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least one monomer unit, i.e., a nucleotide in the case of an dsRNA compound. These dsRNAs typically contain at least one region wherein the dsRNA is modified so as to confer upon the dsRNA increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, and/or increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid. An additional region of the dsRNA may serve as a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA:DNA or RNA:RNA hybrids. By way of example, RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNAduplex. Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of dsRNA inhibition of gene expression. Consequently, comparable results can often be obtained with shorter dsRNAs when chimeric dsRNAs are used, compared to phosphorothioate deoxydsRNAs hybridizing to the same target region. Cleavage of the RNA target can be routinely detected by gel electrophoresis and, if necessary, associated nucleic acid hybridization techniques known in the art.\n\n\nIn certain instances, the dsRNA may be modified by a non-ligand group. A number of non-ligand molecules have been conjugated to dsRNAs in order to enhance the activity, cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the dsRNA, and procedures for performing such conjugations are available in the scientific literature. Such non-ligand moieties have included lipid moieties, such as cholesterol (Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1989, 86:6553), cholic acid (Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1994, 4:1053), a thioether, e.g., hexyl-5-tritylthiol (Manoharan et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 1992, 660:306; Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let., 1993, 3:2765), a thiocholesterol (Oberhauser et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1992, 20:533), an aliphatic chain, e.g., dodecandiol or undecyl residues (Saison-Behmoaras et al., EMBO J., 1991, 10:111; Kabanov et al., FEBS Lett., 1990, 259:327; Svinarchuk et al., Biochimie, 1993, 75:49), a phospholipid, e.g., di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol or \ntriethylammonium\n 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-H-phosphonate (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36:3651; Shea et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1990, 18:3777), a polyamine or a polyethylene glycol chain (Manoharan et al., Nucleosides & Nucleotides, 1995, 14:969), or adamantane acetic acid (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36:3651), a palmityl moiety (Mishra et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1995, 1264:229), or an octadecylamine or hexylamino-carbonyl-oxycholesterol moiety (Crooke et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1996, 277:923). Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of such dsRNA conjugates have been listed above. Typical conjugation protocols involve the synthesis of dsRNAs bearing an aminolinker at one or more positions of the sequence. The amino group is then reacted with the molecule being conjugated using appropriate coupling or activating reagents. The conjugation reaction may be performed either with the dsRNA still bound to the solid support or following cleavage of the dsRNA in solution phase. Purification of the dsRNA conjugate by HPLC typically affords the pure conjugate.\n\n\nVector Encoded dsRNAs\n\n\nIn another aspect, XBP-1 specific dsRNA molecules are expressed from transcription units inserted into DNA or RNA vectors (see, e.g., Couture, A, et al., \nTIG\n. (1996), 12:5-10; Skillern, A., et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 00/22113, Conrad, International PCT Publication No. WO 00/22114, and Conrad, U.S. Pat. No. 6,054,299). These transgenes can be introduced as a linear construct, a circular plasmid, or a viral vector, which can be incorporated and inherited as a transgene integrated into the host genome. The transgene can also be constructed to permit it to be inherited as an extrachromosomal plasmid (Gassmann, et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n(1995) 92:1292).\n\n\nThe individual strands of a dsRNA can be transcribed by promoters on two separate expression vectors and co-transfected into a target cell. Alternatively each individual strand of the dsRNA can be transcribed by promoters both of which are located on the same expression plasmid. In one embodiment, a dsRNA is expressed as an inverted repeat joined by a linker polynucleotide sequence such that the dsRNA has a stem and loop structure.\n\n\nThe recombinant dsRNA expression vectors are generally DNA plasmids or viral vectors. dsRNA expressing viral vectors can be constructed based on, but not limited to, adeno-associated virus (for a review, see Muzyczka, et al., \nCurr. Topics Micro. Immunol\n. (1992) 158:97-129)); adenovirus (see, for example, Berkner, et al., BioTechniques (1998) 6:616), Rosenfeld et al. (1991, Science 252:431-434), and Rosenfeld et al. (1992), Cell 68:143-155)); or alphavirus as well as others known in the art. Retroviruses have been used to introduce a variety of genes into many different cell types, including epithelial cells, in vitro and/or in vivo (see, e.g., Eglitis, et al., \nScience \n(1985) 230:1395-1398; Danos and Mulligan, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n(1998) 85:6460-6464; Wilson et al., 1988, Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 85:3014-3018; Armentano et al., 1990, Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 87:61416145; Huber et al., 1991, Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 88:8039-8043; Ferry et al., 1991, Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 88:8377-8381; Chowdhury et al., 1991, Science 254:1802-1805; van Beusechem. et al., 1992, Proc. Nad. Acad. Sci. USA 89:7640-19; Kay et al., 1992, Human Gene Therapy 3:641-647; Dai et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10892-10895; Hwu et al., 1993, J. Immunol. 150:4104-4115; U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,116; U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286; PCT Application WO 89/07136; PCT Application WO 89/02468; PCT Application WO 89/05345; and PCT Application WO 92/07573). Recombinant retroviral vectors capable of transducing and expressing genes inserted into the genome of a cell can be produced by transfecting the recombinant retroviral genome into suitable packaging cell lines such as PA317 and Psi-CRIP (Comette et al., 1991, Human Gene Therapy 2:5-10; Cone et al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6349). Recombinant adenoviral vectors can be used to infect a wide variety of cells and tissues in susceptible hosts (e.g., rat, hamster, dog, and chimpanzee) (Hsu et al., 1992, J. Infectious Disease, 166:769), and also have the advantage of not requiring mitotically active cells for infection.\n\n\nAny viral vector capable of accepting the coding sequences for the dsRNA molecule(s) to be expressed can be used, for example vectors derived from adenovirus (AV); adeno-associated virus (AAV); retroviruses (e.g., lentiviruses (LV), Rhabdoviruses, murine leukemia virus); herpes virus, and the like. The tropism of viral vectors can be modified by pseudotyping the vectors with envelope proteins or other surface antigens from other viruses, or by substituting different viral capsid proteins, as appropriate.\n\n\nFor example, lentiviral vectors featured in the invention can be pseudotyped with surface proteins from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), rabies, Ebola, Mokola, and the like. AAV vectors featured in the invention can be made to target different cells by engineering the vectors to express different capsid protein serotypes. For example, an AAV vector expressing a serotype 2 capsid on a serotype 2 genome is called AAV 2/2. This serotype 2 capsid gene in the AAV 2/2 vector can be replaced by a \nserotype\n 5 capsid gene to produce an AAV 2/5 vector. Techniques for constructing AAV vectors which express different capsid protein serotypes are within the skill in the art; see, e.g., Rabinowitz J E et al. (2002), J Virol 76:791-801, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nSelection of recombinant viral vectors suitable for use in the invention, methods for inserting nucleic acid sequences for expressing the dsRNA into the vector, and methods of delivering the viral vector to the cells of interest are within the skill in the art. See, for example, Dornburg R (1995), Gene Therap. 2: 301-310; Eglitis M A (1988), Biotechniques 6: 608-614; Miller A D (1990), Hum Gene Therap. 1: 5-14; Anderson W F (1998), Nature 392: 25-30; and Rubinson D A et al., Nat. Genet. 33: 401-406, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nViral vectors can be derived from AV and AAV. In one embodiment, the dsRNA featured in the invention is expressed as two separate, complementary single-stranded RNA molecules from a recombinant AAV vector having, for example, either the U6 or H1 RNA promoters, or the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter.\n\n\nA suitable AV vector for expressing the dsRNA featured in the invention, a method for constructing the recombinant AV vector, and a method for delivering the vector into target cells, are described in Xia H et al. (2002), \nNat. Biotech. \n20: 1006-1010.\n\n\nSuitable AAV vectors for expressing the dsRNA featured in the invention, methods for constructing the recombinant AV vector, and methods for delivering the vectors into target cells are described in Samulski R et al. (1987), J. Virol. 61: 3096-3101; Fisher K J et al. (1996), J. Virol, 70: 520-532; Samulski R et al. (1989), J. Virol. 63: 3822-3826; U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,479; U.S. Pat. No. 5,139,941; International Patent Application No. WO 94/13788; and International Patent Application No. WO 93/24641, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nThe promoter driving dsRNA expression in either a DNA plasmid or viral vector featured in the invention may be a eukaryotic RNA polymerase I (e.g., ribosomal RNA promoter), RNA polymerase II (e.g., CMV early promoter or actin promoter or U1 snRNA promoter) or generally RNA polymerase III promoter (e.g., U6 snRNA or 7SK RNA promoter) or a prokaryotic promoter, for example the T7 promoter, provided the expression plasmid also encodes T7 RNA polymerase required for transcription from a T7 promoter. The promoter can also direct transgene expression to the pancreas (see, e.g., the insulin regulatory sequence for pancreas (Bucchini et al., 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:2511-2515)).\n\n\nIn addition, expression of the transgene can be precisely regulated, for example, by using an inducible regulatory sequence and expression systems such as a regulatory sequence that is sensitive to certain physiological regulators, e.g., circulating glucose levels, or hormones (Docherty et al., 1994, FASEB J. 8:20-24). Such inducible expression systems, suitable for the control of transgene expression in cells or in mammals include regulation by ecdysone, by estrogen, progesterone, tetracycline, chemical inducers of dimerization, and isopropyl-beta-D1-thiogalactopyranoside (EPTG). A person skilled in the art would be able to choose the appropriate regulatory/promoter sequence based on the intended use of the dsRNA transgene.\n\n\nGenerally, recombinant vectors capable of expressing dsRNA molecules are delivered as described below, and persist in target cells. Alternatively, viral vectors can be used that provide for transient expression of dsRNA molecules. Such vectors can be repeatedly administered as necessary. Once expressed, the dsRNAs bind to target RNA and modulate its function or expression. Delivery of dsRNA expressing vectors can be systemic, such as by intravenous or intramuscular administration, by administration to target cells ex-planted from the patient followed by reintroduction into the patient, or by any other means that allows for introduction into a desired target cell.\n\n\ndsRNA expression DNA plasmids are typically transfected into target cells as a complex with cationic lipid carriers (e.g., Oligofectamine) or non-cationic lipid-based carriers (e.g., Transit-TKO™). Multiple lipid transfections for dsRNA-mediated knockdowns targeting different regions of a single XBP-1 gene or multiple XBP-1 genes over a period of a week or more are also contemplated by the invention. Successful introduction of vectors into host cells can be monitored using various known methods. For example, transient transfection can be signaled with a reporter, such as a fluorescent marker, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Stable transfection of cells ex vivo can be ensured using markers that provide the transfected cell with resistance to specific environmental factors (e.g., antibiotics and drugs), such as hygromycin B resistance.\n\n\nThe XBP-1 specific dsRNA molecules can also be inserted into vectors and used as gene therapy vectors for human patients. Gene therapy vectors can be delivered to a subject by, for example, intravenous injection, local administration (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,328,470) or by stereotactic injection (see e.g., Chen et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3054-3057). The pharmaceutical preparation of the gene therapy vector can include the gene therapy vector in an acceptable diluent, or can include a slow release matrix in which the gene delivery vehicle is imbedded. Alternatively, where the complete gene delivery vector can be produced intact from recombinant cells, e.g., retroviral vectors, the pharmaceutical preparation can include one or more cells which produce the gene delivery system.\n\n\nIII. Pharmaceutical Compositions Comprising dsRNA\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a dsRNA, as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition comprising the dsRNA is useful for treating a disease or disorder associated with the expression or activity of the XBP-1 gene, such as pathological processes mediated by XBP-1 expression. Such pharmaceutical compositions are formulated based on the mode of delivery. One example is compositions that are formulated for systemic administration via parenteral delivery.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions featured herein are administered in dosages sufficient to inhibit expression of the XBP-1 genes. In general, a suitable dose of total dsRNA will be in the range of 0.01 to 200.0 milligrams per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, generally in the range of 0.02 to 50 mg per kilogram body weight per day. For example, the dsRNA can be administered at 0.01 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg per single dose. The pharmaceutical composition may be administered once daily or the dsRNA may be administered as two, three, or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day or even using continuous infusion or delivery through a controlled release formulation. In that case, the dsRNA contained in each sub-dose must be correspondingly smaller in order to achieve the total daily dosage. The dosage unit can also be compounded for delivery over several days, e.g., using a conventional sustained release formulation which provides sustained release of the dsRNA over a several day period. Sustained release formulations are well known in the art and are particularly useful for delivery of agents at a particular site, such as could be used with the agents of the present invention. In this embodiment, the dosage unit contains a corresponding multiple of the daily dose.\n\n\nThe skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage and timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a composition can include a single treatment or a series of treatments. Estimates of effective dosages and in vivo half-lives for the individual dsRNAs encompassed by the invention can be made using conventional methodologies or on the basis of in vivo testing using an appropriate animal model, as described elsewhere herein.\n\n\nAdvances in mouse genetics have generated a number of mouse models for the study of various human diseases, such as pathological processes mediated by XBP-1 expression. Such models are used for in vivo testing of dsRNA, as well as for determining a therapeutically effective dose.\n\n\nThe present invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions and formulations which include the dsRNA compounds featured in the invention. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in a number of ways depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (e.g., by a transdermal patch), pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal and transdermal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or infusion; subdermal, e.g., via an implanted device; or intracranial, e.g., by intrathecal or intraventricular, administration.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful. Suitable topical formulations include those in which the dsRNAs featured in the invention are in admixture with a topical delivery agent such as lipids, liposomes, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, steroids, chelating agents and surfactants. Suitable lipids and liposomes include neutral (e.g., dioleoylphosphatidyl DOPE ethanolamine, dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline DMPC, distearolyphosphatidyl choline) negative (e.g., dimyristoylphosphatidyl glycerol DMPG) and cationic (e.g., dioleoyltetramethylaminopropyl DOTAP and dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine DOTMA). DsRNAs featured in the invention may be encapsulated within liposomes or may form complexes thereto, in particular to cationic liposomes. Alternatively, dsRNAs may be complexed to lipids, in particular to cationic lipids. Suitable fatty acids and esters include but are not limited arachidonic acid, oleic acid, eicosanoic acid, lauric acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monoolein, dilaurin, glyceryl 1-monocaprate, 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, an acylcarnitine, an acylcholine, or a C\n1-10 \nalkyl ester (e.g., isopropylmyristate IPM), monoglyceride, diglyceride or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Topical formulations are described in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/315,298 filed on May 20, 1999 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a dsRNA featured in the invention is fully encapsulated in the lipid formulation (e.g., to form a SPLP, pSPLP, SNALP, or other nucleic acid-lipid particle). As used herein, the term “SNALP” refers to a stable nucleic acid-lipid particle, including SPLP. As used herein, the term “SPLP” refers to a nucleic acid-lipid particle comprising plasmid DNA encapsulated within a lipid vesicle. SNALPs and SPLPs typically contain a cationic lipid, a non-cationic lipid, and a lipid that prevents aggregation of the particle (e.g., a PEG-lipid conjugate). SNALPs and SPLPs are extremely useful for systemic applications, as they exhibit extended circulation lifetimes following intravenous (i.v.) injection and accumulate at distal sites (e.g., sites physically separated from the administration site). SPLPs include “pSPLP,” which include an encapsulated condensing agent-nucleic acid complex as set forth in PCT Publication No. WO 00/03683. The particles of the present invention typically have a mean diameter of about 50 nm to about 150 nm, more typically about 60 nm to about 130 nm, more typically about 70 nm to about 110 nm, most typically about 70 to about 90 nm, and are substantially nontoxic. In addition, the nucleic acids when present in the nucleic acid-lipid particles of the present invention are resistant in aqueous solution to degradation with a nuclease. Nucleic acid-lipid particles and their method of preparation are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,976,567; 5,981,501; 6,534,484; 6,586,410; 6,815,432; and PCT Publication No. WO 96/40964.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the lipid to drug ratio (mass/mass ratio) (e.g., lipid to dsRNA ratio) will be in the range of from about 1:1 to about 50:1, from about 1:1 to about 25:1, from about 3:1 to about 15:1, from about 4:1 to about 10:1, from about 5:1 to about 9:1, or about 6:1 to about 9:1.\n\n\nThe cationic lipid may be, for example, N,N-dioleyl-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride (DODAC), N,N-distearyl-N,N-dimethylammonium bromide (DDAB), N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP), N-(1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA), N,N-dimethyl-2,3-dioleyloxy)propylamine (DODMA), 1,2-DiLinoleyloxy-N,N-dimethylaminopropane (DLinDMA), 1,2-Dilinolenyloxy-N,N-dimethylaminopropane (DLenDMA), 1,2-Dilinoleylcarbamoyloxy-3-dimethylaminopropane (DLin-C-DAP), 1,2-Dilinoleyoxy-3-(dimethylamino)acetoxypropane (DLin-DAC), 1,2-Dilinoleyoxy-3-morpholinopropane (DLin-MA), 1,2-Dilinoleoyl-3-dimethylaminopropane (DLinDAP), 1,2-Dilinoleylthio-3-dimethylaminopropane (DLin-S-DMA), 1-Linoleoyl-2-linoleyloxy-3-dimethylaminopropane (DLin-2-DMAP), 1,2-Dilinoleyloxy-3-trimethylaminopropane chloride salt (DLin-TMA.Cl), 1,2-Dilinoleoyl-3-trimethylaminopropane chloride salt (DLin-TAP.Cl), 1,2-Dilinoleyloxy-3-(N-methylpiperazino)propane (DLin-MPZ), or 3-(N,N-Dilinoleylamino)-1,2-propanediol (DLinAP), 3-(N,N-Dioleylamino)-1,2-propanedio (DOAP), 1,2-Dilinoleyloxo-3-(2-N,N-dimethylamino)ethoxypropane (DLin-EG-DMA), 2,2-Dilinoleyl-4-dimethylaminomethyl-[1,3]-dioxolane (DLin-K-DMA), or a mixture thereof. The cationic lipid may comprise from about 20 mol % to about 50 mol % or about 40 mol % of the total lipid present in the particle.\n\n\nThe non-cationic lipid may be an anionic lipid or a neutral lipid including, but not limited to, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG), dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (DOPE-mal), dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine (DPPE), dimyristoylphosphoethanolamine (DMPE), distearoyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (DSPE), 16-O-monomethyl PE, 16-O-dimethyl PE, 18-1-trans PE, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidyethanolamine (SOPE), cholesterol, or a mixture thereof. The non-cationic lipid may be from about 5 mol % to about 90 mol %, about 10 mol %, or about 58 mol % if cholesterol is included, of the total lipid present in the particle.\n\n\nThe conjugated lipid that inhibits aggregation of particles may be, for example, a polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-lipid including, without limitation, a PEG-diacylglycerol (DAG), a PEG-dialkyloxypropyl (DAA), a PEG-phospholipid, a PEG-ceramide (Cer), or a mixture thereof. The PEG-DAA conjugate may be, for example, a PEG-dilauryloxypropyl (Ci\n2\n), a PEG-dimyristyloxypropyl (Ci\n4\n), a PEG-dipalmityloxypropyl (Ci\n6\n), or a PEG-distearyloxypropyl (C]\n8\n). The conjugated lipid that prevents aggregation of particles may be from 0 mol % to about 20 mol % or about 2 mol % of the total lipid present in the particle.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the nucleic acid-lipid particle further includes cholesterol at, e.g., about 10 mol % to about 60 mol % or about 48 mol % of the total lipid present in the particle.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the lipidoid ND98.4HCl (MW 1487) (Formula 1), Cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich), and PEG-Ceramide C16 (Avanti Polar Lipids) can be used to prepare lipid-siRNA nanoparticles (i.e., LNP01 particles). Stock solutions of each in ethanol can be prepared as follows: ND98, 133 mg/mL; Cholesterol, 25 mg/mL, PEG-Ceramide C16, 100 mg/mL. The ND98, Cholesterol, and PEG-Ceramide C16 stock solutions can then be combined in a, e.g., 42:48:10 molar ratio. The combined lipid solution can be mixed with aqueous siRNA (e.g., in sodium acetate pH 5) such that the final ethanol concentration is about 35-45% and the final sodium acetate concentration is about 100-300 mM. Lipid-siRNA nanoparticles typically form spontaneously upon mixing. Depending on the desired particle size distribution, the resultant nanoparticle mixture can be extruded through a polycarbonate membrane (e.g., 100 nm cut-off) using, for example, a thermobarrel extruder, such as Lipex Extruder (Northern Lipids, Inc). In some cases, the extrusion step can be omitted. Ethanol removal and simultaneous buffer exchange can be accomplished by, for example, dialysis or tangential flow filtration. Buffer can be exchanged with, for example, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at about pH 7, e.g., about pH 6.9, about pH 7.0, about pH 7.1, about pH 7.2, about pH 7.3, or about pH 7.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLNP01 formulations are described, e.g., in International Application Publication No. WO 2008/042973, which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nFormulations prepared by either the standard or extrusion-free method can be characterized in similar manners. For example, formulations are typically characterized by visual inspection. They should be whitish translucent solutions free from aggregates or sediment. Particle size and particle size distribution of lipid-nanoparticles can be measured by light scattering using, for example, a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, USA). Particles should be about 20-300 nm, such as 40-100 nm in size. The particle size distribution should be unimodal. The total siRNA concentration in the formulation, as well as the entrapped fraction, is estimated using a dye exclusion assay. A sample of the formulated siRNA can be incubated with an RNA-binding dye, such as Ribogreen (Molecular Probes) in the presence or absence of a formulation disrupting surfactant, e.g., 0.5% Triton-X100. The total siRNA in the formulation can be determined by the signal from the sample containing the surfactant, relative to a standard curve. The entrapped fraction is determined by subtracting the “free” siRNA content (as measured by the signal in the absence of surfactant) from the total siRNA content. Percent entrapped siRNA is typically >85%. For SNALP formulation, the particle size is at least 30 nm, at least 40 nm, at least 50 nm, at least 60 nm, at least 70 nm, at least 80 nm, at least 90 nm, at least 100 nm, at least 110 nm, and at least 120 nm. The suitable range is typically about at least 50 nm to about at least 110 nm, about at least 60 nm to about at least 100 nm, or about at least 80 nm to about at least 90 nm.\n\n\nCompositions and formulations for oral administration include powders or granules, microparticulates, nanoparticulates, suspensions or solutions in water or non-aqueous media, capsules, gel capsules, sachets, tablets or minitablets. Thickeners, flavoring agents, diluents, emulsifiers, dispersing aids or binders may be desirable. In some embodiments, oral formulations are those in which dsRNAs featured in the invention are administered in conjunction with one or more penetration enhancers surfactants and chelators. Suitable surfactants include fatty acids and/or esters or salts thereof, bile acids and/or salts thereof. Suitable bile acids/salts include chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and ursodeoxychenodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), cholic acid, dehydrocholic acid, deoxycholic acid, glucholic acid, glycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, sodium tauro-24,25-dihydro-fusidate and sodium glycodihydrofusidate. Suitable fatty acids include arachidonic acid, undecanoic acid, oleic acid, lauric acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monoolein, dilaurin, glyceryl 1-monocaprate, 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, an acylcarnitine, an acylcholine, or a monoglyceride, a diglyceride or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (e.g., sodium). In some embodiments, combinations of penetration enhancers are used, for example, fatty acids/salts in combination with bile acids/salts. One exemplary combination is the sodium salt of lauric acid, capric acid and UDCA. Further penetration enhancers include polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether. DsRNAs featured in the invention may be delivered orally, in granular form including sprayed dried particles, or complexed to form micro or nanoparticles. DsRNA complexing agents include poly-amino acids; polyimines; polyacrylates; polyalkylacrylates, polyoxethanes, polyalkylcyanoacrylates; cationized gelatins, albumins, starches, acrylates, polyethyleneglycols (PEG) and starches; polyalkylcyanoacrylates; DEAE-derivatized polyimines, pollulans, celluloses and starches.

Oral formulations for dsRNAs and their preparation are described in detail in U.S. application. Ser. No. 08/886,829 (filed Jul. 1, 1997), Ser. No. 09/108,673 (filed Jul. 1, 1998), Ser. No. 09/256,515 (filed Feb. 23, 1999), Ser. No. 09/082,624 (filed May 21, 1998) and Ser. No. 09/315,298 (filed May 20, 1999), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nCompositions and formulations for parenteral, intrathecal, intraventricular or intrahepatic administration may include sterile aqueous solutions which may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives such as, but not limited to, penetration enhancers, carrier compounds and other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, solutions, emulsions, and liposome-containing formulations. These compositions may be generated from a variety of components that include, but are not limited to, preformed liquids, self-emulsifying solids and self-emulsifying semisolids. Particularly preferred are formulations that target the liver when treating hepatic disorders such as hepatic carcinoma.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention, which may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, may be prepared according to conventional techniques well known in the pharmaceutical industry. Such techniques include the step of bringing into association the active ingredients with the pharmaceutical carrier(s) or excipient(s). In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredients with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.\n\n\nThe compositions of the present invention may be formulated into any of many possible dosage forms such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gel capsules, liquid syrups, soft gels, suppositories, and enemas. The compositions of the present invention may also be formulated as suspensions in aqueous, non-aqueous or mixed media. Aqueous suspensions may further contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension including, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran. The suspension may also contain stabilizers.\n\n\nEmulsions\n\n\nThe compositions of the present invention may be prepared and formulated as emulsions. Emulsions are typically heterogenous systems of one liquid dispersed in another in the form of droplets usually exceeding 0.1.mu·m in diameter (Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 199; Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nVolume\n 1, p. 245; Block in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 2, p. 335; Higuchi et al., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 301). Emulsions are often biphasic systems comprising two immiscible liquid phases intimately mixed and dispersed with each other. In general, emulsions may be of either the water-in-oil (w/o) or the oil-in-water (o/w) variety. When an aqueous phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk oily phase, the resulting composition is called a water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion. Alternatively, when an oily phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk aqueous phase, the resulting composition is called an oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion. Emulsions may contain additional components in addition to the dispersed phases, and the active drug which may be present as a solution in either the aqueous phase, oily phase or itself as a separate phase. Pharmaceutical excipients such as emulsifiers, stabilizers, dyes, and anti-oxidants may also be present in emulsions as needed. Pharmaceutical emulsions may also be multiple emulsions that are comprised of more than two phases such as, for example, in the case of oil-in-water-in-oil (o/w/o) and water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) emulsions. Such complex formulations often provide certain advantages that simple binary emulsions do not. Multiple emulsions in which individual oil droplets of an o/w emulsion enclose small water droplets constitute a w/o/w emulsion. Likewise a system of oil droplets enclosed in globules of water stabilized in an oily continuous phase provides an o/w/o emulsion.\n\n\nEmulsions are characterized by little or no thermodynamic stability. Often, the dispersed or discontinuous phase of the emulsion is well dispersed into the external or continuous phase and maintained in this form through the means of emulsifiers or the viscosity of the formulation. Either of the phases of the emulsion may be a semisolid or a solid, as is the case of emulsion-style ointment bases and creams. Other means of stabilizing emulsions entail the use of emulsifiers that may be incorporated into either phase of the emulsion. Emulsifiers may broadly be classified into four categories: synthetic surfactants, naturally occurring emulsifiers, absorption bases, and finely dispersed solids (Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 199).\n\n\nSynthetic surfactants, also known as surface active agents, have found wide applicability in the formulation of emulsions and have been reviewed in the literature (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 285; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, \nvolume\n 1, p. 199). Surfactants are typically amphiphilic and comprise a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic portion. The ratio of the hydrophilic to the hydrophobic nature of the surfactant has been termed the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB) and is a valuable tool in categorizing and selecting surfactants in the preparation of formulations. Surfactants may be classified into different classes based on the nature of the hydrophilic group: nonionic, anionic, cationic and amphoteric (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 285).\n\n\nNaturally occurring emulsifiers used in emulsion formulations include lanolin, beeswax, phosphatides, lecithin and acacia. Absorption bases possess hydrophilic properties such that they can soak up water to form w/o emulsions yet retain their semisolid consistencies, such as anhydrous lanolin and hydrophilic petrolatum. Finely divided solids have also been used as good emulsifiers especially in combination with surfactants and in viscous preparations. These include polar inorganic solids, such as heavy metal hydroxides, nonswelling clays such as bentonite, attapulgite, hectorite, kaolin, montmorillonite, colloidal aluminum silicate and colloidal magnesium aluminum silicate, pigments and nonpolar solids such as carbon or glyceryl tristearate.\n\n\nA large variety of non-emulsifying materials are also included in emulsion formulations and contribute to the properties of emulsions. These include fats, oils, waxes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty esters, humectants, hydrophilic colloids, preservatives and antioxidants (Block, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 335; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 199).\n\n\nHydrophilic colloids or hydrocolloids include naturally occurring gums and synthetic polymers such as polysaccharides (for example, acacia, agar, alginic acid, carrageenan, guar gum, karaya gum, and tragacanth), cellulose derivatives (for example, carboxymethylcellulose and carboxypropylcellulose), and synthetic polymers (for example, carbomers, cellulose ethers, and carboxyvinyl polymers). These disperse or swell in water to form colloidal solutions that stabilize emulsions by forming strong interfacial films around the dispersed-phase droplets and by increasing the viscosity of the external phase.\n\n\nSince emulsions often contain a number of ingredients such as carbohydrates, proteins, sterols and phosphatides that may readily support the growth of microbes, these formulations often incorporate preservatives. Commonly used preservatives included in emulsion formulations include methyl paraben, propyl paraben, quaternary ammonium salts, benzalkonium chloride, esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and boric acid. Antioxidants are also commonly added to emulsion formulations to prevent deterioration of the formulation. Antioxidants used may be free radical scavengers such as tocopherols, alkyl gallates, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, or reducing agents such as ascorbic acid and sodium metabisulfite, and antioxidant synergists such as citric acid, tartaric acid, and lecithin.\n\n\nThe application of emulsion formulations via dermatological, oral and parenteral routes and methods for their manufacture have been reviewed in the literature (Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 199). Emulsion formulations for oral delivery have been very widely used because of ease of formulation, as well as efficacy from an absorption and bioavailability standpoint (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 245; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 199). Mineral-oil base laxatives, oil-soluble vitamins and high fat nutritive preparations are among the materials that have commonly been administered orally as o/w emulsions.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the compositions of dsRNAs and nucleic acids are formulated as microemulsions. A microemulsion may be defined as a system of water, oil and amphiphile which is a single optically isotropic and thermodynamically stable liquid solution (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 245). Typically microemulsions are systems that are prepared by first dispersing an oil in an aqueous surfactant solution and then adding a sufficient amount of a fourth component, generally an intermediate chain-length alcohol to form a transparent system. Therefore, microemulsions have also been described as thermodynamically stable, isotropically clear dispersions of two immiscible liquids that are stabilized by interfacial films of surface-active molecules (Leung and Shah, in: Controlled Release of Drugs: Polymers and Aggregate Systems, Rosoff, M., Ed., 1989, VCH Publishers, New York, pages 185-215). Microemulsions commonly are prepared via a combination of three to five components that include oil, water, surfactant, cosurfactant and electrolyte. Whether the microemulsion is of the water-in-oil (w/o) or an oil-in-water (o/w) type is dependent on the properties of the oil and surfactant used and on the structure and geometric packing of the polar heads and hydrocarbon tails of the surfactant molecules (Schott, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 271).\n\n\nThe phenomenological approach utilizing phase diagrams has been extensively studied and has yielded a comprehensive knowledge, to one skilled in the art, of how to formulate microemulsions (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 245; Block, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 335). Compared to conventional emulsions, microemulsions offer the advantage of solubilizing water-insoluble drugs in a formulation of thermodynamically stable droplets that are formed spontaneously.\n\n\nSurfactants used in the preparation of microemulsions include, but are not limited to, ionic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants, Brij 96, polyoxyethylene oleyl ethers, polyglycerol fatty acid esters, tetraglycerol monolaurate (ML310), tetraglycerol monooleate (MO310), hexaglycerol monooleate (PO310), hexaglycerol pentaoleate (PO500), decaglycerol monocaprate (MCA750), decaglycerol monooleate (MO750), decaglycerol sequioleate (SO750), decaglycerol decaoleate (DAO750), alone or in combination with cosurfactants. The cosurfactant, usually a short-chain alcohol such as ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol, serves to increase the interfacial fluidity by penetrating into the surfactant film and consequently creating a disordered film because of the void space generated among surfactant molecules. Microemulsions may, however, be prepared without the use of cosurfactants and alcohol-free self-emulsifying microemulsion systems are known in the art. The aqueous phase may typically be, but is not limited to, water, an aqueous solution of the drug, glycerol, PEG300, PEG400, polyglycerols, propylene glycols, and derivatives of ethylene glycol. The oil phase may include, but is not limited to, materials such as Captex 300, Captex 355, Capmul MCM, fatty acid esters, medium chain (C8-C12) mono, di, and tri-glycerides, polyoxyethylated glyceryl fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, polyglycolized glycerides, saturated polyglycolized C8-C10 glycerides, vegetable oils and silicone oil.\n\n\nMicroemulsions are particularly of interest from the standpoint of drug solubilization and the enhanced absorption of drugs. Lipid based microemulsions (both o/w and w/o) have been proposed to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs, including peptides (Constantinides et al., Pharmaceutical Research, 1994, 11, 1385-1390; Ritschel, Meth. Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol., 1993, 13, 205). Microemulsions afford advantages of improved drug solubilization, protection of drug from enzymatic hydrolysis, possible enhancement of drug absorption due to surfactant-induced alterations in membrane fluidity and permeability, ease of preparation, ease of oral administration over solid dosage forms, improved clinical potency, and decreased toxicity (Constantinides et al., Pharmaceutical Research, 1994, 11, 1385; Ho et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 1996, 85, 138-143). Often microemulsions may form spontaneously when their components are brought together at ambient temperature. This may be particularly advantageous when formulating thermolabile drugs, peptides or dsRNAs. Microemulsions have also been effective in the transdermal delivery of active components in both cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. It is expected that the microemulsion compositions and formulations of the present invention will facilitate the increased systemic absorption of dsRNAs and nucleic acids from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as improve the local cellular uptake of dsRNAs and nucleic acids.\n\n\nMicroemulsions of the present invention may also contain additional components and additives such as sorbitan monostearate (Grill 3), Labrasol, and penetration enhancers to improve the properties of the formulation and to enhance the absorption of the dsRNAs and nucleic acids of the present invention. Penetration enhancers used in the microemulsions of the present invention may be classified as belonging to one of five broad categories—surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating non-surfactants (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92). Each of these classes has been discussed above.\n\n\nLiposomes\n\n\nThere are many organized surfactant structures besides microemulsions that have been studied and used for the formulation of drugs. These include monolayers, micelles, bilayers and vesicles. Vesicles, such as liposomes, have attracted great interest because of their specificity and the duration of action they offer from the standpoint of drug delivery. As used in the present invention, the term “liposome” means a vesicle composed of amphiphilic lipids arranged in a spherical bilayer or bilayers.\n\n\nLiposomes are unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles which have a membrane formed from a lipophilic material and an aqueous interior. The aqueous portion contains the composition to be delivered. Cationic liposomes possess the advantage of being able to fuse to the cell wall. Non-cationic liposomes, although not able to fuse as efficiently with the cell wall, are taken up by macrophages in vivo.\n\n\nIn order to cross intact mammalian skin, lipid vesicles must pass through a series of fine pores, each with a diameter less than 50 nm, under the influence of a suitable transdermal gradient. Therefore, it is desirable to use a liposome which is highly deformable and able to pass through such fine pores.\n\n\nFurther advantages of liposomes include; liposomes obtained from natural phospholipids are biocompatible and biodegradable; liposomes can incorporate a wide range of water and lipid soluble drugs; liposomes can protect encapsulated drugs in their internal compartments from metabolism and degradation (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 245). Important considerations in the preparation of liposome formulations are the lipid surface charge, vesicle size and the aqueous volume of the liposomes.\n\n\nLiposomes are useful for the transfer and delivery of active ingredients to the site of action. Because the liposomal membrane is structurally similar to biological membranes, when liposomes are applied to a tissue, the liposomes start to merge with the cellular membranes and as the merging of the liposome and cell progresses, the liposomal contents are emptied into the cell where the active agent may act.\n\n\nLiposomal formulations have been the focus of extensive investigation as the mode of delivery for many drugs. There is growing evidence that for topical administration, liposomes present several advantages over other formulations. Such advantages include reduced side-effects related to high systemic absorption of the administered drug, increased accumulation of the administered drug at the desired target, and the ability to administer a wide variety of drugs, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic, into the skin.\n\n\nSeveral reports have detailed the ability of liposomes to deliver agents including high-molecular weight DNA into the skin. Compounds including analgesics, antibodies, hormones and high-molecular weight DNAs have been administered to the skin. The majority of applications resulted in the targeting of the upper epidermis\n\n\nLiposomes fall into two broad classes. Cationic liposomes are positively charged liposomes which interact with the negatively charged DNA molecules to form a stable complex. The positively charged DNA/liposome complex binds to the negatively charged cell surface and is internalized in an endosome. Due to the acidic pH within the endosome, the liposomes are ruptured, releasing their contents into the cell cytoplasm (Wang et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1987, 147, 980-985).\n\n\nLiposomes which are pH-sensitive or negatively-charged, entrap DNA rather than complex with it. Since both the DNA and the lipid are similarly charged, repulsion rather than complex formation occurs. Nevertheless, some DNA is entrapped within the aqueous interior of these liposomes. pH-sensitive liposomes have been used to deliver DNA encoding the thymidine kinase gene to cell monolayers in culture. Expression of the exogenous gene was detected in the target cells (Zhou et al., Journal of Controlled Release, 1992, 19, 269-274).\n\n\nOne major type of liposomal composition includes phospholipids other than naturally-derived phosphatidylcholine. Neutral liposome compositions, for example, can be formed from dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Anionic liposome compositions generally are formed from dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, while anionic fusogenic liposomes are formed primarily from dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE). Another type of liposomal composition is formed from phosphatidylcholine (PC) such as, for example, soybean PC, and egg PC. Another type is formed from mixtures of phospholipid and/or phosphatidylcholine and/or cholesterol.\n\n\nSeveral studies have assessed the topical delivery of liposomal drug formulations to the skin. Application of liposomes containing interferon to guinea pig skin resulted in a reduction of skin herpes sores while delivery of interferon via other means (e.g., as a solution or as an emulsion) were ineffective (Weiner et al., Journal of Drug Targeting, 1992, 2, 405-410). Further, an additional study tested the efficacy of interferon administered as part of a liposomal formulation to the administration of interferon using an aqueous system, and concluded that the liposomal formulation was superior to aqueous administration (du Plessis et al., Antiviral Research, 1992, 18, 259-265).\n\n\nNon-ionic liposomal systems have also been examined to determine their utility in the delivery of drugs to the skin, in particular systems comprising non-ionic surfactant and cholesterol. Non-ionic liposomal formulations comprising Novasome.™. I (glyceryl dilaurate/cholesterol/po-lyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether) and Novasome.™. II (glyceryl distearate/cholesterol/polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether) were used to deliver cyclosporin-A into the dermis of mouse skin. Results indicated that such non-ionic liposomal systems were effective in facilitating the deposition of cyclosporin-A into different layers of the skin (Hu et al. S.T.P. Pharma. Sci., 1994, 4, 6, 466).\n\n\nLiposomes also include “sterically stabilized” liposomes, a term which, as used herein, refers to liposomes comprising one or more specialized lipids that, when incorporated into liposomes, result in enhanced circulation lifetimes relative to liposomes lacking such specialized lipids. Examples of sterically stabilized liposomes are those in which part of the vesicle-forming lipid portion of the liposome (A) comprises one or more glycolipids, such as monosialoganglioside GM\n1\n, or (B) is derivatized with one or more hydrophilic polymers, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is thought in the art that, at least for sterically stabilized liposomes containing gangliosides, sphingomyelin, or PEG-derivatized lipids, the enhanced circulation half-life of these sterically stabilized liposomes derives from a reduced uptake into cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (Allen et al., FEBS Letters, 1987, 223, 42; Wu et al., Cancer Research, 1993, 53, 3765).\n\n\nVarious liposomes comprising one or more glycolipids are known in the art. Papahadjopoulos et al. (Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 1987, 507, 64) reported the ability of monosialoganglioside GM\n1\n, galactocerebroside sulfate and phosphatidylinositol to improve blood half-lives of liposomes. These findings were expounded upon by Gabizon et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1988, 85, 6949). U.S. Pat. No. 4,837,028 and WO 88/04924, both to Allen et al., disclose liposomes comprising (1) sphingomyelin and (2) the ganglioside GM\n1 \nor a galactocerebroside sulfate ester. U.S. Pat. No. 5,543,152 (Webb et al.) discloses liposomes comprising sphingomyelin. Liposomes comprising 1,2-sn-dimyristoylphosphat-idylcholine are disclosed in WO 97/13499 (Lim et al).\n\n\nMany liposomes comprising lipids derivatized with one or more hydrophilic polymers, and methods of preparation thereof, are known in the art. Sunamoto et al. (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 1980, 53, 2778) described liposomes comprising a nonionic detergent, 2C\n12\n15G, that contains a PEG moiety. Illum et al. (FEBS Lett., 1984, 167, 79) noted that hydrophilic coating of polystyrene particles with polymeric glycols results in significantly enhanced blood half-lives. Synthetic phospholipids modified by the attachment of carboxylic groups of polyalkylene glycols (e.g., PEG) are described by Sears (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,426,330 and 4,534,899). Klibanov et al. (FEBS Lett., 1990, 268, 235) described experiments demonstrating that liposomes comprising phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) derivatized with PEG or PEG stearate have significant increases in blood circulation half-lives. Blume et al. (Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1990, 1029, 91) extended such observations to other PEG-derivatized phospholipids, e.g., DSPE-PEG, formed from the combination of distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE) and PEG. Liposomes having covalently bound PEG moieties on their external surface are described in European Patent No. EP 0 445 131 B1 and WO 90/04384 to Fisher. Liposome compositions containing 1-20 mole percent of PE derivatized with PEG, and methods of use thereof, are described by Woodle et al. (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,013,556 and 5,356,633) and Martin et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,213,804 and European Patent No. EP 0 496 813 B1). Liposomes comprising a number of other lipid-polymer conjugates are disclosed in WO 91/05545 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,212 (both to Martin et al.) and in WO 94/20073 (Zalipsky et al.) Liposomes comprising PEG-modified ceramide lipids are described in WO 96/10391 (Choi et al). U.S. Pat. No. 5,540,935 (Miyazaki et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,556,948 (Tagawa et al.) describe PEG-containing liposomes that can be further derivatized with functional moieties on their surfaces.\n\n\nA limited number of liposomes comprising nucleic acids are known in the art. WO 96/40062 to Thierry et al. discloses methods for encapsulating high molecular weight nucleic acids in liposomes. U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,221 to Tagawa et al. discloses protein-bonded liposomes and asserts that the contents of such liposomes may include an dsRNA RNA. U.S. Pat. No. 5,665,710 to Rahman et al. describes certain methods of encapsulating oligodeoxynucleotides in liposomes. WO 97/04787 to Love et al. discloses liposomes comprising dsRNA dsRNAs targeted to the raf gene.\n\n\nTransfersomes are yet another type of liposomes, and are highly deformable lipid aggregates which are attractive candidates for drug delivery vehicles. Transfersomes may be described as lipid droplets which are so highly deformable that they are easily able to penetrate through pores which are smaller than the droplet. Transfersomes are adaptable to the environment in which they are used, e.g., they are self-optimizing (adaptive to the shape of pores in the skin), self-repairing, frequently reach their targets without fragmenting, and often self-loading. To make transfersomes it is possible to add surface edge-activators, usually surfactants, to a standard liposomal composition. Transfersomes have been used to deliver serum albumin to the skin. The transfersome-mediated delivery of serum albumin has been shown to be as effective as subcutaneous injection of a solution containing serum albumin.\n\n\nSurfactants find wide application in formulations such as emulsions (including microemulsions) and liposomes. The most common way of classifying and ranking the properties of the many different types of surfactants, both natural and synthetic, is by the use of the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB). The nature of the hydrophilic group (also known as the “head”) provides the most useful means for categorizing the different surfactants used in formulations (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, p. 285).\n\n\nIf the surfactant molecule is not ionized, it is classified as a nonionic surfactant. Nonionic surfactants find wide application in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products and are usable over a wide range of pH values. In general their HLB values range from 2 to about 18 depending on their structure. Nonionic surfactants include nonionic esters such as ethylene glycol esters, propylene glycol esters, glyceryl esters, polyglyceryl esters, sorbitan esters, sucrose esters, and ethoxylated esters. Nonionic alkanolamides and ethers such as fatty alcohol ethoxylates, propoxylated alcohols, and ethoxylated/propoxylated block polymers are also included in this class. The polyoxyethylene surfactants are the most popular members of the nonionic surfactant class.\n\n\nIf the surfactant molecule carries a negative charge when it is dissolved or dispersed in water, the surfactant is classified as anionic. Anionic surfactants include carboxylates such as soaps, acyl lactylates, acyl amides of amino acids, esters of sulfuric acid such as alkyl sulfates and ethoxylated alkyl sulfates, sulfonates such as alkyl benzene sulfonates, acyl isethionates, acyl taurates and sulfosuccinates, and phosphates. The most important members of the anionic surfactant class are the alkyl sulfates and the soaps.\n\n\nIf the surfactant molecule carries a positive charge when it is dissolved or dispersed in water, the surfactant is classified as cationic. Cationic surfactants include quaternary ammonium salts and ethoxylated amines. The quaternary ammonium salts are the most used members of this class.\n\n\nIf the surfactant molecule has the ability to carry either a positive or negative charge, the surfactant is classified as amphoteric. Amphoteric surfactants include acrylic acid derivatives, substituted alkylamides, N-alkylbetaines and phosphatides.\n\n\nThe use of surfactants in drug products, formulations and in emulsions has been reviewed (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, p. 285).\n\n\nPenetration Enhancers\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the present invention employs various penetration enhancers to effect the efficient delivery of nucleic acids, particularly dsRNAs, to the skin of animals. Most drugs are present in solution in both ionized and nonionized forms. However, usually only lipid soluble or lipophilic drugs readily cross cell membranes. It has been discovered that even non-lipophilic drugs may cross cell membranes if the membrane to be crossed is treated with a penetration enhancer. In addition to aiding the diffusion of non-lipophilic drugs across cell membranes, penetration enhancers also enhance the permeability of lipophilic drugs.\n\n\nPenetration enhancers may be classified as belonging to one of five broad categories, i.e., surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating non-surfactants (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92). Each of the above mentioned classes of penetration enhancers are described below in greater detail.\n\n\nSurfactants: In connection with the present invention, surfactants (or “surface-active agents”) are chemical entities which, when dissolved in an aqueous solution, reduce the surface tension of the solution or the interfacial tension between the aqueous solution and another liquid, with the result that absorption of dsRNAs through the mucosa is enhanced. In addition to bile salts and fatty acids, these penetration enhancers include, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether and polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92); and perfluorochemical emulsions, such as FC-43. Takahashi et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1988, 40, 252).\n\n\nFatty acids: Various fatty acids and their derivatives which act as penetration enhancers include, for example, oleic acid, lauric acid, capric acid (n-decanoic acid), myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monoolein (1-monooleoyl-rac-glycerol), dilaurin, caprylic acid, arachidonic acid, glycerol 1-monocaprate, 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, acylcarnitines, acylcholines, C\n1-10 \nalkyl esters thereof (e.g., methyl, isopropyl and t-butyl), and mono- and di-glycerides thereof (i.e., oleate, laurate, caprate, myristate, palmitate, stearate, linoleate, etc.) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33; El Hariri et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1992, 44, 651-654).\n\n\nBile salts: The physiological role of bile includes the facilitation of dispersion and absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins (Brunton, Chapter 38 in: Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Ed., Hardman et al. Eds., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996, pp. 934-935). Various natural bile salts, and their synthetic derivatives, act as penetration enhancers. Thus the term “bile salts” includes any of the naturally occurring components of bile as well as any of their synthetic derivatives. Suitable bile salts include, for example, cholic acid (or its pharmaceutically acceptable sodium salt, sodium cholate), dehydrocholic acid (sodium dehydrocholate), deoxycholic acid (sodium deoxycholate), glucholic acid (sodium glucholate), glycholic acid (sodium glycocholate), glycodeoxycholic acid (sodium glycodeoxycholate), taurocholic acid (sodium taurocholate), taurodeoxycholic acid (sodium taurodeoxycholate), chenodeoxycholic acid (sodium chenodeoxycholate), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), sodium tauro-24,25-dihydro-fusidate (STDHF), sodium glycodihydrofusidate and polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether (POE) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92; Swinyard, Chapter 39 In: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990, pages 782-783; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33; Yamamoto et al., J. Pharm. Exp. Ther., 1992, 263, 25; Yamashita et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 1990, 79, 579-583).\n\n\nChelating Agents: Chelating agents, as used in connection with the present invention, can be defined as compounds that remove metallic ions from solution by forming complexes therewith, with the result that absorption of dsRNAs through the mucosa is enhanced. With regards to their use as penetration enhancers in the present invention, chelating agents have the added advantage of also serving as DNase inhibitors, as most characterized DNA nucleases require a divalent metal ion for catalysis and are thus inhibited by chelating agents (Jarrett, J. Chromatogr., 1993, 618, 315-339). Suitable chelating agents include but are not limited to disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), citric acid, salicylates (e.g., sodium salicylate, 5-methoxysalicylate and homovanilate), N-acyl derivatives of collagen, laureth-9 and N-amino acyl derivatives of beta-diketones (enamines) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33; Buur et al., J. Control Rel., 1990, 14, 43-51).\n\n\nNon-chelating non-surfactants: As used herein, non-chelating non-surfactant penetration enhancing compounds can be defined as compounds that demonstrate insignificant activity as chelating agents or as surfactants but that nonetheless enhance absorption of dsRNAs through the alimentary mucosa (Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33). This class of penetration enhancers include, for example, unsaturated cyclic ureas, 1-alkyl- and 1-alkenylazacyclo-alkanone derivatives (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92); and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as diclofenac sodium, indomethacin and phenylbutazone (Yamashita et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1987, 39, 621-626).\n\n\nAgents that enhance uptake of dsRNAs at the cellular level may also be added to the pharmaceutical and other compositions of the present invention. For example, cationic lipids, such as lipofectin (Junichi et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,188), cationic glycerol derivatives, and polycationic molecules, such as polylysine (Lollo et al., PCT Application WO 97/30731), are also known to enhance the cellular uptake of dsRNAs.\n\n\nOther agents may be utilized to enhance the penetration of the administered nucleic acids, including glycols such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, pyrrols such as 2-pyrrol, azones, and terpenes such as limonene and menthone.\n\n\nCarriers\n\n\nCertain compositions of the present invention also incorporate carrier compounds in the formulation. As used herein, “carrier compound” or “carrier” can refer to a nucleic acid, or analog thereof, which is inert (i.e., does not possess biological activity per se) but is recognized as a nucleic acid by in vivo processes that reduce the bioavailability of a nucleic acid having biological activity by, for example, degrading the biologically active nucleic acid or promoting its removal from circulation. The coadministration of a nucleic acid and a carrier compound, typically with an excess of the latter substance, can result in a substantial reduction of the amount of nucleic acid recovered in the liver, kidney or other extracirculatory reservoirs, presumably due to competition between the carrier compound and the nucleic acid for a common receptor. For example, the recovery of a partially phosphorothioate dsRNA in hepatic tissue can be reduced when it is coadministered with polyinosinic acid, dextran sulfate, polycytidic acid or 4-acetamido-4′isothiocyano-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (Miyao et al., DsRNA Res. Dev., 1995, 5, 115-121; Takakura et al., DsRNA & Nucl. Acid Drug Dev., 1996, 6, 177-183.\n\n\nExcipients\n\n\nIn contrast to a carrier compound, a “pharmaceutical carrier” or “excipient” is a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, suspending agent or any other pharmacologically inert vehicle for delivering one or more nucleic acids to an animal. The excipient may be liquid or solid and is selected, with the planned manner of administration in mind, so as to provide for the desired bulk, consistency, etc., when combined with a nucleic acid and the other components of a given pharmaceutical composition. Typical pharmaceutical carriers include, but are not limited to, binding agents (e.g., pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, etc.); fillers (e.g., lactose and other sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, pectin, gelatin, calcium sulfate, ethyl cellulose, polyacrylates or calcium hydrogen phosphate, etc.); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, silica, colloidal silicon dioxide, stearic acid, metallic stearates, hydrogenated vegetable oils, corn starch, polyethylene glycols, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, etc.); disintegrants (e.g., starch, sodium starch glycolate, etc.); and wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate, etc).\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic excipient suitable for non-parenteral administration which do not deleteriously react with nucleic acids can also be used to formulate the compositions of the present invention. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, water, salt solutions, alcohols, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like.\n\n\nFormulations for topical administration of nucleic acids may include sterile and non-sterile aqueous solutions, non-aqueous solutions in common solvents such as alcohols, or solutions of the nucleic acids in liquid or solid oil bases. The solutions may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives. Pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic excipients suitable for non-parenteral administration which do not deleteriously react with nucleic acids can be used.\n\n\nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include, but are not limited to, water, salt solutions, alcohol, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like.\n\n\nOther Components\n\n\nThe compositions of the present invention may additionally contain other adjunct components conventionally found in pharmaceutical compositions, at their art-established usage levels. Thus, for example, the compositions may contain additional, compatible, pharmaceutically-active materials such as, for example, antipruritics, astringents, local anesthetics or anti-inflammatory agents, or may contain additional materials useful in physically formulating various dosage forms of the compositions of the present invention, such as dyes, flavoring agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opacifiers, thickening agents and stabilizers. However, such materials, when added, should not unduly interfere with the biological activities of the components of the compositions of the present invention. The formulations can be sterilized and, if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously interact with the nucleic acid(s) of the formulation.\n\n\nAqueous suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension including, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran. The suspension may also contain stabilizers.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions featured in the invention include (a) one or more dsRNA compounds and (b) one or more other chemotherapeutic agents which function by a non-RNAi mechanism. Examples of such chemotherapeutic agents include but are not limited to daunorubicin, daunomycin, dactinomycin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, esorubicin, bleomycin, mafosfamide, ifosfamide, cytosine arabinoside, bis-chloroethylnitrosurea, busulfan, mitomycin C, actinomycin D, mithramycin, prednisone, hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, tamoxifen, dacarbazine, procarbazine, hexamethylmelamine, pentamethylmelamine, mitoxantrone, amsacrine, chlorambucil, methylcyclohexylnitrosurea, nitrogen mustards, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-azacytidine, hydroxyurea, deoxycoformycin, 4-hydroxyperoxycyclophosphor-amide, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FUdR), methotrexate (MTX), colchicine, taxol, vincristine, vinblastine, etoposide (VP-16), trimetrexate, irinotecan, topotecan, gemcitabine, teniposide, cisplatin and diethylstilbestrol (DES). See, generally, The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 15th Ed. 1987, pp. 1206-1228, Berkow et al., eds., Rahway, N.J. When used with the dsRNAs featured in the invention, such chemotherapeutic agents may be used individually (e.g., 5-FU and oligonucleotide), sequentially (e.g., 5-FU and oligonucleotide for a period of time followed by MTX and oligonucleotide), or in combination with one or more other such chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., 5-FU, MTX and oligonucleotide, or 5-FU, radiotherapy and oligonucleotide). Anti-inflammatory drugs, including but not limited to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids, and antiviral drugs, including but not limited to ribivirin, vidarabine, acyclovir and ganciclovir, may also be combined in compositions featured in the invention. See, generally, The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 15th Ed., Berkow et al., eds., 1987, Rahway, N.J., pages 2499-2506 and 46-49, respectively). Other non-RNAi chemotherapeutic agents are also within the scope of this invention. Two or more combined compounds may be used together or sequentially.\n\n\nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are typical.\n\n\nThe data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulation a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of compositions featured in the invention lies generally within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods featured in the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range of the compound or, when appropriate, of the polypeptide product of a target sequence (e.g., achieving a decreased concentration of the polypeptide) that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.\n\n\nIn addition to their administration, as discussed above, the dsRNAs featured in the invention can be administered in combination with other known agents effective in treatment of pathological processes mediated by XBP-1 expression. In any event, the administering physician can adjust the amount and timing of dsRNA administration on the basis of results observed using standard measures of efficacy known in the art or described herein.\n\n\nMethods for Treating Diseases Caused by Expression of the XBP-1 Gene\n\n\nThe invention relates in particular to the use of a dsRNA targeting XBP-1 and compositions containing at least one such dsRNA, for the treatment of an XBP-1-mediated disorder or disease. For example, a dsRNA targeting an XBP-1 gene can be useful for the treatment of a metabolic disease, such as Type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome, or a cardiovascular disease. “Metabolic syndrome” (also called metabolic syndrome X, X syndrome, insulin resistance syndrome, Reaven's syndrome, and CHAOS) is characterized by a group of metabolic risk factors including: abdominal obesity (excessive fat tissue in and around the abdomen), atherogenic dyslipidemia (blood fat disorders (including high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol) that foster plaque build-up in artery walls), elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance or glucose intolerance (due to the body's inability to properly use insulin or blood sugar), a prothrombotic state (e.g., high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in the blood), and a proinflammatory state (e.g., elevated C-reactive protein in the blood). People with metabolic syndrome are at increased risk of coronary heart disease and other diseases related to plaque buildups in artery walls (e.g., stroke and peripheral vascular disease), and Type II diabetes. A “cardiovascular disease,” as used herein is a disorder that affects the heart or blood vessels, such as atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, congenital heart disease, aneurysm, a heart valve disease, a heart infection, or cardiomyopathy. Other metabolic diseases suitable for treatment with a dsRNA targeting XBP-1 include obesity and insulin resistance.\n\n\nA dsRNA targeting XBP-1 is also useful for the treatment of a dyslipidemia, such as a hyperlidipemia (e.g., hypercholesterolemia), or a disorder associated with a dyslipidemia, such as atherosclerosis. A “hyperlipidemia” refers to elevated lipid levels in the blood (e.g., in plasma), such as elevated levels of one or more of cholesterol, LDL (low density lipoprotein), VLDL (very low density lipoprotein), triglycerides, or chylomicrons.\n\n\nA dsRNA targeting XBP-1 is also useful for the treatment of liver disorders, such as a nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is a fatty inflammation of the liver not due to excessive use of alcohol, or cirrhosis. For example, a dsRNA targeting XBP-1 can be used to treat non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is one of the most extreme forms of NAFLD, and which is regarded as a major cause of cirrhosis of the liver of unknown cause.\n\n\nA dsRNA targeting XBP-1 can also be useful for the treatment of cancer, such as a leukemia, e.g., ATLL. A dsRNA targeting XBP-1 can also be used to treat a myelopathy, e.g., tropical spastic paresis (TSP). TSP is a chronic and progressive disease of the nervous system that typically affects adults living in equatorial areas of the world and can cause progressive weakness, stiff muscles, muscle spasms, sensory disturbance, and sphincter dysfunction. A “myelopathy,” as used herein, is a neurological deficit related to the spinal cord.\n\n\nA composition containing a dsRNA targeting XBP-1 may also be used to treat other tumors and cancers, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, brain cancer, abdominal cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, glioma, tongue cancer, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, retinoblastoma, Wilm's tumor, multiple myeloma and for the treatment of skin cancer, like melanoma, for the treatment of lymphomas and blood cancer.\n\n\nOwing to the inhibitory effects on XBP-1 expression, a composition according to the invention or a pharmaceutical composition prepared therefrom can enhance the quality of life.\n\n\nThe invention further relates to the use of a dsRNA or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, e.g., for treating a metabolic disorder, cardiovascular disease, or an HTLV-1 mediated disorder, in combination with other pharmaceuticals and/or other therapeutic methods, e.g., with known pharmaceuticals and/or known therapeutic methods, such as, for example, those which are currently employed for treating these disorder. In one example, administration of a dsRNA targeting XBP-1 can be accompanied by a exercise regimen or by dietary restrictions. A dsRNA featured in the invention can also be administered with a drug or combination of drugs for managing Type II diabetes, e.g., a sulfonylurea, a biguanide, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, a thiazolidinedione (e.g., rosiglitazone or pioglitazone), a meglitinide, a D-phenylalanine derivative, an amylin synthetic derivatives, an incretin mimetic, metformin, or an insulin. Exemplary insulins include regular insulins (Humulin®, Novolin®), insulin lispro (Humalog®), insulin aspart (Novolog®), insulin glulisine (Apidra®), prompt insulin zinc (Semilente®, slightly slower acting), inhaled insulin (Exubera®), intermediate-acting insulins, isophane insulin, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH), insulin zinc (Lente®), extended insulin zinc insulin (Ultralente®), insulin glargine (Lantus®), and insulin detemir (Levemir®).\n\n\nIn another example, a composition containing a dsRNA targeting XBP-1 is administered in combination with a lipid-lowering drug, such as a statin, e.g., atorvastatin (Lipitor®) or simvastatin (Mevacor®); ezetimibe (Zetia®); a bile-acid sequestrant, such as Questran®; a fibrate, such as gemfibrozil (Lopid®) or fenofibrate (Tricor); or a compound that raises HDL levels, such as nicotinic acid (Niacin).\n\n\nA dsRNA targeting XBP-1 can also be provided in combination with a vitamin, such as vitamin E or vitamin C, e.g., for treatment of a liver disorder, such as NAFLD or NASH.\n\n\nIn another example, a composition containing a dsRNA targeting XBP-1 is administered in combination with an antiviral drug, such as zidovudine, ribivirin, vidarabine, acyclovir and ganciclovir, or an anti-inflammatory drug, such as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroid. See, generally, The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 15th Ed., Berkow et al., eds., 1987, Rahway, N.J., pages 2499-2506 and 46-49, respectively). Administration can also be in combination with an interferon, such as interferon alpha or interferon beta; lioresal, tizanidine, or oxybutynin.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, administration is with a chemotherapy agent, such as deoxycoformycin, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, daunorubicin, tamoxifen aunorubicin, daunomycin, dactinomycin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, esorubicin, bleomycin, mafosfamide, ifosfamide, cytosine arabinoside, bis-chloroethylnitrosurea, busulfan, mitomycin C, actinomycin D, mithramycin, prednisone, hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, tamoxifen, dacarbazine, procarbazine, hexamethylmelamine, pentamethylmelamine, mitoxantrone, amsacrine, chlorambucil, methylcyclohexylnitrosurea, nitrogen mustards, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-azacytidine, hydroxyurea, deoxycoformycin, 4-hydroxyperoxycyclophosphoramide, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FUdR), methotrexate (MTX), colchicine, taxol, vincristine, vinblastine, etoposide (VP-16), trimetrexate, irinotecan, topotecan, gemcitabine, teniposide, cisplatin and diethylstilbestrol (DES). See, generally, The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 15th Ed. 1987, pp. 1206-1228, Berkow et al., eds., Rahway, N.J. When used with the dsRNAs featured in the invention, such chemotherapeutic agents may be used individually (e.g., deoxycoformycin and dsRNA), sequentially (e.g., antiviral and dsRNA for a period of time, followed by deoxycoformycin and dsRNA), or in combination with one or more other such agents (e.g., deoxycoformycin, antiviral and dsRNA, or deoxycoformycin, radiotherapy and dsRNA). Two or more combined compounds may be used together or sequentially.\n\n\nPatients can be administered a therapeutic amount of dsRNA, such as 0.02, 0.1, 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, or 2.5 mg/kg dsRNA. The dsRNA can be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of time, such as over a 5 minute, 10 minute, 15 minute, 20 minute, or 25 minute period. In some embodiments, the administration is repeated, for example, on a regular basis, such as biweekly (i.e., every two weeks) for one month, two months, three months, four months or longer. After an initial treatment regimen, the treatments can be administered on a less frequent basis. For example, after administration biweekly for three months, administration can be repeated once per month, for six months or a year or longer. Administration of the dsRNA can reduce LDL levels in the blood of the patient by at least 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% or more.\n\n\nBefore administration of a full dose of a dsRNA targeting XBP-1, a patient can be administered a smaller dose, such as a 5% infusion reaction, and monitored for adverse effects, such as an allergic reaction. In another example, the patient can be monitored for unwanted immunostimulatory effects, such as increased cytokine (e.g., TNF-alpha or INF-alpha) levels.\n\n\nMany XBP-1-associated diseases and disorders are hereditary. Therefore, a patient in need of a dsRNA targeting XBP-1 can be identified by taking a family history. A healthcare provider, such as a doctor, nurse, or family member, can take a family history before prescribing or administering a dsRNA. A DNA test may also be performed on the patient to identify a mutation in the target gene, before a dsRNA is administered to the patient.\n\n\nMethods for Inhibiting Expression of the XBP-1 Gene\n\n\nIn yet another aspect, the invention provides a method for inhibiting the expression of an XBP-1 gene in a mammal. The method includes administering a composition featured in the invention to the mammal such that expression of the target XBP-1 gene is silenced.\n\n\nWhen the organism to be treated is a mammal such as a human, the composition may be administered by any means known in the art including, but not limited to oral or parenteral routes, including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, transdermal, airway (aerosol), nasal, rectal, and topical (including buccal and sublingual) administration. In certain embodiments, the compositions are administered by intravenous infusion or injection.\n\n\nUnless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the dsRNAs and methods featured in the invention, suitable methods and materials are described below.

RNA and RNA containing 2′-O-methyl nucleotides were generated by solid phase synthesis employing the corresponding phosphoramidites and 2′-O-methyl phosphoramidites, respectively (Proligo Biochemie GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). These building blocks were incorporated at selected sites within the sequence of the oligoribonucleotide chain using standard nucleoside phosphoramidite chemistry such as described in Current protocols in nucleic acid chemistry, Beaucage, S. L. et al. (Edrs.), John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y., USA. Phosphorothioate linkages were introduced by replacement of the iodine oxidizer solution with a solution of the Beaucage reagent (Chruachem Ltd, Glasgow, UK) in acetonitrile (1%). Further ancillary reagents were obtained from Mallinckrodt Baker (Griesheim, Germany).\n\n\nDeprotection and purification of the crude oligoribonucleotides by anion exchange HPLC were carried out according to established procedures. Yields and concentrations were determined by UV absorption of a solution of the respective RNA at a wavelength of 260 nm using a spectral photometer (DU 640B, Beckman Coulter GmbH, Unterschleiβheim, Germany). Double stranded RNA was generated by mixing an equimolar solution of complementary strands in annealing buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8; 100 mM sodium chloride), heated in a water bath at 85-90° C. for 3 minutes and cooled to room temperature over a period of 3-4 hours. The annealed RNA solution was stored at −20° C. until use.\n\n\nFor the synthesis of 3′-cholesterol-conjugated siRNAs (herein referred to as -Chol-3′), an appropriately modified solid support is used for RNA synthesis. The modified solid support is prepared as follows:\n\n\nDiethyl-2-azabutane-1,4-dicarboxylate \nAA\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 4.7 M aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (50 mL) is added into a stirred, ice-cooled solution of ethyl glycinate hydrochloride (32.19 g, 0.23 mole) in water (50 mL).

The amidite solutions were prepared at 0.1M concentration and ethyl thio tetrazole (0.6M in acetonitrile) was used as an activator.\n\n\nThe synthesized sequences were cleaved and deprotected in 96-well plates, using methylamine in the first step and pyradine.3HF in the second step. The crude sequences thus obtained were precipitated using an acetone:ethanol mix, and the pellets were resuspended in 0.5M sodium acetate buffer. Samples from each sequence were analyzed by LC-MS and the resulting mass data confirmed the identity of the sequences. A selected set of samples was also analyzed by IEX chromatography.\n\n\nThe sequences were purified on an AKTA explorer purification system using a Source Q column. A single peak corresponding to the full length sequence was collected in the eluent and was subsequently analyzed for purity by ion exchange chromatography.\n\n\nThe purified sequences were desalted on a Sephadex G25 column using an AKTA purifier. The desalted XBP-1 sequences were analyzed for concentration and purity. The single strands were then submitted for annealing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nXBP-1 oligos with Endolight Chemistry Modifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

Experiment (% Knockdown Relative to Control 12 nM)\n\n\nTransfection of PC-3 cells was performed in 6-well plates: 31.25 μl (for 12.5 nM) of 200 nM duplex was added to 500 μl Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) in a well of a 6-well plate. 5 μl Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) was added to the wells, mixed and incubated for 15 minutes. 2.0 ml complete growth media without Antibiotics containing 0.6×10\n5 \ncells was added, and the mixture was mixed by rocking back and forth for 36 hours. Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was measured using a nanodrop and was diluted to 2 μg per 10 μl.\n\n\ncDNA was synthesized using an ABI High-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) and 2 μg total RNA. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using probes to amplify XBP-1 and 18S in the same reaction. All reactions were performed in triplicate.\n\n\nqPCR data were analyzed using the ΔΔCt method using BlockiT™ fluorescent Oligo (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), which does not target any human gene, as a negative control.\n\n\nGeneration of IC50s (for AD18028, AD18029, AD18037, AD18038, AD18040)\n\n\nIC50s were generated for the 5 duplexes that showed the best silencing in the single concentration experiment.\n\n\nThree sets of transfections were performed in two independent experiments using the dsRNAs shown in Table 4. In the first experiment, qPCR experiment 1 (qPCR1) and branched DNA (bDNA) results were obtained from different transfections that were done in parallel using the same cells and reagents. In the second experiment, qPCR2 results were generated from transfections that were done under the same conditions as the first experiment.\n\n\nTransfection of PC-3 cells was performed in 96-well plates. The duplex concentrations tested were 50 nM, 10 nM, 5 nM, 1 nM, 0.5 nM, 0.1 nM, 0.05 nM, 0.01 nM, 0.005 nM, 0.001 nM, 0.0005 nM, and 0.0001 nM. Each dsRNA was diluted so that 5 μl would be added to 100 μl for each transfection to give the desired concentration. Transfections were performed using Opti-MEM and lipofectamine, and then cultured in EMEM.\n\n\nRNA was extracted using an RNAqueous 96 kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, Tex.) according to manufactures instructions.\n\n\ncDNA synthesis and qPCR were done as described above, and qPCR data were analyzed using the ΔΔCt method using AD-3966 as a control, which targets the Sid1 gene but has been shown to have no activity in cell based assays.\n\n\nBranched DNA assays were performed using QuantiGene® 2.0 (Panomics, Fremont, Calif.). The bDNA data were analyzed by subtracting the average background from each triplicate sample, averaging the triplicate GAPDH (control probe) and TTR (experimental probe) then taking the ratio:\n\n\n(experimental probe-background)/(control probe-background).\n\n\nThe results are shown in Tables 5 and 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 results for XBP-1 dsRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIC50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman\n\n\nMouse\n\n\nRat\n\n\nRhesus\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\noligoName\n\n\nantisScore\n\n\nantisScore\n\n\n \nantisScore\n \n \nantisScore\n\n\nqPCR\n \n 1\n\n\nqPCR 2\n\n\nbDNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18027\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18028\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.019\n\n\n0.011\n\n\n0.034\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18029\n\n\n3\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n0.020\n\n\n0.026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18030\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18031\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18032\n\n\n3\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n3\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18033\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18034\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18035\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18036\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18037\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18038\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18039\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18040\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.057\n\n\n0.052\n\n\n0.065\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18041\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNH\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18042\n\n\n4\n\n\nNH\n\n\nNH\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18043\n\n\n4\n\n\nNH\n\n\nNH\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18044\n\n\n3.2\n\n\nNH\n\n\nNH\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18045\n\n\n3.2\n\n\nNH\n\n\nNH\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18046\n\n\n3.2\n\n\nNH\n\n\nNH\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18047\n\n\n3.2\n\n\nNH\n\n\nNH\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18048\n\n\n3.2\n\n\nNH\n\n\nNH\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18049\n\n\n3\n\n\nNH\n\n\nNH\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD18050\n\n\n3\n\n\nNH\n\n\nNH\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNH = No homology;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbold = perfect match with hamster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nXBP-1 Silencing Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nknockdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nrelative to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ncontrol\n\n\nIC50\n\n\nIC50\n\n\nIC50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(12 nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\noligo Name\n\n\n(36 hours)\n\n\n \nqPCR\n 1\n\n\nqPCR 2\n\n\nbDNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18027\n\n\n81.993\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18028\n\n\n90.581\n\n\n0.019\n\n\n0.011\n\n\n0.034\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18029\n\n\n97.749\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n0.02\n\n\n0.026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18030\n\n\n82.845\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18031\n\n\n34.782\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18032\n\n\n84.893\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18033\n\n\n68.971\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18034\n\n\n42.962\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18035\n\n\n82.076\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18036\n\n\n77.26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18037\n\n\n94.209\n\n\n0.016\n\n\n0.019\n\n\n0.016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18038\n\n\n93.239\n\n\n0.004\n\n\n0.003\n\n\n0.006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18039\n\n\n56.873\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18040\n\n\n93.75\n\n\n0.057\n\n\n0.052\n\n\n0.065\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18041\n\n\n84.396\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18042\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18043\n\n\n27.804\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18044\n\n\n64.316\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18045\n\n\n14.933\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18046\n\n\n−2.101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18047\n\n\n62.456\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18048\n\n\n74.534\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18049\n\n\n2.284\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAD18050\n\n\n59.621\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nScreening siRNA Sequences for Immunostimulatory Ability\n\n\nHuman PBMC were isolated from freshly collected buffy coats obtained from healthy donors (Research Blood Components, Inc., Boston, Mass.) by a standard Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation. Freshly isolated cells (1×10\n5\n/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured in RPMI 1640 GlutaMax medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen).\n\n\nsiRNAs were transfected into PBMC using two separate transfection reagents: GenePorter 2 (GP2; Genlantis) and DOTAP (Roche Applied Science). The transfection reagent was first diluted in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 5 minutes before mixing with an equal volume of Opti-MEM containing the siRNA. siRNA/transfection reagent complexes were incubated as specified by the reagent manufacturers' instructions and subsequently added to PBMC. siRNAs were used at a final concentration of 133 nM. The ratio of RNA to transfection reagent was 33 pmoles and 16.5 pmoles, respectively, per ul of GP2 and DOTAP.\n\n\nCytokines were detected and quantified in culture supernatants with a commercially available ELISA kit for IFN-α (BMS216INST) and TNF-α (BMS223INST); both from Bender MedSystems (Vienna, Austria).\n\n\nThe results are shown in Table 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nXBP-1 targeted siRNAs are not immunostimulatory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor human PBMC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDonor A\n\n\nDonor B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npg/ml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransfection\n\n\nIFN-Ξ\n\n\nTNF-Ξ\n\n\nIFN-Ξ\n\n\nTNF-Ξ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium only\n\n\n−36 ± 5 \n\n\n−20 ± 13\n\n\n−35 ± 7 \n\n\n125 ± 48\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOTAP only\n\n\n−49 ± 5 \n\n\n−39 ± 4 \n\n\n−36 ± 11\n\n\n110 ± 81\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD-1730\n\n\n −6 ± 11\n\n\n1859 ± 276\n\n\n141 ± 42\n\n\n1082 ± 181\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD-1955\n\n\n−35 ± 8 \n\n\n32 ± 7\n\n\n−40 ± 10\n\n\n 59 ± 27\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD-2153\n\n\n302 ± 32\n\n\n 62 ± 46\n\n\n531 ± 44\n\n\n158 ± 26\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD-5048\n\n\n473 ± 63\n\n\n1244 ± 217\n\n\n592 ± 41\n\n\n 785 ± 121\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD-18028\n\n\n−39 ± 9 \n\n\n−39 ± 7 \n\n\n−23 ± 16\n\n\n162 ± 49\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD-18029\n\n\n−35 ± 11\n\n\n−31 ± 8 \n\n\n−26 ± 16\n\n\n 24 ± 40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD-18037\n\n\n−28 ± 20\n\n\n−24 ± 14\n\n\n30 ± 6\n\n\n−44 ± 27\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD-18038\n\n\n−24 ± 18\n\n\n −5 ± 17\n\n\n−37 ± 11\n\n\n 32 ± 56\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD-18040\n\n\n−31 ± 17\n\n\n−12 ± 17\n\n\n−37 ± 8 \n\n\n−43 ± 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCytokine Responses of Whole PBMC to Duplex siRNAs Targeting XBP-1\n\n\nFreshly isolated PBMC from two normal donors (A and B) were transfected with test siRNAs using DOTAP and cultured for 24 hours. Subsequently, culture supernatants were collected and IFN-α and TNF-α levels measured by ELISA. AD-1730, AD-1955, and AD-2153 are sequences that bear no known homology to any human genes. AD-1730 and AD-2153 preferentially stimulate TNF-α and IFN-α, respectively. AD-5048 corresponds to a sequence that targets human Apolipoprotein B (Soutschek et al., 2004) and elicits both and IFN-α and TNF-α AD-1995 is a non-stimulatory sequence used as a negative control. The data shown are derived from a single experiment in which four replicate wells were transfected with each siRNA or were treated with either DOTAP or medium alone. Values represent the mean±standard deviation for four biological replicates.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nThe Effect of XBP-1 siRNA on Hepatic Lipogenesis in Mice\n\n\nDietary carbohydrates regulate hepatic lipogenesis by controlling the expression of critical enzymes in glycolysis and lipogenic pathways. XBP-1, a regulator of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), is important for de novo fatty acid synthesis in the liver, a function unrelated to its role in the UPR. (Lee et al., Science (2009) 320:1492-1496) XBP-1 protein expression is induced in the liver by a high carbohydrate diet and controls the induction of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. Selective deletion of XBP-1 in liver resulted in marked hypocholesterolemia and hypotriglyceridemia secondary to a decreased production of lipids from the liver. (Lee et al. (2009)) Notably, this phenotype was not accompanied by hepatic steatosis or significantly compromised protein secretory function.\n\n\nXBP-1 accelerates de novo fatty acid synthesis in the liver while preserving normal hepatic lipid composition, a profile that is highly relevant to the treatment of diseases, such as atherosclerosis, that are associated with dyspipidemia. Inhibition of XBP-1 may also be useful therapeutics for the treatment of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH), which lead to accelerated morbidity and mortality.\n\n\nIn order to determine whether XBP-1 downregulation by siRNAs would be an effective strategy to reduce lipid levels and treat dyslipidemias and metabolic syndromes, siRNAs were designed to target XBP-1.\n\n\nKnock-Down of XBP-1 mRNA in the Liver and Decrease of Plasma Cholesterol Levels by Lipidoid Formulated siRNA\n\n\nAnimal dosing: Bolus dosing of LNP01 formulated siRNAs in C57/BL6 mice (5/group, 18-20 g body weight, Charles River Laboratories, MA) was performed by low volume tail vein injection using a 27 G needle. Mice were dosed with two siRNAs targeting XBP-1 (LNP01-18037 and LNP01-18038) and a control luciferase targeting siRNA (LNP01-1955) at 5 and 7.5 mg/kg. Animals were kept under an infrared lamp for approximately 3 min prior to dosing to ease injection. 48 hour post dose animals were sacrificed by CO\n2\n-asphyxiation. 0.2 ml blood was collected by retro-orbital bleeding. Liver was harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Serum and livers were stored at −80° C. Total serum cholesterol in mouse serum was measured using the Wako Cholesterol E enzymatic colorimetric method (Wako Chemicals USA, Inc., Richmond, Va., USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Measurements were taken on a VersaMax™ Tunable microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.) using SoftMax® Pro software. Message levels of the target gene XBP-1 were measured via bDNA analysis as below.\n\n\nbDNA analysis: Frozen livers were grinded using 6850 Freezer/Mill Cryogenic Grinder (SPEX CentriPrep, Inc.) and powders stored at −80° C. until analysis.\n\n\nXBP-1 mRNA levels were detected using the branched-DNA technology based QuantiGene® Reagent System (Panomics, Fremont, Calif., U.S.A.) according to the protocol. 10-20 mg of frozen liver powders was lysed in 600 ul of 0.3 ug/ml Proteinase K (Epicentre®, #MPRK092) in Tissue and Cell Lysis Solution (Epicentre®, #MTC096H) at 65° C. for 1 hour. Then 10 ul of the lysates were added to 90 μl of Lysis Working Reagent (1 volume of stock Lysis Mixture in two volumes of water) and incubated at 55° C. overnight on Panomics capture plates with probe sets specific to mouse XBP-1 and mouse GAPDH (Panomics, U.S.A.). Capture plates then were processed for signal amplification and detection according to the protocol and chemiluminescence was read as relative light units (RLUs) on a microplate luminometer Victor2-Light (Perkin Elmer). The ratio of XBP-1 mRNA to GAPDH mRNA in liver lysates was averaged over each treatment group and compared to a control group treated with PBS\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 6\n, as compared to the PBS control, treatment of mice with compounds LNP01-18037, and LNP01-18038, but not with unrelated siRNA control LNP01-1955 resulted in significant and dose dependent (72-88%) lowering of XBP-1 transcript levels in mouse liver (as indicated by a smaller XBP-1 to GAPDH transcript ratio when normalized to a PBS control group), indicating that siRNA molecules were active in vivo. As shown in \nFIG. 6\n, the silencing activity translated in lowering of total cholesterol in those animals.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nCleavage of XBP-1 siRNAs\n\n\n5′RACE was used to examine the cleavage products of XBP-1 siRNAs isolated from livers of mice injected with the oligonucleotides.\n\n\nMice were injected with 5 mg/kg or 7.5 mg/kg lipid-formulated XBP-1 siRNAs (LNP01-18038, negative control siRNAs targeting luciferase (LNP01-1955), or PBS. Total RNA was isolated from powdered liver samples using Trizol (Invitrogen) and RNAeasy mini columns (Qiagen). Two micrograms of RNA were used for 5′RACE similar to the Generacer kit (Invitrogen) protocol. The oligonucleotide adaptor was ligated directly to total RNA using T4 RNA ligase (2U) for 1 hour at 37° C. The ligation mixture was reverse transcribed using the XBP-1-\nspecific oligo\n 5′-GGAAGCAGAGAGTGGAGAAAGAAATGCTAAGG-3′ (SEQ ID NO:4335) using Superscript™ III (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 50° C., then 15 min. at 70° C. cDNA was amplified using 3 ul of cDNA amplified with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) for 35 cycles where Tm=62° C. with \noligos\n 5′-CGACTGGAGCACGAGGACACTGACATGG-3′ (SEQ ID NO:4336) and 5′-CCAGTGTTATGTGGCTCTTTAGACACTAATCAG-3′ (SEQ ID NO:4337). PCR products were examined by gel electrophoresis, purified, and cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector for sequencing (Invitrogen).\n\n\nPCR experiments on the 5′ RACE product were performed in a blind fashion. One round of PCR was performed using Tm=62° C., for 35 cycles. The expected XBP-1 product size was 320 bp. The PCR products were roughly the correct size in all experimental samples, but products appeared to exhibit a high level of degradation the same location as the siRNA-intended cleavage site. Three bands from each of the experimental groups were cut from agarose gels for cloning and sequencing.\n\n\nThe control groups yielded clones with several degradation products resulting from cleavage around but not located at the expected cleavage site. The expected and observed cleavage products in the negative control samples are shown in \nFIG. 1A\n. The AD18038 siRNA was expected to cleave after nucleotide 925 in the XBP-1 transcript (see \nFIGS. 1A\n, \n1\nB, and \n3\n). Thus, no cleavage products at nucleotide position 925 were expected, and in fact, none were observed, in the negative control products (\nFIG. 1A\n). Degradation products in the negative control samples were found at positions −49, −35, −32(2), −31, −30(2), −28, −24, −22, −16(2), −17, −15, −14, −12, −11, −9, +8, +13, +65, and +68, relative to the intended cleavage site of the XBP-1 siRNA AD18038.\n\n\nThe expected siRNA-mediated cleavage product was found in 76.5% of the clones derived from the AD18038-treated groups (\nFIG. 1B\n). Degradation products were found from cleavage at positions −30, −10, −8, −5, −3, +1, +3, and +14, relative to the intended cleavage site of the XBP-1 siRNA AD18038.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE
