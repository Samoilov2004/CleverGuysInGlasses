Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates generally to compounds which act as inhibitors of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) 2 enzyme, compositions and therapeutic uses thereof.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nSchizophrenia is debilitating disorder affecting the psychic and motor functions of the brain. It is typically diagnosed in individuals in their early to mid-twenties and symptoms include hallucinations and delusions or at the other extreme, anhedonia or social withdrawal. Across the spectrum, the symptoms are indicative of cognitive impairment and functional disabilities. Notwithstanding improvements in antipsychotic treatments, current therapies, including typical (haloperidol) and atypical (clozapine or olanzapine) antipsychotics, have been less than acceptable and result in an extremely high rate of noncomplicance or discontinuation of medication. Dissatisfaction with therapy is attributed to lack of efficacy or intolerable and unacceptable side affects. The side effects have been associated with significant metabolic, extrapyramidal, prolactic and cardiac adverse events. See, Lieberman et al., N. Engl. J. Med. (2005) 353:1209-1223.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile multiple pathways are believed to be involved with the pathogenesis of schizophrenia leading to psychosis and cognition deficits, much attention has focused on the role of glutamate/NMDA dysfunction associated with cyclic guanosine monophasphate (cGMP) levels and the dopaminergic D2 receptor associated with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). These ubiquitous second messengers are responsible for altering the function of many intracellular proteins. Cyclic AMP is thought to regulate the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which in turns phosphorylates and regulates many types of proteins including ion channels, enzymes and transcription factors. Similarly, cGMP is also responsible for downstream regulation of kinases and ion channels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne pathway for affecting the levels of cyclic nucleotides, such as cAMP and cGMP, is to alter or regulate the enzymes that degrade these enzymes, known as 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotide specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The PDE superfamily includes twenty one genes that encode for eleven families of PDEs. These families are further subdivided based on catalytic domain homology and substrate specificity and include the 1) cAMP specific, PDE4A-D, 7A and 7B, and 8A and 8B, 2) cGMP specific, PDE 5A, 6A-C, and 9A, and 3) those that are dual substrate, PDE 1A-C, 2A, 3A and 3B, 10A, and 11A. The homology between the families, ranging from 20% to 45% suggests that it may be possible to develop selective inhibitors for each of these subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPDE2 is highly expressed in the brain, but is also found in many other tissues as well, and therefore has a broad array of function and utility (J. A. Beavo, et al., Rev. Physio. Biochem. Pharm., 135, 67 (1999)). Amongst others, PDE2 has been shown to have therapeutic potential in neuronal development, learning, and memory (W. C. G. van Staveren, et. al., Brain Res., 888, 275 (2001) and J. O'Donnell, et. al., J. Pharm. Exp. Ther., 302, 249 (2002)); prolactin and aldosterone secretion (M. O. Velardez, et. al., Eur. J. Endo., 143, 279 (2000) and N. Gallo-Payet, et. al., Endo., 140, 3594 (1999)); bone cell differentiation, growth, and bone resorption (C. Allardt-Lamberg, et. al., Biochem.

Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. Any formulas, structures or names of compounds described in this specification that do not specify a particular stereochemistry are meant to encompass any and all existing isomers as described above and mixtures thereof in any proportion. When stereochemistry is specified, the invention is meant to encompass that particular isomer in pure form or as part of a mixture with other isomers in any proportion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the compounds of generic Formula I, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of generic Formula I. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (\n1\nH) and deuterium (\n2\nH). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples.

If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll patents, patent applications and publications cited herein, whether supra or infra, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety and are deemed representative of the prevailing state of the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of present invention are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and also salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable when they are used as precursors to the free compounds or in other synthetic manipulations.

The subject compounds are useful in a method of treating a neurological or psychiatric disorder associated with PDE2 dysfunction in a patient such as a mammal in need of such inhibition comprising the administration of an effective amount of the compound. In addition to primates, especially humans, a variety of other mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention. The subject compounds are useful in a method of inhibiting PDE2 activity in a patient such as a mammal in need of such inhibition comprising the administration of an effective amount of the compound. The subject compounds are also useful for treating a neurological or psychiatric disorder associated with striatal hypofunction or basal ganglia dysfunction in a mammalian patient in need thereof. In addition to primates, especially humans, a variety of other mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in medicine. The present invention is further directed to a use of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for treating a neurological or psychiatric disorder associated with PDE2 dysfunction in a mammalian patient in need thereof. The present invention is further directed to a use of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for treating a neurological or psychiatric disorder associated with striatal hypofunction or basal ganglia dysfunction in a mammalian patient in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Treating” or “treatment of” a disease state includes: 1) preventing the disease state, i.e. causing the clinical symptoms of the disease state not to develop in a subject that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease state, but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease state; 2) inhibiting the disease state, i.e., arresting the development of the disease state or its clinical symptoms; 3) or relieving the disease state, i.e., causing temporary or permanent regression of the disease state or its clinical symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject treated in the present methods is generally a mammal, in particular, a human being, male or female, in whom therapy is desired. The term “therapeutically effective amount” means the amount of the subject compound that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. It is recognized that one skilled in the art may affect the neurological and psychiatric disorders by treating a patient presently afflicted with the disorders or by prophylactically treating a patient afflicted with such disorders with an effective amount of the compound of the present invention. As used herein, the terms “treatment” and “treating” refer to all processes wherein there may be a slowing, interrupting, arresting, controlling, or stopping of the progression of the neurological and psychiatric disorders described herein, but does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all disorder symptoms, as well as the prophylactic therapy to retard the progression or reduce the risk of the noted conditions, particularly in a patient who is predisposed to such disease or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApplicants propose that inhibitors of PDE2, including PDE2A, will provide therapeutic benefit to those individuals suffering from psychiatric and cognitive disorders. The unique and exclusive distribution of PDE2A in the medium spiny projection neurons of the striatum, which form the principle site for cortical and dopaminergic input within basal ganglia, suggests that it may be possible and desirable to identify inhibitors of PDE2 to ameliorate or eliminate unwanted cellular signaling within this site. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, Applicants believe that inhibition of PDE2A in the striatum will result in increased cAMP/cGMP signaling and striatal output, which has the potential to restore behavioral inhibition that is impaired in cognitive disease such as schizophrenia. Regulation and integration of glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs will enhance cognitive behavior, while suppressing or reducing unwanted behavior. Thus, in one embodiment, compounds of the invention provide a method for treating or ameliorating diseases or conditions in which striatal hypofunction is a prominent feature or ones in which basal ganglia dysfunction plays a role, such as, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorders, addiction and psychosis. Other conditions for which the inhibitors described herein may have a desirable and useful effect include those requiring a reduction in activity and reduced response to psychomotor stimulants or where it would be desirable to reduce conditional avoidance responses, which is often predictive of clinical antipsychotic activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the compounds of this invention there is provided a method for treating or ameliorating diseases or conditions in neuronal development, learning, and memory prolactin and aldosterone secretion, bone cell differentiation, growth, and bone resorption, immunological response, vascular angiogenesis, inflammatory cell transit, cardiac contraction, platelet aggregation, female sexual arousal disorder, and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “selective PDE2 inhibitor” refers to an organic molecule that effectively inhibits an enzyme from the PDE2 family to a greater extent than enzymes from the PDE 1, and 3-11 families. In one embodiment, a selective PDE2 inhibitor is an organic molecule having a Ki for inhibition of PDE2 that is less than or about one-tenth that for a substance that is an inhibitor for another PDE enzyme. In other words, the organic molecule inhibits PDE2 activity to the same degree at a concentration of about one-tenth or less than the concentration required for any other PDE enzyme. Preferably, a selective PDE2 inhibitor is an organic molecule, having a Ki for inhibition of PDE2 that is less than or about one-hundredth that for a substance that is an inhibitor for another PDE enzyme. In other words, the organic molecule inhibits PDE2 activity to the same degree at a concentration of about one-hundredth or less than the concentration required for any other PDE enzyme. A “selective PDE2 inhibitor” can be identified, for example, by comparing the ability of an organic molecule to inhibit PDE2 activity to its ability to inhibit PDE enzymes from the other PDE families. For example, an organic molecule may be assayed for its ability to inhibit PDE2 activity, as well as PDE1A, PDE1B, PDE1C, PDE3A, PDE3B, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, PDE4D, PDE5A, PDE6A, PDE6B, PDE6C, PDE7A, PDE7B, PDE8A, PDE8B, PDE9A, PDE10 and/or PDE11A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhosphodiesterase enzymes including PDE2 have been implicated in a wide range of biological functions. This has suggested a potential role for these enzymes in a variety of disease processes in humans or other species. The compounds of the present invention have utility in treating a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, compounds of the present invention provide a method for treating schizophrenia or psychosis comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of the present invention.

IMAP® technology has been applied previously to examine the effects of phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Huang, W., et al., J. Biomol Screen, 2002, 7: 215). Assays were performed at room temperature in 384-well microtiter plates with an incubation volume of 20.2 μL. Solutions of test compounds were prepared in DMSO and serially diluted with DMSO to yield 8 μL of each of 10 solutions differing by 3-fold in concentration, at 32 serial dilutions per plate. 100% inhibition is determined using a known PDE2 inhibitor, which can be any compound that is present at 5,000 times its Ki value in the assay described below, such as Bay 60-7550 (Ki-˜0.2 nM) at 1 μM concentration for 100% inhibition. Bay 60-7550 was obtained from Axxora via Fisher Scientific (cat#ALX-270-421-M025/cat#NC9314773). Put another way, any compound with Ki of ˜0.2 to about 2 nM could be used at 1 to 10 μM. 0% of inhibition is determined by using DMSO (1% final concentrations).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Labcyte Echo 555 (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, Calif.) is used to dispense 200 mL from each well of the titration plate to the 384 well assay plate. Ten microliters of a solution of enzyme (1/2000 final dilution from aliquots; sufficient to produce 20% substrate conversion) was added to the assay plate. Next 10 uL of a separate solution of the substrate FAM-labeled cAMP (50 nM final concentration product #R7506 from Molecular Devices) and the activator cGMP (1 uM final concentration), prepared in the assay buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.05% NaN\n3 \n0.01% Tween-20, and 1 mM DTT) was added to the assay plate and shaken to mix. The reaction is allowed to proceed at room temperature for 60 minutes. A binding solution is then made from the kit components, comprised of 80% Solution A, 20% Solution B and binding reagent at a volume of 1/600 the total binding solution. The enzymatic reaction is stopped by addition of 60 μL of the binding solution to each well of the assay plates and the plates are sealed and shaken for 30 seconds. The plate was incubated at room temperature for at least one hour prior to determining the fluorescence polarization (FP). The parallel and perpendicular fluorescence of each well of the plate was measured using a Tecan Genios Pro plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland) or Perkin Elmer EnVision™ plate reader (Waltham, Mass.). Fluorescence polarization (mP) was calculated from the parallel (S) and perpendicular (P) fluorescence of each sample well and the analogous values for the median control well, containing only substrate (So and Po), using the following equation:\n\n\n \n \n \nPolarization (mP)=1000*(\nS/So−P/Po\n)/(\nS/So+P/Po\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDose-inhibition profiles for each compound were characterized by fitting the mP data to a four-parameter equation given below. The apparent inhibition constant (K\nI\n), the maximum inhibition at the low plateau relative to “100% Inhibition Control” (Imax; e.g. 1=> same as this control), the minimum inhibition at the high plateau relative to the “0% Inhibition Control” (Imin, e.g. 0=>same as the no drug control) and the Hill slope (nH) are determined by a non-linear least squares fitting of the mP values as a function of dose of the compound using an in-house software based on the procedures described by Mosser et al., JALA, 2003, 8: 54-63, using the following equation:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmP\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmP\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nDrug\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\npK\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nSubstrate\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmP\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmP\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe median signal of the “0% inhibition controls” (0% mP) and the median signal of the “100% inhibition controls” (100% mP) are constants determined from the controls located in columns 1-2 and 23-24 of each assay plate. An apparent (K\nm\n) for FAM-labeled cAMP of ˜10 uM was used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelectivity for PDE2, as compared to other PDE families, was assessed using the IMAP® technology. Rhesus PDE2A3 and Human PDE10A2 enzyme was prepared from cytosolic fractions of transiently transfected HEK cells. All other PDE's were GST Tag human enzyme expressed in insect cells and were obtained from BPS Bioscience (San Diego, Calif.): PDE1A (Cat#60010), PDE3A (Cat#60030), PDE4A1A (Cat#60040), PDE5A1 (Cat#60050), PDE6C (Cat#60060), PDE7A (Cat#60070), PDE8A1 (Cat#60080), PDE9A2 (Cat#60090), PDE11A4 (Cat#60110).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays for PDE 1 through 11 were performed in parallel at room temperature in 384-well microtiter plates with an incubation volume of 20.2 μL. Solutions of test compounds were prepared in DMSO and serially diluted with DMSO to yield 30 μL of each of ten solutions differing by 3-fold in concentration, at 32 serial dilutions per plate. 100% inhibition was determined by adding buffer in place of the enzyme and 0% inhibition is determined by using DMSO (1% final concentrations). A Labcyte POD 810 (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, Calif.) was used to dispense 200 nL from each well of the titration plate to make eleven copies of the assay plate for each titration, one copy for each PDE enzyme. A solution of each enzyme (dilution from aliquots, sufficient to produce 20% substrate conversion) and a separate solution of FAM-labeled cAMP or PAM-labeled cGMP from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, Calif., product #R7506 or cGMP#R7508), at a final concentration of 50 nM were made in the assay buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.05% NaN\n3 \n0.01% Tween-20, and 1 mM DTT). Note that the substrate for PDE2 is 50 nM FAM cAMP containing 1000 nM of cGMP. The enzyme and the substrate were then added to the assay plates in two consecutive additions of 10 μL and then shaken to mix. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 60 minutes. A binding solution was then made from the kit components, comprised of 80% Solution A, 20% Solution B and binding reagent at a volume of 1/600 the total binding solution. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by addition of 60 of the binding solution to each well of the assay plate. The plates were sealed and shaken for 10 seconds. The plates were incubated at room temperature for one hour, then the parallel and perpendicular fluorescence was measured using a Tecan Genios Pro plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). The apparent inhibition constants for the compounds against all 11 PDE's was determined from the parallel and perpendicular fluorescent readings as described for PDE10 FP assay using the following apparent K\nM \nvalues for each enzyme and substrate combination: PDE 1A (FAM cGMP) 70 nM, rhesus PD2A3 (FAM cAMP) 10,000 nM, PDE3A (FAM cAMP) 50 nM, PDE4A1A (FAM cAMP) 1500 nM, PDE5A1 (FAM cGMP) 400 nM, PDE6C (FAM cGMP) 700 nM, PDE7A (FAM cAMP) 150 nM, PDE8A1 (FAM cAMP) 50 nM, PDE9A2 (FAM cGMP) 60 nM, PDE10A2 (FAM cAMP) 150 nM, PDE11A4 (FAM cAMP) 1000 nM. The intrinsic PDE10 inhibitory activity of a compound which may be used in accordance with the present invention may be determined by these assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the following examples had activity in inhibiting the human PDE2 enzyme in the aforementioned assays with a Ki of less than about 10 μM. Many of compounds within the present invention had activity in inhibiting the human PDE2 enzyme in the aforementioned assays, with an Ki of less than about 0.1 μM. Additional data is provided in the following Examples. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds in use as inhibitors of the PDE2 enzyme. In general, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that a substance is considered to effectively inhibit PDE2 activity if it has a Ki of less than or about 1 μM, preferably less than or about 0.1 μM. The present invention also includes compounds within the generic scope of the invention which possess activity as inhibitors of other phosphodiesterase enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject compounds are further useful in a method for the prevention, treatment, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of the diseases, disorders and conditions noted herein.
