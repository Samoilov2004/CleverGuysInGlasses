Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to a series of amino acid derivatives, to compositions containing them, to processes for their preparation and to their use in medicine as IKK inhibitors.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe expression of many pro-inflammatory genes is regulated by the transcriptional activator nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Since their discovery these transcription factors have been suspected to play a pivotal role in chronic and acute inflammatory diseases. It now seems that aberrant regulation of NF-κB also underlies autoimmune diseases and different types of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstances whose activity depends on the activation of NF-κB include: cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-1β; the adhesion molecules E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1; and the enzymes nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. NF-κB normally resides in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells as an inactive complex with a member of the IκB inhibitory protein family. However, upon cellular activation, IκB is phosphorylated by the IκB kinase (IKK) and is subsequently degraded. Free NF-κB then translocates to the nucleus where it mediates pro-inflammatory gene expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe three classical members of the IκB family are IκBα, IκBβ and IκBε. All of these require the phosphorylation of two key serine residues before they can be degraded. Two major enzymes IKK-α and IKK-βappear to be responsible for IκB phosphorylation. Dominant-negative (DN) versions of either of these enzymes (where ATP binding is disabled by the mutation of a key kinase domain residue) have been found to suppress the activation of NF-κB by TNF-α, IL-1β and LPS. Importantly IKK-β DN has been found to be a far more potent inhibitor than IKK-α DN (Zandi E, \nCell, \n1997, 91, 243). Furthermore, the generation of IKK-α and IKK-β deficient mice has established that IKK-β is required for activation of NF-κB by proinflammatory stimuli to occur and has corroborated biochemical data suggesting that IKK-β plays a dominant role in this pathway. Indeed it has been demonstrated that IKK-α is dispensable for NF-κB activation by these stimuli (Tanaka M, \nImmunity \n1999, 10, 421).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of IKK-β therefore represents a potentially attractive target for modulation of immune function and hence the development of drugs for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. For example, in relation to treatment of type II diabetes mellitus it has been shown that disruption of the NF-κB signalling pathways by methods such as tissue-specific deletion of IKK-β or pharmacological targetting of IKK-β can attenuate insulin resistance (Shoelson S et al., \nGastroenterology \n2007, 132, 2169).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA group of compounds has now been identified which are potent and selective inhibitors of IKK isoforms, particularly IKK-β. The compounds may thus be of use in medicine, for example in the treatment of a variety of proliferative disease states such as conditions related to the hyperactivity of IKK, as well as diseases modulated by the NF-κB cascade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe general concept of conjugating an α-mono substituted glycine ester motif to a modulator of an intracellular enzyme or receptor, to obtain the benefits of intracellular accumulation of the carboxylic acid hydrolysis product is described in WO 2006/117567. However, this publication does not suggest that α,α-disubstituted glycine ester conjugates could be hydrolysed by intracellular carboxylesterases. It appears that the ability of the intracellular carboxyl esterases, principally hCE-1, hCE-2 and hCE-3, to hydrolyse α,α-disubstituted glycine ester has not previously been investigated.\n\n\n \nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides a compound which is: (a) a thiophene carboxamide derivative of formula (IA) or (IB), or a tautomer thereof;

and\n\n\nany aryl, heteroaryl, carbocyclyl and heterocyclyl groups and moieties in A\n1\n, A\n2\n, A\n3\n, D and R\n5 \nare the same or different and are each unsubstituted or substituted by 1, 2, 3 or 4 unsubstituted substituents selected from halogen atoms, and cyano, nitro, C\n1-4 \nalkyl, C\n1-4 \nalkoxy, C\n2-4 \nalkenyl, C\n2-4 \nalkenyloxy, C\n1-4 \nhaloalkyl, C\n2-4 \nhaloalkenyl, C\n1-4 \nhaloalkoxy, C\n2-4 \nhaloalkenyloxy, hydroxyl, C\n1-4 \nhydroxyalkyl, —SR′ and —NR′R″ groups wherein each R′ and R″ is the same or different and represents hydrogen or unsubstituted C\n1-4 \nalkyl, or from substituents of formula —COOH, —COOR\nA\n, —COR\nA\n, —SO\n2\nR\nA\n, —CONH\n2\n, —SO\n2\nNH\n2\n, —CONHR\nA\n, —SO\n2\nNHR\nA\n, —CONR\nA\nR\nB\n, —SO\n2\nNR\nA\nR\nB\n, —OCONH\n2\n, —OCONHR\nA\n, —OCONR\nA\nR\nB\n, —NHCOR\nA\n, —NR\nB\nCOR\nA\n, —NHCOOR\nA\n, —NR\nB\nCOOR\nA\n, —NR\nB\nCOOH, —NHCOOH, —NHSO\n2\nR\nA\n, —NR\nB\nSO\n2\nR\nA\n, —NHSO\n2\nOR\nA\n, —NR\nB\nSO\n2\nOH, —NHSO\n2\nH, —NR\nB\nSO\n2\nOR\nA\n, —NHCONH\n2\n, —NR\nA\nCONH\n2\n, —NHCONHR\nB\n, —NR\nA\nCONHR\nB\n, —NHCONR\nA\nR\nB \nor —NR\nA\nCONR\nA\nR\nB \nwherein R\nA \nand R\nB \nare the same or different and represent unsubstituted C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n3-6 \ncycloalkyl, non-fused phenyl or a non-fused 5- to 6-membered heteroaryl, or R\nA \nand R\nB \nwhen attached to the same nitrogen atom form a non-fused 5- or 6-membered heterocyclyl group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention contain an amino acid motif or an amino acid ester motif that is hydrolysable by an intracellular carboxylesterase. The compounds also contain a linker group, which separates the thiophene ring core of the molecule from the cyclic group carried on the side chain of the molecule that ultimately terminates in the amino acid or amino acid ester motif. Surprisingly, compounds of the invention having this combination of lipophilic amino acid or amino acid ester motif and linker group are potent and selective inhibitors of IKK isoforms, particular IKK-β.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred compounds of the invention are those which contain an amino acid ester motif that is hydrolysable by an intracellular carboxylesterase. These compounds can easily cross a cell membrane and can then be hydrolysed to the acid by the intracellular carboxylesterases. The polar hydrolysis product accumulates in the cell since it does not cross the cell membrane as readily. Hence the IKK activity of the compound can be prolonged and enhanced within the cell. This accumulation effect may thus result in enhanced intracellular IKK activity of the compounds of the invention relative to their extracellular activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, compounds of the invention where R is a group of formula (X1) or (Y1) have been found to accumulate selectively in monocytes. Thus, these compounds of the invention can advantageously be used where systemic administration is desired, since they are not very susceptible to pre-systemic metabolism and can thus reach target tissues in tact (whereupon they are converted inside target cells into the acid products). Preferential accumulation in monocyte cell lines can result in the IKK inhibitory effect of a dose of compound administered to a patient being concentrated on monocytes in preference to other neighbouring cells. This selectivity can therefore improve the therapeutic window associated with the compounds of the invention when used to target monocytic cells, for example in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease. Thus, for example, side effects associated with IKK inhibition of non-target, non-monocytic cells can be reduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConversely, where local administration is desired it can be advantageous to use compounds of the invention where R is a group of formula (X2) or (Y2). Such compounds of the invention do not show monocyte selectivity and ester cleavage typically occurs more rapidly. This rapid rate of ester cleavage can be advantageous in reducing systemic exposure and consequent unwanted side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably the compounds of the invention are compounds of formula (IA) or (IB) or a tautomer thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a compound as defined above for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound as defined above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a compound as defined above for use in the treatment of a disorder mediated by an IKK enzyme.

Hence, the broken cell assay described later provides a straightforward, quick and simple first screen for esters which have the required hydrolysis profile. Ester motifs selected in that way may then be re-assayed in the same carboxylesterase assay when conjugated to the IKK inhibitor via the chosen conjugation chemistry, to confirm that it is still a carboxylesterase substrate in that background.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubject to the requirement that they be hydrolysable by intracellular carboxylesterase enzymes, examples of particular ester groups R\n2 \ninclude those of formula —(C═O)OR\n9 \nwherein R\n9 \nis —CR\n14\nR\n15\nR\n16 \nwherein:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(i) R\n15 \nrepresents hydrogen or a group of formula —[C\n1-4 \nalkylene]\nb\n-(Z\n1\n)\na\n—[C\n1-4 \nalkyl] or —[C\n1-4 \nalkylene]\nb\n-(Z\n1\n)\na\n—[C\n2-4 \nalkenyl] wherein a and b are the same or different and represent 0 or 1, and Z\n1 \nrepresents —O—, —S—, or —NR\n17\n— wherein R\n17 \nis hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl, R\n16 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl, and R\n14 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl;\n \n(ii) R\n15 \nrepresents a phenyl or a 5- to 10-membered heteroaryl group optionally fused to a further phenyl, 5- to 10-membered heteroaryl, C\n3-7 \ncarbocyclyl or 5- to 10-membered heterocyclyl group, R\n16 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl, and R\n14 \nrepresents hydrogen;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n(iii) R\n15 \nrepresents a group of formula -(Alk\n5\n)—NR\n18\nR\n19 \nwherein Alk\n5 \nrepresents a C\n1-4 \nalkylene group and either (a) R\n18 \nand R\n19 \nare the same or different and represent hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl, or (b) R\n18 \nand R\n19\n, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded, form a 5- to 10-membered heteroaryl or 5- to 10-membered heterocyclyl group optionally fused to a further phenyl, 5- to 10-membered heteroaryl, C\n3-7 \ncarbocyclyl or 5- to 10-membered heterocyclyl group; R\n16 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl, and R\n14 \nrepresents hydrogen; or\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(iv) R\n15 \nand R\n16\n, together with the carbon atom to which they are bonded, form a phenyl, 5- to 10-membered heteroaryl, C\n3-7 \ncarbocyclyl or 5- to 10-membered heterocyclyl group which is optionally fused to a further phenyl, 5- to 10-membered heteroaryl, C\n3-7 \ncarbocyclyl or 5- to 10-membered heterocyclyl group, and R\n14 \nrepresents hydrogen.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nPreferred substituents on the alkyl, alkylene and alkenyl groups in R\n14\n, R\n15\n, R\n16\n, R\n17\n, R\n18\n, R\n19 \nand Alk\n5 \ngroups include one or two substituents which are the same or different and are selected from halogen, C\n1-4 \nalkyl, C\n2-4 \nalkenyl, C\n1-4 \nalkoxy, hydroxyl and —NR′R″ wherein and R″ are the same or different and represent hydrogen or C\n1-2 \nalkyl.

In rheumatoid arthritis they are major contributors to the maintenance of joint inflammation and joint destruction. Macrophages are also involved in tumour growth and development. Hence agents that selectively target macrophage cell proliferation could be of value in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease. Targeting specific cell types would be expected to lead to reduced side-effects. The inventors have discovered a method of targeting inhibitors to macrophages and other cells derived from the myelo-monocytic lineage such as monocytes, osteoclasts and dendritic cells. This is based on the observation that the way in which the esterase motif is linked to the inhibitor determines whether it is hydrolysed, and hence whether or not it accumulates in different cell types. Specifically it has been found that macrophages and other cells derived from the myelo-monocytic lineage contain the human carboxylesterase hCE-1 whereas other cell types do not. In the general formulae (IA) and (IB) when the group R is a group of formula (X1) or (Y1) whose nitrogen moiety is not directly linked to a carbonyl (—C(═O)—), the ester will only be hydrolysed by hCE-1 and hence the inhibitors will selectively accumulate in macrophage-related cells. For the avoidance of doubt, the nitrogen moiety referred to here is the N atom drawn out explicitly in the groups (X1) and (Y1). Herein, unless “monocyte” or “monocytes” is specified, the term macrophage or macrophages will be used to denote macrophages (including tumour associated macrophages) and/or monocytes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment (1) of the invention there is provided a compound of the present invention in which:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nL\n1 \nrepresents C\n1-4 \nalkylene which is unsubstituted or substituted with 1 or 2 unsubstituted substituents which are the same or different and are selected from halogen atoms and C\n1-2 \nalkoxy and C\n1-2 \nhaloalkyl groups;\n \nA\n1 \nrepresents an unfused phenyl or a 5- to 6-membered heteroaryl group which is unsubstituted or substituted by 1, 2 or 3 substituents which are the same or different and are selected from halogen atoms and unsubstituted C\n1-4 \nalkyl, C\n1-4 \nalkoxy, hydroxyl, C\n1-4 \nhaloalkyl, C\n1-4 \nhaloalkoxy, C\n1-4 \nhydroxyalkyl, cyano, nitro, —SR′ and —NR′R″ groups wherein R′ and R″ are the same or different and represent hydrogen or unsubstituted C\n1-2 \nalkyl;\n \nAlk\n2 \nrepresents an unsubstituted C\n1-3 \nalkylene, C\n2-3 \nalkenylene or C\n2-3 \nalkynylene group;\n \nAlk\n3 \nrepresents an unsubstituted C\n1-4 \nalkylene group;\n \nA\n2 \nrepresents an unfused phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted with 1, 2 or 3 substituents which are the same or different and are selected from halogen atoms and unsubstituted C\n1-4 \nalkyl, C\n1-4 \nalkoxy, hydroxyl and —NR′R″ groups wherein R′ and R″ are the same or different and represent hydrogen or unsubstituted C\n1-2 \nalkyl;\n \nHet represents —O—, —NH— or —S—;\n \nAlk\n1 \nrepresents a bond or a C\n1-4 \nalkylene group which is unsubstituted or substituted with 1 or 2 unsubstituted substituents selected from halogen atoms and C\n1-2 \nalkoxy, hydroxyl, C\n1-2 \nhaloalkyl and —NR′R″ groups where R′ and R″ are the same or different and represent hydrogen or unsubstituted C\n1-2 \nalkyl, or Alk\n1 \nrepresents a group -A\n3\n-Alk\n4\n- where A\n3 \nrepresents an unfused phenyl or unfused 5- to 6-membered heteroaryl group which is unsubstituted or substituted with 1, 2 or 3 substituents which are the same or different and are selected from halogen atoms and unsubstituted C\n1-4 \nalkyl, C\n1-4 \nalkoxy, hydroxyl and —NR′R″ groups wherein R′ and R″ are the same or different and represent hydrogen or unsubstituted C\n1-2 \nalkyl, and Alk\n4 \nrepresents an unsubstituted C\n1-3 \nalkylene group;\n \nR represents a group of formula (X1) or (Y1):\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nin which\n\n \n \n \n \n \nR\n2 \nrepresents —COOH or —COOR\n9 \nwherein R\n9 \nrepresents a C\n1-4 \nalkyl, C\n3-7 \ncarbocyclyl or C\n2-4 \nalkenyl group, or R\n9 \nrepresents a phenyl, benzyl, 2-pyridylmethyl, 3-pyridylmethyl, 4-pyridylmethyl, N-methylpiperidin-4-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, methoxyethyl, indanyl, norbonyl, dimethylaminoethyl or morpholinoethyl group, said R\n9 \nbeing unsubstituted or substituted with 1, 2 or 3 unsubstituted substituents which are the same or different and are selected from halogen atoms and C\n1-2 \nalkoxy, hydroxyl, C\n1-2 \nhaloalkyl and —NR′R″ groups where R′ and R″ are the same or different and represent hydrogen or unsubstituted C\n1-2 \nalkyl;\n \nR\n3 \nrepresents a hydrogen atom or an unsubstituted methyl group;\n \nR\n7 \nand R\n8\n, which are the same or different, represent a hydrogen atom or an unsubstituted C\n1-6 \nalkyl group;

In particular, uses of the compounds include: treatment of cancer, such as hepatocellular cancer or melanoma, but also including bowel cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck and cervical squamous cancers, gastric or lung cancers, anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, glioblastoma multiforme or medulloblastomas; and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, such as type II diabetes mellitus, atopic dermatitis, graft versus host disease, or systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing treatment. Optimum dose levels and frequency of dosing will be determined by clinical trial, but an exemplary dosage would be 0.1-1000 mg per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds with which the invention is concerned may be prepared for administration by any route consistent with their pharmacokinetic properties. The orally administrable compositions may be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, liquid or gel preparations, such as oral, topical, or sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinyl-pyrrolidone; fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricant, for example magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica; disintegrants, for example potato starch, or acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical application to the skin, the drug may be made up into a cream, lotion or ointment. Cream or ointment formulations which may be used for the drug are conventional formulations well known in the art, for example as described in standard textbooks of pharmaceutics such as the British Pharmacopoeia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical application by inhalation, the drug may be formulated for aerosol delivery for example, by pressure-driven jet atomizers or ultrasonic atomizers, or preferably by propellant-driven metered aerosols or propellant-free administration of micronized powders, for example, inhalation capsules or other “dry powder” delivery systems. Excipients, such as, for example, propellants (e.g. Frigen in the case of metered aerosols), surface-active substances, emulsifiers, stabilizers, preservatives, flavourings, and fillers (e.g. lactose in the case of powder inhalers) may be present in such inhaled formulations. For the purposes of inhalation, a large number of apparata are available with which aerosols of optimum particle size can be generated and administered, using an inhalation technique which is appropriate for the patient. In addition to the use of adaptors (spacers, expanders) and pear-shaped containers (e.g. Nebulator®, Volumatic®), and automatic devices emitting a puffer spray (Autohaler®), for metered aerosols, in particular in the case of powder inhalers, a number of technical solutions are available (e.g. Diskhaler®, Rotadisk®, Turbohaler® or the inhalers for example as described in European Patent Application EP 0 505 321).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical application to the eye, the drug may be made up into a solution or suspension in a suitable sterile aqueous or non aqueous vehicle. Additives, for instance buffers such as sodium metabisulphite or disodium edeate; preservatives including bactericidal and fungicidal agents such as phenyl mercuric acetate or nitrate, benzalkonium chloride or chlorhexidine, and thickening agents such as hypromellose may also be included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active ingredient may also be administered parenterally in a sterile medium. Depending on the vehicle and concentration used, the drug can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be used in conjunction with a number of known pharmaceutically active substances. For example, the compounds of the invention may be used with cytotoxics, HDAC inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, aminopeptidase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies (for example those directed at growth factor receptors). Preferred cytotoxics include, for example, taxanes, platins, anti-metabolites such as 5-fluoracil, topoisomerase inhibitors and the like. The medicaments of the invention comprising amino acid derivatives of formula (IA) or (IB), tautomers thereof or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, N-oxides, hydrates or solvates thereof therefore typically further comprise a cytotoxic, an HDAC inhibitor, a kinase inhibitor, an aminopeptidase inhibitor and/or a monoclonal antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(a) a compound which is: (i) a thiophene carboxamide derivative of formula (IA) or (IB), or a tautomer thereof; or (ii) a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, N-oxide, hydrate or solvate thereof;\n \n(b) a cytotoxic agent, an HDAC inhibitor, a kinase inhibitor, an aminopeptidase inhibitor and/or a monoclonal antibody; and\n \n(c) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAlso provided is a product comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(a) a compound which is: (i) a thiophene carboxamide derivative of formula (IA) or (IB), or a tautomer thereof; or (ii) a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, N-oxide, hydrate or solvate thereof; and\n \n(b) a cytotoxic agent, an HDAC inhibitor, a kinase inhibitor, an aminopeptidase inhibitor and/or a monoclonal antibody,\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nfor the separate, simultaneous or sequential use in the treatment of the human or animal body.\n\n\n \nSynthesis\n\n\n \n \n \nThere are multiple synthetic strategies for the synthesis of the compounds of formula (IA) or (IB) with which the present invention is concerned, but all rely on known chemistry, known to the synthetic organic chemist. Thus, compounds according to formula (IA) or (IB) can be synthesised according to procedures described in the standard literature and well known to those skilled in the art. Typical literature sources are “\nAdvanced organic chemistry”, \n4\nth \nEdition (Wiley), J March, “\nComprehensive Organic Transformation”, \n2\nnd \nEdition (Wiley), R. C. Larock , “\nHandbook of Heterocyclic Chemistry”, \n2\nnd \nEdition (Pergamon), A. R. Katritzky, review articles such as found in “\nSynthesis”, “Acc. Chem. Res.”, “Chem. Rev\n”, or primary literature sources identified by standard literature searches online or from secondary sources such as “\nChemical Abstracts\n” or “\nBeilstein”. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be prepared by a number of processes generally described below and more specifically in the Examples hereinafter. In the reactions described below, it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxyl, amino and carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions [see for example Greene, T. W., “Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis”, John Wiley and Sons, 1999]. Conventional protecting groups may be used in conjunction with standard practice. In some instances deprotection may be the final step in the synthesis of a compound of general formula (IA) or (IB), and the processes according to the invention described herein after are understood to extend to such removal of protecting groups.\n\n\n \n \nThe amino acid ester building blocks can be prepared in a number of ways. Scheme 1 illustrates the main routes employed for their preparation for the purpose of this application. To the chemist skilled in the art it will be apparent that there are other methodologies that will also achieve the preparation of these intermediates.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIt will be apparent to the individual skilled in the art that the general route set out in scheme 2 is one of a number available. For example, methods of preparation of a suitable thiophene carboxamide core are described in detail in WO 03/104218, the content of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nScheme 3 shows a process that involves reductive amination of the amino acid ester with the corresponding benzaldehyde, followed by N-protection and a Heck reaction giving rise to the key aldehyde intermediate. This is transformed into the thiophene ring using 2-cyano acetamide. It will be apparent to a person skilled in art that the nature of the group L\n1 \nwill have an impact on the chosen route of synthesis. The person skilled in the art would readily be aware of synthetic possibilities for the synthesis of such compounds.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nThe carboxylic acid derivatives of the esters described herein can be easily prepared from their parent esters by hydrolysis. To the chemist skilled in the art it will be apparent that depending on the ester group to be removed, either basic or acidic conditions may be employed.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples illustrate the preparation and properties of some specific compounds of the invention.

The Z′-LYTE™ biochemical assay employs a fluorescence-based, coupled-enzyme format and is based on the differential sensitivity of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides to proteolytic cleavage. The peptide substrate is labelled with two fluorophores—one at each end—that make up a FRET pair. In the primary reaction, the kinase transfers the gamma-phosphate of ATP to a single serine or threonine residue in a synthetic FRET-peptide. In the secondary reaction, a site-specific protease recognizes and cleaves non-phosphorylated FRET-peptides. Phosphorylation of FRET-peptides suppresses cleavage by the Development Reagent. Cleavage disrupts FRET between the donor (i.e., coumarin) and acceptor (i.e. fluorescein) fluorophores on the FRET-peptide, whereas uncleaved, phosphorylated FRET-peptides maintain FRET. A radiometric method, which calculates the ratio (the Emission Ratio) of donor emission to acceptor emission after excitation of the donor fluorophore at 400 nm, is used to quantitate reaction progress.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe final 10 μL Kinase Reaction consists of 0.9-8.0 ng IκBKB (IKKβ), 2 μM Ser/Thr 05 Peptide and ATP in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.01% BRIJ-35, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EGTA. The assay is performed at an ATP concentration at, or close to the Km. After the 60 minute Kinase Reaction incubation at room temperature, 5 μL of a 1:128 dilution of Development Reagent is added. The assay plate is incubated for a further 60 minutes at room temperature and read on a fluorescence plate reader.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuplicate data points are generated from a 1/3 log dilution series of a stock solution of test compound in DMSO. Nine dilutions steps are made from a top concentration of 10 μM, and a ‘no compound’ blank is included. Data is collected and analysed using XLfit software from IDBS. The dose response curve is curve fitted to model number 205 (sigmoidal dose-response model). From the curve generated, the concentration giving 50% inhibition is determined and reported.\n\n\n \nLPS-Stimulation of THP-1 Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nTHP-1 cells were plated in 100 μl at a density of 4×10\n4 \ncells/well in V-bottomed 96 well tissue culture treated plates and incubated at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2 \nfor 16 hours. 2 hours after the addition of the inhibitor in 100 μl of tissue culture media, the cells were stimulated with LPS (\nE coli \nstrain 005:B5, Sigma) at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml and incubated at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2 \nfor 6 hrs. TNF-α levels were measured from cell-free supernatants by sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems #QTA00B).\n\n\n \nLPS-Stimulation of Human Whole Blood\n\n\n \n \n \nWhole blood was taken by venous puncture using heparinised vacutainers (Becton Dickinson) and diluted in an equal volume of RPMI1640 tissue culture media (Sigma). 100 μl was plated in V-bottomed 96 well tissue culture treated plates. 2 hours after the addition of the inhibitor in 100 μlof RPMI1640 media, the blood was stimulated with LPS (\nE coli \nstrain 005:B5, Sigma) at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml and incubated at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2 \nfor 6 hours. TNF-α levels were measured from cell-free supernatants by sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems #QTA00B).\n\n\n \nBroken Cell Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to determine whether a compound containing a particular group R\n2 \nis hydrolysable by one or more intracellular carboxylesterase enzymes to a —COOH group, the compound may be tested in the following assay:\n\n\n \nPreparation of Cell Extract\n\n\n \n \n \nU937 or HUT78 tumour cells (−109) are washed in 4 volumes of Dulbeccos PBS (˜1 litre) and pelleted at 525 g for 10 minutes at 4° C. This is repeated twice and the final cell pellet is resuspended in 35 ml of cold homogenising buffer (Trizma 10 mM, NaCl-130 mM, CaCl\n2 \n0.5 mM pH 7.0 at 25° C.). Homogenates are prepared by nitrogen cavitation (700 psi for 50 minutes at 4° C.). The homogenate is kept on ice and supplemented with a cocktail of inhibitors at final concentrations of Leupeptin Aprotinin 0.1 μM, E64 8 μM, Pepstatin 1.5 μM, Bestatin 162 μM, Chymostatin 33 μM. After clarification of the cell homogenate by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes, the resulting supernatant is used as a source of esterase activity and is stored at −80° C. until required.\n\n\n \nMeasurement of Ester Cleavage\n\n\n \n \n \nHydrolysis of esters to the corresponding carboxylic acids can be measured using the cell extract, prepared as above. To this effect cell extract (˜30 μg/total assay volume of 0.5 ml) is incubated at 37° C. in a Tris-HCl 25 mM, 125 mM NaCl buffer, pH 7.5 at 25° C. At zero time the ester (substrate) is then added at a final concentration of 2.5 mM and the samples were incubated at 37° C. for the appropriate time (usually 0 or 80 minutes). Reactions are stopped by the addition of 2× volumes of acetonitrile. For zero time samples the acetonitrile is added prior to the ester compound. After centrifugation at 12000 g for 5 minutes, samples are analysed for the ester and its corresponding carboxylic acid at room temperature by LCMS (Sciex API 3000, HP1100 binary pump, CTC PAL). Chromatography was based on a MeCN (75×2.1 mm) column and a mobile phase of 5-95% acetonitrile in water/0.1% formic acid. Rates of hydrolysis are expressed in pg/mL/min.\n\n\n \nIntact Cell Accumulation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nCells (4×10\n4\n/mL) were incubated at 37° C. in culture medium containing 6 μmol/L compound in a 5% (v/v) CO\n2\n-humidified atmosphere. Incubations were terminated after 6 h by centrifugation of 25 mL aliquots of the cell suspension at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4° C. 0.2 mL samples of the culture media supernatants were added to four volumes of acetonitrile. After decanting the supernatant, the residual cell pellet (10\n6 \ncells) was extracted into 1 mL of acetonitrile. Samples were then analyzed for the ester and acid metabolite at room temperature by LC/MS/MS (Sciex API3000). Chromatography was based on a MeCN (75×21 mm) column with a 5% to 95% (v/v) acetonitrile/water, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid mobile phase. For the zero time samples, the cell suspension was chilled and centrifuged as soon as the ester had been added and then extracted into acetonitrile as described. Levels in cells are expressed as ng/mL.\n\n\n \nResults:\n\n\n \n \n \nIC\n50 \nvalues obtained in the biological assays for the exemplary compounds of the invention are presented in Table 1.

After 6 hours incubation, it becomes clear that the compound of Example 5 (acid derivative) is selectively accumulating in the U937 monocytic cell line (268 ng/10\n6 \ncells) with no accumulation in the corresponding HUT78 non-monocytic cell line. The compound of Example 1 is being hydrolysed by human carboxylesterase hCE-1 (only present in macrophage-related cell lines such as U937) and hence the compound of Example 4 will selectively accumulate in macrophage-related cells. The concentration of the compound of Example 1 in HUT78 at 6 hours remains unchanged to the 0 hour time point (466 vs 465 ng/10\n6 \ncells). The small amount of Example 5 associated with the U937 cells at 0 hour time point reflects acid formed within the cell during the separation of cells and medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA comparison between in vitro biological data of the compound of Example 1 with its parent molecule (Compound I) is presented in Table 3.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nInhibition of\n\n\nInhibition of\n\n\nRatio of\n\n\nCell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTNF-α \n\n\nTNF-α\n\n\nwhole \n\n\naccumulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInhibition \n\n\nproduction\n\n\nproduction in \n\n\nblood IC\n50 \n \n\n\nin U937 cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nof IKKβ\n\n\nin THP-1 \n\n\nhuman whole \n\n\nto enzyme \n\n\nis at 6 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\n(IC\n50 \nnM)\n\n\ncells (IC\n50\n, nM)\n\n\nblood (IC\n50\n, nM)\n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\n(ng/mL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n486\n\n\n2711\n\n\n28% @10 μM\n\n\n>20\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEster  10,000 \n\n\nAcid  369\n\n\n1936\n\n\n497\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 3 shows that the acid of the compound of Example 1 has a similar IC\n50 \nin the enzyme assay to its parent compound (Compound I), indicating that binding to the enzyme has not been disrupted by attachment of the esterase motif. Methylene-bridged compounds (i.e., L\n1 \nis a methylene group) such as the compound of Example 1 are hydrolysed by hCE-1 and as a consequence the acid accumulates in cells. This accumulation of acid results in the compound of Example 1 being significantly more potent than the parent compound, particularly in the human whole blood assay. These data highlight the potency benefit that can be achieved by the attachment of the esterase motif and the resulting cellular accumulation of the corresponding acid."
