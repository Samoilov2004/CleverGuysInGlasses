The invention also relates to novel FGF21 analogues, as well as to the pharmaceutical use of these FGF21 derivatives and analogues, in particular for the treatment or prevention of diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and/or Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). \n\n\n The derivatives of the invention are protracted, e.g. capable of maintaining a low blood glu- cose level for a longer period of time, capable of increasing the in vivo half-life of FGF21 , and/or result in a lower clearance of FGF21. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THIS INVENTION \n\n\n Fibroblast growth factors are polypeptides expressed in developing and adult tissues. They are in- volved in several physiological mechanisms including for example metabolic regulation and cellular differentiation. A whole family of more than twenty fibroblast growth factors exists (the FGF family). Three members of the FGF family including FGF19, FGF21 , and FGF23 form a subfamily functioning as endocrine factors involved in metabolic regulation. \n\n\n Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 or FGF-21 , herein for short FGF21 , is expressed preferentially in the liver and has been shown to exert hormone-like metabolic effects. \n\n\n For example, FGF21 has been demonstrated to activate glucose uptake in mouse adipocytes, to protect mice from diet induced obesity when over-expressed in transgenic mice, and to lower blood glucose and triglyceride levels when administered to diabetic rodents (Kharitonenkov ef al., J. Clin. Invest. (2005), 115:1627-1635). \n\n\n The lowering effect of FGF21 on blood glucose and triglycerides has also been shown in diabetic monkeys. FGF21 was also able to decrease LDL and to increase HDL significantly in diabetic monkeys (Kharitonenkov ef al., Endocrinology (2007), 148(2):774-81 ). \n\n\n In diet induced obese mice and ob/ob mice, FGF21 was furthermore shown to lower body weight, predominantly by an increase in energy expenditure and a reduction in adiposity (Coskun ef al., Endocrinology (2008), 149(12): 6018-6027). \n\n\n Based on these results FGF21 has been suggested as a pharmacological agent with the potential to treat diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome includes aspects like insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, visceral obesity and hypertension, see e.g. the definition of metabolic syndrome in Grundy ef al., Circulation (2004), (109): 433- 438. \n\n\n FGF21 may furthermore be used as a pharmacological agent with a potential to treat Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), see Coskun ef al. Endocrinology, 2008 cited above, and Xu ef al., Diabetes (2009, 58(1 ):250-9). NAFLD has been defined by Erickson, J. Lipid Res. (2009, 50 (April supplement), S412-16). \n\n Yie ef al. studied the role of the N- and C-termini of FGF21 in receptor interaction and activation, see FEBS Letters, 583 (2009), 19-24. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n Briefly, this invention is as defined in claim 1 below. \n\n\n The present invention relates to derivatives of FGF21 compounds having one or two modifying groups covalently attached to the FGF21 compound, wherein the modifying group has the formula A-B-C-D-, in which component A is a fatty acid or a derivative thereof. The invention also relates to the use of the derivatives of the invention in pharmaceutical compositions, in particular for the treatment of diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and/or Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). \n\n\n The derivatives of the invention are protracted, e.g. capable of maintaining a low blood glucose level for a longer period of time, capable of increasing the in vivo half-life of FGF21 , and/or result in a lower clearance of FGF21 . The protracted FGF21 derivatives retain satisfactory biological activity and may be administered less frequently. The derivatives are preferably furthermore of an improved oxidative stability. \n\n\nDEFINITIONS \n\n\n The term \"FGF21 compound\" as used herein refers to native human FGF21 as well as analogues thereof. \n\n\n The sequence of the native human FGF21 protein is available from the UNIPROT database with accession no. Q9NSA1. The 209 amino acid precursor protein includes a signal peptide (amino acids 1-28) and a mature protein (amino acids 29-209). The mature protein is included herein as SEQ ID NO:1 (amino acids 1-181 ), and the signal peptide as SEQ ID NO:2 (amino acids 1-28). An isoform or allelic form of native human FGF21 having a Pro instead of Leu in the mature protein at position 146 of SEQ ID NO: 1 herein is known from, La., US2001012628 A1 (residue no. 174 of SEQ ID NO:2 in the published US application). Another isoform having a shorter signal peptide in which Leu at position 23 of SEQ ID NO:2 herein is missing is known from WO 2003/01 1213 (see SEQ ID NO: 2 of the WO publication having a signal peptide of 27 amino acid residues). Thus, particular examples of native human FGF21 are: SEQ ID NO: 1 , SEQ ID NO:1 having the substitution L146P, as well as any of these sequences preceded by the 27 or 28 amino acids signal peptide referred to above. Preferred examples of native human FGF21 are the mature parts, viz. SEQ ID NO: 1 and the L146P isoform thereof. \n\n\n The term \"analogue\", for example as referred to herein in the context of FGF21 , i.e., an FGF21 analogue, refers to polypeptides that are or can be, deduced or derived from native FGF21 , from SEQ ID NO:1 in particular, by modification of the amino acid sequence thereof. Such modification, amendment or change may include substitution, deletion, and/or addition of one or more amino acids. For example, amino acids may be added and/or deleted at the C-terminus, at the N-terminus, or internally in the amino acid sequence. Preferably amino acids are added and/or deleted at the C- and/or N-terminus, more preferably at the N-terminus. Amino acid sequences with C- or N-terminally \n\n deleted amino acids may also be referred to as truncated sequences, as is known in the art. Likewise, amino acids added internally in the sequence may be referred to as insertions. In one embodiment of this invention, the number of the above modifications of SEQ ID NO: 1 to give an FGF21 analogues is not more than 1 1 and, preferably, more than 9, more preferred more than 7, even more preferred more than 5 and even more preferred more than 3. The term \"variant\" or \"mutein\" is now and then used herein instead of the term \"analogue\". \n\n\n One example of an FGF21 analogue is the truncated form of native mature FGF21 in which the four N-terminal amino acid residues of the mature protein (HPIP) are removed, which is disclosed in, e.g., WO 2006/065582. This truncated form is said to stimulate glucose uptake in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes at the same level as the wild-type FGF21. This protein has the amino acid sequence of amino acids 5-181 of SEQ ID NO: 1 herein. \n\n\n A further example of an FGF21 analogue is the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:1 which has an N- terminal Met (also designated \"Met-FGF21 \" or as substitution -1 M ((minus 1 )M) of SEQ ID NO:1 ). An N-terminal Met is added when FGF21 compound is expressed in E. coli, see e.g. WO 2006/050247, Table 6. \n\n\n Other examples of FGF21 analogues are the modified FGF21 sequences (often called muteins) which are disclosed in e.g. WO 2003/061712, WO 2005/091944, WO 2006/028595, WO 2006/028714, WO 2006/065582 and WO 2008/121563. Still further examples of FGF21 analogues are disclosed in the experimental part herein, as well as in the appended claims. \n\n\n The term \"amino acid\" or \"amino acid residue\" as referred to herein in the context of FGF21 modifications includes the twenty standard alpha-amino acids being used by cells in protein biosynthesis and specified by the genetic code, viz. alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine. The term also includes non-standard amino acids, such as selenocysteine and pyrrolysine which are also encoded by the genetic code but rare in proteins. Other non-standard amino acids found in proteins may be formed by post-translational modification, for example γ-carboxyglutamate and hydroxyproline. Additional examples of non-standard or non-natural amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code are ornithine and phosphoserine. Still further examples of non-standard amino acids are synthetic amino acids including amino acids manufactured by chemical synthesis, e.g. D-isomers of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code such as D-alanine, D-glutamine, D-histidine, and D-leucine, Aib (a-aminoisobutyric acid), Abu (a- aminobutyric acid), Tie (tert-butylglycine), β-alanine, 3-aminomethyl benzoic acid, anthranilic acid, des-aminohistidine (abbreviated DesaminoHis, alternative name imidazopropionic acid, abbreviated Impr), the beta analogues of amino acids such as β-alanine, 2-aminohistidine, β-hydroxyhistidine, ho- mohistidine, Na-acetylhistidine, a-fluoromethylhistidine, a-methylhistidine, α,α-dimethylglutamic acid, m-CF\n3\n-phenylalanine (abbreviated m-CF\n3\n-Phe), α,β-diaminopropionic acid (abbreviated Dap), 3- pyridylalanine, 2-pyridylalanine or 4-pyridylalanine, (l-aminocyclopropyl)carboxylic acid, (1-amino- cyclobutyl)carboxylic acid, (l-aminocyclopentyl)carboxylic acid, (l-aminocyclohexyl)carboxylic acid, (l-aminocycloheptyl)carboxylic acid, and (l-aminocyclooctyl)carboxylic acid. \n\n For the present purposes the two recognized codes of the standard amino acids (one-letter and three-letter) are used interchangeably, or now and then the amino acid name is fully spelled out. These terms are of course considered fully equivalent (e.g. S = Ser = serine). \n\n\n The term \"derivative\", for example as referred to herein in the context of FGF21 , e.g., a FGF21 derivative, as used herein refers to an FGF21 compound which has been covalently modified exemplified by the addition of the modifying group(s) herein designated A-B-C-D-. The term is not limiting as such, rather descriptive, as it is intended to mark a distinction between changes made to the constituent FGF21 polypeptide compound as such (\"analogues\"), and the covalent binding of a side chain to the FGF21 compound, whereby the compound is \"derivatised\". \n\n\n Nomenclature: Analogues and derivatives are named herein using, interchangeably, polypeptide nomenclature, organic chemical nomenclature, and chemical formulas, or mixtures thereof, whatever is deemed best suited for easing the understanding of the technical matter in question. For example, the derivative of example 3 may be named N-alpha(4-{[2-(2-{2-[2-(2-{2-[(S)-4-carboxy-4-(17- carboxyheptadecanoylamino)butyrylamino]ethoxy}ethoxy)acetylamino]ethoxy}ethoxy)acetylamino]- methyljbenzyl) [Arg56, Arg59, Arg69, Arg122] Gly-FGF21 (meaning that [Arg56, Arg59, Arg69,\n\n\nArg122] Gly-FGF21 is modified by 4-{[2-(2-{2-[2-(2-{2-[(S)-4-carboxy-4-(17-carboxyheptadecanoyl- amino)butyrylamino]ethoxy}ethoxy)acetylamino]ethoxy}ethoxy)acetylamino]methyl}benzyl at the alpha- amino group of the N-terminal amino acid Gly). But this compound may also be defined as [Arg56, Arg59, Arg69, Arg122] Gly-FGF21 derivatised at N-alpha of the N-terminal with the following com- pound: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n wherein * is the point of attachment to said alpha amino group of the N terminal amino acid Gly. \n\n\n Variant nomenclature (Nomenclature of analogues): Variants (or analogues) of FGF21 are named herein using, interchangeably, polypeptide nomenclature, organic chemical nomenclature, chemical formulas, amino acid sequences, or a mix thereof, whatever is deemed best suited for easing the understanding of the technical matter in question. \n\n\n For example, a substitution in a variant may be indicated as: \"Original amino acid-position- substituted amino acid\". The three or one letter code may be used. Accordingly, the notation \"K122C\" or \"Lys122Cys\" means, that the variant comprises a substitution of lysine with cysteine in the variant amino acid position corresponding to the amino acid at position 122 in FGF21 (SEQ ID NO:1 ), when the variant and FGF21 are aligned as described further below (\"alignment\"). \n\n\n Multiple modifications such as e.g. substitutions may be separated by commas (with a space after the comma), and if desired surrounded by brackets in order to make it clear that they belong to the same variant. The analogue which is derivatised in example 3 may for example be designated \"K56R, K59R, K69R, K122R Gly-FGF21 \" or \"(K56R, K59R, K69R, K122R) Gly-FGF21 \" or it may be \n\n referred to as \"SEQ ID NO:1 with K56R, K59R, K69R, and K122R and an N-terminal G\". An even more simple way of designating this compound is to leave out the amino acids which have been exchanged so that the name becomes: \"56R, 59R, 69R, 122R Gly-FGF21 \". See compound example 2d for the nomenclature of a variant with multiple modifications in the form of a mix of substitutions and insertions. \n\n\n Alternative modifications such as alternative substituents at a given position may be separated by commas, as e.g. in the designation \"S181 K,R\", which means that the Ser at position 181 may be substituted with Lys or Arg. \n\n\n An extension can be described by reference to SEQ ID NO:1 by addition of position numbers (continued positive numbers in the C-terminal end and negative numbers in the N-terminal end) or, more simply, by adding the amino acids of the extension in question, using the correct sequence thereof, to the compound in question, which is then often given a trivial name, such as FGF21 , again in order to ease the understanding of the relevant technical point. As an example, the compound of example 2a designates the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 (FGF21 ) with an G at position -1 and the mu- tations K56R, K59R, K69R, K122R by reference to SEQ ID NO:1 . \n\n\n An insertion in a variant may be indicated as: \"Amino acid position number before the insertion-index-inserted amino acid\". The amino acid position number before the insertion refers to the amino acid position in FGF21 (SEQ ID NO:1 ) just before the gap, which is created when the variant and FGF21 are aligned as described further below (\"alignment\"). For the amino acids, the three or one letter code may be used. The index is a lower case letter in alphabetical order, e.g. \"a\" for the first inserted amino acid residue, \"b\" for the second inserted amino acid residue, etc., as applicable. Accordingly, the notation\"V169aT\" (or \"Val169aThr\") or simply \"169aT\" (or \"169aThr\") all mean, that the variant comprises an insertion of threonine after valine at position 169 in FGF21 (SEQ ID NO: 1 ), when the variant and FGF21 are aligned as described further below (\"alignment\"). \n\n\n For purposes of the present invention, the alignment of two amino acid sequences may be made using the Needle program from the EMBOSS package (http://emboss.org). A preferred version is 2.8.0. The Needle program implements the global alignment algorithm described in Needleman, S. B. and Wunsch, C. D. (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48, 443-453. The substitution matrix used is BLOSUM62, gap opening penalty is 10, and gap extension penalty is 0.5. \n\n\n The degree or percentage of identity between an FGF21 analogue sequence of the present invention (\"invention sequence\"; e.g. SEQ ID NO: 1 with K56R, K59R, and K69R) and a different amino acid sequence (\"foreign sequence\"; e.g. the FGF21 sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 ) is calculated as the number of exact matches in an alignment of the two sequences, divided by the length of the \"invention sequence\" or the length of the \"foreign sequence\", whichever is the shortest. The result is expressed in percent identity. \n\n\n An exact match occurs when the \"invention sequence\" and the \"foreign sequence\" have identical amino acid residues in the same positions of the overlap (in the alignment example below this is represented by \"·\"). The length of a sequence is the number of amino acid residues in the sequence (e.g. the length of SEQ ID NO:1 is 181 ). \n\n This is an example of an alignment of the \"invention sequence\" and the \"foreign sequence\" that are referred to above: \n\n\nFGF21_SEQ1 HPIPDSSPLLQFGGQVRQRYLYTDDAQQTEAHLEIREDGTVGGAADQSPESLLQLKALKP\n\n\n56_59_69R HPIPDSSPLLQFGGQVRQRYLYTDDAQQTEAHLEIREDGTVGGAADQSPESLLQLRALRP \n\n\nFGF21_SEQ1 GVIQILGVKTSRFLCQRPDGALYGSLHFDPEACSFRELLLEDGYNVYQSEAHGLPLHLPG\n\n\n56_59_69R GVIQILGVRTSRFLCQRPDGALYGSLHFDPEACSFRELLLEDGYNVYQSEAHGLPLHLPG \n\n\nFGF21_SEQ1 NKSPHRDPAPRGPARFLPLPGLPPALPEPPGILAPQPPDVGSSDPLSMVGPSQGRSPSYA\n\n\n56_59_69R NKSPHRDPAPRGPARFLPLPGLPPALPEPPGILAPQPPDVGSSDPLSMVGPSQGRSPSYA \n\n\nFGF21_SEQ1 S \n\n\n56_59_69R S \n\n\n Accordingly, the percentage of identity of this FGF21 analogue to FGF21 is 178/181x100% = 98.3%.

The sequences are aligned by the program, using the default scoring matrix BLOSUM50. The penalty for the first residue of a gap is 12, and for further residues of a gap the penalties are 2.

More specifically, reference is made to the specific working examples below and other publications describing the preparation of such compounds. \n\n\n Example 1 and 2 below describes the cloning and expression of FGF21 and FGF21 ana- logues in E.coli. Alternatively, FGF21 and FGF21 analogues, optionally with N-terminal extensions, can be expressed in yeast as follows: \n\n\n FGF21 with N-terminal amino acid extensions can be expressed in S. cerevisiae. In one embodiment, this requires strain design in which a strain disrupted in PMT2, PEP4 and YPS1 is created. This strain can be designed using classical techniques relying on homologous recombination allowing specific integration at the respective loci. FGF21 with N-terminal extension is coded for on an S. cerevisiae expression vector which can be maintained in S. cerevisiea. To direct the FGF21 analogue to the secretory pathway a pre-pro sequence including a signal peptide (for example the MFalpha pre- pro leader sequence) may be provided in the recombinant expression vector. This sequence is joined to the DNA encoding the FGF21 analogue in correct reading frame. This signal peptide ensures secre- tion to the media. Upstream and adjacent to the FGF21 analogue sequence a dibasic amino acid sequence is placed ensuring cleavage of the prepro sequence from the FGF21 analogue before secretion to the media. The cleavage is likely to be caused by KEX2 activity. The FGF21 analogue can be harvested from the media. \n\n The derivatives of an FGF compound and the FGF21 analogues can, if desired, be formulated together with other medicaments such as insulin. \n\n\nTo sum up and supplement the above statements, certain embodiments of this invention are as follows: \n\n\n1.

Biophys. Acta 1492(1 ):203-206 (2000). The sequences are also available from public databases with accession nos. EMBL:AB021975 and UNIPROT:Q9NSA1 , respectively. \n\n\n The native polypeptide is synthesised with a signal peptide of 28 amino acids for secretion: \n\n\n1 MDSDETGFEH SGLWVSVLAG LLLGACQAHP IPDSSPLLQF GGQVRQRYLY \n\n\n51 TDDAQQTEAH LEIREDGTVG GAADQSPESL LQLKALKPGV IQILGVKTSR \n\n\n101 FLCQRPDGAL YGSLHFDPEA CSFRELLLED GYNVYQSEAH GLPLHLPGNK \n\n 151 SPHRDPAPRG PARFLPLPGL PPALPEPPGI LAPQPPDVGS SDPLSMVGPS \n\n\n201 QGRSPSYAS \n\n\nThe signal peptide, shown in italics above, is included in the appended sequence listing as SEQ ID NO:2. The mature FGF21 polypeptide consisting of the remaining 181 amino acids is included in the sequence listing as SEQ ID NO: 1. \n\n\n The mature FGF21 polypeptide was cloned and expressed as an intracellular protein in E.coli, without the signal peptide, but with an added N-terminal methionine or an N-terminal Met-Ala which is processed in E. coli resulting in N-terminal Ala (-1Ala). More in particular, a 550 bp coding region including at the 3'-end the ATG codon for Met, as well as Nde1 and BamH 1 restriction sites at the 3'- and 5'-ends, respectively, was inserted into the expression vector pET 1 1 c in Nde1-BamH1 under control of the phage T7 promoter, and transformed into E.coli B BL21 (DE3). The cells were grown in LB amp 100 ug/mL to OD\n450\n 0.5, and expression was induced with 0.3 mM IPTG for 4 hours at 37°C. Crude extracts of cells were made by sonication for analysis of FGF21 expression. \n\n\n A Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE showed successful expression of FGF21 which was identified mainly in the soluble supernatant fraction, with very little in the insoluble pellet. Although the calculated MW of the thus expressed FGF21 (Met-FGF21 ) (Compound A) is 19.5 kD, it migrated on the gel as a 25 kD protein, which is likely due to the high content of prolines, delaying the movement of the protein. \n\n\nExample 2: Cloning, expression and purification of FGF21 analogues \n\n\n The following analogues of Met-FGF21 were designed as is known in the art and expressed in E.coli as generally described in example 1 : \n\n\n2a) [K56R, K59R, K69R, K122R] Gly-FGF21. \n\n\n2b) [Q28R, K56R, K59R, K69R, D102T, D121 Q, K122R, L166F, S167G, M168L, G170T] Ala-FGF21. 2c) [S71 C, N121 Q, L166F, S167G, M168L, P171 L, S172E, Q173A, G174V, Y179F, A180E, des181] Ala-FGF21. \n\n\n 2d) [S71 C, N121 Q, L166F, S167G, M168L, des170, 173aA, G174V, Y179F, A180E, des181] Ala- FGF21. \n\n\n2e) [S71 C, N121 Q, L166F, S167G, M168L, 173aA, G174V, Y179F, A180E, des181] Ala-FGF21. 2f) [N121 Q, L166F, S167G, M168L, P171 L, S172E, Q173A, G174V, Y179F, A180E, des181] Ala- FGF21. \n\n\n 2g) [N121 Q] Met-FGF21. \n\n\n2h) [N121 Q] Ala-FGF21. \n\n\n2i) [N121 Q, L166F, S167G, M168L, P171 L, S172E, Q173A, G174V, Y179F, A180E, des181] Phe- FGF21. \n\n\nThe same analogues can be expressed and prepared in S. cerevisiae by methods known per se and suitable for this organism. \n\n The FGF21 polypeptide and its analogues prepared as described in examples 1-2 were further purified as follows or using similar technics: \n\n\n A slurry (20% w/v) of E.coli in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 was sonicated (3 seconds on/off intervals on ice for 5 minutes). The polypeptide was pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 x g, for 30 minutes), re-solubilised by sonication in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, and debris removed by centrifugation (10,000 x g, for 30 minutes). The polypeptide in the resulting supernatant was purified by anion exchange chromatography (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 50-250 mM NaCI) using Q Sepharose Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare), as generally described in Protein Purification. Principles and Practice Series: Springer Advanced Texts in Chemistry Scopes, Robert K. 3rd ed., 1994. In some instances, further purification was done by size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex pg 75 column (GE Healthcare) operated with 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 200 mM NaCI. For storage the polypeptide was transferred to DPBSS, and stored frozen. \n\n\nExample 3: Derivatisation of FGF21 compounds at the N-terminus with modifying groups \n\n\nModifying groups containing an aldehyde may be synthesised as described in the following and FGF21 and analogues thereof may be derivatised with such modifying groups as also described in the following.

The mixture was concentrated in vacuo and co-concentrated with toluene (twice). The residue was dissolved in THF (2.5 ml) and a solution of 17-((S)-1-carboxy-3-{2-[2-({2-[2-(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yloxycarbonyl- methoxy)ethoxy]ethylcarbamoyl}methoxy)ethoxy]ethylcarbamoyl}propylcarbamoyl)heptadecanoic acid (320 mg, prepared as described previously in WO2009/083549) in THF (5 ml) was added. DIPEA (0.5 ml) was added slowly. After 130 min, the mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was disolved in EtOAc and 1 N HCI. The organic layer was extracted with 1 N HCI and brine. The organic layer was dried (Na\n2\nS0\n4\n) and concentrated in vacuo to give the title compound as a white solid, which was used without further purification.

CL-173) are maintained in basal medium (DMEM (4500 mg/l Glucose) with 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and Penicillin/Streptomycin). The cells are not allowed to reach confluence and should be passed (transferred to new vials) before reaching approx. 60 % of confluency (by visual inspection). \n\n\n For the glucose uptake assay, cells are plated 80,000 cells/well in a 24 well plate, or 20,000 cells/well in a 96 well plate, and when they reach confluency (high density, with a view to have differentiated adipose cells made), the medium is changed from basal medium to basal medium containing Troglitazone, IBMX, Dexamethasone (commercially available from, e.g., Sigma) and human insulin (commercially available from, e.g., Novo Nordisk A S). \n\n\n The cells are used 7-14, preferably 7-10, days after initiation of differentiation. The cells are stimulated with increasing concentrations (0-300 nM) of the FGF21 polypeptides or derivatives of the invention for 20 hours in basal medium. Before addition of 3H-deoxyglucose (in what follows: the tracer) the cells are washed in warm (approximately 37°C) assay buffer (PBS with 1 mM MgCI\n2\n and 2 mM CaCI\n2\n), HEPES and 0.1 % Human serum albumin) and the cells are incubated with the tracer for 1 hour. This incubation is terminated by washing twice in ice cold assay buffer. The cells are lysed with Triton X-100 and lysates transferred to a 96 wells plate, microscint-40 (commercially available from, e.g., Perkin Elmer) is added and amount of tracer counted in a TOP-counter (e.g. a Packard top- counter from Perkin Elmer).

Description\n\n\n\n\n MODULATION OF NUCLEAR-RETAINED RNA \n\n\nSequence Listing \n\n\n The present application is being filed along with a Sequence Listing in electronic format. The Sequence Listing is provided as a file entitled BIOL0133WOSEQ.txt created July 19, 2011, which is approximately 724 kb in size. The information in the electronic format of the sequence listing is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n\n\n Field of the Invention \n\n\n Provided herein are methods of achieving a pharmacologically relevant reduction of nuclear- retained RNAs and RNAs having a long residence time in the nucleus in a tissue having low antisense oligonucleotide uptake. Such methods are useful, for example, for treating, ameliorating, delaying or reducing a symptom of a disease or disorder in an animal associated with nuclear- retained RNAs and RNAs having a long residence time in the nucleus. \n\n\nBackground Systemic administration of antisense oligonucleotides produces high tissue concentration in liver and renal cortex, and moderate levels in some other tissues such as adipose, spleen and certain inflammatory cells. Uptake of 2'MOE gapmer oligonulceotides in spleen and inflammatory cells is typically 2 to 5-fold less than in the liver. In other tissues, including skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscle, tumor and brain, systemic admimstration of antisense oligonucleotides results in low to no accumulation of olignucleotide. The systemic delivery of 2'MOE gapmer oligonucleotides results in skeletal and cardiac muscle concentration that is approximately 50-fold lower than liver. Within tissue, the oligonucleotide distribution is heterogeneous with regard to cell type. For example, glomeruli, distal tubular epithelial cells and lymphocytes demonstrate lower uptake of \n\n\noligonucleotide compared to other cells in kidney and lymphoid tissue. Pharmacodynamic effects are consistent with biodistribution data. Systemic administration of 2'MOE gapmer \n\n\noligonucleotides produce modest target inhibition in skeletal or cardiac muscle in WT mice, even when targeting sequences are highly optimized.

The most prominent structure is the nucleolus, a non-membrane structure in which ribosomal RNA is transcribed and processed (Thiry, M. and Lanfontaine, D. L. J. Trends Cell Biol. 2005. 15: 194-199). Chromatin domains are also important structures which house the genomic DNA of the cell and regulate its expression (Cremer, T. et al., Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 2000. 10: 179-212). \n\n\n The nucleus also contains speckles, or clusters of granules, of which interchromatin granules (ICGs) form a well-known class (Spector, D.L. et al., EMBO J. 1991. 10: 2467-3481), and which are the storage centres for various snRNAs, snRNPs (small nuclear RNA binding proteins), and RNA polymerase II (Fu, X.Y. and Maniatis, T. Nature. 1990. 343: 437-441). Many of the larger speckles correspond to interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs). These clusters measure 0.8-1.8 μηι in diameter and are composed of 20-25-nm diameter particles that appear connected in places. IGCs have been proposed to be involved in the assembly and/or modification of pre-mRNA splicing factors. \n\n\n Nuclear splicing speckles or interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs) also contain nuclear retained RNAs (Thiry, M. Eur. J. Cell. Biol. 1993. 62: 259-269). Certain nuclear retained RNAs remain in the nucleus for the duration of their life, and some of these may be released to the cytoplasm in response to certain signals, such as cellular stress. RNA is retained in the nucleus as a consequence of its editing by RNA adenosine deaminases and formation of large RNP complexes. Paraspeckles (PSs) are discrete nuclear bodies (Fox, A.H. et al., Mol. Biol. Cell 2005. 16: 5304- 5315) often nearby or adjacent to splicing speckles, and also implicated in nuclear retention of certain RNAs. Studies (Clemenson, CM. et al., Mol. Cell 2009. 33: 717-726; Sasaki, Y.T. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2009. 106: 2525-2530; Sunwoo, H. et al., Genome Res. 2009. 19: 347- 359) have shown the two non-coding RNAs, Mens/NEATl and Μβηβ, as structural elements, critical for the formation and maintenance of PSs. \n\n Similar to PSs are the formation of stress nuclear bodies (SNBs), which similarly takes place at specific transcription sites around satellite repeat transcripts (Denegri, M. et al., Mol. Biol. Cell 2002. 13: 2069-2079; Jolly, C. et al., J. Cell Biol. 2002. 156: 775-781; Rizzi, N. et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 2004. 15: 543-551). SNBs are associated with factors in the regulation of RNA transcription and processing, though their actual role has not yet been elucidated. \n\n\n Another nuclear domain, the perichromatin fibrils (PCFs), is distributed throughout the nucleus, and contains snRNPs, non-snRNPs and hnRNPs (Spector, D.L. Ann. Rev. Cell.Biol. 1993. 9: 265-315). These suggest that the PCFs are the sites of transcription and pre-mRNA processing (Fakan, S. et al., J. Cell Biol. 1984. 98: 358-363). Other such active nuclear sites are coiled bodies or Cajal bodies (CBs) (Lamond, A.I. and Carmo-Fonesca, M. Trends Cell Biol. 1993. 3: 198-204; Gall, J.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000. 16: 273-300) that are found in cells with a high RNA transcriptional/processing demand (Cajal, S.R. Trab. Lab Invest. Biol. Univ. Madrid 1903. 2: 129- 221). CBs may represent domains that snRNPs would enter for maturation/recycling and leave to eventually integrate other functional domains, such as the splicing speckles or active transcriptional units. \n\n\n Additional nuclear bodies are the perinuclear compartment (PNC) associated with the nucleolus and also implicated in RNA metabolism (Huang, S. J. Struct. Biol. 2000. 129: 233-240), granular and fibrillar regions of the nucleolus, promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies (Doucas, V. and Evans, R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1996. 1288: M25-M29), histone locus bodies, heat shock factor 1 foci, SAM-68 bodies, GATA-1 foci, and nuclear dots (Ascoli, C.A. and Maul, G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991. 112: 785-795). \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the nrRNA targeted in the methods described herein is contained in one of the subnuclear structures described herein, including, but not limited to, nucleoli, Cajal bodies, speckles, paraspeckles, stress nuclear bodies, perichromatin fibrils and perinuclear compartments. In certain embodiments, the nrRNA targeted in the methods described herein is associated with a ribonuclear protein or RNP complex. \n\n\nNuclear retention \n\n\n The cell nucleus, especially in mammalian cells, is a highly organized structure. Specific proteins and nucleic acids are enriched in subnuclear structures such as nucleoli, Cajal bodies, paraspeckles, and nuclear speckles (Platini and Lamond, 2004). Many of these structures are \n\n involved in control of gene expression through retention of RNA. The mechanism of nuclear retention is thought to be mediated by a number of structural features of RNA. For example, inosine-containing RNAs (or RNAs that undergo adenosine to inosine hyper editing) as well as RNAs with extended 3'UTRs and RNAs with inverted repeat elements, such as Alu elements, have been linked with nuclear retention (Bond and Fox 2009). RNAs with inverted repeats elements, such as Alu repeats, are shown to form double-stranded hairpins. These hairpins associate with ribonuclear proteins and can undergo adenosine to inosine (A to I) hyper editing (Zhang and Carmichael 2001 ; Bond and Fox, 2009). Other studies have also shown the importance of A-to-I editing in human RNAs as a reason for their stability (Athanasiadis, 2004; Kim, 2004). Other studies have shown that mutant expanded nucleotide repeat-containing RNAs form hairpins that associate with nuclear proteins or other proteins and thereby become sequestered or retained in the nucleus. \n\n\n Thus, presence of an extended 3' UTR, presence of expanded or inverted repeat elements, presence of inosine or A to I editing of certain sequences and the binding of nucleoproteins to the RNA may be major contributing factors to nuclear retention or the increased stability of nuclear- retained RNAs. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the nrRNA targeted or provided in the methods as described herein has an extended 3 ' UTR. In certain embodiments, the nrRNA has one or more inverted repeat elements. In certain embodiments, the nrRNA contains inosine or undergoes A to I editing. In certain embodiments, the nrRNA binds nucleoproteins, ribonucleoproteins or snRNPs or a complex of any one or more thereof. \n\n\nStability of nuclear retained RNAs \n\n\n nrRNAs are generally understood to have greater stability compared to protein-coding RNAs. The comparative stability of nrRNAs is generally attributed to their structure as well as association with ribonucleoprotein complexes (Viegas, S.C. and Arraiano, CM. RNA Biol. 2008. 5: 230-243). For example, the MALAT1 transcript, which has a long half-life, has a conserved genomically encoded short poly(A)-rich tract which yields a short poly(A) tail-like moiety at its 3'- end in the mature transcript. The presence of such short poly(A) tracts or tails have been previously shown to be effective at ensuring RNA stability (Peng, J. et al., RNA 2005. 1 1 : 958-965). U-rich motifs are also believed to play a role in RNA stability. The presence of a poly(A) tail-like moiety \n\n and nearby U-rich motifs are believed to be the reason for the long half-life of MALAT-1 and its resistance to exonucleases (Wilusz J.E. et al., Cell 2008. 135: 919-932). \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the nrRNA targeted or provided in the methods described herein includes a poly(A) tail or U-rich motifs. \n\n\nNuclear Retained RNAs \n\n\n Non-Coding RNA \n\n\n A large proportion of the mammalian genome is transcribed into long transcripts of RNA that do not get translated into protein. Such long non-coding RNA, previously considered as artifacts in the cell, are now beginning to be functionally characterized. Long non-coding RNA (long ncRNA) may serve one of many functions, such as structural, house-keeping, silencing by antisense or repression, and/or regulation of other gene expression. Mercer et al. (Mercer, T.R. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2008. 105: 716-721) have identified 849 long ncRNAs that are expressed in the adult mouse brain and found that the majority of processed transcripts with no protein-coding capacity function intrinsically as RNAs. Guttman et al. (Guttman, M. et al., Nature., 2009, 458, 223-227) have identified over a thousand long ncRNAs (large intervening non-coding RNAs or lincRNAs) and have assigned putative functions to each, demonstrating a diverse range of roles in processes from embryonic stem cell pluripotency to cell proliferation. \n\n\n Long non-coding RNAs described in literature as possessing structural function are Neatl (Clemson, CM. et al., Mol. Cell 2009. 33 : 717-726), Neat2/Malat-1 (Wilusz, J.E. et al., Cell 2008. 135: 919-932), hsr-omega (Lakhotia, S.C. et al., Curr. Sci. 1999. 77: 553-563), Xlsirt, which anchors other RNAs to the vegetal cortex in Xenopus oocytes (Kloc, M. and Etkin, L.D. Science 1994. 265: 1 101-1103), Satellite 111, which has been implicated in the establishment and maintenance of a specific chromatin structure at the 9ql2 pericentromeric region during stress (Jolly, C. and Lakhotia, S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006. 34: 5508-5514), and Menfi (Sasaki, Y.T. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2009. 106: 2525-2530). Recent studies have implicated long ncRNAs as messengers of non- Mendelian inheritance of extragenomic information. Long ncRNAs hothead in Arapidopsis thaliana (Lolle, S.J. Nature 2005. 434: 505-509) and Kit in mouse (Rassoulzadegan, M. et al., Nature 2006. 441 : 469-474) both function as alternate genome caches. \n\n Computational analysis of data from large-scale sequencing projects has revealed an abundance of natural antisense transcripts in eukaryotic genomes (Lehner, B. et al., Trends Genet. 2002. 18: 63-65; Lavorgna, G. et al., Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004. 29: 88-94). More than 1600 transcripts have been identified as natural antisense transcripts in human (Yelin, R. et al., Nat. \n\n\nBiotechnol. 2003. 21 : 379-386). These may be transcribed in cis or in trans. Non-coding RNAs described in literature as possessing antisense function are Xist, which has a role in X chromosome inactivation (Brockdorff N. et al., Cell 1992. 71 : 515-526, Brown, C.J. et al., Cell 1992. 71 : 527- 542); Tsix (Lee, J.T. et al., Nat. Gen. 1999. 21 : 400-404), which is antisense to Xist; Air, which silences autosomal genes of the paternal allele (Sleutels, F. et al., Nature 2002. 415: 810-813); \n\n\nCop2as, which is antisense to the Cop2 gene and is maternally imprinted (Lee, Y.J. et al., FEBS Lett. 2000. 472: 230-234); Mirg, antisense to the Rtll gene which is paternally expressed (Seitz, H. et al., Nat. Genet. 2003. 34: 261-262); Kcnqlotl, an antisense transcript that regulates lineage- specific silencing (Thakur, N. et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004. 24: 7855-7862; Pandey, R.R. et al., Mol.

USA 2000. 97: 3342-3346); SRG1, which represses transcription of the SER3 gene in yeast (Martens, J. A. et al., Genes & Dev. 2004. 19: 2695-2704); antisense transcripts against the ErbAa2 mRNA in B cells (Hastings, M.L. et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 1997. 25: 4296-4300; Hastings, M.L. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2000. 275: 11507-11513); the antisense transcript against the HFE mRNA, which is implicated in iron metabolism (Thenie, A.C. et al., Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001. 10: 1859-1866); the pseudo-NOS transcript, which is an antisense regulator of nNOS protein synthesis (Korneev, S.A. J Neurosci. 1999. 19: 7711-7720); and 231 known Hox ncRNAs, including Hotair, which represses transcription in trans of the HOXD locus (Rinn, J.L. et al., Cell 2007. 129: 131 1-1323). \n\n\n Non-coding RNAs may also regulate gene expression as dsRNAs, which also induce gene silencing via RNAi pathways. Such sense-antisense RNA-induced gene silencing has been well- documented (Aravin, A.A. Curr. Biol. 2001. 11 : 1017-1027; Saito, K. et al., Genes & Dev. 2006. 20: 2214-2222; Vagin, V.V. et al., Science 2006. 313: 320-324). These transcripts in mammals are called piRNAs (Aravin, A. et al., Nature 2006. 442: 203-207; Girard, A. et al., Nature 2006. 442: 199-202) and are involved in germline-specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene \n\n silencing (Carthew, R.W. Science 2006. 313: 305-306; Lau, N.C. et al., Science 2006. 313: 363- 367). \n\n\n Other non-coding RNAs described in literature as possessing regulatory function are Evf (Feng, J. et al., Genes Dev. 2006. 20: 1470-1484), which interacts with homeobox transcription factor Dlx2; Glt2 (Schuster-Gossler, K. et al., Dev.

The snoRNA U16 and U50 function in the modification of other small nuclear RNAs (Fragapane, P. et al., EMBO J. 12: 2921-2928, 1993; Tanaka, R. et al., Genes Cells. 5: 277-287, 2000). Nucleic acids have also been found in Cajal bodies within the nucleus. RNA found in Cajal bodies have been referred to as small Cajal body-specific RNA (scaRNA). Certain scaRNA have been reported to be involved in nucleotide modification of spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). SnoRNA machinery has been implicated in human diseases such as Dyskeratosis congenital and Prader-Willi syndrome (Meier, U.T., Chromosoma 2005 114: 1-14). \n\n\n Table 1 \n\n\n \n\n P-rexl NM 020820 phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5- 16 trisphosphate-dependent Rac \n\n\n exchange factor 1 \n\n\n ZNF127AS AF130844.1 MKRN3AS; MKRN3 antisense 17 \n\n\n RNA (non-protein coding) \n\n\n NESPAS AJ251759 neuroendocrine secretory protein 18 antisense \n\n\n SRG1 NM_202885.2 SRG1 ; (SENESCENCE- 19 \n\n\n RELATED GENE 1 \n\n\n Hotair NR 003716 hox transcript antisense RNA 20 \n\n\n (non-protein coding) \n\n\n Gomafu NR 033657 Miat; myocardial infarction 21 associated transcript (non-protein \n\n\n coding) \n\n\n Sox2ot NR_004053 SOX20T; SOX2 overlapping 22 transcript (non-protein coding) \n\n\n Rian NR_028261.1 Rian; RNA imprinted and 23 accumulated in nucleus \n\n\n CAT2 U35654.1 mCat2; cationic amino acid 24 transporter \n\n\n Xite AY190762.1 Xite; X-inactivation intergenic 25 transcription element \n\n\n Jp AV714079 NCRNA00183 non-protein 26 coding RNA 183 \" \n\n\n Ftx NR_028379 FTX; Thrombocytosis, familial 27 \n\n\n X-linked, FLJ 18387, \n\n\n NCRNA00182 \n\n\n RoXl NR_002098.1 roXl ; RNA on the X l 28\n\n\nRoX2 R_002105.1 roX2; RNA on the X 2 29\n\n\nH19 NR_002196.1 HI 9; HI 9, imprinted maternally 30 expressed transcript (non-protein \n\n\n coding) \n\n\n Igf2 NM_000612 Igf2; insulin-like growth factor 2 31\n\n\nIPW U12897 IPW; imprinted in Prader-Willi 32 syndrome (non-protein coding) \n\n\n UBE3A NM 000462 Ube3a; ubiquitin protein ligase 33 \n\n\n E3A \n\n\n ATP IOC NM 024490 ATP IOC; ATPase, Class V, type 34 \n\n\n IOC \n\n\nPgc NM_001103942.1 pgc; polar granule component 35\n\n\n7S NR 001445.2 RN7SK RNA, 7SK small nuclear 36\n\n\nRNA Pol II AF027300.1 Positive transcription elongation 37 transcription factor b \n\n\nelongation factor \n\n\nP-TEFb \n\n\n\n\n \n\n UBE3A-AS NG_002690 Ube3a ubiquitin protein ligase \n\n\n E3A \n\n\n SCA8 NR_002717 sca8 cell surface antigen-like 61 \n\n\n protein Sca8, KLHL1AS, \n\n\n ATXN80S \n\n\n ZNF127AS AF130844.1 MKRN3AS MKRN3 antisense 62 \n\n\n RNA (non-protein coding) \n\n\n 22k48 AF093016 Homo sapiens 22k48 gene, 63 \n\n\n 5'UTR \n\n\n C6orf370S NM_080870 DPCR1 diffuse panbronchiolitis 64 \n\n\n critical region 1, PBLT, \n\n\n bCX105N19.6 \n\n\n COPG2IT1 NR_024086 COPG2IT1 COPG2 imprinted 65 \n\n\n transcript 1 (non-protein coding) \n\n\n DGCR5 NR_002733 DGCR5 DiGeorge syndrome 66 \n\n\n critical region gene 5 (non-protein \n\n\n coding) \n\n\n KCNQ1 NR_002728 vDMRl, KvLQTl-AS, LIT1, 67 overlapping NCRNA00012, \n\n\n transcript 1 (nonprotein coding) \n\n\n MESTIT 1 AF482998 Homo sapiens MESTIT 1 68 \n\n\n antisense RNA, partial sequence \n\n\n PRINS NR_023388 PRINS psoriasis associated RNA 69 \n\n\n induced by stress (non-protein \n\n\n coding), NC NA00074 \n\n\nExpanded Nucleotide Repeat-Containing RNAs \n\n\n Mutant expanded nucleotide repeat-containing RNAs can form hairpins that associate with nuclear proteins or other proteins that become sequestered or retained in the nucleus. These expanded nucleotide repeat-containing RNAs (enrRNAs) are also referred to in the art as \"gain-of- function RNAs\" that gain the ability to sequester ribonuclear proteins and impair the normal action of RNA processing in the nucleus (see Cooper, T. (2009) Cell 136, 777-793; O'Rourke, JR (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284 (12), 7419-7423). Several disease states are associated with enrRNAs, some of said diseases only occurring where a threshold number of repeats are contained within the enrRNA. For instance, one disease state might be caused by 50-200 repeats in a particular gene, where a different disease or severity is caused by a different number of repeats >400 in the same gene. Some mutations that caused enrRNAs can be heterozygous and therefore some copies of the gene can be functional and as a result, there is a need to interfere with the mutant version of the gene without \n\n affecting the wild type copy of the gene. Examples of nucleotide repeat-containing RNA molecules that can have expanded repeat elements implicated in disease are the following: \n\n\n Table 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n An example from the table is myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). DM1, with an estimated frequency of 1 in 7,500, is an autosomal dominant disease that causes progressive disability and premature death. Skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle are affected. No treatment has been shown to modify the course of this disorder. The cause of DM1 is an expansion of CTG repeats in the 3' \n\n untranslated region (UTR) of DMPK, a gene encoding a cytosolic protein kinase. The mutation is unstable in dividing and post-mitotic cells, with a bias towards further expansion. Affected individuals typically have DMPK alleles with several thousand repeats in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Research on DM1 has led to the discovery of RNA dominance, a disease process in which expression of RNA containing an expanded CUG repeat (CUGexp) induces cell dysfunction and ultimately cell degeneration in muscle. A critical step in this process is the interaction of CUG repeats with splicing factors in the Muscleblind-like (MBNL1) family. This interaction causes retention of CUGexp RNA in nuclear foci, which adversely effects transcriptional and post- transcriptional regulation of other genes. Treatment of the disease is complicated because the drug or agent must be taken up by muscle tissue. Oligonucleotide uptake in muscle tissue is very low. \n\n\nReduction of nuclear-retained RNA \n\n\n Data provided herein demonstrates that sensitivity to cleavage by ASOs is dramatically increased for a nuclear-retained RNA making it possible to reduce nuclear-retained targets in tissue that has low uptake of oligonucleotide by a pharmacologically relevant amount. For example, out & the more than 4,000 transcripts that Isis has targeted by antisense, MALAT1 , a non-coding, nuclear- retained RNA, is demonstrated to be one of the most sensitive targets for antisense \n\n\noligonucleotide/RNase H inhibition. The data demonstrate a great number of oligonucleotides targeting over the majority of the transcript that inhibit by more than 50% in vitro. The data also demonstrates very low IC50 values in multiple cell types. Half-life studies have also shown that the MALAT1 is stable over a period of at least 10 hours. Subcutaneous administration of \n\n\noligonucleotide targeting MALAT1 at doses commensurate with other oligonucleotide drugs (e.g., liver targeting drugs) achieved pharmacologically relevant reduction of MALAT1 in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Dosing at 50mg/kg biweekly for 3.5 weeks achieved a 89% and 85% reduction in gastrocnemius and quadriceps, respectively, and 54% reduction in heart (as compared to 95% reduction in liver). Pharmacologically relevant reduction of MALAT1 has also been achieved in tumor xenograft models. \n\n\nWhere the nuclear-retained RNA is a mutant RNA, this sensitivity also provides a means to selectively reduce mutant RNA over wild-type. This approach is advantageous as the risk of inducing functional protein deficiency is reduced. \n\n Antisense Compounds \n\n\n Oligomeric compounds include, but are not limited to, oligonucleotides, oligonucleosides, oligonucleotide analogs, oligonucleotide mimetics, antisense compounds, antisense \n\n\noligonucleotides, and siRNAs. An oligomeric compound can be \"antisense\" to a target nucleic acid, meaning that is capable of undergoing hybridization to a target nucleic acid through hydrogen bonding. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, an antisense compound has a nucleobase sequence that, when written in the 5' to 3' direction, comprises the reverse complement of the target segment of a target nucleic acid to which it is targeted. In certain such embodiments, an antisense oligonucleotide has a nucleobase sequence that, when written in the 5' to 3' direction, comprises the reverse complement of the target segment of a target nucleic acid to which it is targeted. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, an antisense compound targeted to a nrRNA nucleic acid is 10 to 30 nucleotides in length. In other words, antisense compounds are from 10 to 30 linked nucleobases. In other embodiments, the antisense compound comprises a modified oligonucleotide consisting of 8 to 80, 10-80, 12 to 50, 15 to 30, 18 to 24, 19 to 22, or 20 linked nucleobases. In certain such \n-;\n \n\n\nembodiments, the antisense compound comprises a modified oligonucleotide consisting of 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, or 80 linked nucleobases in length, or a range defined by any two of the above values. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antisense compound comprises a shortened or truncated modified oligonucleotide. The shortened or truncated modified oligonucleotide can have a single nucleoside deleted from the 5' end (5' truncation), or alternatively from the 3' end (3' truncation). A shortened or truncated oligonucleotide can have two nucleosides deleted from the 5' end, or alternatively can have two subunits deleted from the 3' end. Alternatively, the deleted nucleosides can be dispersed throughout the modified oligonucleotide, for example, in an antisense compound having one nucleoside deleted from the 5' end and one nucleoside deleted from the 3' end. \n\n\n When a single additional nucleoside is present in a lengthened oligonucletide, the additional nucleoside can be located at the 5' or 3' end of the oligonucleotide. When two or more additional nucleosides are present, the added nucleosides can be adjacent to each other, for example, in an oligonucleotide having two nucleosides added to the 5' end (5' addition), or alternatively to the 3' \n\n end (3' addition), of the oligonucleotide. Alternatively, the added nucleoside can be dispersed throughout the antisense compound, for example, in an oligonucleotide having one nucleoside added to the 5' end and one subunit added to the 3' end. \n\n\n It is possible to increase or decrease the length of an antisense compound, such as an antisense oligonucleotide, and/or introduce mismatch bases without eliminating activity. For example, in Woolf et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:7305-7309, 1992), a series of antisense oligonucleotides 13-25 nucleobases in length were tested for their ability to induce cleavage of a target RNA in an oocyte injection model. Antisense oligonucleotides 25 nucleobases in length with 8 or 11 mismatch bases near the ends of the antisense oligonucleotides were able to direct specific cleavage of the target mRNA, albeit to a lesser extent than the antisense oligonucleotides that contained no mismatches. Similarly, target specific cleavage was achieved using 13 nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides, including those with 1 or 3 mismatches. \n\n\n Gautschi et al (J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 93:463-471, March 2001) demonstrated the ability of an oligonucleotide having 100% complementarity to the bcl-2 mRNA and having 3 mismatches to the bcl-xL mRNA to reduce the expression of both bcl-2 and bcl-xL in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, this oligonucleotide demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in vivo. \n:'\n \n\n\n Maher and Dolnick (Nuc. Acid. Res. 16:3341-3358, 1988) tested a series of tandem 14 nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides, and a 28 and 42 nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides comprised of the sequence of two or three of the tandem antisense oligonucleotides, respectively, for their ability to arrest translation of human DHFR in a rabbit reticulocyte assay. Each of the three 14 nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides alone was able to inhibit translation, albeit at a more modest level than the 28 or 42 nucleobase antisense oligonucleotides. \n\n\nAntisense Compound Motifs \n\n\n In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to a a nrRNA nucleic acid have chemically modified subunits arranged in patterns, or motifs, to confer to the antisense compounds properties such as enhanced the inhibitory activity, increased binding affinity for a target nucleic acid, or resistance to degradation by in vivo nucleases. \n\n\n Chimeric antisense compounds typically contain at least one region modified so as to confer increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid, and/or increased inhibitory activity. A second region of a chimeric antisense \n\n compound can optionally serve as a substrate for the nuclear ribonuclease RNase H, which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. \n\n\n Antisense compounds having a gapmer motif are considered chimeric antisense compounds. In a gapmer an internal region having a plurality of nucleotides that supports RNaseH cleavage is positioned between external regions having a plurality of nucleotides that are chemically distinct from the nucleosides of the internal region. In the case of an antisense oligonucleotide having a gapmer motif, the gap segment generally serves as the substrate for endonuclease cleavage, while the wing segments comprise modified nucleosides. In certain embodiments, the regions of a gapmer are differentiated by the types of sugar moieties comprising each distinct region. The types of sugar moieties that are used to differentiate the regions of a gapmer can in some embodiments include β- D-ribonucleosides, β-D-deoxyribonucleosides, 2'-modified nucleosides (such 2 '-modified nucleosides can include 2'-MOE, and 2'-0-CH\n3\n, among others), and bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides (such bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides can include those having a 4'-(CH2)n-0-2' bridge, where n=l or n=2). Preferably, each distinct region comprises uniform sugar moieties. The wing-gap-wing motif is frequently described as \"X-Y-Z\", where \"X\" represents the length of the 5' w¾g region, \"Y\" represents the length of the gap region, and \"Z\" represents the length of the 3 ' wing region. As used herein, a gapmer described as \"X-Y-Z\" has a configuration such that the gap segment is positioned immediately adjacent each of the 5' wing segment and the 3' wing segment. Thus, no intervening nucleotides exist between the 5' wing segment and gap segment, or the gap segment and the 3 ' wing segment. Any of the antisense compounds described herein can have a gapmer motif. In some embodiments, X and Z are the same, in other embodiments they are different. In a preferred embodiment, Y is between 8 and 15 nucleotides. X, Y or Z can be any of 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30 or more nucleotides. Thus, gapmers include, but are not limited to, for example 5-10-5, 4-8-4, 4-12-3, 4-12-4, 3-14-3, 2-13-5, 2- 16-2, 1-18-1, 3-10-3, 2-10-2, 1-10-1, 2-8-2, 6-8-6, 5-8-5, 1-8-1, or 2-6-2. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antisense compound as a \"wingmer\" motif, having a wing-gap or gap- wing configuration, i.e. an X-Y or Y-Z configuration as described above for the gapmer configuration. Thus, wingmer configurations include, but are not limited to, for example 5-10, 8-4, 4-12, 12-4, 3-14, 16-2, 18-1, 10-3, 2-10, 1-10, 8-2, 2-13, or 5-13. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to a nrRNA nucleic acid possess a 5-\n\n\n10-5 gapmer motif. \n\n In certain embodiments, an antisense compound targeted to a nrRNA nucleic acid has a gap- widened motif. \n\n\nTarget Nucleic Acids, Target Regions and Nucleotide Sequences \n\n\n Nucleotide sequences that encode a nrRNA include, without limitation, those described herein, including those listed in Table 1 and Table 2. \n\n\n It is understood that the sequence set forth in each SEQ ID NO in the Examples contained herein is independent of any modification to a sugar moiety, an intemucleoside linkage, or a nucleobase. As such, antisense compounds defined by a SEQ ID NO can comprise, independently, one or more modifications to a sugar moiety, an intemucleoside linkage, or a nucleobase. Antisense compounds described by Isis Number (Isis No) indicate a combination of nucleobase sequence and motif. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, a target region is a structurally defined region of the target nucleic acid. For example, a target region can encompass a 3' UTR, a 5' UTR, an exon, an intron, an exon/intron junction, a coding region, a translation initiation region, translation termination region, or other defined nucleic acid region. The structurally defined regiorisffc a nrRNA can be obtained by accession number from sequence databases such as NCBI and such information is incorporated herein by reference. In certain embodiments, a target region can encompass the sequence from a 5' target site of one target segment within the target region to a 3' target site of another target segment within the target region. \n\n\n Targeting includes determination of at least one target segment to which an antisense compound hybridizes, such that a desired effect occurs. In certain embodiments, the desired effect is a reduction in mRNA target nucleic acid levels. In certain embodiments, the desired effect is reduction of levels of protein encoded by the target nucleic acid or a phenotypic change associated with the target nucleic acid. \n\n\n A target region can contain one or more target segments. Multiple target segments within a target region can be overlapping. Alternatively, they can be non-overlapping. In certain \n\n\nembodiments, target segments within a target region are separated by no more than about 300 nucleotides. In certain embodiments, target segments within a target region are separated by a number of nucleotides that is, is about, is no more than, is no more than about, 250, 200, 150, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, or 10 nucleotides on the target nucleic acid, or is a range defined by \n\n any two of the preceding values. In certain embodiments, target segments within a target region are separated by no more than, or no more than about, 5 nucleotides on the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, target segments are contiguous. Contemplated are target regions defined by a range having a starting nucleic acid that is any of the 5' target sites or 3' target sites listed herein. \n\n\n Suitable target segments can be found within a 5' UTR, a coding region, a 3' UTR, an intron, an exon, or an exon/intron junction. Target segments containing a start codon or a stop codon are also suitable target segments. A suitable target segment can specifically exclude a certain structurally defined region such as the start codon or stop codon. \n\n\n The determination of suitable target segments can include a comparison of the sequence of a target nucleic acid to other sequences throughout the genome. For example, the BLAST algorithm can be used to identify regions of similarity amongst different nucleic acids. This comparison can prevent the selection of antisense compound sequences that can hybridize in a non-specific manner to sequences other than a selected target nucleic acid (i.e., non-target or off-target sequences). \n\n\n There can be variation in activity (e.g., as defined by percent reduction of target nucleic acid levels) of the antisense compounds within an active target region. In certain embodiments, phenotypic changes, such as a treating, ameliorating, delaying or reducing a symptom of a disease or disorder associated with a nuclear-retained RNA , are indicative of inhibition of a nrRNA. \n\n\nHybridization \n\n\n In some embodiments, hybridization occurs between an antisense compound disclosed herein and a nrRNA. The most common mechanism of hybridization involves hydrogen bonding (e.g., Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding) between complementary nucleobases of the nucleic acid molecules. \n\n\n Hybridization can occur under varying conditions. Stringent conditions are sequence- dependent and are determined by the nature and composition of the nucleic acid molecules to be hybridized. \n\n\n Methods of determining whether a sequence is specifically hybridizable to a target nucleic acid are well known in the art (Sambrooke and Russell, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3\nrd\n Ed., 2001). In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds provided herein are specifically hybridizable with a nrRNA. \n\n Complementarity \n\n\nAn antisense compound and a target nucleic acid are complementary to each other when a sufficient number of nucleobases of the antisense compound can hydrogen bond with the corresponding nucleobases of the target nucleic acid, such that a desired effect will occur (e.g., antisense inhibition of a target nucleic acid, such as a nrRNA). \n\n\n An antisense compound can hybridize over one or more segments of a nrRNA such that intervening or adjacent segments are not involved in the hybridization event (e.g., a loop structure, mismatch or hairpin structure). \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds provided herein, or a specified portion thereof, are, or are at least 70%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88, %, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%), 99%, or 100%. complementary to a nrRNA, a target region, target segment, or specified portion thereof. In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds are at least 70%, at least 80%., at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100% complementary to a nrRNA, ajarget region, target segment, or specified portion thereof and contain at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 1 1 , at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 16, at least 17, at least 18, or at least 19, contiguous nucleobases of the nucleobase sequence of any of the exemplary antisense compounds described herein. Percent complementarity of an antisense compound with a target nucleic acid can be determined using routine methods. \n\n\n For example, an antisense compound in which 18 of 20 nucleobases of the antisense compound are complementary to a target region, and would therefore specifically hybridize, would represent 90 percent complementarity. In this example, the remaining noncomplementary nucleobases can be clustered or interspersed with complementary nucleobases and need not be contiguous to each other or to complementary nucleobases. As such, an antisense compound which is 18 nucleobases in length having 4 (four) noncomplementary nucleobases which are flanked by two regions of complete complementarity with the target nucleic acid would have 77.8% overall complementarity with the target nucleic acid and would thus fall within the scope of the present invention. Percent complementarity of an antisense compound with a region of a target nucleic acid can be determined routinely using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search tools) and\n\n\nPowerBLAST programs known in the art (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1990, 215, 403 410; Zhang \n\n and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649 656). Percent homology, sequence identity or complementarity, can be determined by, for example, the Gap program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, Madison Wis.), using default settings, which uses the algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Adv. Appl. Math., 1981, 2, 482 489). \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds provided herein, or specified portions thereof, are fully complementary (i.e. 100% complementary) to a target nucleic acid, or specified portion thereof. For example, antisense compound can be fully complementary to target nucleic acid, or a target region, or a target segment or target sequence thereof. As used herein, \"fully complementary\" means each nucleobase of an antisense compound is capable of precise base pairing with the corresponding nucleobases of a target nucleic acid. For example, a 20 nucleobase antisense compound is fully complementary to a target sequence that is 400 nucleobases long, so long as there is a corresponding 20 nucleobase portion of the target nucleic acid that is fully complementary to the antisense compound. Fully complementary can also be used in reference to a specified portion of the first and /or the second nucleic acid. For example, a 20 nucleobase portion of a 30 nucleobase antisense compound c¾nbe \"fully complementary\" to a target sequence that is 400 nucleobases long. The 20 nucleobase portion of the 30 nucleobase oligonucleotide is fully complementary to the target sequence if the target sequence has a corresponding 20 nucleobase portion wherein each nucleobase is complementary to the 20 nucleobase portion of the antisense compound. At the same time, the entire 30 nucleobase antisense compound can be fully \n\n\ncomplementary to the target sequence, depending on whether the remaining 10 nucleobases of the antisense compound are also complementary to the target sequence. \n\n\n The location of a non-complementary nucleobase can be at the 5' end or 3' end of the antisense compound. Alternatively, the non-complementary nucleobase or nucleobases can be at an internal position of the antisense compound. When two or more non-complementary nucleobases are present, they can be either contiguous (i.e. linked) or non-contiguous. In one embodiment, a non-complementary nucleobase is located in the wing segment of a gapmer antisense \n\n\noligonucleotide. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, antisense compounds that are, or are up to 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 nucleobases in length comprise no more than 4, no more than 3, no more than 2, or no \n\n more than 1 non-complementary nucleobase(s) relative to a target nucleic acid, such as a nrRNA, or specified portion thereof. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, antisense compounds that are, or are up to 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,\n\n\n18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 nucleobases in length comprise no more than 6, no more than 5, no more than 4, no more than 3, no more than 2, or no more than 1 non- complementary nucleobase(s) relative to a target nucleic acid, such as a nrRNA, or specified portion thereof. \n\n\n The antisense compounds provided herein also include those which are complementary to a portion of a target nucleic acid. As used herein, \"portion\" refers to a defined number of contiguous (i.e. linked) nucleobases within a region or segment of a target nucleic acid. A \"portion\" can also refer to a defined number of contiguous nucleobases of an antisense compound. In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds, are complementary to at least an 8 nucleobase portion of a target segment. In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds are complementary to at least a 10 nucleobase portion of a target segment. In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds are complementary to at least a 15 nucleobase portion of a target segment. Also contemplated are antisense compounds that are complimentary to at least an 8, at least a 9, at least a 10, at least an 11, at least a 12, at least a 13, at least a 14, at least a 15, at least a 16, at least a 17, at least a 18, at least a\n\n\n19, at least a 20, or more nucleobase portion of a target segment, or a range defined by any two of these values. Identity \n\n\n The antisense compounds provided herein can also have a defined percent identity to a particular nucleotide sequence, SEQ ID NO, or compound represented by a specific Isis number, or portion thereof. As used herein, an antisense compound is identical to the sequence disclosed herein if it has the same nucleobase pairing ability. For example, a RNA which contains uracil in place of thymidine in a disclosed DNA sequence would be considered identical to the DNA sequence since both uracil and thymidine pair with adenine. Shortened and lengthened versions of the antisense compounds described herein as well as compounds having non-identical bases relative to the antisense compounds provided herein also are contemplated. The non-identical bases can be adjacent to each other or dispersed throughout the antisense compound. Percent identity of an antisense compound is calculated according to the number of bases that have identical base pairing relative to the sequence to which it is being compared. \n\n In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds, or portions thereof, are at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%), at least 99%, or 100%», identical to one or more of the antisense compounds or SEQ ID NOs, or a portion thereof, disclosed herein. Modifications \n\n\n A nucleoside is a base-sugar combination. The nucleobase (also known as base) portion of the nucleoside is normally a heterocyclic base moiety. Nucleotides are nucleosides that further include a phosphate group covalently linked to the sugar portion of the nucleoside. For those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to the 2', 3' or 5' hydroxyl moiety of the sugar. Oligonucleotides are formed through the covalent linkage of adjacent nucleosides to one another, to form a linear polymeric oligonucleotide. Within the oligonucleotide structure, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as forming the intemucleoside linkages of the oligonucleotide. \n\n\n Modifications to antisense compounds encompass substitutions or changes to intemucleoside linkages, sugar moieties, or nucleobases. Modified antisense compounds are often preferred over native forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for nucleic acid target, increased stability in the presence of nucleases, or increased inhibitory activity. \n\n\n Chemically modified nucleosides can also be employed to increase the binding affinity of a shortened or truncated antisense oligonucleotide for its target nucleic acid. Consequently, comparable results can often be obtained with shorter antisense compounds that have such chemically modified nucleosides. \n\n\nModified Intemucleoside Linkages \n\n\nThe naturally occurring intemucleoside linkage of RNA and DNA is a 3' to 5' phosphodiester linkage. Antisense compounds having one or more modified, i.e. non-naturally occurring, intemucleoside linkages are often selected over antisense compounds having naturally occurring intemucleoside linkages because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for target nucleic acids, and increased stability in the presence of nucleases. \n\n Oligonucleotides having modified intemucleoside linkages include intemucleoside linkages that retain a phosphorus atom as well as intemucleoside linkages that do not have a phosphorus atom. Representative phosphorus containing intemucleoside linkages include, but are not limited to, phosphodiesters, phosphotriesters, methylphosphonates, phosphoramidate, and phosphorothioates. Methods of preparation of phosphorous-containing and non-phosphorous-containing linkages are well known. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to a nrRNA comprise one or more modified intemucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, the modified intemucleoside linkages are phosphorothioate linkages. In certain embodiments, each intemucleoside linkage of an antisense compound is a phosphorothioate intemucleoside linkage. \n\n\nModified Sugar Moieties \n\n\n Antisense compounds of the invention can optionally contain one or more nucleosides wherein the sugar group has been modified. Such sugar modified nucleosides may impart enhanced nuclease stability, increased binding affinity, or some other beneficial biological property to the antisense compounds. In certain embodiments, nucleosides comprise a chemically modified i- ribofuranose ring moieties. Examples of chemically modified ribofuranose rings include without limitation, addition of substitutent groups (including 5' and 2' substituent groups, bridging of non- geminal ring atoms to form bicyclic nucleic acids (BNA), replacement of the ribosyl ring oxygen atom with S, N(R), or C(R1)(R)2 (R = H, C1-C12 alkyl or a protecting group) and combinations thereof. Examples of chemically modified sugars include 2'-F-5 '-methyl substituted nucleoside (see PCT International Application WO 2008/101 157 Published on 8/21/08 for other disclosed 5\",2'-bis substituted nucleosides) or replacement of the ribosyl ring oxygen atom with S with further substitution at the 2'-position (see published U.S. Patent Application US2005-0130923, published on June 16, 2005) or alternatively 5'-substitution of a BNA (see PCT International Application WO 2007/134181 Published on 11/22/07 wherein LNA is substituted with for example a 5'-methyl or a 5'- vinyl group). \n\n\n Examples of nucleosides having modified sugar moieties include without limitation nucleosides comprising 5'-vinyl, 5'-methyl (R or S), 4'-S, 2'-F, 2'-OCH3 and 2'-0(CH2)20CH3 substituent groups. The substituent at the 2' position can also be selected from allyl, amino, azido, thio, O-allyl, O-CI-CIO alkyl, OCF3, 0(CH2)2SCH3, 0(CH2)2-0-N(Rm)(Rn), and 0-CH2-C(=0)- \n\n N(Rm)(Rn), where each Rm and Rn is, independently, H or substituted or unsubstituted CI -CIO alkyl. \n\n\n As used herein, \"bicyclic nucleosides\" refer to modified nucleosides comprising a bicyclic sugar moiety. Examples of bicyclic nucleosides include without limitation nucleosides comprising a bridge between the 4' and the 2' ribosyl ring atoms. In certain embodiments, antisense compounds provided herein include one or more bicyclic nucleosides wherein the bridge comprises a 4' to 2' bicyclic nucleoside. Examples of such 4' to 2' bicyclic nucleosides, include but are not limited to one of the formulae: 4'-(CH\n2\n)-0-2' (LNA); 4'-(CH\n2\n)-S-2'; 4'-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-0-2' (ENA); 4'-CH(CH\n3\n)-0-2' and 4'-CH(CH\n2\nOCH\n3\n)-0-2' (and analogs thereof see U.S. Patent 7,399,845, issued on July 15, 2008); 4'-C(CH\n3\n)(CH\n3\n)-0-2' (and analogs thereof see published International Application \n\n\nWO/2009/006478, published January 8, 2009); 4'-CH\n2\n-N(OCH\n3\n)-2' (and analogs thereof see published International Application WO/2008/150729, published December 11 , 2008); 4'-CH\n2\n-0- N(CH\n3\n)-2' (see published U.S. Patent Application US2004-0171570, published September 2, 2004 ); 4'-CH\n2\n-N(R)-0-2', wherein R is H, Ci-C\n]2\n alkyl, or a protecting group (see U.S. Patent 7,427,672, issued on September 23, 2008); 4'-CH\n2\n-C(H)(CH\n3\n)-2' (see Chattopadhyaya, et al, J.

C, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 2002, 10, 841-854). \n\n\nSuch ring systems can undergo various additional substitutions to enhance activity. \n\n\n Methods for the preparations of modified sugars are well known to those skilled in the art. In nucleotides having modified sugar moieties, the nucleobase moieties (natural, modified or a combination thereof) are maintained for hybridization with an appropriate nucleic acid target. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, antisense compounds comprise one or more nucleotides having modified sugar moieties. In certain embodiments, the modified sugar moiety is 2'-MOE. In certain embodiments, the 2' -MOE modified nucleotides are arranged in a gapmer motif. In certain embodiments, the modified sugar moiety is a cEt. In certain embodiments, the cEt modified nucleotides are arranged throughout the wings of a gapmer motif. \n\n\nModified Nucleobases \n\n\n Nucleobase (or base) modifications or substitutions are structurally distinguishable from, yet functionally interchangeable with, naturally occurring or synthetic unmodified nucleobases. Both \n\n natural and modified nucleobases are capable of participating in hydrogen bonding. Such nucleobase modifications can impart nuclease stability, binding affinity or some other beneficial biological property to antisense compounds. Modified nucleobases include synthetic and natural nucleobases such as, for example, 5-methylcytosine (5-me-C). Certain nucleobase substitutions, including 5-methylcytosine substitutions, are particularly useful for increasing the binding affinity of an antisense compound for a target nucleic acid. For example, 5-methylcytosine substitutions have been shown to increase nucleic acid duplex stability by 0.6-1.2°C (Sanghvi, Y.S., Crooke, S.T. and Lebleu, B., eds., Antisense Research and Applications, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1993, pp. 276- 278). \n\n\n Additional unmodified nucleobases include 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2- propyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-thiouracil, 2-thiothymine and 2- thiocytosine, 5-halouracil and cytosine, 5-propynyl (-C≡C-CH3) uracil and cytosine and other alkynyl derivatives of pyrimidine bases, 6-azo uracil, cytosine and thymine, 5-uracil (pseudouracil), 4-thiouracil, 8-halo, 8-amino, 8-thiol, 8-thioalkyl, 8-hydroxyl and other 8-substituted adenines and guanines, 5-halo particularly 5-bromo, 5-trifluoromethyl and other 5-substituted uracils and - - cytosines, 7-methylguanine and 7-methyladenine, 2-F-adenine, 2-amino-adenine, 8-azaguanine and 8-azaadenine, 7-deazaguanine and 7-deazaadenine and 3-deazaguanine and 3-deazaadenine. \n\n\n Heterocyclic base moieties can also include those in which the purine or pyrimidine base is replaced with other heterocycles, for example 7-deaza-adenine, 7-deazaguanosine, 2-aminopyridine and 2-pyridone. Nucleobases that are particularly useful for increasing the binding affinity of antisense compounds include 5-substituted pyrimidines, 6-azapyrimidines and N-2, N-6 and 0-6 substituted purines, including 2 aminopropyladenine, 5-propynyluracil and 5-propynylcytosine. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to a nrRNA comprise one or more modified nucleobases. In certain embodiments, gap-widened antisense oligonucleotides targeted to a nrRNA comprise one or more modified nucleobases. In certain embodiments, the modified nucleobase is 5-methylcytosine. In certain embodiments, each cytosine is a 5-methylcytosine. \n\n\nCompositions and Methods for Formulating Pharmaceutical Compositions \n\n\n Antisense oligonucleotides can be admixed with pharmaceutically acceptable active or inert substance for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions or formulations. Compositions and \n\n methods for the formulation of pharmaceutical compositions are dependent upon a number of criteria, including, but not limited to, route of administration, extent of disease, or dose to be administered. \n\n\nAntisense compound targeted to a nrRNA can be utilized in pharmaceutical compositions by combining the antisense compound with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. A pharmaceutically acceptable diluent includes phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). PBS is a diluent suitable for use in compositions to be delivered parenterally. Accordingly, in one embodiment, employed in the methods described herein is a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antisense compound targeted to a nrRNA and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable diluent is PBS. In certain embodiments, the antisense compound is an antisense oligonucleotide. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical compositions comprising antisense compounds encompass any \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, or salts of such esters, or any other oligonucleotide which, upon administration to an animal, including a human, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) the biologically active metabolite or residue thereof. Accordingly, for example, the disclosure is also drawn to pharmaceutically acceptable salts of antisense compounds, prodrugs, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such prodrugs, and other bioequivalents. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, sodium and potassium salts. \n\n\n A prodrug can include the incorporation of additional nucleosides at one or both ends of an antisense compound which are cleaved by endogenous nucleases within the body, to form the active antisense compound. \n\n\nConjugated Antisense Compounds \n\n\n Antisense compounds can be covalently linked to one or more moieties or conjugates which enhance the activity, cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the resulting antisense \n\n\noligonucleotides. Typical conjugate groups include cholesterol moieties and lipid moieties. \n\n\nAdditional conjugate groups include carbohydrates, phospholipids, biotin, phenazine, folate, phenanthridine, anthraquinone, acridine, fluoresceins, rhodamines, coumarins, and dyes. \n\n\n Antisense compounds can also be modified to have one or more stabilizing groups that are generally attached to one or both termini of antisense compounds to enhance properties such as, for example, nuclease stability. Included in stabilizing groups are cap structures. These terminal \n\n modifications protect the antisense compound having terminal nucleic acid from exonuclease degradation, and can help in delivery and/or localization within a cell. The cap can be present at the 5'-terminus (5'-cap), or at the 3'-terminus (3'-cap), or can be present on both termini. Cap structures are well known in the art and include, for example, inverted deoxy abasic caps. Further 3' and 5'- stabilizing groups that can be used to cap one or both ends of an antisense compound to impart nuclease stability include those disclosed in WO 03/004602 published on January 16, 2003. \n\n\nCell culture and antisense compounds treatment \n\n\n The effects of antisense compounds on the level or activity of a nrRNA can be tested in vitro in a variety of cell types. Cell types used for such analyses are available from commercial vendors (e.g. American Type Culture Collection, Manassus, VA; Zen-Bio, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC; Clonetics Corporation, Walkersville, MD) and cells are cultured according to the vendor's instructions using commercially available reagents (e.g. Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Illustrative cell types include, but are not limited to, HepG2 cells, Hep3B cells, primary hepatocytes, A549 cells, GM04281 fibroblasts and LLC-MK2 cells. In vitro testing of antisense oligonucleotides »\n■\n? \n\n\n Described herein are methods for treatment of cells with antisense oligonucleotides, which can be modified appropriately for treatment with other antisense compounds. \n\n\n In general, cells are treated with antisense oligonucleotides when the cells reach \n\n\napproximately 60-80% confluence in culture. \n\n\n One reagent commonly used to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into cultured cells includes the cationic lipid transfection reagent LIPOFECTIN® (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). \n\n\nAntisense oligonucleotides are mixed with LIPOFECTIN® in OPTI-MEM® 1 (Invitrogen, \n\n\nCarlsbad, CA) to achieve the desired final concentration of antisense oligonucleotide and a \n\n\nLIPOFECTIN® concentration that typically ranges 2 to 12 ug/mL per 100 nM antisense \n\n\noligonucleotide. \n\n\n Another reagent used to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into cultured cells includes LIPOFECTAMINE 2000® (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Antisense oligonucleotide is mixed with LIPOFECT AMINE 2000® in OPTI-MEM® 1 reduced serum medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to achieve the desired concentration of antisense oligonucleotide and a LIPOFECTAMINE® concentration that typically ranges 2 to 12 ug/mL per 100 nM antisense oligonucleotide. \n\n Another reagent used to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into cultured cells includes Cytofectin® (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Antisense oligonucleotide is mixed with Cytofectin® in OPTI-MEM® 1 reduced serum medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to achieve the desired concentration of antisense oligonucleotide and a Cytofectin® concentration that typically ranges 2 to 12 ug/mL per 100 nM antisense oligonucleotide. \n\n\n Another technique used to introduce antisense oligonucleotides into cultured cells includes electroporation. \n\n\nCells are treated with antisense oligonucleotides by routine methods. Cells are typically harvested 16-24 hours after antisense oligonucleotide treatment, at which time RNA or protein levels of target nucleic acids are measured by methods known in the art and described herein. In general, when treatments are performed in multiple replicates, the data are presented as the average of the replicate treatments. \n\n\n The concentration of antisense oligonucleotide used varies from cell line to cell line. \n\n\nMethods to determine the optimal antisense oligonucleotide concentration for a particular cell line are well known in the art. Antisense oligonucleotides are typically used at concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 300 nM when transfected with LIPOFECTAMINE2000®, Lipofectin or Cytofectin. Antisense oligonucleotides are used at higher concentrations ranging from 625 to 20,000 nM when transfected using electroporation. \n\n\nRNA Isolation \n\n\n RNA analysis can be performed on total cellular RNA or poly(A)+ mRNA. Methods of RNA isolation are well known in the art. RNA is prepared using methods well known in the art, for example, using the TRIZOL® Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocols. \n\n\nAnalysis of inhibition of target levels or expression \n\n\n Inhibition of levels or activity of a nrRNA can be assayed in a variety of ways known in the art. For example, target nucleic acid levels can be quantitated by, e.g., Northern blot analysis, competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or quantitaive real-time PCR. RNA analysis can be performed on total cellular RNA or poly(A)+ mRNA. Methods of RNA isolation are well known in the art. Northern blot analysis is also routine in the art. Quantitative real-time PCR can be conveniently accomplished using the commercially available ABI PRISM® 7600, 7700, or 7900 \n\n Sequence Detection System, available from PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA and used according to manufacturer's instructions. \n\n\nQuantitative Real-Time PCR Analysis of Target RNA Levels \n\n\n Quantitation of target RNA levels can be accomplished by quantitative real-time PCR using the ABI PRISM® 7600, 7700, or 7900 Sequence Detection System (PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Methods of quantitative real-time PCR are well known in the art. \n\n\n Prior to real-time PCR, the isolated RNA is animaled to a reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction, which produces complementary DNA (cDNA) that is then used as the substrate for the real-time PCR amplification. The RT and real-time PCR reactions are performed sequentially in the same sample well. RT and real-time PCR reagents are obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). RT, real-time-PCR reactions are carried out by methods well known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\n Gene (or RNA) target quantities obtained by real time PCR are normalized using either the expression level of a gene whose expression is constant, such as cyclophilin A, or by quantifying total RNA using RIBOGREEN® (Invitrogen, Inc. Carlsbad, C A). Cyclophilin A expression is quantified by real time PCR, by being run simultaneously with the target, multiplexing, or separately. Total RNA is quantified using RIBOGREEN® RNA quantification reagent (Invitrogen, Inc. Eugene, OR). Methods of RNA quantification by RIBOGREEN® are taught in Jones, L.J., et al, (Analytical Biochemistry, 1998, 265, 368-374). A CYTOFLUOR® 4000 instrument (PE Applied Biosystems) is used to measure RIBOGREEN® fluorescence. \n\n\n Probes and primers are designed to hybridize to a nrRNA sequence. Methods for designing real-time PCR probes and primers are well known in the art, and can include the use of software such as PRIMER EXPRESS® Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). \n\n\n For Quantitation of nuclear structures, such as nuclear foci, speckles, paraspecles and other nuclear substructures, induced by ncRNA as measure of antisense effects, immunofluoresence can be used (see e.g, Example 26). In situ htbridization can also be used to measure RNA. \n\n\nAnalysis of Protein Levels \n\n\n Antisense inhibition of certain nrRNAs can be assessed by measuring associated protein levels. Protein levels can be evaluated or quantitated in a variety of ways well known in the art, \n\n such as immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis (immunoblotting), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative protein assays, protein activity assays (for example, caspase activity assays), immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Antibodies directed to a target can be identified and obtained from a variety of sources, such as the MSRS catalog of antibodies (Aerie Corporation, Birmingham, MI), or can be prepared via conventional monoclonal or polyclonal antibody generation methods well known in the art. \n\n\nIn vivo testing of antisense compounds \n\n\n Antisense compounds, for example, antisense oligonucleotides, are tested in animals to assess their ability to inhibit a nrRNA and produce phenotypic changes. Testing can be performed in normal animals, or in experimental disease models. For administration to animals, antisense oligonucleotides are formulated in a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, such as phosphate- buffered saline. Administration includes parenteral routes of administration. Following a period of treatment with antisense oligonucleotides, RNA is isolated from tissue and changes in nrRNA levels or activity are measured. In certain embodiments, changes in associated protein levels are also \n\n\n Y i \n\n\nmeasured. \n\n\nCertain Indications \n\n\n In certain embodiments, provided herein are methods of treating an individual comprising administering one or more pharmaceutical compositions as described herein.

After approximately 16 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and MALAT-1 RNA transcript levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR using primer probe set mMALATl#2 (forward sequence \n\n\nTGGGTTAGAGAAGGCGTGTACTG, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 126; reverse sequence TCAGCGGCAACTGGGAAA, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 127; and probe sequence CGTTGGCACGACACCTTCAGGGACTX, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 128). MALAT1 RNA transcript levels were normalized to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN . \n\n\nResults are presented in Table 13 as percent inhibition of MALAT1, relative to untreated control cells. \n\n All the gapmers of Table 13 are 5-10-5 gapmers, where the gap segment comprises ten 2'- deoxynucleosides and each wing segment comprises five 2'-MOE nucleosides.

All cytidine residues throughout each gapmer are 5-methylcytidines. \n\n\n To measure the stability of the MALAT1 non-coding RNA, b.END cells were treated with 8 μg/mL of actinomycin D over a period of 10 hours. Another set of cells were treated with 75 μΜ 5,6-dichloro-l-P-D-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (DRB) for the same time period. Both RNA synthesis inhibitors gave similar results, as presented in Table 14. Table 14 presents the percent mRNA levels compared to the PBS control after treatment with actinomycin D or DRB at different time points. The data demonstrates that the MALAT1 RNA does not get degraded and is therefore stable for the period of treatment. \n\n\n The data from Tables 13 and 14 demonstrates that the IC \n0\n for oligonucleotides targeting RNA transcripts which are stable is low, suggesting that these RNA transcripts are more amenable for targeting compared to RNA transcripts which are not as stable. Therefore, these antisense oligonucleotides will be useful to employ in cases where oligonucleotide uptake by cells is low. \n\n\n Table 13 \n\n\n Dose-dependent antisense inhibition of nuclear-retained RNA in b.END cells \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Table 14 \n\n\n RNA levels (% PBS control) of nuclear-retained RNA at various time-points after treatment with actinomycin D or DRB \n\n\n \n\n 0.25 124 106 \n\n\n 0.50 161 126 \n\n\n 0.75 160 107 \n\n\n 1.00 147 131 \n\n\n 2.00 136 138 \n\n\n 3.00 163 133 \n\n\n 4.00 151 139 \n\n\n 5.00 167 134 \n\n\n 6.00 137 131 \n\n\n 7.00 135 105 \n\n\n 8.00 155 116 \n\n\n 9.00 143 1 13 \n\n\n 10.00 131 118 \n\n\nExample 9: Dose response studies with antisense oligonucleotides and correlation with murine target mRNA stability in b.END cells \n\n\n The correlation of mRNA stability of the murine target molecule to the dose of antisense oligonucleotide required to achieve target knockdown was studied. \n\n\n Antisense oligonucleotides, ISIS 5, ISIS 6, ISIS 7, ISIS 8, ISIS 9, ISIS 10, ISIS 11, ISIS 12, ISIS 13, and ISIS 14 targeting 'Target 3' gene sequence were tested at various doses. b.END cells were plated at a density of 4,000 cells per well and transfected using Cytofectin reagent with 6.25 nM, 12.5 nM, 25 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM, and 200 nM concentrations of each antisense \n\n\noligonucleotide. After approximately 16 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and 'Target 3' RNA transcript levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. 'Target 3' RNA transcript levels were normalized to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN\n®\n.

After approximately 16 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and 'Target 4' RNA transcript levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. 'Target 4' RNA transcript levels were normalized to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN\n®\n. Results are presented in Table 16 as percent inhibition of 'Target 4', relative to untreated control cells. \n\n All the gapmers of Tables 15 and 16 are 5-10-5 gapmers, where the gap segment comprises ten 2'-deoxynucleosides and each wing segment comprises five 2'-MOE nucleosides. The intemucleoside linkages throughout each gapmer are phosphorothioate (P=S) linkages. All cytidine residues throughout each gapmer are 5-methylcytidines. \n\n\n The data presented in Tables 15 and 16 demonstrate that the IC\n50\n for antisense \n\n\n oligonucleotides targeting 'Target 4' is about twenty times lower than the IC\n50\n for antisense oligonucleotides targeting 'Target 3' in the same cell line and for gapmers with similar motif. \n\n\nTo measure the stability of the target mRNAs, b.END cells were treated with 8 μg/mL of actinomycin D over a period of 9 hours. Another set of cells were treated with 75 μΜ 5,6-dichloro- Ι-β-D-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (DRB) for the same time period. Both RNA synthesis inhibitors gave similar results, as presented in Tables 17 and 18. Tables 17 and 18 present the percent mRNA levels compared to the PBS control after treatment with actinomycin D or DRB at different time points. The data demonstrates that 'Target 3' mRNA has significantly less stability than 'Target 4' mRNA. \n\n\n The data from Tables 15-18 suggests that antisense inhibition of target mRNAs, which are comparatively more stable, is easier to achieve than antisense inhibition of target mRNAs with less stability. \n\n\n Table 15 \n\n\n Dose-dependent antisense inhibition of 'Target 3' mRNA in b.END cells \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dose-dependent antisense inhibition of 'Target 4' mRNA in b.END cells \n\n\n ISIS ISIS ISIS ISIS ISIS\n\n\nISIS F ISIS G ISIS I ISIS J ISIS L H M N O \n\n\n 1.4063 5 20 25 0 26 24 25 26 18 21 \n\n nM \n\n\n 2.8125 \n\n\n 32 37 32 21 46 46 43 36 28 17 nM \n\n\n 5.625 nM 67 56 61 50 68 69 60 62 50 34\n\n\n11.25 nM 91 87 87 82 88 92 92 78 77 69\n\n\n22.5 nM 98 96 96 92 93 98 98 94 90 86\n\n\n45.0 nM 98 99 96 90 93 97 95 93 94 89\n\n\nIC\n50\n (nM) 4.6 4.2 4 6.6 3.1 3.1 3.4 4 5.4 7.1 \n\n\nTable 17 \n\n\n mRNA levels (% PBS control) of 'Target 3' at various time-points after treatment with actinomycin \n\n\n D or DRB \n\n\n \n\n 2.75 79 101 \n\n\n 3.75 66 71 \n\n\n 4.75 72 64 \n\n\n 5.75 56 51 \n\n\n 6.75 52 48 \n\n\n 7.75 47 44 \n\n\n 8.75 53 54 \n\n\nSR-B1 stability \n\n\n To measure the stability of the SR-B1 mRNA, b.END cells were treated with 8 μ^ιτιΐ. of actinomycin D over a period of 10 hours.

HUVEC cells were plated at a density of 5,000 cells per well and transfected using LipoectAMINE2000\n®\n reagent with 0.0069 nM, 0.0206 nM, 0.0617 nM, 0.1852 nM, 0.5556 nM, 1.6667 nM, 5 nM and 15 nM concentrations of each antisense oligonucleotide.

'Target 1 ' RNA transcript levels were normalized to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN\n®\n. Results are presented in Table 20 as percent inhibition of 'Target , relative to untreated control cells. \n\n\n Antisense oligonucleotides, ISIS A, ISIS B, ISIS C, ISIS D, and ISIS E targeting 'Target 2' mRNA were tested at various doses. HUVEC cells were plated at a density of 5,000 cells per well and transfected using LipoectAMINE2000\n®\n reagent with 0.6173 nM, 1.8519 nM, 5.-5556 nM, 16.6667 nM, 50 nM and 150 nM concentrations of each antisense oligonucleotide. After approximately 16 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and 'Target 2' RNA transcript levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. \n\n\n 'Target 2' RNA transcript levels were normalized to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN\n®\n. Results are presented in Table 21 as percent inhibition of 'Target 2', relative to untreated control cells. \n\n\n All the gapmers of Tables 20 and 21 are 2-13-5 gapmers, where the gap segment comprises thirteen 2'-deoxynucleosides and the 5' wing segment comprises two 2'-MOE nucleosides and the 3' wing segment comprises five 2'-MOE nucleosides. The intemucleoside linkages throughout each gapmer are phosphorothioate (P=S) linkages. All cytidine residues throughout each gapmer are 5- methylcytidines. \n\n\n The data presented in Tables 20 and 21 demonstrate that the IC\n50\n for antisense \n\n\noligonucleotides targeting 'Target 1 'is ten times lower than the IC\n50\n for antisense oligonucleotides targeting 'Target 2' in the same cell line and for gapmers with similar motif. \n\n To measure the stability of the target mRNAs, HUVEC cells were treated with 8 j-ig/mL of actinomycin D over a period of 9 hours. Another set of cells were treated with 75 μΜ 5,6-dichloro- Ι-β-D-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (DRB) for the same time period. Another set of cells were 30 μg/mL of a-amanitin for the same time period. At time points indicated in Tables 21 and 22, mRNA was harvested and 'Target 1 Or 'Target 2' mRNA levels were quantified by RT-PCR. All three RNA synthesis inhibitors gave similar results, as presented in Tables 22 and 23. Table 22 presents the percent mRNA levels compared to the PBS control after treatment with actinomycin D or DRB at different time points. Table 23 presents the percent mRNA levels compared to the PBS control after treatment with DRB and α-amanitin at different time points. Based on the results from the two different assays, the half-life of 'Target 2' mRNA is calculated to be within 2-4 hours. The half-life of 'Target 1 ' mRNA could not be calculated with the available data and is therefore beyond 9 hours. Therefore, the data in Tables 22 and 23 demonstrates that the 'Target 2' mRNA has significantly less stability than 'Target 1 'mRNA. \n\n\nThe data from Tables 20-23 suggests that antisense inhibition of target mRNAs, which are comparatively more stable, is easier to achieve than antisense inhibition of target mRNAs with less \nv\n stability. \n\n\n Table 20 \n\n\n Dose-dependent antisense inhibition of 'Target 1 'mRNA in HUVEC cells \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Table 21 \n\n\n Dose-dependent antisense inhibition of 'Target 2' mRNA in HUVEC cells \n\n\n \n\n 5.5556 nM 39 37 41 41 39 \n\n\n 16.6667 nM 60 61 62 70 60\n\n\n50.000 nM 71 75 68 78 71\n\n\n150.000 nM 76 71 71 79 72\n\n\nIC50 (nM) 13.3 12.5 14.9 9.0 17.3 \n\n\nTable 22 \n\n\nmRNA levels (% PBS control) of 'Target l 'and 'Target 2' at various time-points after treatment with actinomycin D or DRB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Table 23 \n\n\n mRNA levels of 'Target 1 'and 'Target 2' at various time-points after treatment with DRB amanitin \n\n\n \n\n 6.00 101 114 8 13 \n\n\n 7.00 93 115 8 14 \n\n\n 8.00 92 109 11 12 \n\n\n 9.00 94 107 13 10 \n\n\nDose response studies with STAT3 antisense oligonucleotides and correlation RNA stability in HUVEC cells \n\n\n The correlation of RNA stability of the non-nuclear-retained target molecule, STAT3, to the dose of antisense oligonucleotide required to achieve target knockdown was studied. \n\n\n Antisense oligonucleotides, ISIS 337332 (GAAGCCCTTGCCAGCCATGT, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 129), ISIS 345785 (TGCCTCCTCCTTGGGAATGT, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 130), ISIS 455269 (GCTTAGATTCTCCTTAAACC, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 131), ISIS 455271 (AAATGCTTAGATTCTCCTTA, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 132), ISIS 455272 (TAAAATGCTTAGATTCTCCT, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 133), ISIS 455291 (CAGCAGATCAAGTCCAGGGA, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 134), ISIS 455370 (TAGGTGTTCCCATACGCACA, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 135), ISIS 455371 \n\n\n(GCTAGGTGTTCCCATACGCA, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 136), ISIS 455391 \n\n\n(TCAACTGTCTCCAGGCAGGA, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 137), ISIS 455393 \n\n\n(CACATCAACTGTCTCCAGGC, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 138), ISIS 455394 \n\n\n(GACACATCAACTGTCTCCAG, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 139), ISIS 45541 1 \n\n\n(AACCCAATGGTAAGCCCAAG, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 140), ISIS 455412 \n\n\n(TAAACCCAATGGTAAGCCCA, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 141), ISIS 455471 \n\n\n(TGGAATTTGAATGCAGTGGC, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 142), ISIS 455525 \n\n\n(GTACACACTATACACATTTT, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 143), ISIS 455527 \n\n\n(GCCAAAAATTTACAACCCAT, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 144), ISIS 455530 \n\n\n(AGAGACTAAAATCAAGGCTC, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 145), ISIS 455536 \n\n\n(AGAACTGAAATTCCTTGGTC, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 146), and 455540 \n\n\n(AAGTACTCTTTCAGTGGTTT, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 147), all targeting human STAT3 RNA transcript (the complement of GENBANK Accession NT_010755.14 truncated from nucleobases 4185000 to 4264000, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 148) were tested at various doses.

Therefore, these antisense oligonucleotides will be useful to employ in cases where oligonucleotide uptake by cells is low. \n\n\n Table 24 \n\n\n Dose-dependent inhibition of STAT3 mRNA in HUVEC cells \n\n\n \n\n 455271 86 71 40 16 4.9 \n\n\n 455272 86 57 30 28 5.7 \n\n\n 455269 84 72 49 23 4.0 \n\n\n 45541 1 82 58 21 10 7.9 \n\n\n 455412 79 50 27 15 8.4 \n\n\n 345785 75 43 17 10 1 1.4\n\n\n337332 80 49 12 0 10.5 \n\n\nTable 25 \n\n\n RNA levels (% PBS control) of STAT3 mRNA at various time-points after treatment with \n\n\n actinom cin D or DRB \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11: Antisense Inhibition of murine MALATl in BALB/c mice \n\n\n ISIS 395251 (CCAGGCTGGTTATGACTCAG; target site 3338), incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 96; ISIS 399462 (GGGTCAGCTGCCAATGCTAG, target site 1280), incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 1 17; ISIS 399479 (CGGTGCAAGGCTTAGGAATT, target site 4004), incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 1 18; and ISIS 399484 (ACAAGTACATTGGAGCACAT, target site 4206), incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 124; all targeting murine MALATl RNA transcript (GENBANK Accession No. 3144_097A, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 125) and which demonstrated statistically significant dose-dependent inhibition in vitro, were evaluated for their ability to reduce murine MALATl RNA transcript in vivo. Treatment \n\n Male BALB/c mice were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum normal Purina mouse chow. Animals were acclimated for at least 7 days in the research facility before initiation of the experiment. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were prepared in buffered saline (PBS) and sterilized by filtering through a 0.2 micron filter. Oligonucleotides were dissolved in 0.9% PBS for injection. \n\n\n The mice were divided into six treatment groups. The first four groups received intraperitoneal injections of ISIS 395251, ISIS 399462, ISIS 399479, or ISIS 399484 at a dose of 50 mg/kg twice per week for 3 weeks. The fifth group received intraperitoneal injections of control oligonucleotide ISIS 141923 at a dose of 50 mg/kg twice weekly for 3 weeks. The sixth group received intraperitoneal injections of saline twice weekly for 3 weeks. The saline-injected group served as the control group to which the oligonucleotide-treated group was compared. \n\n\n Inhibition of MALATl RNA \n\n\n Twenty four hours after the final dose, the animals were sacrificed and liver tissue was isolated. Liver RNA was isolated for real-time PCR analysis of MALATl . As presented in Table 26, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides reduced MALATl RNA transcript expression. The results are expressed as percent inhibition of MALATl RNA transcript, relative to the PBS control. The control oligonucleotide, ISIS 141923, did not demonstrate significant inhibition of MALATl RNA, as expected. \n\n\n Table 26 \n\n\n Percent inhibition of MALATl RNA transcript in BALB/c mice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example 12: Dose-dependent antisense inhibition of murine MALATl RNA \n\n\nISIS 399462 and ISIS 399479, which showed statistically significant in vivo inhibition of MALATl, were further evaluated in a dose response study. \n\n\n Treatment \n\n BALB/c mice were injected with 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, or 40 mg/kg of ISIS 399462 or ISIS 399479 twice a week for 3 weeks.

The transgene is expressed in the mice as a CUG repeat RNA, which is retained in the nucleus, forming nuclear inclusions or foci, similar to that seen in human tissue samples of patients with myotonic dystrophy. \n\n\n ISIS 190403, ISIS 445236 and ISIS 445238, which demonstrated statistically significant dose-dependent inhibition in vitro, were evaluated for their ability to reduce human alphal actin RNA transcript in vivo. \n\n\n Treatment \n\n\n HSA\nLR\n mice were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum normal Purina mouse chow. Animals were acclimated for at least 7 days in the research facility before initiation of the experiment. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were prepared in PBS and sterilized by filtering through a 0.2 micron filter. Oligonucleotides were dissolved in 0.9% PBS for injection. \n\n\n The mice were divided into four treatment groups. The first three groups received subcutaneous injections of ISIS 190403, ISIS 445236 or ISIS 445238 at a dose of 25 mg/kg twice per week for 4 weeks. The fourth group received subcutaneous injections of PBS twice weekly for \n\n 4 weeks. The PBS-injected group served as the control group to which the oligonucleotide-treated group was compared. \n\n\n Inhibition of alphal actin RNA \n\n\n Twenty four hours after the final dose, the animals were sacrificed and tissue from the quadriceps muscles (left and right), gastrocnemius muscles (left and right), and tibialis anterior muscles (left and right) was isolated. RNA was isolated for real-time PCR analysis of alphal actin and normalized to 18s RNA. As presented in Table 36, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides reduced human alphal actin RNA transcript expression. The results are expressed as percent inhibition of alphal actin transcript, relative to the control. \n\n\n Table 36 \n\n\n Percent inhibition of human alphal actin RNA transcript in HSA\nLR\n mice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFluorescence in situ hybridization of alphal actin in muscles \n\n\n Frozen muscle tissue sections were fixed in fresh 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS solution for 15-20 minutes, after which they were rinsed twice with PBS for 5 minutes. The nuclei were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes after which the tissue was blocked with normal goat serum for 30 minutes. The sections were incubated a 2'-0-methyl RNA targeted to alphal actin that is 5'-labeled with Texas Red (Integrated DNA Technologies). The sections were counter- stained with DAPI to label the nuclei. The sections were mounted and viewed with a standard fluorescence microscope. Image acquisition was by Metavue software and deconvolution was achieved by Autoquant software. \n\n\n All muscle tissue sections from mice treated with ISIS 445236 and ISIS 445238 displayed reduced fluorescent intensity of alphal actin signal at the ribonuclear foci, indicating antisense inhibition of human alphal actin mRNA and reduction of the RNA in the nuclear foci. \n\n\nAssessment of myotonia by electromyography \n\n\n Myotonia refers to repetitive action potential that is due to delayed relaxation of muscle fibers. This phenomenon is observed in patients of myotonic dystrophy as well as in the HSA\nLR\n \n\n mice. When the EMG needle is inserted into a myotonic muscle, the electrical activity is prolonged for up to several seconds past when the insertional activity should normally cease. The frequency of myotonic discharges ranges from 50 to 100 impulses per second. \n\n\n Myotonia may be measured via electromyography and is graded in the following manner: grade 0 refers to no myotonia elicited by any needle insertion (0%); grade 1 refers to myotonia elicited by less than 50% needle insertions; grade 2 refers to myotonia elicited by more than 50% needle insertions; and grade 3 refers to mytonia elicited by 100% needle insertions. \n\n\n Before electromyography, mice were anesthetized by using i.p. 100 mg kg ketamine, 10 mg_kg xylazine, and 3 mg_kg acepromazine or 250 mg_kg 2,2,2 tribromoethanol. \n\n\nElectromyography on left and right quadriceps, left and right gastrocnemius muscles, left and right tibialis anterior muscles and lumbar paraspinals muscles was performed as previously described (Kanadia et al, 2003, Science, 302: 1978-1980) by using 30 gauge concentric needle electrodes and a minimum of 10 needle insertions for each muscle. The data is presented in Table 37 as the average myotonia grade observed in four mice of each group and demonstrates significant reduction of myotonia in mice treated with ISIS 445236 and ISIS 445238. \n\n\n Table 37 \n\n\n Average reduction of myotonia in various muscles of antisense oligonucleotide-treated HSA\nLR\n mice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample27: Dose-dependent inhibition of long CUG repeat mRNA (HSA mice) and a short CUG repeat (HSA mice)by subcutaneous administration in transgenic mice \n\n\n Dose-dependent inhibition of mRNA transcripts containing a long CUG repeat (HSA\nLR\n mice) and a short CUG repeat (HSA mice), was evaluated. HSA-short repeat (HSA ) mice express the identical transgene as the HSA\nLR\n mice, except that 5 instead of 250 CUG repeats are \n\n inserted in the 3' UTR. HSA mice do not have myotonia, splicing changes, or any other observable myotonia phenotype. ISIS 445236 was used in this assay. \n\n\n Treatment \n\n\nHSA\nLR\n mice were divided into four treatment groups. The first three groups received subcutaneous injections of ISIS 445236 at doses of 2.5 mg/kg, 8.5 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg twice per week for 4 weeks. The fourth group received subcutaneous injections of PBS twice per week for 4 weeks. The PBS-injected group served as the control group to which the oligonucleotide-treated group was compared. HSA mice were also divided into four groups and similarly treated. \n\n\nInhibition of alphal actin RNA \n\n\n Twenty four hours after the final dose, the animals were sacrificed and tissue from the quadriceps muscles (left and right), gastrocnemius muscles (left and right), and tibialis anterior muscles (left and right) was isolated. RNA was isolated for real-time PCR analysis of alphal actin and normalized to 18s RNA. The results are presented in Tables 38 and 39 and are expressed as percent inhibition of alphal actin transcript, relative to the control. Greater inhibition of the nuclear- retained long repeat in the muscle of HSA\nLR\n mice was achieved compared with the non-nuclear- retained short repeat in the muscle of HSA mice \n\n\n Table 38 \n\n\n Percent inhibition of human alphal actin RNA transcript in HSA mice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Table 39 \n\n\n Percent inhibition of human al hal actin RNA transcri t in HSA\nSR\n mice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 28: Dose response studies with antisense oligonucleotides targeting human dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase (DMPK) in DM1 fibroblast cells \n\n The mutant form of the DMPK mRNA, harboring large CUG repeats, are fully transcribed and polyadenylated, but remained trapped in the nucleus (Davis et al, 1997, Proc.

Antisense inhibition of mutant DMPK mRNA in DM1 fibroblast cells was studied. \n\n\n DM1 fibroblast cells were plated at a density of 4,500 cells per well and transfected using Cytofectin reagent with 9.375 nM, 18.75 nM, 37.5 nM, 75 nM, 150 nM, and 300 nM concentrations of each antisense oligonucleotide. After approximately 16 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and DMPK RNA transcript levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR using primer probe set RTS3164 (forward sequence AGCCTGAGCCGGGAGATG, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 164; reverse sequence GCGTAGTTGACTGGCGAAGTT, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 165; and probe sequence AGGCCATCCGCACGGACAACCX, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 166).

The transgene is expressed in the mice as a CUG repeat RNA, which is retained in the nucleus, forming nuclear inclusions or foci, similar to that seen in human tissue samples of patients with myotonic dystrophy (DM1). There are 350-400 CUG repeats in the DMPK \n\n transgene.

The fourth group received subcutaneous injections of ISIS 473810 at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg twice per week for 4 weeks. The fifth group received subcutaneous injections of PBS twice weekly for 4 weeks. The PBS-injected group served as the control group to which the oligonucleotide- treated group was compared. \n\n\n Inhibition of DMPK RNA \n\n\n Twenty four hours after the final dose, the animals were sacrificed and tissue from the quadriceps muscles was isolated. RNA was isolated for real-time PCR analysis of DMPK and normalized to 18s RNA. As presented in Table 43, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides reduced human DMPK RNA transcript expression. The results are expressed as percent inhibition of DMPK transcript, relative to the PBS control. \n\n\n Table 43 \n\n\n Antisense inhibition of human DMPK RNA transcript in LCI 5 mice \n\n\n \n\n Assessment of myotonia by electromyography \n\n\n Electromyography on left and right quadriceps, left and right gastrocnemius muscles, left and right tibialis anterior muscles and lumbar paraspinals muscles was performed as previously described (Kanadia et al, 2003, Science, 302: 1978-1980) by using 30 gauge concentric needle electrodes and a minimum of 10 needle insertions for each muscle. Since LCI 5 mice do not have myotonia, neither the control group nor the treatment groups displayed any myotonia in any muscle tested. \n\n\nExample 30: In vivo antisense inhibition of human DMPK in transgenic mice \n\n\n LCI 5 mice, Line D, are transgenic mice containing the entire human DMPK 3'UTR \n\n\n(developed by Wheeler et al, University of Rochester). The mice are the third generation of mice backcrossed to an FVB background. The transgene is expressed in the mice as a CUG repeat RNA, which is retained in the nucleus, forming nuclear inclusions or foci, similar to that seen in human tissue samples of patients with myotonic dystrophy (DM1). There are 350-400 CUG repeats in the DMPK transgene. These mice display early signs of DM1 and do not display any myotonia in their muscle tissues. \n\n\n ISIS 445569, ISIS 444404, ISIS 444436 and ISIS 4738ΪΌ were further evaluated for their ability to reduce human DMPK RNA transcript in vivo. \n\n\n Treatment \n\n\n LC15, Line A mice were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum normal Purina mouse chow. Animals were acclimated for at least 7 days in the research facility before initiation of the experiment. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were prepared in PBS and sterilized by filtering through a 0.2 micron filter. Oligonucleotides were dissolved in 0.9% PBS for injection. \n\n\n The mice were divided into six treatment groups. The first three groups received \n\n\nsubcutaneous injections of ISIS 445569, ISIS 444404 or ISIS 444436 at a dose of 25 mg/kg twice per week for 4 weeks. The fourth group received subcutaneous injections of ISIS 473810 at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg twice per week for 4 weeks. The fifth group received subcutaneous injections of ISIS 473810 at a dose of 6.25 mg/kg twice per week for 4 weeks. The sixth group received subcutaneous injections of PBS twice weekly for 4 weeks. The PBS-injected group served as the control group to which the oligonucleotide-treated group was compared. \n\n Inhibition ofDMPKRNA \n\n\n Twenty four hours after the final dose, the animals were sacrificed and tissue from the quadriceps muscles was isolated. RNA was isolated for real-time PCR analysis of DMPK and normalized to 18s RNA. As presented in Table 44, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides reduced human DMPK RNA transcript expression. The results are expressed as percent inhibition of DMPK transcript, relative to the PBS control. \n\n\n Table 44 \n\n\n Antisense inhibition of human DMPK RNA transcript in LCI 5 mice \n\n\n \n\n Assessment of myotonia by electromyography \n\n\n Electromyography on left and right quadriceps, left and right gastrocnemius muscles, left and right tibialis anterior muscles and lumbar paraspinals muscles was performed as previously described (Kanadia et al, 2003, Science, 302: 1978-1980) by using 30 gauge concentric needle electrodes and a minimum of 10 needle insertions for each muscle. Since LCI 5 mice do not have myotonia, neither the control group nor the treatment groups displayed any myotonia in any muscle tested. \n\n\nExample 31: In vivo antisense inhibition of human DMPK in SXL transgenic mouse model \n\n\nUsing hDMPK-targeting ASOs 444401 and 299471 target knockdown in soleus muscle was measured in SXL mice. The SXL mouse is transgenic for the entire DMPK gene and promoter and contains a 1000 CUG repeat sequence in the 3'UTR of DMPK gene. Mice were dosed 50mg/kg twice weekly for 4 weeks (n= 3 mice per group, except n=2 for saline-injected controls). Results of Taqman assays are shown in Figure 1 for mut-hDMPK mRNA (Figure 1 A) and endogenous mouse Dmpk mRNA (Figure IB). \n\n\nExample 32: In vivo inhibition of snoRNAs \n\n ISIS 462026 (targeting U 16) and ISIS 477499 (targeting U50), demonstrating significant inhibition of their respective snoRNAs, were tested in mice and the efficacy of the gapmers was evaluated. \n\n\n Treatment \n\n\n Two groups of five seven-week old balb-c mice were each administered subcutaneously with\n\n\n100 mg/kg of ISIS 462026 or ISIS 477499. Another group of five mice was injected with 100 mg/kg of control oligonucleotide ISIS 141923 (CCTTCCCTGAAGGTTCCTCC, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 176). Another group of five mice were injected subcutaneously with PBS. The mice injected with PBS served as a control group. The mice were sacrificed 72 hours later and several tissues were harvested for target mRNA analysis. Tissues harvested were: liver, heart, spleen, white adipose tissue (WAT), kidney, and muscle. \n\n\n RNA analysis \n\n\n Total RNA from each of the various tissues was separately prepared using Tri-Reagent, based on the manufacturer's instructions. Five micrograms of total RNA was separated in 8% polyacrylamide-7M urea gels and was transferred onto a membrane, using semi-dry transfer apparatus. Northern hybridization was performed using U16 snoRNA-specific 5'-end labeled oligonucleotide probe (5 ' -TTGCTC AGTAAGAATTTTCG-3 ' , designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 177), and U50 snoRNA-specific 5'-end labeled oligonucleotide probe (5'-\n\n\nGGTTCGGGATAAGATCATCACA-3 ' , designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 178). U2 snRNA were detected and served as a control for loading. The density of the bands was scanned using an ImageJ densitometer. Results for inhibition are presented in Figure 2. The data indicates that ISIS 462026 and ISIS 477499 significantly inhibited their target snoRNA expression. \n\n\n Evaluation of rRNA methylation \n\n\n Total RNA from liver samples was pooled for each group and subjected to primer extension analysis to detect rRNA methylation at positions A485 in 18S rRNA, targeted by Ul 6 snoRNA, or C2613 in 28S rRNA, targeted by U50 snoRNA. The results are presented in Table 45 and demonstrate significant inhibition at 0.05 mM dNTP concentration, compared to the PBS control. \n\n Table 45 \n\n\n Inhibition of rRNA methylation by antisense oligonucleotides in mouse livers relative to the PBS control \n\n\n \n\n Example 33: In vitro inhibition of lincRNAjSFPQE, lincRNA jp21, lincRNA HOXAl, HOTAIR, PCGEMl, and MIAT mRNA \n\n\nAntisense oligonucleotides were designed targeting lincRNA_SFPQE, lincRNA_p21 , \n\n\nlincRNA_HOXAl, HOTAIR, PCGEMl, and MIAT mRNA sequences. The antisense oligonucleotides were tested in vitro. Various doses of antisense oligonucleotides were individually tested in various cells and the mRNA expression levels of the corresponding targets were analyzed by RT-PCR. \n\n\nThe results indicated that the antisense oligonucleotides for nuclear-retained RNAs, such as lincRNA SFPQE, lincRNA_p21, lincRNA HOXAl , HOTAIR, PCGEMl, and MIAT, were able to reduce their target mRNA sequences with a potency similar to that demonstrated by antisense oligonucleotides targeting MALAT1 (see Examples 1-6)."
