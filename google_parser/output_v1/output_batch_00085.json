Description\n\n\n\n\n SULFONAMIDE COMPOUNDS USEFUL AS CYP 17 INHIBITORS \n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION \n\n\n[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/367,612, filed July 26, 2010, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n\n\nDESCRIPTION \n\n\n [0002] The present invention generally relates to sulfonamide compounds useful as CYP17 inhibitors. Provided herein are sulfonamide compounds, compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of their use. The invention further pertains to \n\n\npharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound according to the invention that is useful for the treatment of conditions related to the CYP 17 enzyme, such as cancer and other proliferative diseases. \n\n\n[0003] Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related mortality in American men. In 2007, there were 218,890 new cases with 27,000 deaths associated with prostate cancer. It is well known that androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, drive the growth of the prostate as well as prostate cancer at the level of the androgen receptor. The standard of care for advanced hormone sensitive prostate cancer involves surgical or chemical castration with a leutenizing releasing hormone agonist/antagonist to remove the androgens produced in the gonads from circulation. However, approximately 90% of androgens are produced in the testes with the remaining 10% being produced through the action of the adrenal gland. Thus, castration does not alleviate the action of all androgens. Further once a patient progresses to castration resistant prostate cancer, androgens are also produced at the level of the tumor, making treatment with antiandrogens more difficult. \n\n\n [0004] The cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 17a-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP 17) is responsible for the biosynthesis of both dihydroepiandrostenedione and \n\n\nandrostenedione which are precursors of both androgens and estrogen. Thus the production of androgens and estrogens in the human body is mediated by CYP17. \n\n\nBlocking this enzyme would inhibit the production of gonadal, adrenal, and tumoral androgens and could offer a new treatment option for prostate cancer and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients. Clinical proof-of-concept for CYP 17 as a target \n\n for prostate cancer has been achieved with the antifungal ketoconazole and the steroidal CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone, which has progressed to Phase III clinical trials for prostate cancer. Despite the advances recently made in the art, there is a clear need for new compounds that are useful as inhibitors of CYP 17 enzymes. \n\n\n[0005] Applicants have found potent sulfonamide compounds that have activity as CYP 17 inhibitors, and these compounds may be useful for the treatment of conditions related to the CYP 17 enzyme. \n\n\n [0006] Certain sulfonamide compounds have been reported in patent publications. Such publications, for example, include the following: WO 01/82916; WO 2004/113279; US 2007/0287708; US 2008/003949; WO 2008/042867; WO 2008/136378; US \n\n\n2004/0048891; US 2006/0030543; US 2008/0167348; US 2006/0258671 ; and WO 2010/005922. However, these publications do not disclose CYP 17 activity for their compounds. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n [0007] The present invention fills the foregoing need by providing sulfonamide compounds, which are useful as inhibitors of CYP 17 enzymes, including stereoisomers, N-oxides, prodrugs, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. \n\n\n[0008] The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; and at least one compound of Formula (I), or stereoisomers, N-oxides, prodrugs, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. \n\n\n[0009] The present invention also provides a method of treating a disease or disorder associated with the activity of the CYP 17 enzyme, the method comprising administering to a mammalian patient a compound of Formula (I), or stereoisomers, N-oxides, prodrugs, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. \n\n\n [0010] The present invention also provides processes and intermediates for making the compounds of Formula (I), or stereoisomers, N-oxides, prodrugs, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. \n\n\n [0011] The present invention also provides the compounds of Formula (I), or stereoisomers, N-oxides, prodrugs, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for use in therapy. \n\n [0012] The present invention also provides use of the compounds of Formula (I), or stereoisomers, N-oxides, prodrugs, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of cancer. \n\n\n [0013] The compounds of Formula (I) and compositions comprising such compounds are inhibitors of CYP 17 enzymes, and may be used in treating, prevention, or curing various CYP 17 enzyme related conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds of the present invention are useful in treating, preventing, or slowing the progression of diseases or disorders in a variety of therapeutic areas, such as cancer. \n\n\n[0014] These and other features of the invention will be set forth in expanded form as the disclosure continues. \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n\n\n [0015] The invention is illustrated by reference to the accompanying drawing described below. \n\n\n[0016] FIG. 1 shows the plasma pharmacokinetics of Example 217 and testosterone levels in cynomolgus monkeys after administration of Example 217.

It is to be appreciated that certain features of the invention that are, for clarity reasons, described above and below in the context of separate embodiments, may also be combined to form a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention that are, for brevity reasons, described in the context of a single embodiment, may also be combined so as to form sub-combinations thereof. Embodiments identified herein as exemplary or preferred are intended to be illustrative and not limiting. \n\n [0072] Unless specifically stated otherwise herein, references made in the singular may also include the plural. For example, \"a\" and \"an\" may refer to either one, or one or more. \n\n\n [0073] Unless otherwise indicated, any heteroatom with unsatisfied valences is assumed to have hydrogen atoms sufficient to satisfy the valences. \n\n\n [0074] The definitions set forth herein take precedence over definitions set forth in any patent, patent application, and/or patent application publication incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n [0075] Listed below are definitions of various terms used to describe the present invention. These definitions apply to the terms as they are used throughout the specification (unless they are otherwise limited in specific instances) either individually or as part of a larger group. \n\n\n [0076] Throughout the specification, groups and substituents thereof may be chosen by one skilled in the field to provide stable moieties and compounds. [0077] In accordance with a convention used in the art, ^ is used in structural Formulae herein to depict the bond that is the point of attachment of the moiety or substituent to the core or backbone structure. \n\n\n [0078] The terms \"halo\" and \"halogen,\" as used herein, refer to F, CI, Br, and I. \n\n\n[0079] The term \"alkyl\" as used herein, refers to both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups containing, for example, from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples of alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, methyl (Me), ethyl (Et), propyl (e.g., n-propyl and i-propyl), butyl (e.g., n-butyl, i-butyl, sec -butyl, and ?-butyl), and pentyl (e.g., n-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl), n-hexyl, 2-methylpentyl, 2-ethylbutyl, 3-methylpentyl, and 4-methylpentyl. When numbers appear in a subscript after the symbol \"C\", the subscript defines with more specificity the number of carbon atoms that a particular group may contain. For example, \"Ci_\n6\nalkyl\" denotes straight and branched chain alkyl groups with one to six carbon atoms. \n\n\n [0080] The term \"alkenyl\" as used herein, refers to both branched and straight-chain unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups, which have one or more carbon-carbon double bonds that may occur at any stable point along the chain. The term \"C2-4alkenyl\" is intended to include C\n2\n, C3, and C\n4\n alkenyl groups. \n\n [0081] The term \"haloalkyl,\" as used herein, refers to an alkyl group in which one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by halogen atom(s), the number of which can range from one up to the total number of hydrogen atoms that could otherwise exist in the parent alkyl group. Representative examples of haloalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, chloromethyl (-CH\n2\nCI), trifluoromethyl (-CF\n3\n), and 2,2,2-trfluoroethyl (-CH\n2\nCF\n3\n). When numbers appear in a subscript after the symbol \"C\", the subscript defines with more specificity the number of carbon atoms that a particular haloalkyl group may contain. For example, \"Ci_\n4\nhaloalkyl\" denotes straight and branched chain haloalkyl groups with one to four carbon atoms. \n\n\n[0082] The term \"fluoroalkyl\" as used herein is intended to include both branched and straight-chain alkyl groups substituted with one or more fluorine atoms. For example, \"Ci-4fluoroalkyl\" is intended to include Ci, C\n2\n, C3, and C\n4\n alkyl groups substituted with one or more fluorine atoms. Representative examples of fluoroalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, -CF\n3\n and -CH\n2\nCF\n3\n. \n\n\n[0083] The term \"hydroxyalkyl\" includes both branched and straight-chain alkyl groups substituted with one or more hydroxyl groups. For example, \"Ci_\n4\nhydroxyalkyl\" is intended to include Ci, C\n2\n, C3, and C\n4\n alkyl groups substituted with one or more hydroxyl groups. Representative examples of hydroxyalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, -CH\n2\nOH, and -CH\n2\nCH\n2\nOH. \n\n\n[0084] The term \"cycloalkyl,\" as used herein, refers to cyclized alkyl groups, including mono-, bi- or poly-cyclic ring systems. Representative examples of cycloalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and adamantanyl. When numbers appear in a subscript after the symbol \"C\", the subscript defines with more specificity the number of carbon atoms that a particular cycloalkyl group may contain. For example, \"C3-C\n6\ncycloalkyl\" denotes cycloalkyl groups with three to six carbon atoms. \n\n\n [0085] The term \"alkoxy,\" as used herein, refers to an alkyl group attached to the parent molecular moiety through an oxygen atom.

Thus, shown and claimed nitrogen atoms are considered to cover both the shown nitrogen and its N-oxide (N— >0) derivatives. \n\n\n [0097] As referred to herein, the term \"substituted\" means that at least one hydrogen atom is replaced with a non-hydrogen group, provided that normal valencies are maintained and that the substitution results in a stable compound. \n\n\n[0098] The term \"stereoisomer\" refers to a compound which has identical chemical constitution, but differs with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space. \n\n\n[0099] The phrase \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of \n\n sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. \n\n\n [00100] As used herein, \"pharmaceutically acceptable salts\" refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th Edition, p. 1418, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA (1985), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. \n\n\n[00101] Salt(s) of the Formula (I) compounds can be formed by, for example, reacting a Formula (I) compound with, for example, an equivalent amount of acid or base in a medium that allows the newly formed salt to, for example, either be precipitated out, or be isolated via lyophilization. Exemplary acidic salt(s) that the compounds of Formula (I) can form with inorganic and/or organic acids include, but are not limited to, for example, acetate, ascorbate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, acid citrate, citrate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, gentisinate, gluconate, glucaronate, glutamate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, isonicotinate, maleate, mesylate, \n\n\nmethanesulfonate, nitrate, pantothenate, phosphate, acid phosphate, saccharate, salicylate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, p-toluenesulfonate, trifluoroacetate, lactate, and pamoate [i.e., l, l'-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)] salts. Such salts can be formed in accordance with methods known to a person of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n [00102] Exemplary basic salt(s) that the compounds of Formula (I) can form with inorganic and/or organic bases include, but are not limited to, for example, ammonium salts; alkali metal salts, such as, for example, sodium, lithium and potassium salts: \n\n\nalkaline earth metal salts, such as, for example, calcium and magnesium salts; salts formed with organic bases, such as, for example, benzathines, dicyclohexylamines, 2- amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-l,3-diol (trisamine or tris), hydrabamines (such as, for example, N,N-bis(dehydroabietyl)ethylenediamine), N-methyl-D-glucamines, N-methyl- D-glycamides, and ?-butyl amines; salts formed with amino acids, such as, for example, arginine and lysine; and salts formed by using agents, such as, for example, lower alkyl halides (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g., dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g., decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), and aralkyl halides (e.g., benzyl and phenethyl bromides) to quaternize basic nitrogen-containing groups. Such salts can be formed in accordance with methods known to a person of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n\n [00103] The term \"protecting group\" refers to a substituent that is commonly employed to block or protect a particular functionality while reacting with other functional group on the compound. For a general description of protection groups and their use, see Greene, T.W., Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis\", John Wiley & Sons, New York (1991). \n\n\n [00104] Compounds of the Formula (I) may also have prodrug forms. Any compound that can be converted in vivo to provide the bioactive agent (i.e., the compound of Formula (I)) is a prodrug within the scope and spirit of the invention. \n\n\n[00105] The term \"prodrugs\" as employed herein includes esters and carbonates formed by reacting one or more hydroxyls of compounds of Formula (I) with alkyl, alkoxy, or aryl substituted acylating agents employing procedures known to those skilled in the art to generate acetates, pivalates, methylcarbonates, benzoates, and the like. \n\n\n[00106] Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art and are described in: a) Wermuth, C.G. et al, The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, Chapter 31, Academic Press (1996); \n\n\n b) Design of Prodrugs, Bundgaard, H. ed., Elsevier (1985); \n\n c) Bundgaard, FL, Chapter 5, \"Design and Application of Prodrugs,\" A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, pp. 113-191, Krosgaard-Larsen, P. et al, eds., Harwood Academic Publishers (1991); and \n\n\n d) Testa, B. et al, Hydrolysis in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism, Wiley -VCH (2003). \n\n\n[00107] In addition, compounds of the Formula (I) are, subsequent to their preparation, preferably isolated and purified to obtain a composition containing an amount by weight equal to or greater than 99% Formula (I) compound (\"substantially pure\" compound of the Formula (I)), which is then used or formulated as described herein. Such \n\n\n \"substantially pure\" compounds of the Formula (I) are also contemplated herein as part of the present invention. \n\n\n [00108] \"Stable compound\" and \"stable structure\" are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. The present invention is intended to embody stable compounds. \n\n\n [00109] \"Therapeutically effective amount\" is intended to include an amount of a compound of the present invention alone or an amount of the combination of compounds claimed or an amount of a compound of the present invention in combination with other active ingredients effective to act as a CYP 17 inhibitor, or effective to treat or prevent cancer or other proliferative diseases. \n\n\n [00110] As used herein, \"treating\" or \"treatment\" cover the treatment of a disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, and include: (a) preventing the disease-state from occurring in a mammal, in particular, when such mammal is predisposed to the disease- state but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting the disease-state, i.e., arresting it development; and/or (c) relieving the disease-state, i.e., causing regression of the disease state. \n\n\n [00111] Compounds of the present invention may contain one or more additional asymmetric carbon atoms and therefore exist in two or more stereoisomeric forms. The present invention includes all of the possible individual stereoisomers, the individual tautomeric forms thereof, together with mixtures thereof. Separation of diastereoisomers may be achieved by conventional techniques, e.g., by fractional crystallization, \n\n chromatography or HPLC of a stereoisomeric mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a suitable salt or derivative thereof. An individual enantiomer of the compound may also be prepared from a corresponding optically pure intermediate or by resolution, such as by HPLC of the corresponding racemate using a suitable chiral support or by fractional crystallization of the diastereoisomeric salts formed by reaction of the corresponding racemate with a suitable optically active acid or base, as appropriate. All stereoisomers of the compounds of the instant invention are contemplated, either in admixture or in pure or substantially pure form. \n\n\n [00112] The compounds of the present invention are intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include deuterium and tritium. Isotopes of carbon include \n13\nC and \n14\nC. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed. \n\n\n [00113] Also embraced within this invention is a class of pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds of Formula (I), or stereoisomers, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in association with one or more non-toxic, pharmaceutically - acceptable carriers and/or diluents and/or adjuvants (collectively referred to herein as \"carrier\" materials) and, if desired, other active ingredients. The compounds of Formula (I) may be administered by any suitable route, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such a route, and in a dose effective for the treatment intended. The compounds and compositions of the present invention may, for example, be administered orally, mucosally, or parentally including intravascularly, intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly intrasternally and infusion techniques, in dosage unit formulations containing conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles. For example, the pharmaceutical carrier may contain a mixture of mannitol or lactose and microcrystalline cellulose. The mixture may contain additional components such as a lubricating agent, e.g., magnesium stearate and a disintegrating agent such as crospovidone. The carrier mixture may be filled into a gelatin capsule or compressed as a tablet. \n\n [00114] The pharmaceutically active compounds of this invention can be processed in accordance with conventional methods of pharmacy to produce medicinal agents for administration to patients, including humans and other mammals. \n\n\n[00115] For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of, for example, a tablet, capsule, suspension, or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active ingredient. Examples of such dosage units are tablets or capsules. For example, these may contain an amount of active ingredient from about 0.05 to 2000 mg, preferably from about 0.05 to 500 mg, more preferably from about 0.05 to 150 mg. A suitable daily dose for a human or other mammal may vary widely depending on the condition of the patient and other factors, but, once again, can be determined using routine methods. \n\n\n[00116] The amounts of compounds that are administered and the dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the compounds and/or compositions of this invention depends on a variety of factors, including the age, weight, sex, the medical condition of the subject, the type of disease, the severity of the disease, the route and frequency of administration, and the particular compound employed. Thus, the dosage regimen may vary widely, but can be determined routinely using standard methods. A daily dose of about 0.01 to 1500 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.05 to 50 mg/kg body weight, and most preferably about 0.05 to 20 mg/kg body weight, may be appropriate. The daily dose can be administered in one to four doses per day. \n\n\n [00117] For therapeutic purposes, the active compounds of this invention are ordinarily combined with one or more adjuvants appropriate to the indicated route of administration. If administered orally, the compounds may be admixed with lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, cellulose alkyl esters, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulfuric acids, gelatin, acacia gum, sodium alginate, polyvinyl alcohol, and/or \n\n\npolyvinylpyrrolidone, and then tableted or encapsulated for convenient administration. Such capsules or tablets may contain a controlled-release formulation as may be provided in a dispersion of active compound in hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. \n\n\n[00118] The oily phase of the emulsions comprising compounds of Formula (I) may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier, it may comprise a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an \n\n oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make-up the so- called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream \n\n\nformulations. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the present invention include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, or other materials well known in the art. \n\n\n[00119] The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations is very low. Thus, the cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters may be used. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used. \n\n\n [00120] Formulations for parenteral administration may be in the form of aqueous or non-aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions or suspensions. These solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders or granules using one or more of the carriers or diluents mentioned for use in the formulations for oral administration or by using other suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The compounds may be dissolved in water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, benzyl alcohol, sodium chloride, tragacanth gum, and/or various buffers. Other adjuvants and modes of administration are well and widely known in the pharmaceutical art. The active ingredient may also be administered by injection as a composition with suitable carriers including saline, dextrose, or water, or with cyclodextrin (i.e., CAPTISOL®), cosolvent solubilization (i.e., propylene glycol) or micellar solubilization (i.e., Tween 80). \n\n [00121] The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. \n\n\n [00122] The pharmaceutical compositions may be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical operations such as sterilization and/or may contain conventional adjuvants, such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, and buffers. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings. Such compositions may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. \n\n\n[00123] Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention comprise the compound of Formula (I), or a stereoisomer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and optionally an additional agent selected from any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, and vehicle. Alternate compositions of this invention comprise a compound of the Formula (I) described herein, or a stereoisomer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle. \n\n\n [00124] Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) such as d-alpha-tocopherol polyethyleneglycol 1000 succinate, surfactants used in pharmaceutical dosage forms such as Tweens or other similar polymeric delivery matrices, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat. \n\n Cyclodextrins such as alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrin, or chemically modified derivatives such as hydroxyalkylcyclodextrins, including 2- and 3-hydroxypropyl- cyclodextrins, or other solubilized derivatives may also be advantageously used to enhance delivery of compounds of the Formulae described herein. \n\n\n[00125] The terms \"compound of this invention\", \"compounds of the present invention\", \"compound of Formula (I)\", and \"compounds of Formula (I)\" include compounds of Formulae (I), (la), (lb), (Ic) and (Id), and stereoisomers, N-oxides, prodrugs, and a pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. UTILITY \n\n\n [00126] The compounds of Formula (I) are useful for the treatment of cancer, for example, cancers dependent upon androgen receptor signaling. These compounds inhibit the activity of the CYP 17 enzyme, which is involved in biosynthesis of androgens. \n\n\nBlocking this enzyme would inhibit the production of gonadal, adrenal, and tumoral androgens and could offer a new treatment option for cancers dependent upon androgen receptor signaling, such as prostate cancer and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients. Thus, the treatment comprises administering to the patient a compound of Formula (I), or a stereoisomer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. \n\n\n[00127] In one embodiment, a method is provided for treating cancer comprising administering a compound of Formula (I), a stereoisomer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The method of this embodiment can be used to treat a variety of cancers, including, but not limited to, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer. Preferably, the method of this embodiment is used to treat prostate cancer and/or breast cancer. In one method of this embodiment, the compound of Formula (I), a stereoisomer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered in a therapeutically effective amount. \n\n\n [00128] In one embodiment, provided are methods for treating cancer in a patient wherein the cancer is dependent upon CYP 17 activation, comprising administering to the patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), a stereoisomer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In one method of this embodiment, a compound of Formula (I), a stereoisomer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered to treat prostate cancer. In another method of this \n\n embodiment, a compound of Formula (I), a stereoisomer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered to treat breast cancer. Preferably, a therapeutically effective amount of Compound (I), a stereoisomer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered. \n\n\n[00129] The amount of a compound of Formula (I) which is administered and the dosage regimen for treating a particular cancer depends on a variety of factors, including the age, weight, sex and medical condition of the subject, the type of disease, the severity of the disease, the route and frequency of administration, and the particular compound employed. Thus, the dosage regimen may vary widely, but can be determined routinely using standard methods. A daily dose of about 0.01 to 500 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.05 to 50 mg/kg body weight, and most preferably about 0.05 to 20 mg/kg body weight, may be appropriate. The daily dose can be administered in one to four doses per day. \n\n\n [00130] In treating cancer, a combination of chemotherapeutic agents and/or other treatments (e.g., radiation therapy) is often advantageous. The second (or third) agent may have the same or different mechanism of action than the primary therapeutic agent. It may be especially useful to employ cytotoxic drug combinations wherein the two or more drugs being administered act in different manners or in different phases of the cell cycle, and/or where the two or more drugs have overlapping toxicities or side effects, and/or where the drugs being combined each has a demonstrated efficacy in treating the particular disease state manifested by the patient. \n\n\n [00131] Accordingly, a compound of Formula (I) may be administered in combination with other anti-cancer treatments useful in the treatment of cancer or other proliferative diseases. The invention herein further comprises use of a compound of Formula (I) in preparing medicaments for the treatment of cancer, and/or it comprises the packaging of a compound of Formula (I) herein together with instructions that the compound be used in combination with other anti-cancer or cytotoxic agents and treatments for the treatment of cancer. The present invention further comprises combinations of a compound of Formula (I) and one or more additional agents in kit form, e.g., where they are packaged together or placed in separate packages to be sold together as a kit, or where they are packaged to be formulated together. \n\n [00132] The compound of Formula (I) can be formulated or co-administered with other therapeutic agents that are selected for their particular usefulness in addressing side effects associated with the aforementioned conditions.

For illustrative purposes, general Schemes 1 to 8 below show general methods for preparing the compounds of the present invention, as well as key intermediates. For a more detailed description of the individual reaction steps, see the Example section below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be used to synthesize the inventive compounds. Although specific starting material and reagents are depicted in the Schemes and discussed below, other starting materials and reagents can be easily substituted to provide a variety of compounds of the present invention. In addition, many of the compounds prepared by the methods below can be further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled in the art. [00149] As shown in Scheme 1, for instance a 3-pyridylboronic acid or ester II can be coupled to an aryl halide of type III, where P is a common protecting group known to those skilled in the art, via standard Suzuki coupling conditions to give a coupled product of general structure IV. Removal of protecting group via standard conditions gives the aniline of general structure V. Treatment of the aniline with a sulfonyl chloride VI in the presence of an organic base such as triethylamine, will give the desired sulfonamide of general structure (I). \n\n Scheme 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00150] Alternatively, the boronic acid or ester of general structure II (Scheme 2) can be coupled with an aryl halide of general structure VII where the sulfonamide functionality is already present under standard Suzuki coupling conditions to give products of general structure (I). \n\n\nScheme 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n VII (I) \n\n\n[00151] Scheme 3 depicts another preparation beginning with sulfonamides of general structure VII where G is bromo or iodo. Treatment of the halide at low temperature with excess alkyl lithium, such as tertiary butyl lithium, followed by trapping of the resultant anion with a boronic ester such as pinacol borane, will give products of general structure VIII with a boronic ester para to the sulfonamide. This boronic ester can then be coupled to the 3-bromopyridine of general structure IX under standard Suzuki conditions to afford compounds of general structure (I). \n\n Scheme 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVII [00152] Starting with the commercial pyridine X, treatment with PBrs will afford the tribromide XI. Substitution at the 4-position of XI with various alkoxides and amines under conditions well-known to one skilled in the art will afford compounds of general structure XII. Standard Suzuki coupling with the boronic acid/ester VIII will give compounds of general structure XIII. Functionalization at the 5-position of the pyridine in XIII via Suzuki or Buchwald coupling will give compounds of general structure (I). \n\n\n \n\n [00153] An alternative coupling strategy is shown in Scheme 5. Treatment of optionally substituted pyridines of general structure XIV with an organolithium such as \n\n LDA followed by addition of ZnC¾ and Pd(0) in the presence of an aryl halide such as the bromide of general structure XV, will afford the coupled product of general structure XVI. The 4-position of the pyridine can then be further functionalized by chemistry well- known to one skilled in the art such as Suzuki couplings with aryl boronic acids to afford compounds of general structure XVII. Reduction of the nitro group under standard conditions such as iron/acetic acid or Pd catalyzed hydrogenation will afford the aniline of general structure V which can be converted to the sulfonamide of general structure (I) by methods discussed previously. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00154] Sulfamides can were also prepared and are encompassed by general Formula (I). Treatment of the aniline V with chlorosulfonylisocyanate and 2-hydroxychloroethane in the presence of Hunig's base gives the intermediate oxazolidinone of structure XVIII. Subsequent treatment with an amine at high temperatures, such as 80 °C in CH\n3\nCN, will give the sulfamide of general structure XIX, which is a structure of general Formula (I). \n\n Scheme 6 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n XIX \n\n\n[00155] Substituted pyrimidines can also be prepared from the commercially available 4-chloro-5-iodo-pyrimidine XX. Treatment of this pyrimidine with an amine in a solvent such as DMSO and cesium carbonate will afford the 4-aminopyridimine of structure XXI. This intermediate can then be coupled to boronic acids/esters of general structure VIII under standard Suzuki coupling conditions to afford compounds of general structure \n\n\nXXII which is a compound of general Formula (I). \n\n\nScheme 7 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00156] In a similar manner, the 4-alkoxy -pyrimidines of general structure XXIII can be prepared leading to compounds of general structure XXIV which is a compound of general Formula (I). \n\n Scheme 8 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DME, EtOH, H\n2\n0 \n\n\n XX XXIII \n\n\nEXAMPLES \n\n\n [00157] The following Examples are offered as illustrative as a partial scope and particular embodiment of the invention and are not to be limiting of the scope of the invention. \n\n\nAbbreviations \n\n\n [00158] The following abbreviations are employed in the Example section below and elsewhere herein: \n\n\nAcOH acetic acid \n\n\n AC\n2\nO acetic anhydride \n\n\n CH\n2\nC1\n2\n or DCM dichloromethane \n\n\n DCE dichloroethane \n\n\n DMAP dimethylaminopyridine \n\n\n DME dimethoxyethane \n\n\nDIEA or Hunig's base diisopropylethylamine \n\n\n DMF dimethylformamide \n\n\n DMSO dimethylsulfoxide \n\n\n EDC l-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride\n\n\nEt ethyl \n\n\n Et\n2\n0 diethyl ether \n\n\n EtOAc ethyl acetate \n\n\n EtOH ethanol \n\n\n Et\n3\n or TEA triethylamine \n\n Et\n3\nSiH triethylsilane \n\n\n HC1 hydrochloric acid \n\n\n HOBT 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole \n\n\niPr isopropyl \n\n\niPrOH isopropanol \n\n\n LDA lithium diisopropylamide \n\n\n Me methyl \n\n\n MeOH methanol \n\n\n NBS N-bromosuccinimide \n\n\nn-BuLi n-butyl lithium \n\n\n NaOMe sodium methoxide \n\n\n NaOH sodium hydroxide \n\n\n PMe\n3\n trimethyl phosphine \n\n\n Pd(Ph\n3\nP)\n4\n tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)\n\n\nTBSC1 tert-buty ldimethy Is ily lchloride \n\n\n TFA trifluoroacetic acid \n\n\n Tf\n2\n0 trifluoromethylsulfonic anhydride\n\n\nTHF tetrahydrofuran \n\n\n VCD vibrational circular dichroism h hour(s) \n\n\nmin minute(s) \n\n\n L liter \n\n\nmL milliliter \n\n\n microliter \n\n\ng gram(s) \n\n\nmg milligram(s) \n\n\nmol mole(s) \n\n\nmmol millimole(s) \n\n\nrt room temperature \n\n\n Ret time HPLC/LC-MS retention time sat or sat'd saturated \n\n\naq. aqueous \n\n TLC thin layer chromatography \n\n\n HPLC high performance liquid chromatography \n\n\n Prep HPLC preparative reverse phase HPLC \n\n\n LC/MS liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry \n\n\n MS mass spectrometry \n\n\n NMR nuclear magnetic resonance \n\n\nmp melting point \n\n\nAnalytical HPLC/LC-MS Retention Time \n\n\n [00159] Retention time data reported for each example and intermediate uses one of the following general Analytical HPLC/LC-MS methods: \n\n\n Method A: YMC S-5 ODS-A 4.6 x 50 mm column; flow rate 4 mL/min; gradient time 4 min; 100% Solvent A to 100% Solvent B and holding 100% Solvent B for 1 min; monitoring at 220 nm (Solvent A: 10% MeOH, 90% H\n2\n0, 0.2% H\n3\nP0\n4\n; Solvent B: 90% MeOH, 10% H\n2\n0, 0.2% H\n3\nP0\n4\n).

The exemplified biological assays, which follow, have been carried out with the compounds of the present invention. CYP17 Total SPA assay \n\n\n [00287] The assays were performed in U-bottom 384-well optiplates. The final assay volume was 15 μΐ prepared from 7.5 μΐ additions of microsomes (prepared as a highspeed pellet from homogenized HEK2 cells stably transfected with CYP17), substrates (3H- Pregnenolone and NADPH) and test compounds in assay buffer (50 mM Potassium phosphate pH 7.2, 10% glycerol). The reaction was initiated by the combination of the microsomes and substrates in wells containing compound. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes and terminated by adding 7.5 μΐ of 0.2N HC1 to each well. Following an incubation period of 10 minutes, anti-DHEA-coated SPA beads were added to the terminated reaction. The plate was sealed and incubated overnight with shaking at 4 °C. The beads were allowed to settle in the plate for 1 hour and the plate read on a TOPCOU T® (Perkin-Elmer) plate reader. \n\n\n [00288] Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assays are NADPH, 2 mM; 3H-Pregnenolone, 1 uM; microsomes, 1.25 ug/ml; Anti-DHEA-SPA beads (0.125 mg/well) in 0.5% Triton X-100 and DMSO, 0.05%. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required inhibiting 50% of enzyme activity (IC\n50\n). Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at eleven concentrations, each in duplicate. IC5\n0\n values were derived by non-linear regression analysis. \n\n\n[00289] Table 22 below lists the IC5\n0\n values for the following Examples of this invention measured in the Total CYP17 SPA Assay hereinabove.

The reaction consists of 200nM [3H]-Hydroxypregnenolone (ARC), 200 nM 17-\n\n\nHydroxypregnenolone (Sigma), 2mM NADPH (CalBiochem), and CYP 17-HEK293 microsomes which were incubated in the presence of DMSO or test compounds for 20 minutes at room temperature. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and serially diluted. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2 N HC1 and the product was captured using anti-mouse YSi SPA beads (GE) conjugated to an anti-DHEA monoclonal antibody (Abeam). Signal intensity determined by a Packard Top Count was used to calculate percent inhibition and IC5\n0\n values. \n\n\nCypl7 Hydroxylase Assay \n\n\n[00291] E. coli was transformed to express active human CYP17 and membranes prepared from the transformed E. coli were used as the source of enzyme. The reaction \n\n was carried out in a 50μΙ\n^\n final volume containing 200nM hCYP 17 membranes, 25μΜ Pregnenolone (Sigma), 7mM NADPH (CalBiochem), Ι μΜ cytochrome P450 reductase (Invitrogen), and 50mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. The IC5\n0\n determination of compounds dissolved in 100% DMSO was done by serial dilution into the assay buffer to a final concentration of 0.2% DMSO. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 120 minutes and stopped by the addition of 200μί of 0.02N HCl in acetonitrile. Samples were then spun at 750000 g and 200μΙ. of the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube for analysis. The product of the reaction, 17 alpha pregnenolone, was measured via LC/MS. Cypl7 HEK293 Cell Based Assay \n\n\n [00292] HEK293 cells were stably transfected with human Cypl7 and individual clones analyzed for Cypl7 enzymatic activity via LC/MS. A single clone showing robust activity was selected and scaled up. Cells were seeded in 96 well plates and a serial dilution of compounds dissolved in DMSO was added to the cells. Following an incubation of 4 hours, reactions were neutralized by the addition of 200ul of acetonitrile containing 0.5uM pregnenolone as tracer. Plates were spun down at 2K for 15 minutes and supernatants transferred to siliconized 96 well plates. The end product of the reaction DHEA was analyzed via LC/MS. 1-Day Cyno PK/PD Study Protocol \n\n\n [00293] Animals: All procedures involving animals and their care were conducted in conformity with the guidelines that are in compliance with the Bristol-Myers Squibb Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Fully mature male cynomolgus monkeys (> 4 yrs of age; 5-6 kg) were from an in-house colony. All the monkeys used had chronically implanted femoral vein access ports. For oral studies, all animals were fasted overnight prior to dosing and were fed 4 hr after dosing. All animals had free access to water and were conscious throughout the study. \n\n\n [00294] Drug: For all oral pharmacokinetic studies in cynomolgus monkeys, the tested compound was formulated in polyethylene glycol (PEG 400): water (80:20, v:v) at concentrations of 1-5 mg/mL. \n\n\n [00295] Drug Treatment: The tested compound was administered by oral gavage to cynomolgus monkeys. \n\n [00296] Sampling: Blood samples were collected from the femoral port, at 15, 30, and 45 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 30, and 48 hr after oral administration. All blood samples were collected into syringes containing sodium heparin. The plasma fraction was immediately separated by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), frozen on dry ice, and stored at -20 °C until the samples were analyzed. \n\n\n [00297] Analysis of Tested Compound: Plasma samples were thawed and treated with two volumes of acetonitrile containing internal standard. After centrifugation to remove precipitated proteins, an aliquot of supernatant was analyzed by LC/MS/MS. \n\n\n[00298] Analysis of Steroids: Plasma samples were thawed, and assayed in accordance with package insert instructions for the following kits: Coat-A-Count total testosterone solid phase RIA kit, Coat-A-Count total progesterone solid phase RIA kit, and Coat-A-Count total Cortisol solid phase RIA kit (Diagnostic Product Corp, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL). \n\n\n [00299] Figure 1 shows the results of a 1-day PK/PD study in NHP cynomolgus monkeys with Example 217. Example 217 was formulated in 80% PEG-400/water at a volume of 1 mL/Kg of monkey and a dose of 5 mg/Kg. The formulation was then administered orally at time = 0 and blood samples were taken over a 24 hour period to monitor for drug exposure and testosterone levels. Figure 1 shows that testosterone levels are reduced after single oral dose of Example 217, consistent with an inhibitor of CYP17 lyase."
