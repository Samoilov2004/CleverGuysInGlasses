Each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides compounds that are PDE10A enzyme inhibitors, and as such are useful to treat neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Especially, the invention provides compounds that are highly selective for PDE10 over other PDE subtypes. The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds of the invention and methods of treating disorders using the compounds of the invention.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThroughout this application, various publications are referenced in full. The disclosures of these publications are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to describe more fully the state of the art to which this invention pertains.\n\n\nThe cyclic nucleotides cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) function as intracellular second messengers regulating a vast array of processes in neurons. Intracellular cAMP and cGMP are generated by adenyl and guanyl cyclases, and are degraded by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP are controlled by intracellular signaling, and stimulation/repression of adenyl and guanyl cyclases in response to GPCR activation is a well characterized way of controlling cyclic nucleotide concentrations (Antoni, F. A. \nFront. Neuroendocrinol. \n2000, 21, 103-132). cAMP and cGMP levels in turn control activity of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent kinases as well as other proteins with cyclic nucleotide response elements, which through subsequent phosphorylation of proteins and other processes regulate key neuronal functions such as synaptic transmission, neuronal differentiation and survival.\n\n\nThere are 21 phosphodiesterase genes that can be divided into 11 gene families. There are ten families of adenylyl cyclases, two of guanylyl cyclases, and eleven of phosphodiesterases. PDEs are a class of intracellular enzymes that regulate levels of cAMP and cGMP via hydrolysis of the cyclic nucleotides into their respective nucleotide monophosphates. Some PDEs degrade cAMP, some cGMP and some both. Most PDEs have a widespread expression and have roles in many tissues, while some are more tissue-specific.\n\n\nPhosphodieasterase 10A (PDE10A) is a dual-specificity phosphodiesterase that can convert both cAMP to AMP and cGMP to GMP (Loughney, K. et al. \nGene \n1999, 234, 109-117; Fujishige, K. et al. \nEur. J. Biochem. \n1999, 266, 1118-1127 and Soderling, S. et al. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n1999, 96, 7071-7076). PDE10A is primarily expressed in the neurons in the striatum, n. accumbens and in the olfactory tubercle (Kotera, J. et al. \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. \n1999, 261, 551-557 and Seeger, T. F. et al. \nBrain Research, \n2003, 985, 113-126).\n\n\nMouse PDE10A is the first identified member of the PDE10 family of phosphodiesterases (Fujishige, K. et al. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n1999, 274, 18438-18445 and Loughney, K. et al. \nGene \n1999, 234, 109-117) and N-terminal splice variants of both the rat and human genes have been identified (Kotera, J. et al. \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. \n1999, 261, 551-557 and Fujishige, K. et al. \nEur. J. Biochem. \n1999, 266, 1118-1127). There is a high degree of homology across species. PDE10A is uniquely localized in mammals relative to other PDE families. mRNA for PDE10 is highly expressed in testis and brain (Fujishige, K. et al. \nEur J. Biochem. \n1999, 266, 1118-1127; Soderling, S. et al. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n1999, 96, 7071-7076 and Loughney, K. et al. \nGene \n1999, 234, 109-117). These studies indicate that within the brain, PDE10 expression is highest in the striatum (caudate and putamen), n. accumbens and olfactory tubercle. More recently, an analysis has been made of the expression pattern in rodent brain of PDE10A mRNA (Seeger, T. F. et al. \nAbst. Soc. Neurosci. \n2000, 26, 345.10) and PDE10A protein (Menniti, F. S. et al. William Harvey Research Conference ‘Phosphodiesterase in Health and Disease’, Porto, Portugal, Dec. 5-7, 2001).\n\n\nPDE10A is expressed at high levels by the medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the caudate nucleus, the accumbens nucleus and the corresponding neurons of the olfactory tubercle. These constitute the core of the basal ganglia system. The MSN has a key role in the cortical-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop, integrating convergent cortical/thalamic input, and sending this integrated information back to the cortex. MSN express two functional classes of neurons: the D\n1 \nclass expressing D\n1 \ndopamine receptors and the D\n2 \nclass expressing D\n2 \ndopamine receptors. The D\n1 \nclass of neurons is part of the ‘direct’ striatal output pathway, which broadly functions to facilitate behavioral responses. The D\n2 \nclass of neurons is part of the ‘indirect’ striatal output pathway, which functions to suppress behavioral responses that compete with those being facilitated by the ‘direct’ pathway. These competing pathways act like the brake and accelerator in a car. In the simplest view, the poverty of movement in Parkinson's disease results from over-activity of the ‘indirect’ pathway, whereas excess movement in disorders such as Huntington's disease represent over-activity of the direct pathway. PDE10A regulation of cAMP and/or cGMP signaling in the dendritic compartment of these neurons may be involved in filtering the cortico/thalamic input into the MSN. Furthermore, PDE10A may be involved in the regulation of GABA release in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus (Seeger, T. F. et al. \nBrain Research, \n2003, 985, 113-126).\n\n\nDopamine D\n2 \nreceptor antagonism is well established in the treatment of schizophrenia. Since the 1950's, dopamine D\n2 \nreceptor antagonism has been the mainstay in psychosis treatment and all effective antipsychotic drugs antagonise D\n2 \nreceptors. The effects of D\n2 \nare likely to be mediated primarily through neurons in the striatum, n. accumbens and olfactory tubercle, since these areas receive the densest dopaminergic projections and have the strongest expression of D\n2 \nreceptors (Konradi, C. and Heckers, S. \nSociety of Biological Psychiatry, \n2001, 50, 729-742). Dopamine D\n2 \nreceptor agonism leads to decrease in cAMP levels in the cells where it is expressed through adenylate cyclase inhibition, and this is a component of D\n2 \nsignalling (Stoof, J. C.; Kebabian J. W. \nNature \n1981, 294, 366-368 and Neve, K. A. et al. \nJournal of Receptors and Signal Transduction \n2004, 24, 165-205). Conversely, D\n2 \nreceptor antagonism effectively increases cAMP levels, and this effect could be mimicked by inhibition of cAMP degrading phosphodiesterases.\n\n\nMost of the 21 phosphodiesterase genes are widely expressed; therefore inhibition is likely to have side effects. Because PDE10A, in this context, has the desired expression profile with high and relatively specific expression in neurons in striatum, n. accumbens and olfactory tubercle, PDE10A inhibition is likely to have effects similar to D\n2 \nreceptor antagonism and therefore have antipsychotic effects.\n\n\nWhile PDE10A inhibition is expected to mimic D\n2 \nreceptor antagonism in part, it might be expected to have a different profile. The D\n2 \nreceptor has signalling components besides cAMP (Neve, K. A. et al. \nJournal of Receptors and Signal Transduction \n2004, 24, 165-205), wherefore interference with cAMP through PDE10A inhibition may negatively modulate rather than directly antagonise dopamine signaling through D\n2 \nreceptors. This may reduce the risk of the extrapyrimidal side effects that are seen with strong D\n2 \nantagonism. Conversely, PDE10A inhibition may have some effects not seen with D\n2 \nreceptor antagonism. PDE10A is also expressed in D\n1 \nreceptors expressing striatal neurons (Seeger, T. F. et al. \nBrain Research, \n2003, 985, 113-126). Since D\n1 \nreceptor agonism leads to stimulation of adenylate cyclase and resulting increase in cAMP levels, PDE10A inhibition is likely to also have effects that mimic D\n1 \nreceptor agonism. Finally, PDE10A inhibition will not only increase cAMP in cells, but might also be expected to increase cGMP levels, since PDE10A is a dual specificity phosphodiesterase. cGMP activates a number of target protein in cells like cAMP and also interacts with the cAMP signalling pathways. In conclusion, PDE10A inhibition is likely to mimic D\n2 \nreceptor antagonism in part and therefore has antipsychotic effect, but the profile might differ from that observed with classical D\n2 \nreceptor antagonists.\n\n\nThe PDE10A inhibitor papaverine is shown to be active in several antipsychotic models. Papaverine potentiated the cataleptic effect of the D\n2 \nreceptor antagonist haloperidol in rats, but did not cause catalepsy on its own (WO 03/093499). Papaverine reduced hyperactivity in rats induced by PCP, while reduction of amphetamine induced hyperactivity was insignificant (WO 03/093499). These models suggest that PDE10A inhibition has the classic antipsychotic potential that would be expected from theoretical considerations. WO 03/093499 further discloses the use of selective PDE10 inhibitors for the treatment of associated neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, PDE10A inhibition reverses subchronic PCP-induced deficits in attentional set-shifting in rats (Rodefer et al. \nEur. J. Neurosci. \n2005, 4, 1070-1076). This model suggests that PDE10A inhibition might alleviate cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia.\n\n\nThe tissue distribution of PDE10A indicates that PDE10A inhibitors can be used to raise levels of cAMP and/or cGMP within cells that express the PDE10 enzyme, especially neurons that comprise the basal ganglia, and the PDE10A inhibitors of the present invention would therefore be useful in treating a variety of associated neuropsychiatric conditions involving the basal ganglia such as neurological and psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and the like, and may have the benefit of not possessing unwanted side effects, which are associated with the current therapies on the market.\n\n\nFurthermore, recent publications (WO 2005/120514, WO 2005012485, Cantin et al, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 17 (2007) 2869-2873) suggest that PDE10A inhibitors may be useful for treatment of obesity and non-insulin dependent diabetes.\n\n\nWith respect to inhibitors of PDE10A, EP 1250923 discloses the use of selective PDE10 inhibitors in general, and papaverine in particular, for the treatment of certain neurologic and psychiatric disorders.\n\n\nWO 05/113517 discloses benzodiazepine stereospecific compounds as inhibitors of phosphodiesterase, especially types 2 and 4, and the prevention and treatment of pathologies involving a central and/or peripheral disorder. WO 02/88096 discloses benzodiazepine derivatives and their uses as inhibitors of phosphodiesterase, especially type 4 in the therapeutic field. WO 04/41258 discloses benzodiazepinone derivatives and their uses as inhibitors of phosphodiesterase, especially type 2 in the therapeutic field.\n\n\nPyrrolodihydroisoquinolines and variants thereof are disclosed as inhibitors of PDE10 in WO 05/03129 and WO 05/02579. Piperidinyl-substituted quinazolines and isoquinolines that serve as PDE10 inhibitors are disclosed in WO 05/82883. WO 06/11040 discloses substituted quinazoline and isoquinoline compounds that serve as inhibitors of PDE10. US 20050182079 discloses substituted tetrahydroisoquinolinyl derivatives of quinazoline and isoquinoline that serve as effective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors. In particular, US 20050182079 relates to said compounds, which are selective inhibitors of PDE10. Analogously, US 20060019975 discloses piperidine derivatives of quinazoline and isoquinoline that serve as effective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors. US 20060019975 also relates to compounds that are selective inhibitors of PDE10. WO 06/028957 discloses cinnoline derivatives as inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 10 for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological syndromes.\n\n\nHowever, these disclosures do not pertain to the compounds of the invention, which are structurally unrelated to any of the known PDE10 inhibitors (Kehler, J. et al. \nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents \n2007, 17, 147-158), and which have now been found by the inventors to be highly active and selective PDE10A enzyme inhibitors.\n\n\nThe compounds 2-(5-Phenyl-1H-imidazol-2-ylmethylsulfanyl)-1H-benzoimidazole (CAS Registry no. 348125-42-8) and 2-(5-Phenyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl-sulfanylmethyl)-1H-benzoimidazole (CAS Registry no. 296791-07-6) appear in the chemical libraries of Scientific Exchange, Inc. and Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry, respectively, but no pharmacological data appear to have been published. The compounds are both disclaimed from the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may offer alternatives to current marketed treatments for neurodegenerative and/or psychiatric disorders, which are not efficacious in all patients. Hence, there remains a need for alternative methods of treatment.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe objective of the present invention is to provide compounds that are selective PDE10A enzyme inhibitors.\n\n\nA further objective of the present invention is to provide compounds which have such activity, and which have improved solubility, metabolic stability and/or bioavailability compared to prior art compounds.\n\n\nAnother objective of the invention is to provide an effective treatment, in particular long-term treatment, of a human patient, without causing the side effects typically associated with current therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders.\n\n\nFurther objectives of the invention will become apparent upon reading the present specification.\n\n\nAccordingly, in one aspect the present invention relates to compounds of formula I:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein HET is a heteroaromatic group of formula II containing from 2 to 4 nitrogen atoms:\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein Y can be N or CH, Z can be N or C, and wherein HET may optionally be substituted with up to three substituents R7, R8 and R9 individually selected from H; C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl such as Me; halogen such as chlorine and bromine; cyano; halo(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl such as trifluoromethyl; aryl such as phenyl; alkoxy, preferably C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxy, such as methoxy, dimethoxy, ethoxy, methoxy-ethoxy and ethoxy-methoxy, and C\n1\n-C\n6 \nhydroxyalkyl such as CH\n2\nCH\n2\nOH, and wherein * denotes the attachment point,\n\n\n-L- is a linker selected from —S—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—S—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— or —CH═CH—,\n\n\nR1 is selected from H; C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl such as methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, isobutyl; C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl(C\n3\n-C\n8\n)cycloalkyl such as cyclopropylmethyl; C\n1\n-C\n6 \nhydroxyalkyl such as hydroxyethyl; CH\n2\nCN; CH\n2\nC(O)NH\n2\n; C\n1\n-C\n6 \narylalkyl such as benzyl and 4-chlorobenzyl; and C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl-heterocycloalkyl such as tetrahydropyran-4-yl-methyl and 2-morpholin-4-yl-ethyl;\n\n\nR2-R6 are each selected independently from H; C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxy such as methoxy; and halogen such as chlorine or fluorine;\n\n\nand tautomers and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, and polymorphic forms thereof, with the proviso that the compound is not 2-(5-Phenyl-1H-imidazol-2-ylmethylsulfanyl)-1H-benzoimidazole or 2-(5-Phenyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl-sulfanylmethyl)-1H-benzoimidazole\n\n\n\nIn a particular embodiment, the invention relates to a compound of formula I in the form of a single tautomer or a polymorph.\n\n\nIn separate embodiments of the invention, the compound of formula I is selected among the specific compounds disclosed in the Experimental Section herein.\n\n\nThe invention further provides a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, for use as a medicament.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient.\n\n\nThe invention further provides the use of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorder.\n\n\nFurthermore, in yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject suffering from a neurodegenerative disorder, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I.

Natl. Acad. Sci. \n1999, 96, 7071-7076). PDE10A can be expressed as full-length proteins or as truncated proteins, as long as they express the catalytic domain. PDE10A can be prepared in different cell types, for example insect cells or \nE. coli\n. An example of a method to obtain catalytically active PDE10A is as follows: The catalytic domain of human PDE10A (amino acids 440-779 from the sequence with accession number NP 006652) is amplified from total human brain total RNA by standard RT-PCR and is cloned into the BamH1 and Xho1 sites of the pET28a vector (Novagen). Expression in coli is performed according to standard protocols. Briefly, the expression plasmids are transformed into the BL21(DE3) \nE. coli \nstrain, and 50 mL cultures inoculated with the cells allowed to grow to an OD600 of 0.4-0.6 before protein expression is induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. Following induction, the cells are incubated overnight at room temperature, after which the cells are collected by centrifugation. Cells expressing PDE10A are resuspended in 12 mL (50 mM TRIS-HCl-pH8.0, 1 mM MgCl\n2 \nand protease inhibitors). The cells are lysed by sonication, and after all cells are lysed, TritonX100 is added according to Novagen protocols. PDE10A is partially purified on Q sepharose and the most active fractions were pooled.\n\n\nPDE10A Inhibition Assay\n\n\nA PDE10A assay may for example, be performed as follows: The assay is performed in 60 uL samples containing a fixed amount of the relevant PDE enzyme (sufficient to convert 20-25% of the cyclic nucleotide substrate), a buffer (50 mM HEPES7.6; 10 mM MgCl\n2\n; 0.02% Tween20), 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 225 pCi of \n3\nH-labelled cyclic nucleotide substrate, tritium labeled cAMP to a final concentration of 5 nM and varying amounts of inhibitors. Reactions are initiated by addition of the cyclic nucleotide substrate, and reactions are allowed to proceed for one hr at room temperature before being terminated through mixing with 15 uL 8 mg/mL yttrium silicate SPA beads (Amersham). The beads are allowed to settle for one hr in the dark before the plates are counted in a Wallac 1450 Microbeta counter. The measured signal can be converted to activity relative to an uninhibited control (100%) and IC\n50 \nvalues can be calculated using the Xlfit extension to EXCEL.\n\n\nIn the context of the present invention the assay was performed in 60 uL assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.6; 10 mM MgCl\n2\n; 0.02% Tween20) containing enough PDE10A to convert 20-25% of 10 nM \n3\nH-cAMP and varying amounts of inhibitors. Following a 1 hour incubation the reactions were terminated by addition of 15 uL 8 mg/mL yttrium silicate SPA beads (Amersham). The beads were allowed to settle for one hr in the dark before the plates were counted in a Wallac 1450 Microbeta counter. IC\n50 \nvalues were calculated by non linear regression using XLfit (IDBS).\n\n\nResults of the experiments showed that the tested compounds of the invention inhibit the PDE10A enzyme with IC\n50 \nvalues below 700 nM.\n\n\nResults of the experiments showed that the majority of the compounds of the invention had IC\n50 \nvalues of <1500 nM, many compounds <100 nM, some compounds <50 nM and some had IC\n50 \nvalues <10 nM.\n\n\nPhencyclidine (PCP) Induced Hyperactivity\n\n\nMale mice (NMRI, Charles River) weighing 20-25 g are used. Eight mice are used in each group receiving the test compound (5 mg/kg) plus PCP (2.3 mg/kg) including the parallel control groups receiving the vehicle of the test compound plus PCP or vehicle injections only. The injection volumen is 10 ml/kg. The experiment is made in normal light conditions in an undisturbed room. The test substance is injected per oss 60 min before injection of PCP, which is administered subcutaneous.\n\n\nImmediately after injection of PCP the mice are placed individually in special designed test cage (20 cm×32 cm). The activity is measured by 5×8 infrared light sources and photocells spaced by 4 cm. The light beams cross the cage 1.8 cm above the bottom of the cage. Recording of a motility count requires interruption of adjacent light beams, thus avoiding counts induced by stationary movements of the mice.\n\n\nMotility is recorded in 5 min intervals for a period of 1 hour. The drug effect is calculated on the total counts during the 1 hour behavioral test period in the following manner: The mean motility induced by vehicle treatment in the absence of PCP is used as baseline. The 100 percent effect of PCP is accordingly calculated to be total motility counts minus baseline. The response in groups receiving test compound is thus determined by the total motility counts minus baseline, expressed in percent of the similar result recorded in the parallel PCP control group. The percent responses are converted to percent inhibition.\n\n\nResults of the experiments showed that the tested compounds of the invention are in vivo active compounds that inhibit the PCP induced hyperactivity to the % shown in table 2 above."

Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nDescribed herein is N-methyl(4-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)cyclohexyl)methanesulfonamide, its analogues, their use as Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds, and methods for the preparation of these compound.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nProtein kinases are families of enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of specific residues in proteins, broadly classified into tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. Inappropriate kinase activity, arising from mutation, over-expression, or inappropriate regulation, dys-regulation or de-regulation, as well as over- or under-production of growth factors or cytokines has been implicated in many diseases, including but not limited to cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies, asthma and other respiratory diseases, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic disorders, and neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Inappropriate kinase activity triggers a variety of biological cellular responses relating to cell growth, cell differentiation, survival, apoptosis, mitogenesis, cell cycle control, and cell mobility implicated in the aforementioned and related diseases.\n\n\nThus, protein kinases have emerged as an important class of enzymes as targets for therapeutic intervention. In particular, the JAK family of cellular protein tyrosine kinases (JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3, and Tyk-2) play a central role in cytokine signaling (Kisseleva et al, Gene, 2002, 285, 1; Yamaoka et al. Genome Biology 2004, 5, 253)). Upon binding to their receptors, cytokines activate JAK which then phosphorylate the cytokine receptor, thereby creating docking sites for signaling molecules, notably, members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family that ultimately lead to gene expression. Numerous cytokines are known to activate the JAK family.\n\n\nAccordingly, there remains a need for alternative compounds that effectively inhibit JAK enzymes, including JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3, and/or Tyk-2.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides a compound of formula I:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof wherein R\n1 \nis —C\n1-4\nalky, optionally substituted with hydroxy.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, a compound of formula I wherein R\n1 \nis methyl.\n\n\nSpecifically, a compound of formula I wherein R\n1 \nis ethyl or cyclobutyl.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention also provides:\n\n\npharmaceutical compositions which comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound of formula I,\n\n\nmethods for controlling or treating a disorder or condition selected from organ transplant rejections, lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, cancer, osteoarthritis, and diabetes by administering to a mammal in need a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n\n\nmethods for controlling or treating a disorder or condition selected from diabetes, cancer, autoimmune thyroid disorders, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, dry eyes, Alzheimer's disease, leukemia, and other indications where immunosuppression or immunomodulation would be desirable by administering to a mammal in need a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n\n\nmethods for controlling or treating a disorder or condition selected from allergic reaction including allergic dermatitis, eczema, atopic dermatitis, pruritus and other pruritic conditions and inflammatory disease such as bowel disease in mammal by administering to a mammal in need a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n\n\nmethods for controlling or treating a disorder or condition selected from Asthma and other obstructive airways diseases, including chronic or inveterate asthma, late asthma, airway hyper-responsiveness, bronchitis, bronchial asthma, allergic asthma, intrinsic asthma, extrinsic asthma, dust asthma, recurrent airway obstruction, and chronic obstruction pulmonary disease by administering to a mammal in need a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n\n\nmethods for the inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases or JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3 and/or Tyk-2 by administering to a mammal in need of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n\n\nmethods for the inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases or JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3 and/or Tyk-2 by administering to a mammal in need of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and\n\n\nmethods for the preparation of compounds of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n is a characteristic X-ray powder diffraction pattern of N-methyl-1-{trans-4-[(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-a]pyrimidin-4-yl)amino]cyclohexyl}methanesulfonamide maleic acid salt (Form A).\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n illustrates \nDay\n 27 VAS Scores for Example 1b in flea allergic dogs in the Reducing Flea-associated Pruritus and Dermatitis Assay\n\n\n \nFIG. 3\n illustrates Seconds of Pruritus per 4 hour recording for example 1b in flea allergic dogs in the Reducing flea-associated Pruritus and Dermatitis Assay.\n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\nWith respect to the above compound, and throughout the application and claims, the following terms have the meanings defined below.\n\n\nThe term “mammal” refers to human or animals including livestock and companion animals. The phrase “companion animal” or “companion animals” refers to animals kept as pets. Examples of companion animals include cats, dogs, and horses. The term “livestock” refers to animals reared or raised in an agricultural setting to make products such as food or fiber, or for its labor. In some embodiments, livestock are suitable for consumption by mammals, for example humans. Examples of livestock animals include mammals, such as cattle, goats, horses, pigs, sheep, including lambs, and rabbits, as well as birds, such as chickens, ducks and turkeys.\n\n\nThe term “controlling”, “treating” or “treatment” of a disease includes: (1) preventing the disease, i.e. causing the clinical symptoms or signs of the disease not to develop in a mammal that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease but does not yet experience or display symptoms/signs of the disease; (2) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the disease or its clinical symptoms/signs; or (3) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease or its clinical symptoms/signs.\n\n\nThe term “therapeutically effective amount” means the amount of a compound that, when administered to a mammal for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease. The “therapeutically effective amount” will vary depending on the compound, the disease and its severity and the age, weight, etc., of the mammal to be treated.\n\n\nThe term “approximately” if used in defining a peak in an X-ray powder diffraction pattern is defined as the stated 2-theta value ±0.2 degree 2-theta. Any determination of whether a crystalline form is the Form A polymorph and encompassed by the claims should be interpreted in light of the variability in this test.\n\n\n“Pharmaceutically acceptable” means suitable for use in mammals, companion animals or livestock animals.\n\n\nThe carbon atom content of various hydrocarbon-containing moieties is indicated by a prefix designating the minimum and maximum number of carbon atoms in the moiety, i.e., the prefix C\ni-j \nindicates a moiety of the integer “i” to the integer “j” carbon atoms, inclusive. Thus, for example, C\n1-4 \nalkyl refers to alkyl of one to four carbon atoms, inclusive.\n\n\nThe term alkyl refers to straight, branched and a cyclic saturated monovalent hydrocarbon groups, but reference to an individual radical such as “propyl” embraces only the straight chain radical, a branched chain isomer such as “isopropyl” or a cyclic isomer such as cyclopropylmethyl or cyclopentyl being specifically referred to.\n\n\nCompounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “isomers”. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “stereoisomers”. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compound of formula I can exist as cis- and trans-achiral diastereomers. Specifically, the present invention provides a compound of formula IA, which has the chemical name N-methyl-1-{trans-4-[methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)amino]cyclohexyl}methanesulfonamide,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n\nIncluded within the scope of the described compounds are all isomers (e.g. cis-, trans-, or diastereomers) of the compounds described herein alone as well as any mixtures. All of these forms, including enantiomers, diastereomers, cis, trans, syn, anti, solvates (including hydrates), tautomers, and mixtures thereof, are included in the described compounds.\n\n\nStereoisomeric mixtures, e.g. mixtures of diastereomers, can be separated into their corresponding isomers in a known manner by means of suitable separation methods. Diastereomeric mixtures for example may be separated into their individual diastereomers by means of fractionated crystallization, chromatography, solvent distribution, and similar procedures. This separation may take place either at the level of one of the starting compounds or in a compound of formula I itself. Enantiomers may be separated through the formation of diastereomeric salts, for example by salt formation with an enantiomer-pure chiral acid, or by means of chromatography, for example by HPLC, using chromatographic substrates with chiral ligands.\n\n\nRoutes of Administration\n\n\nIn therapeutic use for treating disorders in a mammal (i.e. human and animals), a compound of the present invention or its pharmaceutical compositions can be administered orally, parenterally, topically, rectally, transmucosally, or intestinally. Parenteral administrations include indirect injections to generate a systemic effect or direct injections to the afflicted area. Topical administrations include the treatment of skin or organs readily accessibly by local application, for example, eyes or ears. It also includes transdermal delivery to generate a systemic effect. The rectal administration includes the form of suppositories. The preferred routes of administration are oral and parenteral.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Salts\n\n\nThe compound of formula I may be used in its native form or as a salt. In cases where forming a stable nontoxic acid or base salt is desired, administration of the compound as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be appropriate. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I include the acetate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate, bicarbonate/carbonate, bisulphate/sulphate, borate, camsylate, citrate, edisylate, etoglutarate, esylate, formate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, glycerophosphate, hexafluorophosphate, hibenzate, hydrochloride/chloride, hydrobromide/bromide, hydroiodide/iodide, isethionate, lactate, malate, maleate, malonate, mesylate, methylsulphate, naphthylate, 2-napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, orotate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, phosphate/hydrogen phosphate/dihydrogen phosphate, saccharate, stearate, succinate, tartrate, tosylate and trifluoroacetate salts.\n\n\nComposition/Formulation\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured by processes well known in the art, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulation, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, lyophilizing processes or spray drying.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries, which facilitate processing of the active compound into preparations, which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and carriers are generally known to those skilled in the art and are thus included in the instant invention. Such excipients and carriers are described, for example, in “Remington Pharmaceutical Sciences” Mack Pub. Co., New Jersey (1991).\n\n\nThe formulations of the invention can be designed to be short-acting, fast-releasing, long-acting, and sustained-releasing. Thus, the pharmaceutical formulations can also be formulated for controlled release or for slow release.\n\n\nDosage\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an amount sufficient to achieve the intended purpose, i.e., control or the treatment of disorders or diseases. More specifically, a therapeutically effective amount means an amount of compound effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms/signs of disease or prolong the survival of the subject being treated.\n\n\nThe quantity of active component, which is the compound of this invention, in the pharmaceutical composition and unit dosage form thereof, may be varied or adjusted widely depending upon the manner of administration, the potency of the particular compound and the desired concentration. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art. Generally, the quantity of active component will range between 0.01% to 99% by weight of the composition.\n\n\nGenerally, a therapeutically effective amount of dosage of active component will be in the range of about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight/day, preferably about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg of body weight/day, more preferably about 0.3 to 3 mg/kg of body weight/day, even more preferably about 0.3 to 1.5 mg/kg of body weight/day It is to be understood that the dosages may vary depending upon the requirements of each subject and the severity of the disorders or diseases being treated.\n\n\nThe desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye.\n\n\nAlso, it is to be understood that the initial dosage administered may be increased beyond the above upper level in order to rapidly achieve the desired plasma concentration. On the other hand, the initial dosage may be smaller than the optimum and the daily dosage may be progressively increased during the course of treatment depending on the particular situation. If desired, the daily dose may also be divided into multiple doses for administration, e.g., two to four times per day.\n\n\nMedical and Veterinary Uses\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention are Janus Kinase inhibitors (JAK-i) with efficacy against Janus Kinase-1 (JAK-1), Janus Kinase-2 (JAK-2) and Janus Kinase-3 (JAK-3). Accordingly, they are useful as therapeutic agents for organ transplants, lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Type I diabetes and complications from diabetes, cancer, asthma, atopic dermatitis, autoimmune thyroid disorders, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, Alzheimer's disease, leukemia, osteoarthritis, control of pruritus, chronic respiratory disease and other indications where immunosuppression/immunomodulation would be desirable.\n\n\nIn addition, there are substantial needs for safe and efficacious agents to control atopic dermatitis in animals. The market for treating atopic dermatitis in animals is currently dominated by corticosteroids, which cause distressing and undesirable side effects in animals, specifically in companion animals such as dogs. Antihistamines are also used, but are poorly effective. A canine formulation of cyclosporine (ATOPICA™) is currently being marketed for atopic dermatitis, but is expensive and has a slow onset of efficacy. In addition, there are GI toleration issues with ATOPICA™. Compounds of present invention are JAK inhibitors with efficacy against JAK-1 and JAK-3. These compounds will be an alternative to steroid usage and provide resolution of chronic pruritus and inflammation that would either persist in atopic dermatitis or slowly regress following removal of allergen or causative agent, such as fleas in flea-allergic dermatitis.\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention may be administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable form either alone or in combination with one or more additional agents which modulate a mammalian immune system or with antiinflammatory agents. These agents may include but are not limited to cyclosporin A (e.g. Sandimmune® or Neoral®, rapamycin, FK-506 (tacrolimus), leflunomide, deoxyspergualin, mycophenolate (e.g. Cellcept®, azathioprine (e.g. Imuran®), daclizumab (e.g. Zenapax®), OKT3 (e.g. Orthocolone®), AtGam, aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, piroxicam, and antiinflammatory steroids (e.g. prednisolone or dexamethasone). These agents may be administered as part of the same or separate dosage forms, via the same or different routes of administration, and on the same or different administration schedules according to standard pharmaceutical practice known to one skilled in the art.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the invention provides methods of treating or preventing a disease, condition or disorder associated with JAK in a subject, such as a human or non-human mammal, comprising administering an effective amount of one or more compounds described herein to the subject. The JAK associated disease, condition or disorder can be related to JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3, and/or Tyk-2. Suitable subjects that can be treated include domestic or wild animals, companion animals, such as dogs, cats, horses and the like; livestock including, cows and other ruminants, pigs, poultry, rabbits and the like; primates, for example monkeys, such as rhesus monkeys and cynomolgus (also known as crab-eating or long-tailed) monkeys, marmosets, tamarins, chimpanzees, macaques and the like; and rodents, such as rats, mice, gerbils, guinea pigs and the like. In one embodiment, the compound is administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable form, optionally in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\nJAK/STAT signaling has been implicated in the mediation of many abnormal immune responses such as allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases such as transplant (allograft) rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, as well as in solid and hematologic malignancies such as leukemia and lymphomas. For a review of the pharmaceutical intervention of the JAK/STAT pathway see Frank, (1999), Mol. Med. 5:432:456 and Seidel et al., (2000), Oncogene 19:2645-2656.\n\n\nJAK-3 in particular has been implicated in a variety of biological processes. For example, the proliferation and survival of murine mast cells induced by IL-4 and IL-9 have been shown to be dependent on JAK-3 and gamma chain-signaling. Suzuki et al., (2000), Blood 96:2172-2180. JAK-3 also plays a crucial role in IgE receptor-mediated mast cell degranulation responses (Malaviya et al., (1999), Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 257:807-813), and inhibition of JAK-3 kinase has been shown to prevent type I hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis (Malaviya et al., (1999), J. Biol. Chem. 274:27028-27038). JAK-3 inhibition has also been shown to result in immune suppression for allograft rejection (Kirken, (2001), Transpli Proc. 33:3268-3270). JAK-3 kinases have also been implicated in the mechanism involved in early and late stages of rheumatoid arthritis (Muller-Ladner et al., (2000), J. Immunal. 164:3894-3901); familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Trieu et al., (2000), Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 267:22-25); leukemia (Sudbeck et al., (1999), Clin. Cancer Res. 5:1569-1582); mycosis fungoides, a form of T-cell lymphoma (Nielsen et al., (1997), Prac. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:6764-6769); and abnormal cell growth (Yu et al., (1997), J. Immunol. 159:5206-5210; Catlett-Falcone et al., (1999), Immunity 10:105-115).\n\n\nThe JAK kinases, including JAK-3, are abundantly expressed in primary leukemic cells from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood cancer, and studies have correlated STAT activation in certain cells with signals regulating apoptosis (Demoulin et al., (1996), Mol. Cell. Biol. 16:4710-6; Jurlander et al., (1997), Blood 89:4146-52; Kaneko et al., (1997), Clin. Exp. Immun. 109:185-193; and Nakamura et al., (1996), J. Biol. Chem. 271: 19483-8). They are also known to be important to lymphocyte differentiation, function and survival. JAK-3 in particular plays an essential role in the function of lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells. Given the importance of this JAK kinase, compounds which modulate the JAK pathway, including those selective for JAK-3, can be useful for treating diseases or conditions where the function of lymphocytes, macrophages, or mast cells is involved (Kudlacz et al., (2004) Am. J. Transplant 4:51-57; Changelian (2003) Science 302:875-878).\n\n\nConditions in which targeting of the JAK pathway or modulation of the JAK kinases, particularly JAK-3, are contemplated to be therapeutically useful include, arthritis, asthma, autoimmune diseases, cancers or tumors, diabetes, certain eye diseases, disorders or conditions, inflammation, intestinal inflammations, allergies or conditions, neurodegenerative diseases, psoriasis, transplant rejection, and viral infection. Conditions which can benefit for inhibition of JAK-3 are discussed in greater detail below.\n\n\nAccordingly, the compound of formula I or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and pharmaceutical compositions can be used to treat a variety of conditions or diseases such as:\n\n\nArthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis;\n\n\nAsthma and other obstructive airways diseases, including chronic or inveterate asthma, late asthma, airway hyper-responsiveness, bronchitis, bronchial asthma, allergic asthma, intrinsic asthma, extrinsic asthma, dust asthma, recurrent airway obstruction, and chronic obstruction pulmonary disease;\n\n\nAutoimmune diseases or disorders, including those designated as single organ or single cell-type autoimmune disorders, for example Hashimoto's thyroiditis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune atrophic gastritis of pernicious anemia, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, autoimmune orchitis, Goodpasture's disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, sympathetic ophthalmia, myasthenia gravis, Graves' disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic aggressive hepatitis, ulcerative colitis and membranous glomerulopathy, those designated as involving systemic autoimmune disorder, for example systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, Reiter's syndrome, polymyositis-dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, polyarteritis nodosa, multiple sclerosis and bullous pemphigoid, and additional autoimmune diseases, which can be O-cell (humoral) based or T-cell based, including Cogan's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, autoimmune alopecia, Type I or juvenile onset diabetes, and thyroiditis;\n\n\nCancers or tumors, including alimentary/gastrointestinal tract cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, skin cancer including mast cell tumor and squamous cell carcinoma, breast and mammary cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, including acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia, kidney cancer, lung cancer, muscle cancer, bone cancer, bladder cancer, brain cancer, melanoma including oral and metastatic melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, myelomas including multiple myeloma, myeloproliferative disorders, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and angiogenic-associated disorders including solid tumors;\n\n\nDiabetes, including Type I diabetes and complications from diabetes;\n\n\nEye diseases, disorders or conditions including autoimmune diseases of the eye, keratoconjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, uveitis including uveitis associated with Behcet's disease and lens-induced uveitis, keratitis, herpetic keratitis, conical keratitis, corneal epithelial dystrophy, keratoleukoma, ocular premphigus, Mooren's ulcer, scleritis, Grave's opthalmopathy, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye), phlyctenule, iridocyclitis, sarcoidosis, endocrine opthalmopathy, sympathetic ophthalmitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and ocular neovascularization;\n\n\nIntestinal inflammations, allergies or conditions including Crohn's disease and/or ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac diseases, proctitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and mastocytosis;\n\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases including motor neuron disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, cerebral ischemia, or neurodegenerative disease caused by traumatic injury, strike, glutamate neurotoxicity or hypoxia; ischemic/reperfusion injury in stroke, myocardial ischemica, renal ischemia, heart attacks, cardiac hypertrophy, atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis, organ hypoxia, and platelet aggregation;\n\n\nSkin diseases, conditions or disorders including atopic dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, scleroderma, pruritus and other pruritic conditions;\n\n\nAllergic reactions including allergic dermatitis in mammal including horse allergic diseases such as bite hypersensitivity, summer eczema and sweet itch in horses.\n\n\nTransplant rejection, including pancreas islet transplant rejection, bone marrow transplant rejection, graft-versus-host disease, organ and cell transplant rejection such as bone marrow, cartilage, cornea, heart, intervertebral disc, islet, kidney, limb, liver, lung, muscle, myoblast, nerve, pancreas, skin, small intestine, or trachea, and xeno transplantation; and\n\n\nAnother embodiment provides a method of inhibiting a JAK enzyme, including JAK-1, JAK-2; JAK-3 and/or Tyk-2, that includes contacting the JAK enzyme with either a non-therapeutic amount or a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the present compounds. Such methods can occur in vivo or in vitro. In vitro contact can involve a screening assay to determine the efficacy of the one or more compounds against a selected enzyme at various amounts or concentrations. In vivo contact with a therapeutically effective amount of the one or more compounds can involve treatment of a described disease, disorder or condition or prophylaxis of organ transplant rejection in the animal in which the contact occurs. The effect of the one or more compounds on the JAK enzyme and/or host animal can also be determined or measured. Methods for determining JAK activity include those described in the Examples as well as those disclosed in WO 99/65908, WO 99/65909, WO 01/42246. WO 02/00661, WO 02/096909, WO 2004/046112 or WO 2007/012953.\n\n\nThe following reaction schemes illustrate the general synthetic procedures of the compounds of the present invention. All starting materials are prepared by procedures described in these schemes or by procedures known to one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will be apparent to those skilled in the art that sensitive functional groups (Pg or Pg1) may need to be protected and deprotected during synthesis of a compound of the invention. This may be achieved by conventional methods, for example as described in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis” by TW Greene and PGM Wuts, John Wiley & Sons Inc (1999), and references therein.\n\n\nIn Scheme 1,4-Chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (a) can be obtained commercially. trans-4-(Methylamino)-cyclohexyl]methanol (b) may be obtained from the corresponding carboxylic acid, trans-4-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, upon treatment with a reducing agent such as lithium aluminium hydride in an aprotic, anhydrous solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at temperatures between 0-60° C. for several hours.\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme I, a compound of structure (c) can be synthesized by the reaction of 4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (a) with trans-4-(methylamino)-cyclohexyl]methanol (b) in a suitable aprotic, polar solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, aqueous dioxane and dimethylsulfoxide, in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine and potassium carbonate at elevated temperatures up to 90° C. for up to a few hours.\n\n\nA compound of structure (d) could be synthesized in a two step procedure from a compound of structure (c). For example, a compound of structure (d) would be synthesized by firstly using brominating reagents such as thionyl bromide or phosphorous tribromide in a polar, aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride to afford the unprotected cyclohexylmethylbromide, and secondly by addition of a suitable protecting reagent such as tosyl chloride to give the protected compound of structure (d).\n\n\nA compound of structure (e) can be prepared by using simple protection processes from a compound of structure (c). For example, when Pg and Pg\n1 \nare both tosyl, this can be effected in a one step reaction upon treatment of the unprotected compound of structure (c) with tosyl chloride in the presence of a polar, aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride, a catalyst such as DMAP and a weak base such as triethylamine.\n\n\nA compound of structure (f) may be synthesized from a compound of structure (e) by S-alkylation using a suitable nucleophile. Thus compounds of structure (e) wherein the protecting group (Pg\n1\n) is a suitable hydroxyl protecting group such as tosyl or mesyl may be reacted with potassium thioacetate in a polar solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide or N-methylpyrrolidine at elevated temperatures up to 75° C. for up to 2 hours to give compounds of structure (f).\n\n\nA compound of structure (g) may be synthesized by an oxidation procedure from compounds of formula (f). Many oxidizing conditions are known to those skilled in the art, for example those described in “Handbook of Reagents for Organic Synthesis—Oxidising and Reducing Agents” edited by S. D. Burke and R. L. Danheiser. For example, a compound of structure (f), optionally wetted with water, can be treated with formic acid followed by slow addition of hydrogen peroxide whilst stirring at room temperature for about 15 hours to give a compound of structure (g). Alternatively, oxone may be employed in a polar solvent such as acetic acid, if the reaction is performed in the presence of potassium acetate the potassium salt of the compound of formula (g) is produced.\n\n\nIt is envisaged that a compound of structure (g) may be synthesized directly from a compound of structure (e) upon treatment with a suitable sulfur nucleophile such as sodium sulfite in a polar solvent. Similarly, a compound of structure (g) could be synthesized from a compound of structure (d) upon nucleophilic substitution with sodium sulfite.\n\n\nTreatment of sulphonic acids of formula (g) with a chlorinating agent such as thionyl chloride in an aprotic, polar solvent such as methylene chloride with a polar cosolvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide at reflux gives the chlorinated compounds. The chlorinated compound then reacts in an aprotic, anhydrous solvent such as tetrahydrofuran with suitable amines in neat, gaseous form, or dissolved in an aprotic, anhydrous solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, at room temperature to produce a compound of structure (h). Optionally an anhydrous, weak base such as triethylamine may be used to mop up hydrochloric acid generated in the reaction.\n\n\nCompounds of formula I of the present invention may be prepared from compounds of formula (h) wherein Pg is a suitable protecting group by deprotection procedures known to one skilled in the art. For example, when the protecting group (Pg) is tosyl, suitable deprotection conditions involve reaction with a base such as lithium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide in a protic solvent such as methanol or isopropanol and optionally miscible cosolvents such as tetrahydrofuran and water at room temperature for several hours, to produce the deprotected amine of formula I.\n\n\nSalts of compounds of formula I may be formed by the reaction of the free base of compounds of formula I with a suitable acid such as maleic acid in the presence of a protic solvent such as butanol and optionally a cosolvent such as water.\n\n\nAlternatively, compounds of this invention can be prepared in accordance with Scheme II.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Scheme II, 4-methyl-7-[(4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl]-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (j) can be obtained from commercially available (a) using a protecting agent such as tosyl chloride using procedures well known in the art. trans-4-(Methylamino)-cyclohexyl]methanol (b) may be obtained from the corresponding carboxylic acid, trans-4-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, upon treatment with a reducing agent such as Vitride in an anhydrous solvent such as toluene at temperatures between 0-110° C. for several hours.\n\n\nAs shown in Scheme II, a compound of structure (k) can be synthesized by the reaction of 4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (j) with trans-4-(methylamino)-cyclohexyl]methanol (b) in a suitable solvent such as acetone, in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine with a catalytic amount of potassium iodide at elevated temperatures up to 60° C. for up to a few hours.\n\n\nA compound of structure (k) could synthesized by addition of a suitable mesylating reagent such as mesyl chloride in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine or diethylisopropylamine in a suitable solvent such as acetone at elevated temperatures up to 60° C. to give the methane sulfonyl compound of structure (k).\n\n\nA compound of structure (l) can be prepared by using simple S-alkylation processes from a compound of structure (k) using a suitable nucleophile. Thus compounds of structure (k) may be reacted with sodium sulphite in solvent such as isopropylalcohol or water or toluene at elevated temperatures up to 90° C. for up to 4 hours to give compounds of structure (l).\n\n\nTreatment of sulphonic acids of formula (I) with a chlorinating agent such as thionyl chloride in an aprotic, polar solvent such as THF or methylene chloride with a polar cosolvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide at temperatures between 0 and 40° C. gives the chlorinated compounds. The chlorinated compound then reacts in an aprotic, anhydrous solvent such as tetrahydrofuran with suitable amines such as methyl amine, cyclobutyl amine or 2-hydroxyazetidine preferably in neat, gaseous form, or dissolved in an aprotic, anhydrous solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, at room temperature to produce a compound of structure (h).

This variance can be due to test sample preparation, temperature, the particular model of X-ray diffractometer used, the operator's technique, etc. The term “approximately” if used in defining a peak in an X-ray powder diffraction pattern is defined as the stated 2θ value±0.2°2θ. Any determination of whether a crystalline form is the Form A polymorph and encompassed by the claims should be interpreted in light of the variability in this test.\n\n\nThis variability is demonstrated in \nFIG. 1\n.

Recombinant JAK-1 (GST-JAK-1 (852-1142)) and Tyk-2 (GST-Tyk2 (870-1187, C1187S)) used in this study were expressed and purified at Pfizer Laboratories. Adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) was obtained from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo. The JAKtide peptide (peptide sequence, FITC-KGGEEEEYFELVKK (SEQ ID NO:1)) used for the JAK-2 and JAK-3 assays and the IRS-1 peptide (peptide sequence, 5-FAM-KKSRGDYMTMQIG (SEQ ID NO:2)) used for the JAK-1 and Tyk-2 assays were purchased from (American Peptide Company, Sunnyvale, Calif.). Coating Reagent 3 was purchased from (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, Mass.).\n\n\nMethods: A peptide mobility shift assay was used to quantify the phosphorylation of the JAKtide (JAK-2 and JAK-3) or the IRS-1 peptide (JAK-1 and Tyk-2). Reactions were carried out in a 384-well plate (Matrical MP-101) in a 10 microliter total volume. Reaction mixtures contained 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.0005% Tween-20, ATP (4 micromolar for JAK-2 and JAK-3, 40 micromolar for JAK-1 and 7 micromolar for Tyk-2)), 2% DMSO and 1 micromolar peptide substrate (JAKtide for JAK-2 and JAK-3 or IRS-1 peptide for JAK-1 and Tyk-2). Compounds were diluted serially in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and tested in an 11 point dose response in duplicate or quadruplicate (200 n1 of compound/DMSO was added per 10 microliter reaction). The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the final concentration of 2 nM JAK-2, 1 nM JAK-3, 7 nM Tyk2 or 20 nM JAK-1. The assay was run for 240 minutes for JAK-1, 150 minutes for JAK-2, 90 minutes for JAK-3 and 60 minutes for Tyk-2. The assays were stopped at the specified times with 20 microliter of 140 mM HEPES, 22.5 mM EDTA and 0.15% Coating Reagent 3. The plates were placed on a LabChip 3000 (LC3000) instrument (Caliper Life Sciences) to measure the formation of phosphorylated peptide. Data was analyzed using Hits Well Analyzer Software from (Caliper Life Sciences) to obtain the amount of product formed.\n\n\nData was then imported into an internal application where each data point was expressed as % inhibition based on uninhibited and no enzyme controls.

Since T-cell activation can, in part, can be triggered by cytokines that signal through the JAK-STAT pathway, a JAK inhibitor could be effective against such diseases involving aberrant T-cell activation.\n\n\nMethods: Canine whole blood was collected in sodium heparin tubes from 29 beagle dogs and 23 mixed breed dogs. Whole blood (20 μL) was plated in 96-well plates (Costar 3598) with 180 μL of medium (RPMI 1640, Gibco #21870-076, with 1% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, Gibco #10082-39, 292 μg/ml L-glutamine, Gibco #250030-081, 100 u/ml penicillin and 100 μg streptomycin per ml, Gibco #15140-122) containing vehicle control or test compound (0.001 to 10 μM), concanavalin A (ConA; 1 μg/ml, Sigma C5275), and canine interleukin-2 (IL-2; 50 ng/ml, R&D Systems 1815-CL/CF). Wells containing whole blood, medium with vehicle control and no ConA or IL-2 were used as background controls. Plates were incubated at 37° C. for 48 hours. Tritiated thymidine, 0.4 μCi/well (Perkin Elmer, Net027A-005MC), was added for 20 additional hours. Plates were frozen and then thawed, washed and filtered using a Brandel MLR-96 cell harvester and prewet filter mats (Wallac 1205-401, Perkin Elmer). Filters were dried at 60° C. for one hour (Precision 16EG convection oven) and placed into filter sample bags (Wallac 1205-411, Perkin Elmer) with 10 mL of scintillant (Wallac 1205-440, Perkin Elmer). Sealed filters were counted on a LKB Wallac 1205 Betaplate liquid scintillation counter. Data were collected via Gterm Betaplate program v1.1 (Wallac copyright 1989-1990) and transformed into percent inhibition, calculated using the following formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n100\n \n-\n \n \n[\n \n \n \n \n(\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMean\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \nDrug\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \nTreatment\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \ncpm\n \n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMean\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \nBCK\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \ncpm\n \n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n(\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMean\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \nNon\n \n⁢\n \n \n-\n \n \n⁢\n \nDrug\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \nTreatment\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \ncpm\n \n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMean\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \nBCK\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \ncpm\n \n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n×\n \n100\n \n \n]\n \n \n \n=\n \n \n%\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \nInhibition\n \n \n \n \n \n\nData were graphically displayed as percent inhibition using GraphPad Prism 4.0, and IC\n50 \ncurves were fitted using a point to point analysis.\n\n\n\nResults The average IC\n50 \nvalues obtained when using whole blood from beagles was 66.3 nM for the compound of Example 1a; 410 nM for Example 2; and 83 nM for Example 3. The average IC\n50 \nvalue obtained when using whole blood from mixed breed dogs was 138 nM for the compound of Example 1a. These data suggest that the compounds of the present invention are effective in inhibiting T-cell proliferation, a key feature in many diseases.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nReducing Flea-Associated Pruritus and Dermatitis Assay\n\n\nFlea-associated pruritus and dermatitis are common skin conditions in dogs. Pruritus is one of the most severe clinical signs associated with flea associated dermatitis, and continued scratching, face rubbing, and foot chewing can lead to a variety of changes to the skin such as erythema, edema, alopecia, lichenification, and hyper pigmentation. Flea-associated pruritus and dermatitis can be induced experimentally. In these models, inflammatory cells and cytokines have been shown to mediate immune reactions to allergens. Therefore, a JAK inhibitor that inhibits signal transduction of pruritogenic and proinflammatory cytokine receptors could be effective in inhibiting, reducing or minimizing flea-associated pruritus and dermatitis.\n\n\nStudy Design\n\n\nTwenty eight male and female dogs of mixed breeds ranging in weight from 5-35 kg and greater than one year of age were infested with approximately 100 unfed adult cat fleas (\nCtenocephalides felis\n) 14 days prior to the start of dosing and reinfested with 30 fleas per dog every 4 days throughout the study. Seven days before dosing, twenty four dogs were randomized into three different treatment groups, placebo, 0.5 mg/kg or 0.25 mg/kg of the compound of Example 1b, based on visual analog scale (VAS) scores for skin lesions. Treatments were given orally twice a day for 28 days, and pruritic behavior as well as erythema and skin lesions were was assessed during the study. Pruritic behavior was recorded by placing dogs into pens with video recording capability, and recording their activity over 4 hours. Pruritic activity was quantitated by determining how many seconds the dogs spent scratching. Skin lesions were recorded by image capture of abdominal, inguinal region and the severity ranked according to a visual analog scale (VAS).\n\n\nStatistical Analysis:\n\n\nVideo captured elapsed time of pruritic behavior was analyzed using a mixed linear model for repeated measures. The model included fixed effects of treatment and day of study and the interaction of treatment and day of study. Random effects included block, the interaction of block and treatment and error. Baseline data for pruritic behavior (day−1) were used as covariate in the analysis of pruritic behavior. Least squares means were used as estimates of treatment means. Standard errors of least squares means were estimated and 90% confidence intervals were constructed. Geometric means were computed from the least squares means for log-transformed data. A priori contrasts were used to assess treatment. Treatment differences were assessed at the 1.0% level of significance (P≦0.10).\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe treatment results are shown in \nFIG. 2\n and \nFIG. 3\n. Lesions and erythema were significantly reduced in the 0.5 mg/kg group. \nFIG. 2\n illustrates \nDay\n 27 VAS Scores for Example 1b in flea allergic dogs (Least Squares Means). Significant reductions in pruritus as compared to placebo at a 10% level of significance were seen at various time points during the study for both groups (\n \ndays\n \n 1, 4 and 12 for the 0.25 mg/kg dose and on \ndays\n 1 and 20 for the 0.5 mg/kg dose). \nFIG. 3\n illustrates Seconds of Pruritus per 4 hour recording for example 1b in flea allergic dogs (Long Geometric Mean).\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nCell Proliferation Inhibitory Assay\n\n\nFeline Cell Lines The MYA-1 and FETJ are feline T-lymphoblast cell lines obtained from ATCC (Manassas, Va.). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 complete media supplemented with 10% FBS at 37° C. in a humidified incubator with 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\nEx Vivo Canine Lymphoma Nodal Tissue\n\n\nMalignant lymph nodes were excised by veterinary staff at Michigan State University (MSU) Veterinary College, placed into transport media (Advanced RPMI 1640 complete medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 ug/mL streptomycin and 0.25 ug/mL Amphotercin B (Invitrogen/Gibco®). Nodes were processed within 24 hours of removal by mincing into tiny pieces and passing through a tissue sieve. Cell suspensions were spun at 200×g, supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended in NH\n4\nCl for 10 minutes at room temperature. The cell suspension was pelleted by centrifugation; the NH\n4\nCl was removed and washed once with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), followed by re-suspension in Proliferation Medium (Advanced RPMI complete, 1% FBS, 50 nM 2-Mercaptoethanol, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 ug/mL streptomycin and 0.25 ug/mL Amphotercin B). The cell suspension was then passed through a 100 μm nylon cell strainer (BD-Falcon) and counted using a hemacytometer. Cells were cultured in either Proliferation Medium alone, Proliferation Medium supplemented with 0.005% Pansorbin® (Heat inactivated, formalin-fixed \nStaphylococcus Aureus \ncells (SAC), Calbiochem), and 10 ng/mL canine IL-2 (R&D Systems), or Proliferation Medium supplemented with 125 ng/mL concavalin A (Sigma) and 125 ng/mL lipopolysaccamide (LPS; Calbiochem).\n\n\nIn Vitro Anti-Proliferation Assay Method\n\n\nCells cultured in medium described above were plated in 96-well Costar plates (Corning) at a density of 1×10\n3 \ncells/well (feline cell lines) or 2×10\n5 \ncells/well (lymph node cells) and exposed to various concentrations of test compounds for up to 5 days at 37° C. in a humidified incubator with 5% CO\n2\n. Effects on proliferation were determined using the CellTiter 96® AQ\nueous \nNon-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. In general, proliferation was indirectly measured using a soluble tetrazolium salt (MTS) and an electron coupling agent. MTS bioreduction into a formazan product soluble in tissue culture medium was monitored by absorbance at 490 nM on a Spectramax plate reader using Softmax Pro 4.6 software (Molecular Devices). Data were graphically displayed as percent DMSO control using GraphPad Prism 4.00, and IC\n50 \ncurves were fitted using a non-linear regression model with a sigmoidal dose response.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nTable 4 demonstrates that the compound of Example 1 can inhibit proliferation of the feline lymphoid cell line MYA-1 that is dependent on IL-2 for proliferation, but not an IL-2 independent line (FETJ). The compound of formula IA or its salt can also inhibit proliferation of canine nodal tissue obtained from dogs diagnoses with T- or B-cell lymphoma. These results suggest a JAK inhibitor may be effective in treating canine and feline lymphomas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCell Line or\n\n\n \n\n\nStimulant in\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\n\n\nLymph Node\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nCulture Medium\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeline\n\n\nMYA-1\n\n\nLymphoid line\n\n\n \n\n\n122 (n = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeline\n\n\nFETj\n\n\nLymphoid line\n\n\n \n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanine\n\n\nMSU LN 8\n\n\nDe novo T-cell\n\n\nLPS + ConA\n\n\n357\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nlymphoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanine\n\n\nMSU LN 8\n\n\nDe novo T-cell\n\n\nSAC + IL-2\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nlymphoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanine\n\n\nMSU LN 9\n\n\nDe novo B-cell\n\n\nLPS + ConA\n\n\n147\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nlymphoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanine\n\n\nMSU LN 9\n\n\nDe novo B-cell\n\n\nSAC + IL-2\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nlymphoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCanine\n \n \nMSU LN\n \n 10\n\n\nChemotherapy\n\n\nLPS + ConA\n\n\n687\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nresistant B-cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nlymphoma-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanine\n\n\nMSU LN 11\n\n\nDe novo B-cell\n\n\nLPS + ConA\n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nlymphoma"
