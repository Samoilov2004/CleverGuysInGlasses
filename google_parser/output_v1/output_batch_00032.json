The content of this file is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThis invention relates generally to anti-VEGF selected polypeptide sequences and antibodies with beneficial properties foor research, therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nAngiogenesis and VEGF\n\n\nAngiogenesis is an important cellular event in which vascular endothelial cells proliferate, prune and reorganize to form new vessels from preexisting vascular networks. There are compelling evidences that the development of a vascular supply is essential for normal and pathological proliferative processes (Folkman and Klagsbrun (1987) \nScience \n235:442-447). Delivery of oxygen and nutrients, as well as the removal of catabolic products, represent rate-limiting steps in the majority of growth processes occurring in multicellular organisms. Thus, it has been generally assumed that the vascular compartment is necessary, albeit but not sufficient, not only for organ development and differentiation during embryogenesis, but also for wound healing and reproductive functions in the adult.\n\n\nAngiogenesis is also implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders, including but not limited to, proliferative retinopathies, age-related macular degeneration, tumors, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and psoriasis. Angiogenesis is a cascade of processes consisting of 1) degradation of the extracellular matrix of a local venue after the release of protease, 2) proliferation of capillary endothelial cells, and 3) migration of capillary tubules toward the angiogenic stimulus. Ferrara et al. (1992) Endocrine Rev. 13:18-32.\n\n\nIn view of the remarkable physiological and pathological importance of angiogenesis, much work has been dedicated to the elucidation of the factors capable of regulating this process. It is suggested that the angiogenesis process is regulated by a balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules, and is derailed in various diseases, especially cancer. Carmeliet and Jain (2000) Nature 407:249-257.\n\n\nVascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), a potent mitogen for vascular endothelial cells, has been reported as a pivotal regulator of both normal and abnormal angiogenesis. Ferrara and Davis-Smyth (1997) \nEndocrine Rev. \n18:4-25; Ferrara (1999) J. Mol. Med. 77:527-543. Compared to other growth factors that contribute to the processes of vascular formation, VEGF is unique in its high specificity for endothelial cells within the vascular system. Recent evidence indicates that VEGF is essential for embryonic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Carmeliet et al. (1996) \nNature \n380:435-439; Ferrara et al. (1996) \nNature \n380:439-442. Furthermore, VEGF is required for the cyclical blood vessel proliferation in the female reproductive tract and for bone growth and cartilage formation. Ferrara et al. (1998) \nNature Med. \n4:336-340; Gerber et al. (1999) \nNature \nMed. 5:623-628.\n\n\nIn addition to being an angiogenic factor in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, VEGF, as a pleiotropic growth factor, exhibits multiple biological effects in other physiological processes, such as endothelial cell survival, vessel permeability and vasodilation, monocyte chemotaxis and calcium influx. Ferrara and Davis-Smyth (1997), supra. Moreover, recent studies have reported mitogenic effects of VEGF on a few non-endothelial cell types, such as retinal pigment epithelial cells, pancreatic duct cells and Schwann cells. Guerrin et al. (1995) J. Cell Physiol. 164:385-394; Oberg-Welsh et al. (1997) Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 126:125-132; Sondell et al. (1999) J. Neurosci. 19:5731-5740.\n\n\nSubstantial evidence also implicates VEGF's critical role in the development of conditions or diseases that involve pathological angiogenesis. The VEGF mRNA is overexpressed by the majority of human tumors examined (Berkman et al. \nJ Clin Invest \n91:153-159 (1993); Brown et al. \nHuman Pathol. \n26:86-91 (1995); Brown et al. \nCancer Res. \n53:4727-4735 (1993); Mattern et al. \nBrit. J. Cancer. \n73:931-934 (1996); and Dvorak et al. \nAm J. Pathol. \n146:1029-1039 (1995)). Also, the concentration of VEGF in eye fluids are highly correlated to the presence of active proliferation of blood vessels in patients with diabetic and other ischemia-related retinopathies (Aiello et al. \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n331:1480-1487 (1994)). Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated the localization of VEGF in choroidal neovascular membranes in patients affected by AMD (Lopez et al. \nInvest. Ophtalmo. Vis. Sci. \n37:855-868 (1996)).\n\n\nThe recognition of VEGF as a primary regulator of angiogenesis in pathological conditions has led to numerous attempts to block VEGF activities. Inhibitory anti-VEGF receptor antibodies, soluble receptor constructs, antisense strategies, RNA aptamers against VEGF and low molecular weight VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors have all been proposed for use in interfering with VEGF signaling (Siemeister et al. \nCancer Metastasis Rev. \n17:241-248 (1998). Indeed, anti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies have been shown to suppress the growth of a variety of human tumor cell lines in nude mice (Kim et al. \nNature \n362:841-844 (1993); Warren et al. \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n95:1789-1797 (1995); Borgstrom et al. \nCancer Res. \n56:4032-4039 (1996); and Melnyk et al. \nCancer Res. \n56:921-924 (1996)) and also inhibit intraocular angiogenesis in models of ischemic retinal disorders (Adamis et al. \nArch. Ophthalmol. \n114:66-71 (1996)). Therefore, anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies or other inhibitors of VEGF action are promising candidates for the treatment of solid tumors and various intraocular neovascular disorders. Although the VEGF molecule is upregulated in tumor cells and its receptors are upregulated in tumor infiltrated vascular endothelial cells, the expression of VEGF and its receptors remain low in normal cells that are not associated with angiogenesis.\n\n\nTherapeutic Antibodies\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies can be manufactured using recombinant DNA technology. Widespread use has been made of monoclonal antibodies, particularly those derived from rodents; however, nonhuman antibodies are frequently antigenic in humans. The art has attempted to overcome this problem by constructing “chimeric” antibodies in which a nonhuman antigen-binding domain is coupled to a human constant domain (Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The isotype of the human constant domain may be selected to tailor the chimeric antibody for participation in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. In a further effort to resolve the antigen binding functions of antibodies and to minimize the use of heterologous sequences in human antibodies, humanized antibodies have been generated for various antigens in which substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted at regions by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. For example, rodent (CDR) residues have been substituted for the corresponding segments of a human antibody. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some complementarity determining region (CDR) residues and possibly some framework region (FR) residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534-1536 (1988).\n\n\nSeveral humanized anti-humanVEGF antibodies have been successfully generated, and have shown significant hVEGF-inhibitory activities both in vitro and in vivo. Presta et al. (1997) \nCancer Research \n57:4593-4599; Chen et al. (1999) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n293:865-881. One specific humanized anti-VEGF antibody, the Avastin™ antibody, is currently used in several clinical trials for treating various solid tumors; and another high-affinity variant of the humanized anti-VEGF antibody is currently clinically tested for treating choroidal neovascularization related age macular degeneration (AMD).\n\n\nPrior to administering a therapeutic antibody to human, preclinical studies in nonhuman mammals are generally desired to evaluate the efficacy and/or toxicity of the antibody. Ideally, the antibodies subject to these studies are capable of recognizing and reacting with high potency to a target antigen endogenous to the host animal such as mouse or nonhuman primate.\n\n\nPhage Display\n\n\nPhage display technology has provided a powerful tool for generating and selecting novel proteins that bind to a ligand, such as an antigen. Using the technique of phage display, large libraries of protein variants can be generated and rapidly sorted for those sequences that bind to a target antigen with high affinity. Nucleic acids encoding variant polypeptides are fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a viral coat protein, such as the gene III protein or the gene VIII protein. Monovalent phage display systems where the nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein or polypeptide is fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a portion of the gene III protein have been developed. (Bass, S., \nProteins, \n8:309 (1990); Lowman and Wells, \nMethods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology, \n3:205 (1991)). In a monovalent phage display system, the gene fusion is expressed at low levels and wild type gene III proteins are also expressed so that infectivity of the particles is retained. Methods of generating peptide libraries and screening those libraries have been disclosed in many patents (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,723,286, U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,018, U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,717, U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,908 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,530).\n\n\nThe demonstration of expression of peptides on the surface of filamentous phage and the expression of functional antibody fragments in the periplasm of \nE. coli \nwas important in the development of antibody phage display libraries. (Smith et al., \nScience \n(1985), 228:1315; Skerra and Pluckthun, Science (1988), 240:1038). Libraries of antibodies or antigen binding polypeptides have been prepared in a number of ways including by altering a single gene by inserting random DNA sequences or by cloning a family of related genes. Methods for displaying antibodies or antigen binding fragments using phage display have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,750,373, 5,733,743, 5,837,242, 5,969,108, 6,172,197, 5,580,717, and 5,658,727. The library is then screened for expression of antibodies or antigen binding proteins with desired characteristics.\n\n\nPhage display technology has several advantages over conventional hybridoma and recombinant methods for preparing antibodies with the desired characteristics. This technology allows the development of large libraries of antibodies with diverse sequences in less time and without the use of animals. Preparation of hybridomas or preparation of humanized antibodies can easily require several months of preparation. In addition, since no immunization is required, phage antibody libraries can be generated for antigens which are toxic or have low antigenicity (Hogenboom, Immunotechniques (1988), 4:1-20). Phage antibody libraries can also be used to generate and identify novel therapeutic antibodies.\n\n\nPhage display libraries have been used to generate human antibodies from immunized humans, non-immunized humans, germ line sequences, or naïve B cell Ig repertories (Barbas & Burton, Trends Biotech (1996), 14:230; Griffiths et al., EMBO J. (1994), 13:3245; Vaughan et al., Nat. Biotech. (1996), 14:309; Winter EP 0368 684 B1). Naïve, or nonimmune, antigen binding libraries have been generated using a variety of lymphoidal tissues. Some of these libraries are commercially available, such as those developed by Cambridge Antibody Technology and Morphosys (Vaughan et al. (1996) Nature Biotech 14:309; Knappik et al. (1999) J. Mol. Biol. 296:57). However, many of these libraries have limited diversity.\n\n\nThe ability to identify and isolate high affinity antibodies from a phage display library is important in isolating novel antibodies for therapeutic use. Isolation of high affinity antibodies from a library is dependent on the size of the library, the efficiency of production in bacterial cells and the diversity of the library. See, for e.g., Knappik et al., J. Mol. Biol. (1999), 296:57. The size of the library is decreased by inefficiency of production due to improper folding of the antibody or antigen binding protein and the presence of stop codons. Expression in bacterial cells can be inhibited if the antibody or antigen binding domain is not properly folded. Expression can be improved by mutating residues in turns at the surface of the variable/constant interface, or at selected CDR residues. (Deng et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1994), 269:9533, Ulrich et al., PNAS (1995), 92:11907-11911; Forsberg et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1997), 272:12430). The sequence of the framework region is a factor in providing for proper folding when antibody phage libraries are produced in bacterial cells.\n\n\nGenerating a diverse library of antibodies or antigen binding proteins is also important for isolation of high affinity antibodies. Libraries with diversification in limited CDRs have been generated using a variety of approaches. See, for e.g., Tomlinson, Nature Biotech. (2000), 18:989-994. CDR3 regions are of interest in part because they often are found to participate in antigen binding. CDR3 regions on the heavy chain vary greatly in size, sequence and structural conformation.\n\n\nOthers have also generated diversity by randomizing CDR regions of the variable heavy and light chains using all 20 amino acids at each position. It was thought that using all 20 amino acids would result in a large diversity of sequences of variant antibodies and increase the chance of identifying novel antibodies. (Barbas, PNAS 91:3809 (1994); Yelton, D E, \nJ. Immunology, \n155:1994 (1995); Jackson, J. R., \nJ. Immunology, \n154:3310 (1995) and Hawkins, R E, \nJ. Mol. Biology, \n226:889 (1992)).\n\n\nThere have also been attempts to create diversity by restricting the group of amino acid substitutions in some CDRs to reflect the amino acid distribution in naturally occurring antibodies. See, Garrard & Henner, \nGene \n(1993), 128:103; Knappik et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol\n. (1999), 296:57. However, these attempts have had varying success and have not been applied in a systematic and quantitative manner. Creating diversity in the CDR regions while minimizing the number of amino acid changes has been a challenge.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides novel antibodies and polypeptide sequences.

Also, contemplated is an antibody selected from the group consisting of a G6 series antibody, a B20 series antibody, YADS series antibody and a YS series antibody. Further, another antibody of this invention is an antibody comprising a variable region of any one of the antibodies of \nFIGS. 7\n, \n24\n-\n29\n and \n34\n-\n43\n.\n\n\nAccording to one preferred embodiment, the antibodies of this invention are synthesized by recombinant methods rather than produced directly from a hybridoma or derived from an antibody sequence from a hybridoma. In one preferred embodiment, the antibody binds to hVEGF with a Kd value of no more than about 2 nM, no more than about 1 nM, or no more than about 500 pM. According to one embodiment, the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. According to another embodiment, the antibody is a multi-specific antibody (e.g., a bispecific antibody).\n\n\nIn a further embodiment of the invention, the high affinity anti-hVEGF antibody is also capable of binding to a VEGF from a non-human mammal species with Kd values comparible to, or at least within ten-fold of, the Kd value for its hVEGF binding. Such antibodies with cross-species high binding affinities are particularly useful for preclinical research as well as diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Some of the antibodies intended for therapeutic use were generated using a target human antigen such as the immunogen. The resultant antibody may be “species-dependent”, i.e. while binding specifically to human antigen, it may be much less effective at binding a homologue of that antigen from a nonhuman mammal. This is found herein to be problematic, particularly where the nonhuman mammal is one in which preclinical studies of the antibody are to be carried out. An example is the anti-VEGF antibody, the Avastin™ antibody, used for treating cancers. While the Avastin™ antibody had a strong binding affinity for human VEGF (i.e. K\nd \n1.8 nM), the affinity for murine VEGF was unsuitable for conducting experiments in mouse models.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the antibodies are synthetic antibodies comprising at least one variant CDR in its variable domains, wherein the variant CDR comprises variant amino acid in at least one solvent accessible and highly diverse amino acid position, wherein the variant amino acid is encoded by a nonrandom codon set, and wherein at least 70% of the amino acids encoded by the nonrandom set are target amino acids for that position in known antibody variable domains. The antibody may have a heavy chain variable domain which comprises at least 1, 2 or 3 variant CDRs selected from the group consisting of CDR H1, H2 and H3. Preferably the heavy chain variable domain comprises a variant CDR H3. The antibody may also have a light chain variable domain which comprises at least 1, 2 or 3 variant CDRs selected from the group consisting of CDR L1, L2 and L3.\n\n\nAccording to another embodiment, an antibody of this invention binds human VEGF and a rodent VEGF with a desired affinity but does not bind to any one or all of the VEGF-related homologues selected from the group consisting of human VEGF-B, human VEGF-D, and human P1GF-2.\n\n\nAccording to one preferred embodiment, an antibody of this invention has a combination of three or more of any one of the above-mentioned embodiments. According to another embodiment, a Fab antibody of this invention is conjugated to an agent that will increase the half-life of the Fab antibody. According to one preferred embodiment, the agent is a polypeptide comprising the sequence DICLPRWGCLW (SEQ ID NO:929). In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of this invention do not bind to P1GF, VEGF-D or VEGF-B.\n\n\nThe invention also provide a method of selecting a hVEGF antibody from a library of synthetic antibodies comprising: a) generating the library of synthetic antibodies having a designed diversity in at least one of the CDRs; b) contacting the library with hVEGF to form binders; c) separating the binders from the nonbinders, and eluting the binders from the target hVEGF and incubating the binders in a solution with decreasing amounts of the target hVEGF in a concentration from about 0.1 nM to 1000 nM; and c) selecting the binders that can bind to the lowest concentration of the target VEGF and that have an affinity of about 500 pM to 2 nM.\n\n\nAlso contemplated are variants of the synthetic antibodies with improved binding affinities to hVEGF or to VEGF of non-human species, or both. Various forms of the antibody and variants thereof are contemplated herein. For example, the antibody mutant may be a full length antibody (e.g. having a human immunoglobulin constant region) or an antibody fragment (e.g. a Fab or F(ab′)\n2\n). Furthermore, the antibody mutant may be labeled with a detectable label, immobilized on a solid phase and/or conjugated with a heterologous compound (such as a cytotoxic agent).\n\n\nDiagnostic and therapeutic uses for the antibody are contemplated. In one diagnostic application, the invention provides a method for determining the presence of a protein of interest comprising exposing a sample suspected of containing the protein to the antibody mutant and determining binding of the antibody mutant to the sample. For this use, the invention provides a kit comprising the antibody mutant and instructions for using the antibody mutant to detect the protein.\n\n\nThe invention further provides: an isolated nucleic acid encoding the antibody; a vector comprising the nucleic acid, optionally, operably linked to control sequences recognized by a host cell transformed with the vector; a host cell transformed with the vector; a process for producing the antibody comprising culturing this host cell so that the nucleic acid is expressed and, optionally, recovering the antibody mutant from the host cell culture (e.g. from the host cell culture medium).\n\n\nThe invention also provides a composition comprising the antibody and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. This composition for therapeutic use is sterile and may be lyophilized. Also contemplated is the use of an antibody or polypeptide of this invention in the manufacture of a medicament for treating an indication described herein. The composition can further comprise a second therapeutic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, a cytotoxic agent or an anti-angiogenic agent.\n\n\nThe invention further provides a method for treating a mammal, comprising administering an effective amount of the antibody to the mammal. The mammal to be treated in the method may be a nonhuman mammal, e.g. a primate suitable for gathering preclinical data or a rodent (e.g., mouse or rat or rabbit). The nonhuman mammal may be healthy (e.g. in toxicology studies) or may be suffering from a disorder to be treated with the antibody of interest. In one embodiment, the mammal is suffering from or is at risk of developing abnormal angiogenesis (e.g., pathological angiogenesis). In one specific embodiment, the disorder is a cancer selected from the group consisting of colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), bronchoalveolar carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. In another embodiment, the disorder is a disease caused by ocular neovascularisation, e.g., diabetic blindness, retinopathies, primarily diabetic retinopathy, age-induced macular degeneration and rubeosis. In another embodiment, the mammal to be treated is suffering from or is at risk of developing an edema (e.g., an edema associated with brain tumors, an edema associated with stroke, or a cerebral edema). In another embodiment, the mammal is suffering from or at risk of developing a disorder or illness selected from the group consisting of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, refractory ascites, psoriasis, sarcoidosis, arterial arteriosclerosis, sepsis, burns and pancreatitis. According to another embodiment, the mammal is suffering from or is at risk of developing a genitourinary illness selected from the group consisting of polycystic ovarian disease (POD), endometriosis and uterine fibroids. The amount of antibody administered will be a therapeutically effective amount to treat the disorder. In dose escalation studies, a variety of doses of the antibody may be administered to the mammal. In another embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount of the antibody is administered to a human patient to treat a disorder in that patient. In one preferred embodiment, antibodies of this invention useful for treating inflammatory or immune diseases described herein (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) are Fab or scFv antibodies, especially Fab or scFv antibodies derived from the G6 series of antibodies or the B20 series of antibodies. Antibodies that do not cause aggregation of VEGF and do not aggregate themselves such as the B20 series of IgG antibodies are particularly useful in treating inflammatory and immune diseases. Accordingly, such antibodies are can be can be used in the manufacture of a medicament for treating an inflammatory or immune disease. A mammal that is suffering from or is at risk for developing a disorder or illness described herein can be treated by administering a second therapeutic agent, simultaneously, sequentially or in combination with, an antibody of this invention. It should be understood that other therapeutic agents, in addition to the second therapeutic agent, can be administered to the mammal or used in the manufacture of a medicament for the desired indications.\n\n\nThese antibodies and polypeptides can be used to understand the role of host stromal cell collaboration in the growth of implanted non-host tumors, such as in mouse models wherein human tumors have been implanted. These antibodies and polypeptides can be used in methods of identifying human tumors that can escape anti-VEGF treatment by observing or monitoring the growth of the tumor implanted into a rodent or rabbit after treatment with an anti-VEGF antibody of this invention. The antibodies and polypeptides of this invention can also be used to study and evaluate combination therapies with anti-VEGF antibodies of this invention and other therapeutic agents. The antibodies and polypeptides of this invention can be used to study the role of VEGF in other diseases by administering the antibodies or polypeptides to an animal suffering from a similar disease and determining whether one or more symptoms of the disease are alleviated.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n is a schematic illustration of various types of antibody fragments useful for phage display.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n compares residue changes within heavy chain CDRs of the template antibody h4D5 and the four selected novel synthetic antibodies (SEQ ID NO: 921-928). Also compared are VEGF bindings of the four antibodies.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 3\n A and B depict the abilities of VEGF receptors (Flt1-d2 and KDR) to block VEGF bindings of the novel anti-VEGF antibodies. Y0959A, an anti-VEGF variant, was used as a control.\n\n\n \nFIG. 4\n shows that the G6 antibody specifically binds to both hVEGF and mVEGF, but not to VEGF-related antigens.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 5\n A and B show that G6 can effectively block both hVEGF and mVEGF binding to the KDR receptor. Fab-12 and Y0317 were used as controls.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 6\n A, B, and C show effects of G6 on VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 7\n A and B illustrate steps of generating high affinity anti-VEGF antibodies and the list of residues and binding affinities related to various affinity-improved G6 variants (SEQ ID NO: 44-84).\n\n\n \nFIGS. 8\n A, B, and C compare VEGF bindings of G6, G6-23 and Fab-12. Association rates (on-rate) to both hVEGF and mVEGF were measured over time; the calculated Kon, Koff and Kd are listed.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 9\n A and B compare VEGF binding on-rates of G6 and further improved variants of G6-23.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 10\n A and B depict effects of VEGF antagonists (G6-23 and Flt1-3Fc) on neonate mice body weights and survival rates.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 11A\n and B depict effects of G6-23 on tumor growth in nude mice with xenografted human tumor cells (KM12 cells and SW480 cells), as measured by tumor volumes over number of treatment days.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 12\n A and B show VEGF expressions (both hVEGF and mVEGF) in KM12 xenograft mice in the presence or absence of G6-23.\n\n\n \nFIG. 13\n depicts effects of VEGF antagonists (G6-23 and Flt1-3Fc) on tumor growth in nude mice with xenografted mouse tumor (LL2), as measured by tumor volumes over number of treatment days.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 14A\n and B describe codons designed for shotgun scanning codons of G6 and G6-23. For each scan, degenerate shotgun codons for (A) heavy and (B) light chain were designed to encode the wild-type amino acid and alanine (ml) in alanine-scan or similar amino acid (m4) in homolog-scan for both G6 and G6-23 Fab. The shotgun codons are represented by the IUB code (K=G/T, M=A/C, R=A/G, S=G/C, V=A/C/G, W=A/T, Y=C/T). More substitutions (m2, m3, and m5) occurred in some residues due to the nature of the genetic code. In the case of wild-type alanine, the shotgun codon was designed to encode alanine and glycine. Each residue on CDRs is denoted by the single-letter code for amino acid, followed by a number denoting its position according to the scheme of Kabat et al., 1987. Positions where the sequences of G6 and G6-23 differ were shown in two letters, e.g. Q89K denotes \nposition\n 89 which is Gln or Lys in G6 or G6-23, respectively. Asterisks(*) indicate both alanine- and homolog-scan codons encode a common substitution.\n\n\n \nFIG. 15\n provides information regarding the construction of G6 and G6-23 shotgun scanning libraries. The shotgun scanning libraries were performed to mutate codons for the indicated residues on the heavy (hc) or light (1c) chain of G6 and G6-23 with either alanine- or homolog-scan shotgun codons (\nFIGS. 14A\n and B). In total, eight libraries were constructed using the mutagenic oligonucleotides as shown in Example 1. The theoretical diversity of each library and total numbers of amino acid combinations encoded by the mutagenic oligonucleotides, were exceeded at least 100-fold by the actual diversity of the constructed library.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 16A\n and B describe the results of the G6 and G6-23 heavy chain shotgun scan. The effect of each mutation (\nFIGS. 14A\n and B) on the heavy chain CDR residues of (A) G6 and (B) G6-23 was evaluated by calculating wt/mut ratios from sequences of functional clones, either from the alanine-scan libraries (m1, m2, and m3) or the homolog-scan libraries (m4 and m5), isolated after binding selection to either hVEGF (target selection) or an anti-gD tag antibody (display selection). To provide a quantitative estimate of the effect of each mutation on the binding affinity of G6 and G6-23 for hVEGF, the function ratio (Fwt/mut) at each mutation site was derived from dividing the wt/mut ratio from target selection by that from display selection. Deleterious effects are indicated by Fwt/mut values greater than 1.0, and mutations that result in significantly deleterious effects (Fwt/mut >10) are shown in bold text. Several mutations were not observed amongst the target selection and only a lower limit could be defined for its wt/mut ratio; therefore, the Fwt/mut value was indicated as a greater sign.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 17A\n and B describe the results of the G6 and G6-23 light chain shotgun scan. The effect of each mutation (\nFIGS. 14A\n and B) on the light chain CDR residues of (A) G6 and (B) G6-23 was evaluated by calculating wt/mut ratios from sequences of functional clones, either from the alanine-scan libraries (m1, m2, and m3) or the homolog-scan libraries (m4 and m5), isolated after binding selection to either hVEGF (target selection) or an anti-gD tag antibody (display selection). To provide a quantitative estimate of the effect of each mutation on the binding affinity of G6 and G6-23 for hVEGF, the function ratio (Fwt/mut) at each mutation site was derived from dividing the wt/mut ratio from target selection by that from display selection. Deleterious effects are indicated by Fwt/mut values greater than 1.0, and mutations that result in significantly deleterious effects (Fwt/mut >10) are shown in bold text.\n\n\n \nFIG. 18\n is a comparison of relative binding activities for FabG6 and G6-23 point mutants to hVEGF with function values (Fwt/mut) from shotgun scanning. The relative binding activities of each mutant protein to hVEGF were evaluated with IC50, mut/IC50,wt ratio, a measure of the fold reduction in hVEGF binding activity due to each point mutation. The IC50,wt values for G6 and G6-23 are 2.5 nM and 20 pM respectively. The ratio without showing the standard error is estimated the error is ±5%. The ratios of significantly deleterious mutations could not be precisely quantitated because no inhibition was observed at the highest concentration of hVEGF (1 uM and 0.1 uM for G6 and G6-23 respectively) used in the assay and were only shown as a lower limit (>400 and >5000 for G6 and G6-23 mutants respectively) for fold reduction in hVEGF binding. The function values (Fwt/mut) of shotgun scanning were from \nFIGS. 16 and 17\n. DDGmut-wt values for both mutagenesis scanning were calculated using the equation as indicated in the legend of \nFIGS. 22A\n and B.\n\n\n \nFIG. 19\n describes the relative binding affinities as measured by phage ELISAs for phage-derived hVEGF\n1-109 \nsingle alanine mutant to bind different versions of anti-hVEGF antibodies or hVEGF receptors (G6, G6-23, and B20-4 Fabs, monoclonal antibody A4.6.1 and receptors Flt-1 (1-3), Flt-1\nD2 \nand KDR-1 g, respectively). The effects of phage-derived single alanine mutants of hVEGF on the binding affinity of anti-hVEGF antibody and hVEGF receptor were assessed as the relative IC50 values, which are calculated as IC\n50, ala\n/ID\n50,wt \nfrom phage ELISAs. A number greater than 1.0 indicated reduction in binding affinity and any variant with significant relative IC50 values greater than 10 was highlighted as bold text. The IC\n50,wt \nvalues for G6 and G6-23 are 2.5 nM and 20 pM respectively. The ratio without showing the standard error is estimated that the average error is +/−5%. Because phage ELISAs required substantial binding of the mutant phagemid to its protein target to generate a measurable signal, non-binders (NB) could not be precisely quantitated but may be interpreted to have a greatly reduced binding affinity (greater than 1000 IC50 value).

Definitions\n\n\nThe term “antibody” is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. A “G6 series polypeptide” according to this invention is a polypeptide, including an antibody according to this invention, that is derived from a sequence of a G6 antibody or G6-derived antibody according to any one of \nFIGS. 7\n, \n24\n-\n26\n and \n34\n-\n35\n and binds to human VEGF with a desired affinity according to this invention (e.g., 10 nm or less, 2 nM or less, 1 nM or less, 0.1 nM or less, 500 pM or less for the Fab version of the antibody at 25° C.). A “B20 series polypeptide” according to this invention is a polypeptide, including an antibody according to this invention, that is derived from a sequence of the B20 antibody or a B20-derived antibody according to any one of \nFIGS. 27-29\n and binds to VEGF with a desired affinity according to this invention. A “YADS series polypeptide” or “YADS polypeptide” according to this invention is a polypeptide, including an antibody according to this invention, that is derived from a sequence of the YADS antibody according to any one of \nFIGS. 36-40\n and binds to VEGF with a desired affinity according to this invention. A “YADS-2 series polypeptide” or “YADS2 polypeptide” according to this invention is a polypeptide, including an antibody according to this invention, that is derived from a sequence of the YADS2 antibody according to \nFIG. 36\n or \nFIG. 39\n \nand \nbinds to VEGF with a desired affinity according to this invention. A “YADS-3 series polypeptide” or “YADS3 polypeptide” according to this invention is a polypeptide, including an antibody according to this invention, that is derived from a sequence of the YADS3 antibody according to \nFIG. 36\n or \nFIG. 39\n and binds to VEGF with a desired affinity according to this invention. “YS series polypeptide” or “YS polypeptide” according to this invention is a polypeptide, including an antibody according to this invention, that is derived from a sequence of a YS antibody according to \nFIGS. 41-43\n and binds to VEGF with a desired affinity according to this invention. According to one preferred embodiment, the G series polypeptide, B20 series polypeptide, the YADS series polypeptide, the YADS2 series polypeptide, the YADS3 series polypeptide or the YS series polypeptide binds to human and a non-human mammalian VEGF with a Kd value that is within 10 fold of each other. According to one embodiment, the kD values for those antibodies binding to human VEGF and a mouse VEGF are 10 nM or less. In another embodiment, the antibodies bind to human VEGF and mouse VEGF with Kd values of 2 nM or less. In another embodiment, the antibodies bind to human VEGF with Kd values of 1 nM or less. The affinities of such G6 series, B20 series, YADS and YS series polypeptides for VEGF can be improved by methods, e.g., such as the phage display techniques taught herein.\n\n\nAs used herein, “antibody variable domain” refers to the portions of the light and heavy chains of antibody molecules that include amino acid sequences of Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs; ie., CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3), and Framework Regions (FRs). V\nH \nrefers to the variable domain of the heavy chain. V\nL \nrefers to the variable domain of the light chain. According to the methods used in this invention, the amino acid positions assigned to CDRs and FRs may be defined according to Kabat (Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1987 and 1991)). Amino acid numbering of antibodies or antigen binding fragments is also according to that of Kabat.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “Complementarity Determining Regions” (CDRs; i.e., CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3) refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody variable domain the presence of which are necessary for antigen binding. Each variable domain typically has three CDR regions identified as CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3. Each complementarity determining region may comprise amino acid residues from a “complementarity determining region” as defined by Kabat (i.e. about residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)) and/or those residues from a “hypervariable loop” (i.e. about residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk. \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901-917 (1987)). In some instances, a complementarity determining region can include amino acids from both a CDR region defined according to Kabat and a hypervariable loop. For example, the CDRH1 of the heavy chain of antibody 4D5 includes \namino acids\n 26 to 35.\n\n\n“Framework regions” (hereinafter FR) are those variable domain residues other than the CDR residues. Each variable domain typically has four FRs identified as FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4. If the CDRs are defined according to Kabat, the light chain FR residues are positioned at about residues 1-23 (LCFR1), 35-49 (LCFR2), 57-88 (LCFR3), and 98-107 (LCFR4) and the heavy chain FR residues are positioned about at residues 1-30 (HCFR1), 36-49 (HCFR2), 66-94 (HCFR3), and 103-113 (HCFR4) in the heavy chain residues. If the CDRs comprise amino acid residues from hypervariable loops, the light chain FR residues are positioned about at residues 1-25 (LCFR1), 33-49 (LCFR2), 53-90 (LCFR3), and 97-107 (LCFR4) in the light chain and the heavy chain FR residues are positioned about at residues 1-25 (HCFR1), 33-52 (HCFR2), 56-95 (HCFR3), and 102-113 (HCFR4) in the heavy chain residues. In some instances, when the CDR comprises amino acids from both a CDR as defined by Kabat and those of a hypervariable loop, the FR residues will be adjusted accordingly. For example, when CDRH1 includes amino acids H26-H35, the heavy chain FR1 residues are at positions 1-25 and the FR2 residues are at positions 36-49.\n\n\nAs used herein, “codon set” refers to a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids. A set of oligonucleotides can be synthesized, for example, by solid phase synthesis, including sequences that represent all possible combinations of nucleotide triplets provided by the codon set and that will encode the desired group of amino acids. A standard form of codon designation is that of the IUB code, which is known in the art and described herein. A codon set typically is represented by 3 capital letters in italics, eg. NNK, NNS, XYZ, DVK and the like. A “non-random codon set”, as used herein, thus refers to a codon set that encodes select amino acids that fulfill partially, preferably completely, the criteria for amino acid selection as described herein. Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide “degeneracy” at certain positions is well known in that art, for example the TRIM approach (Knappek et al.; J. Mol. Biol. (1999), 296:57-86); Garrard & Henner, Gene (1993), 128:103). Such sets of oligonucleotides having certain codon sets can be synthesized using commercial nucleic acid synthesizers (available from, for example, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.), or can be obtained commercially (for example, from Life Technologies, Rockville, Md.). Therefore, a set of oligonucleotides synthesized having a particular codon set will typically include a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences, the differences established by the codon set within the overall sequence. Oligonucleotides, as used according to the invention, have sequences that allow for hybridization to a variable domain nucleic acid template and also can, but does not necessarily, include restriction enzyme sites useful for, for example, cloning purposes.\n\n\nAn “Fv” fragment is an antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight association, which can be covalent in nature, for example in scFv. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the V\nH\n-V\nL \ndimer. Collectively, the six CDRs or a subset thereof confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although usually at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\nThe “Fab” fragment contains a variable and constant domain of the light chain and a variable domain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. F(ab′)\n2 \nantibody fragments comprise a pair of Fab fragments which are generally covalently linked near their carboxy termini by hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known in the art.\n\n\n“Single-chain Fv” or “scFv” antibody fragments comprise the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains, which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv, see Pluckthun in \nThe Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies\n, \nVol\n 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).\n\n\nThe term “diabodies” refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) in the same polypeptide chain (V\nH \nand V\nL\n). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n90:6444-6448 (1993).\n\n\nThe expression “linear antibodies” refers to the antibodies described in Zapata et al., \nProtein Eng., \n8(10):1057-1062 (1995). Briefly, these antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (V\nH\n-C\nH\n1-V\nH\n-C\nH\n1) which, together with complementary light chain polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific.\n\n\nThe term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., \nNature \n256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The “monoclonal antibodies” may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., \nNature \n352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222:581-597 (1991), for example.\n\n\nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81:6851-6855 (1984)).\n\n\n“Humanized” forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al., \nNature \n321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., \nNature \n332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, \nCurr. Op. Struct. Biol. \n2:593-596 (1992).\n\n\nA “species-dependent antibody” is one which has a stronger binding affinity for an antigen from a first mammalian species than it has for a homologue of that antigen from a second mammalian species. Normally, the species-dependent antibody “binds specifically” to a human antigen (i.e. has a binding affinity (K\nd\n) value of no more than about 1×10\n−7\nM, preferably no more than about 1×10\n−8 \nM and most preferably no more than about 1×10\n−9 \nM) but has a binding affinity for a homologue of the antigen from a second nonhuman mammalian species which is at least about 50 fold, or at least about 500 fold, or at least about 1000 fold, weaker than its binding affinity for the human antigen. The species-dependent antibody can be any of the various types of antibodies as defined above, but preferably is a humanized or human antibody.\n\n\nAs used herein, “antibody mutant” or “antibody variant” refers to an amino acid sequence variant of the species-dependent antibody wherein one or more of the amino acid residues of the species-dependent antibody have been modified. Such mutants necessarily have less than 100% sequence identity or similarity with the species-dependent antibody. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody mutant will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain of the species-dependent antibody, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or similarity with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical (i.e same residue) or similar (i.e. amino acid residue from the same group based on common side-chain properties, see below) with the species-dependent antibody residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence outside of the variable domain shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or similarity.\n\n\nTo increase the half-life of the antibodies or polypeptide containing the amino acid sequences of this invention, one can attach a salvage receptor binding epitope to the antibody (especially an antibody fragment), as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277. For example, a nucleic acid molecule encoding the salvage receptor binding epitope can be linked in frame to a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide sequence of this invention so that the fusion protein expressed by the engineered nucleic acid molecule comprises the salvage receptor binding epitope and a polypeptide sequence of this invention. As used herein, the term “salvage receptor binding epitope” refers to an epitope of the Fe region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, or IgG\n4\n) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the IgG molecule (e.g., Ghetie, V et al., (2000) \nAnn. Rev. Immunol. \n18:739-766, Table 1). Antibodies with substitutions in an Fc region thereof and increased serum half-lives are also described in WO00/42072 (Presta, L.), WO 02/060919; Shields, R. L., et al., (2001) \nJBC \n276(9):6591-6604; Hinton, P. R., (2004) \nJBC \n279(8):6213-6216). In another embodiment, the serum half-life can also be increased, for example, by attaching other polypeptide sequences. For example, antibodies of this invention or other polypeptide containing the amino acid sequences of this invention can be attached to serum albumin or a portion of serum albumin that binds to the FcRn receptor or a serum albumin binding peptide so that serum albumin binds to the antibody or polypeptide, e.g., such polypeptide sequences are disclosed in WO01/45746. In one preferred embodiment, the serum albumin peptide to be attached comprises an amino acid sequence of DICLPRWGCLW. In another embodiment, the half-life of a Fab according to this invention is increased by these methods. See also, Dennis, M.

Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\nAn “angiogenic factor or agent” is a growth factor which stimulates the development of blood vessels, e.g., promote angiogenesis, endothelial cell growth, stabiliy of blood vessels, and/or vasculogenesis, etc. For example, angiogenic factors include, but are not limited to, e.g., VEGF and members of the VEGF family, P1GF, PDGF family, fibroblast growth factor family (FGFs), TIE ligands (Angiopoietins), ephrins, Del-1, fibroblast growth factors: acidic (aFGF) and basic (bFGF), Follistatin, Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/scatter factor (SF), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Leptin, Midkine, Placental growth factor, Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), Platelet-derived growth factor, especially PDGF-BB or PDGFR-beta, Pleiotrophin (PTN), Progranulin, Proliferin, Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/vascular permeability factor (VPF), etc. It would also include factors that accelerate wound healing, such as growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), VIGF, epidermal growth factor (EGF), CTGF and members of its family, and TGF-alpha and TGF-beta. See, e.g., Klagsbrun and D'Amore, \nAnnu. Rev. Physiol., \n53:217-39 (1991); Streit and Detmar, \nOncogene, \n22:3172-3179 (2003); Ferrara & Alitalo, \nNature Medicine \n5(12):1359-1364 (1999); Tonini et al., \nOncogene, \n22:6549-6556 (2003) (e.g., Table 1 listing known angiogenic factors); and, Sato \nInt. J. Clin. Oncol., \n8:200-206 (2003).\n\n\nAn “anti-angiogenesis agent” or “angiogenesis inhibitor” refers to a small molecular weight substance, a polynucleotide, a polypeptide, an isolated protein, a recombinant protein, an antibody, or conjugates or fusion proteins thereof, that inhibits angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, or undesirable vascular permeability, either directly or indirectly. It should be understood that the anti-angiogenesis agent includes those agents that bind and block the angiogenic activity of the angiogenic factor or its receptor. For example, an anti-angiogenesis agent is an antibody or other antagonist to an angiogenic agent as defined above, e.g., antibodies to VEGF-A or to the VEGF-A receptor (e.g., KDR receptor or Flt-1 receptor), anti-PDGFR inhibitors such as Gleevec™ (Imatinib Mesylate). Anti-angiogensis agents also include native angiogenesis inhibitors, e.g., angiostatin, endostatin, etc. See, e.g., Klagsbrun and D'Amore, \nAnnu. Rev. Physiol., \n53:217-39 (1991); Streit and Detmar, \nOncogene, \n22:3172-3179 (2003) (e.g., Table 3 listing anti-angiogenic therapy in malignant melanoma); Ferrara & Alitalo, Nature Medicine 5(12):1359-1364 (1999); Tonini et al., \nOncogene, \n22:6549-6556 (2003) (e.g., Table 2 listing known antiangiogenic factors); and Sato \nInt. J. Clin. Oncol., \n8:200-206 (2003) (e.g., Table 1 lists anti-angiogenic agents used in clinical trials).\n\n\nThe “Kd” or “Kd value” according to this invention is in one preferred embodiment measured by a radiolabeled VEGF binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of the antibody and a VEGF molecule as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for VEGF by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (\n125\nI)-labeled VEGF(109) in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled VEGF, then capturing bound VEGF with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (Chen, et al., (1999) \nJ. Mol Biol \n293:865-881). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 ug/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23° C.). In a non-adsorbant plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [\n125\nI]VEGF(109) are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest, e.g., Fab-12 (Presta et al., (1997) \nCancer Res. \n57:4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for 65 hours to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature for one hour. The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates had dried, 150 ul/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25° C. with immobilized hVEGF (8-109) CM5 chips at ˜10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N′(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Human VEGF is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5 ug/ml (˜0.2 uM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 ul/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of human VEGF, 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25° C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 ul/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999) \nJ. Mol Biol \n293:865-881. If the on-rate exceeds 10\n6 \nM\n−1\nS\n−1 \nby the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25° C. of a 20 nM anti-VEGF antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of human VEGF short form (8-109) or mouse VEGF as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.\n\n\nAn “on-rate” or “rate of association” or “association rate” or “k\non\n” according to this invention is preferably determined with same surface plasmon resonance technique described above using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25° C. with immobilized hVEGF (8-109) CM5 chips at ˜10 response units (RU).

However, if the on-rate exceeds 10\n6 \nM\n−1 \nS\n−1 \nby the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate is preferably determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25° C. of a 20 nM anti-VEGF antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of human short form (8-109) or mouse VEGF as measured in a a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.\n\n\nA “functional epitope” according to this invention refers to amino acid residues of an antigen that contribute energetically to the binding of an antibody. Mutation of any one of the energetically contributing residues of the antigen (for example, mutation of wild-type VEGF by alanine or homolog mutation) will disrupt the binding of the antibody such that the relative affinity ratio (IC50mutant VEGF/IC50wild-type VEGF) of the antibody will be greater than 5 (see Example 2). In a preferred embodiment, the relative affinity ratio is determined by a solution binding phage displaying ELISA. Briefly, 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates (NUNC) are coated overnight at 4° C. with an Fab form of the antibody to be tested at a concentration of 2 ug/ml in PBS, and blocked with PBS, 0.5% BSA, and 0.05% Tween20 (PBT) for 2 h at room temperature. Serial dilutions of phage displaying hVEGF alanine point mutants (residues 8-109 form) or wild type hVEGF (8-109) in PBT are first incubated on the Fab-coated plates for 15 min at room temperature, and the plates are washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween20 (PBST). The bound phage is detected with an anti-M13 monoclonal antibody horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia) conjugate diluted 1:5000 in PBT, developed with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Kirkegaard & Perry Labs, Gaithersburg, Md.) substrate for approximately 5 min, quenched with 1.0 M H\n3\nPO\n4\n, and read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. The ratio of IC50 values (IC50,ala/IC50,wt) represents the fold of reduction in binding affinity (the relative binding affinity).\n\n\nFor competitive binding assays, Maxisorb plates are coated and blocked as above, and serial threefold dilutions of unlabeled VEGF(109) are made in PBS/Tween buffer in a Nunc plate. [\n125\nI]VEGF(109) is added, followed by addition of a fixed concentration of the Fab of interest. The final concentrations of the Fab of interest are 100 pM and 10 pM, respectively. After incubation (as above), bound VEGF is captured and quantified as described above. The binding data is analyzed using a computer program to perform Scatchard analysis (P. Munson et al., \nAnal. Biochem. \n(1980) 107:220-239) for determination of the dissociation binding constants, K\nd\n.\n\n\nAs used herein, “library” refers to a plurality of antibody or antibody fragment sequences (for example, polypeptides of the invention), or the nucleic acids that encode these sequences, the sequences being different in the combination of variant amino acids that are introduced into these sequences according to the methods of the invention.\n\n\n“Phage display” is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to at least a portion of coat protein on the surface of phage, e.g., filamentous phage, particles. A utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of randomized protein variants can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target antigen with high affinity. Display of peptide and protein libraries on phage has been used for screening millions of polypeptides for ones with specific binding properties. Polyvalent phage display methods have been used for displaying small random peptides and small proteins through fusions to either gene III or gene VIII of filamentous phage. Wells and Lowman, \nCurr. Opin. Struct. Biol., \n3:355-362 (1992), and references cited therein. In a monovalent phage display, a protein or peptide library is fused to a gene III or a portion thereof, and expressed at low levels in the presence of wild type gene III protein so that phage particles display one copy or none of the fusion proteins. Avidity effects are reduced relative to polyvalent phage so that sorting is on the basis of intrinsic ligand affinity, and phagemid vectors are used, which simplify DNA manipulations. Lowman and Wells, \nMethods: A companion to Methods in Enzymology, \n3:205-216 (1991).\n\n\nA “phagemid” is a plasmid vector having a bacterial origin of replication, e.g., Co1E1, and a copy of an intergenic region of a bacteriophage. The phagemid may be used on any known bacteriophage, including filamentous bacteriophage and lambdoid bacteriophage. The plasmid will also generally contain a selectable marker for antibiotic resistance. Segments of DNA cloned into these vectors can be propagated as plasmids. When cells harboring these vectors are provided with all genes necessary for the production of phage particles, the mode of replication of the plasmid changes to rolling circle replication to generate copies of one strand of the plasmid DNA and package phage particles. The phagemid may form infectious or non-infectious phage particles. This term includes phagemids which contain a phage coat protein gene or fragment thereof linked to a heterologous polypeptide gene as a gene fusion such that the heterologous polypeptide is displayed on the surface of the phage particle.\n\n\nThe term “phage vector” means a double stranded replicative form of a bacteriophage containing a heterologous gene and capable of replication. The phage vector has a phage origin of replication allowing phage replication and phage particle formation. The phage is preferably a filamentous bacteriophage, such as an M13, fl, fd, Pf3 phage or a derivative thereof, or a lambdoid phage, such as \nlambda\n 21, phi80, phi81, 82, 424, 434, etc., or a derivative thereof.\n\n\nAs used herein, “solvent accessible position” refers to a position of an amino acid residue in the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of a source antibody or antigen binding fragment that is determined, based on structure, ensemble of structures and/or modeled structure of the antibody or antigen binding fragment, as potentially available for solvent access and/or contact with a molecule, such as an antibody-specific antigen. These positions are typically found in the CDRs and on the exterior of the protein. The solvent accessible positions of an antibody or antigen binding fragment, as defined herein, can be determined using any of a number of algorithms known in the art. Preferably, solvent accessible positions are determined using coordinates from a 3-dimensional model of an antibody, preferably using a computer program such as the InsightII program (Accelrys, San Diego, Calif.). Solvent accessible positions can also be determined using algorithms known in the art (e.g., Lee and Richards, J. Mol. Biol. 55, 379 (1971) and Connolly, J. Appl. Cryst. 16, 548 (1983)). Determination of solvent accessible positions can be performed using software suitable for protein modeling and 3-dimensional structural information obtained from an antibody. Software that can be utilized for these purposes includes SYBYL Biopolymer Module software (Tripos Associates). Generally and preferably, where an algorithm (program) requires a user input size parameter, the “size” of a probe which is used in the calculation is set at about 1.4 Angstrom or smaller in radius. In addition, determination of solvent accessible regions and area methods using software for personal computers has been described by Pacios ((1994) “ARVOMOL/CONTOUR: molecular surface areas and volumes on Personal Computers.” Comput. Chem. 18(4): 377-386; and (1995). “Variations of Surface Areas and Volumes in Distinct Molecular Surfaces of Biomolecules.” \nJ. Mol. Model. \n1: 46-53.)\n\n\n“Treatment” refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those in which the disorder is to be prevented.\n\n\nA “disorder” is any condition that would benefit from treatment with the antibody. For example, mammals who suffer from or need prophylaxis against abnormal angiogenesis (excessive, inappropriate or uncontrolled angiogenesis) or vascular permeability. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples of disorders to be treated herein include malignant and benign tumors; non-leukemias and lymphoid malignancies; neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic and other glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal and blastocoelic disorders; and inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic disorders.\n\n\nThe term abnormal angiogenesis occurs when new blood vessels either grow excessively, insufficiently or inappropriately (e.g., the location, timing or onset of the angiogenesis being undesired from a medical standpoint) in a diseased state or such that it causes a diseased state. Excessive, inappropriate or uncontrolled angiogenesis occurs when there is new blood vessel growth that contributes to the worsening of the diseased state or causes a diseased state, such as in cancer, especially vascularized solid tumors and metastatic tumors (including colon, lung cancer (especially small-cell lung cancer), or prostate cancer), diseases caused by ocular neovascularisation, especially diabetic blindness, retinopathies, primarily diabetic retinopathy or age-induced macular degeneration and rubeosis; psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, haemangioblastoma such as haemangioma; inflammatory renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, especially mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, diabetic nephropathy or hypertensive nephrosclerosis; various imflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, especially rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psorsasis, sarcoidosis, arterial arteriosclerosis and diseases occurring after transplants, endometriosis or chronic asthma and more than 70 other conditions. The new blood vessels can feed the diseased tissues, destroy normal tissues, and in the case of cancer, the new vessels can allow tumor cells to escape into the circulation and lodge in other organs (tumor metastases). Insufficient angiogenesis occurs when there is inadequate blood vessel growth that contributes to the worsening of a diseased state, e.g., in diseases such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and delayed wound healing. Further, ulcers, strokes, and heart attacks can result from the absence of angiogenesis that is normally required for natural healing. The present invention contemplates treating those patients that are at risk of developing the above-mentioned illnesses.\n\n\nOther patients that are candidates for receiving the antibodies or polypeptides of this invention have, or are at risk for developing, abnormal proliferation of fibrovascular tissue, acne rosacea, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, artery occlusion, atopic keratitis, bacterial ulcers, Bechets disease, blood borne tumors, carotid obstructive disease, choroidal neovascularization, chronic inflammation, chronic retinal detachment, chronic uveitis, chronic vitritis, contact lens overwear, corneal graft rejection, corneal neovascularization, corneal graft neovascularization, Crohn's disease, Eales disease, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, fungal ulcers, Herpes simplex infections, Herpes zoster infections, hyperviscosity syndromes, Kaposi's sarcoma, leukemia, lipid degeneration, Lyme's disease, marginal keratolysis, Mooren ulcer, Mycobacteria infections other than leprosy, myopia, ocular neovascular disease, optic pits, Osler-Weber syndrome (Osler-Weber-Rendu), osteoarthritis, Pagets disease, pars planitis, pemphigoid, phylectenulosis, polyarteritis, post-laser complications, protozoan infections, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, pterygium keratitis sicca, radial keratotomy, retinal neovascularization, retinopathy of prematurity, retrolental fibroplasias, sarcoid, scleritis, sickle cell anemia, Sjögren's syndrome, solid tumors, Stargarts disease, Stevens-Johnson disease, superior limbic keratitis, syphilis, systemic lupus, Terrien's marginal degeneration, toxoplasmosis, trauma, tumors of Ewing sarcoma, tumors of neuroblastoma, tumors of osteosarcoma, tumors of retinoblastoma, tumors of rhabdomyosarcoma, ulcerative colitis, vein occlusion, Vitamin A deficiency and Wegeners sarcoidosis, undesired angiogenesis associated with diabetes, parasitic diseases, abnormal wound healing, hypertrophy following surgery, injury or trauma, inhibition of hair growth, inhibition of ovulation and corpus luteum formation, inhibition of implantation and inhibition of embryo development in the uterus.\n\n\nAnti-angiogenesis therapies are useful in the general treatment of graft rejection, lung inflammation, nephrotic syndrome, preeclampsia, pericardial effusion, such as that associated with pericarditis, and pleural effusion, diseases and disorders characterized by undesirable vascular permeability, e.g., edema associated with brain tumors, ascites associated with malignancies, Meigs' syndrome, lung inflammation, nephrotic syndrome, pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, permeability associated with cardiovascular diseases such as the condtion following myocardial infarctions and strokes and the like.\n\n\nOther angiogenesis-dependent diseases according to this invention include angiofibroma (abnormal blood of vessels which are prone to bleeding), neovascular glaucoma (growth of blood vessels in the eye), arteriovenous malformations (abnormal communication between arteries and veins), nonunion fractures (fractures that will not heal), atherosclerotic plaques (hardening of the arteries), pyogenic granuloma (common skin lesion composed of blood vessels), scleroderma (a form of connective tissue disease), hemangioma (tumor composed of blood vessels), trachoma (leading cause of blindness in the third world), hemophilic joints, vascular adhesions and hypertrophic scars (abnormal scar formation).\n\n\nThe term “VEGF” or “VEGF” as used herein refers to the 165-amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factor and related 121-, 189-, and 206amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factors, as described by Leung et al. \nScience, \n246:1306 (1989), and Houck et al. \nMol. Endocrin., \n5:1806 (1991), together with the naturally occurring allelic and processed forms thereof. The term “VEGF” also refers to VEGFs from non-human species such as mouse, rat or primate. Sometimes the VEGF from a specific species are indicated by terms such as hVEGF for human VEGF, mVEGF for murine VEGF, and etc. The term “VEGF” is also used to refer to truncated forms of the polypeptide comprising \namino acids\n 8 to 109 or 1 to 109 of the 165-amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factor. Reference to any such forms of VEGF may be identified in the present application, e.g., by “VEGF (8-109),” “VEGF (1-109)” or “VEGF\n165\n.” The amino acid positions for a “truncated” native VEGF are numbered as indicated in the native VEGF sequence. For example, amino acid position 17 (methionine) in truncated native VEGF is also position 17 (methionine) in native VEGF. The truncated native VEGF has binding affinity for the KDR and Flt-1 receptors comparable to native VEGF.\n\n\nThe term “VEGF variant” as used herein refers to a VEGF polypeptide which includes one or more amino acid mutations in the native VEGF sequence. Optionally, the one or more amino acid mutations include amino acid substitution(s). For purposes of shorthand designation of VEGF variants described herein, it is noted that numbers refer to the amino acid residue position along the amino acid sequence of the putative native VEGF (provided in Leung et al., supra and Houck et al., supra.).\n\n\nThe terms “cancer” and “cancerous” refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney cancer, renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma and various types of head and neck cancer. “Mammal” for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, nonhuman primates, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, cats, cows, etc.\n\n\nThe term “anti-neoplastic composition” refers to a composition useful in treating cancer comprising at least one active therapeutic agent, e.g., “anti-cancer agent.” Examples of therapeutic agents (anti-cancer agents) include, but are not limited to, e.g., chemotherapeutic agents, growth inhibitory agents, cytotoxic agents, agents used in radiation therapy, anti-angiogenesis agents, apoptotic agents, anti-tubulin agents, and other agents to treat cancer, such as anti-HER-2 antibodies, anti-CD20 antibodies, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonist (e.g., a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), HER1/EGFR inhibitor (e.g., erlotinib (Tarceva™), platelet derived growth factor inhibitors (e.g., Gleevec™ (Imatinib Mesylate)), a COX-2 inhibitor (e.g., celecoxib), interferons, cytokines, antagonists (e.g., neutralizing antibodies) that bind to one or more of the following targets ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, PDGFR-beta, BIyS, APRIL, BCMA or VEGF receptor(s), TRAIL/Apo2, and other bioactive and organic chemical agents, etc. Combinations thereof are also included in the invention.\n\n\nThe term “epitope tagged” when used herein refers to an antibody mutant fused to an “epitope tag”. The epitope tag polypeptide has enough residues to provide an epitope against which an antibody thereagainst can be made, yet is short enough such that it does not interfere with activity of the antibody mutant. The epitope tag preferably also is fairly unique so that the antibody thereagainst does not substantially cross-react with other epitopes. Suitable tag polypeptides generally have at least 6 amino acid residues, and usually between about 8-50 amino acid residues (preferably between about 9-30 residues). Examples include the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 (Field et al. \nMol. Cell. Biol. \n8:2159-2165 (1988)); the c-myc tag and the 8F9, 3C7, 6E10, G4, B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereagainst (Evan et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol. \n5(12):3610-3616 (1985)); and the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) tag and its antibody (Paborsky et al., \nProtein Engineering \n3(6):547-553 (1990)). In certain embodiments, the epitope tag is a “salvage receptor binding epitope”.\n\n\nThe term “cytotoxic agent” as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g., I\n131\n, I\n125\n, Y\n90 \nand Re\n186\n), chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, or fragments thereof.\n\n\nA “chemotherapeutic agent” is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer. Examples of chemotherapeutic agents include a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer.

See, e.g., Wilman, “Prodrugs in Cancer Chemotherapy” \nBiochemical Society Transactions, \n14, pp. 375-382, 615th Meeting Belfast (1986) and Stella et al., “Prodrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery,” \nDirected Drug Delivery\n, Borchardt et al., (ed.), pp. 247-267, Humana Press (1985). The prodrugs of this invention include, but are not limited to, phosphate-containing prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing prodrugs, sulfate-containing prodrugs, peptide-containing prodrugs, D-amino acid-modified prodrugs, glycosylated prodrugs, β-lactam-containing prodrugs, optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide-containing prodrugs, 5-fluorocytosine and other 5-fluorouridine prodrugs which can be converted into the more active cytotoxic free drug. Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, those chemotherapeutic agents described above.\n\n\nFor the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the patient can be treated with an antibody of the invention in conjunction with any one or more of the following drugs: DMARDS (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (e.g., methotrexate), NSAI or NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), HUMIRA™ (adalimumab; Abbott Laboratories), ARAVA® (leflunomide), REMICADE® (infliximab; Centocor Inc., of Malvern, Pa.), ENBREL™ (etanercept; Immunex, WA), COX-2 inhibitors. DMARDs commonly used in RA are hydroxycloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide, etanercept, infliximab, azathioprine, D-penicillamine, Gold (oral), Gold (intramuscular), minocycline, cyclosporine, Staphylococcal protein A immunoadsorption. Adalimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to TNFα. Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to TNFα. Etanercept is an “immunoadhesin” fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand binding portion of the human 75 kD (p75) tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) linked to the Fc portion of a human IgG1. For conventional treatment of RA, see, e.g., “Guidelines for the management of rheumatoid arthritis” \nArthritis \n& \nRheumatism \n46(2): 328-346 (February, 2002). In a specific embodiment, the RA patient is treated with a CD20 antibody of the invention in conjunction with methotrexate (MTX). An exemplary dosage of MTX is about 7.5-25 mg/kg/wk. MTX can be administered orally and subcutaneously.\n\n\nFor the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease, the patient can be treated with an antibody of the invention in conjunction with, for example, Remicade® (infliximab; from Centocor Inc., of Malvern, Pa.), ENBREL (etanercept; Immunex, WA).\n\n\nFor treatments for SLE, the patient can be treated with an antibody of the invention in conjunction with, for example, high-dose corticosteroids and/or cyclophosphamide (HDCC).\n\n\nFor the treatment of psoriasis, patients can be administered an antibody of this invention in conjunction with topical treatments, such as topical steroids, anthralin, calcipotriene, clobetasol, and tazarotene, or with methotrexate, retinoids, cyclosporine, PUVA and UVB therapies. In one embodiment, the psoriasis patient is treated with the antibody sequentially or concurrently with cyclosporine.\n\n\nAn “isolated” nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the antibody nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the antibody where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.\n\n\nThe expression “control sequences” refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.\n\n\nNucleic acid is “operably linked” when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, “operably linked” means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.\n\n\nAs used herein, the expressions “cell,” “cell line,” and “cell culture” are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. Thus, the words “transformants” and “transformed cells” include the primary subject cell and cultures derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. Where distinct designations are intended, it will be clear from the context.\n\n\nII. Modes for Carrying Out the Invention\n\n\nSynthetic high-Affinity Anti-VEGF Antibodies\n\n\nThe invention herein provides novel anti-VEGF antibodies with high binding affinity to VEGF. Exemplary methods for generating antibodies are described in more detail in the following sections.\n\n\nThe novel anti-VEGF antibodies are selected using the VEGF antigen derived from a first mammalian species. Preferably the antigen is human VEGF (hVEGF). However, VEGFs from other species such as murine VEGF (mVEGF) can also be used as the first target antigen. The VEGF antigens from various mammalian species may be isolated from natural sources. In other embodiments, the antigen is produced recombinantly or made using other synthetic methods known in the art.\n\n\nThe antibody selected will normally have a sufficiently strong binding affinity for the first VEGF antigen. For example, the antibody may bind hVEGF with a K\nd \nvalue of no more than about 5 nM, preferably no more than about 2 nM, and more preferably no more than about 500 pM. Antibody affinities may be determined by a surface plasmon resonance based assay (such as the BIAcore assay as described in Examples); enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA); and competition assays (e.g. RIA's), for example.\n\n\nAlso, the antibody may be subjected to other biological activity assays, e.g., in order to evaluate its effectiveness as a therapeutic. Such assays are known in the art and depend on the target antigen and intended use for the antibody. Examples include the HUVEC inhibition assay (as described in the Examples below); tumor cell growth inhibition assays (as described in WO 89/06692, for example); antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) assays (U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362); and agonistic activity or hematopoiesis assays (see WO 95/27062).\n\n\nTo screen for antibodies which bind to a particular epitope on the antigen of interest, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in \nAntibodies, A Laboratory Manual\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping, e.g. as described in Champe et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n270:1388-1394 (1995), can be performed to determine whether the antibody binds an epitope of interest.\n\n\nSpecies-specificity of the novel antibodies is then determined. The binding affinity of the antibody for a homologue of the antigen used to select the antibody (where the homologue is from the “second mammalian species”) is assessed using techniques such as those described above. In preferred embodiments, the second mammalian species is a nonhuman mammal to which the antibody will be administered in preclinical studies. Accordingly, the second mammalian species may be a nonhuman primate, such as rhesus, cynomolgus, baboon, chimpanzee and macaque. In other embodiments, the second mammalian species may be a rodent (e.g., mouse or rat), cat or dog, for example.\n\n\nWhile the preferred method of the instant invention for determining species-dependence (and for evaluating antibody mutants with improved properties; see below) is to quantify antibody binding affinity, in other embodiments of the invention, one or more biological properties of the synthetic antibody and antibody variants are evaluated in addition to, or instead of, binding affinity determinations. Exemplary such biological assays are described above. Such assays are particularly useful where they provide an indication as to the therapeutic effectiveness of the antibody. Normally, though not necessarily, antibodies which show improved properties in such assays will also have an enhanced binding affinity. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention where the assay of choice is a biological activity assay other than a binding affinity assay, the species-dependent antibody will normally have a “biological activity” using “material” (e.g. antigen, cell, tissue, organ or whole animal) from the second mammalian species which is at least about 50 fold, or at least about 500 fold, or at least about 1000 fold, less effective than its biological activity in a corresponding assay using reagents from the first mammalian species.\n\n\nThe species-dependent antibody is then altered so as to generate an antibody mutant which has a stronger binding affinity for the antigen from the second mammalian species than the species-dependent antibody. The antibody mutant preferably has a binding affinity for the antigen from the nonhuman mammal which is at least about 10 fold stronger, preferably at least about 20 fold stronger, more preferably at least about 50 fold stronger, and sometimes at least about 100 fold or 200 fold stronger, than the binding affinity of the species-dependent antibody for the antigen. The enhancement in binding affinity desired or required will depend on the initial binding affinity of the species-dependent antibody. Where the assay used is a biological activity assay, the antibody mutant preferably has a biological activity in the assay of choice which is at least about 10 fold better, preferably at least about 20 fold better, more preferably at least about 50 fold better, and sometimes at least about 100 fold or 200 fold better, than the biological activity of the species-dependent antibody in that assay.\n\n\nTo generate the antibody mutant, one or more amino acid alterations (e.g. substitutions) are introduced in one or more of the hypervariable regions of the species-dependent antibody. Alternatively, or in addition, one or more alterations (e.g. substitutions) of framework region residues may be introduced in the species-dependent antibody where these result in an improvement in the binding affinity of the antibody mutant for the antigen from the second mammalian species. Examples of framework region residues to modify include those which non-covalently bind antigen directly (Amit et al. \nScience \n233:747-753 (1986)); interact with/effect the conformation of a CDR (Chothia et al. \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901-917 (1987)); and/or participate in the V\nL\nV\nH \ninterface (EP 239 400B1). In certain embodiments, modification of one or more of such framework region residues results in an enhancement of the binding affinity of the antibody for the antigen from the second mammalian species. For example, from about one to about five framework residues may be altered in this embodiment of the invention. Sometimes, this may be sufficient to yield an antibody mutant suitable for use in preclinical trials, even where none of the hypervariable region residues have been altered. Normally, however, the antibody mutant will comprise additional hypervariable region alteration(s).\n\n\nThe hypervariable region residues which are altered may be changed randomly, especially where the starting binding affinity of the species-dependent antibody for the antigen from the second mammalian species is such that such randomly produced antibody mutants can be readily screened.\n\n\nOne useful procedure for generating such antibody mutants is called “alanine scanning mutagenesis” (Cunningham and Wells \nScience \n244:1081-1085 (1989)). Here, one or more of the hypervariable region residue(s) are replaced by alanine or polyalanine residue(s) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with the antigen from the second mammalian species. Those hypervariable region residue(s) demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other mutations at or for the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. The ala-mutants produced this way are screened for their biological activity as described herein.\n\n\nAnother procedure for generating such antibody mutants involves affinity maturation using phage display (Hawkins et al. \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n254:889-896 (1992) and Lowman et al. \nBiochemistry \n30(45):10832-10837 (1991)). Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (e.g. 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody mutants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed mutants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g. binding affinity) as herein disclosed.\n\n\nThe invention also provides a more systematic method for identifying amino acid residues to modify. According to this method, one identifies hypervariable region residues in the species-dependent antibody which are involved in binding the antigen from the first mammalian species and those hypervariable region residues involved in binding a homologue of that antigen from the second mammalian species. To achieve this, an alanine-scan of the hypervariable region residues of the species-dependent antibody can be performed, with each ala-mutant being tested for binding to the antigen from the first and second mammalian species. Alternatively, the X-ray crystal structures of antibody-antigen complexes are analyzed for contacting residues as well as surrounding residues (as described in Examples). The hypervariable region residues involved in binding the antigen from the first mammalian species (e.g. human), and those involved in binding the homologue of the antigen from the second mammalian species (e.g. nonhuman mammal) are thereby identified. Preferably, those residue(s) significantly involved in binding the antigen from the second mammalian species (e.g. nonhuman mammal), but not the antigen from the first mammalian species (e.g. human), are chosen as candidates for modification. In another embodiment, those residue(s) significantly involved in binding the antigen from both the first and second mammalian species are selected to be modified (see Example below). In yet a further but less preferred embodiment, those residues involved in binding the antigen from the first mammalian species, but not the second mammalian species, are selected for modification. Such modification can involve deletion of the residue or insertion of one or more residues adjacent to the residue. However, normally the modification involves substitution of the residue for another amino acid.\n\n\nNormally one would start with a conservative substitution such as those shown below under the heading of “preferred substitutions”. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity (e.g. binding affinity), then more substantial changes, denominated “exemplary substitutions” in the following table, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, are introduced and the products screened.\n\n\nPreferred Substitutions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nExemplary\n\n\nPreferred\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOriginal Residue\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla (A)\n\n\nval; leu; ile\n\n\nval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg (R)\n\n\nlys; gln; asn\n\n\nlys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn (N)\n\n\ngln; his; lys; arg\n\n\ngln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp (D)\n\n\nglu\n\n\nglu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys (C)\n\n\nser\n\n\nser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln (Q)\n\n\nasn\n\n\nasn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlu (E)\n\n\nasp\n\n\nasp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly (G)\n\n\npro; ala\n\n\nala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis (H)\n\n\nasn; gln; lys; arg\n\n\narg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle (I)\n\n\nleu; val; met; ala;\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nphe; norleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu (L)\n\n\nnorleucine; ile; val;\n\n\nile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nmet; ala; phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys (K)\n\n\narg; gln; asn\n\n\narg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet (M)\n\n\nleu; phe; ile\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe (F)\n\n\nleu; val; ile; ala; tyr\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro (P)\n\n\nala\n\n\nala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer (S)\n\n\nthr\n\n\nthr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr (T)\n\n\nser\n\n\nser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp (W)\n\n\ntyr; phe\n\n\ntyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr (Y)\n\n\ntrp; phe; thr; ser\n\n\nphe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal (V)\n\n\nile; leu; met; phe;\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nala; norleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven more substantial modifications to the antibodies' biological properties are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n\n(1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile;\n\n\n(2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr, asn, gln;\n\n\n(3) acidic: asp, glu;\n\n\n(4) basic: his, lys, arg;\n\n\n(5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and\n\n\n(6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe.\n\n\nNon-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the sites selected for modification are affinity matured using phage display (see above).\n\n\nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence mutants are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared mutant or a non-mutant version of the species-dependent antibody. The preferred method for making mutants is site directed mutagenesis (see, e.g., Kunkel, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n82:488 (1985)).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the antibody mutant will only have a single hypervariable region residue substituted. In other embodiments, two or more of the hypervariable region residues of the species-dependent antibody will have been substituted, e.g. from about two to about ten hypervariable region substitutions. For example, the murinized anti-VEGF antibody variant of the example below had four hypervariable region substitutions.\n\n\nOrdinarily, the antibody mutant with improved biological properties will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain of the species-dependent antibody, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or similarity with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical (i.e same residue) or similar (i.e. amino acid residue from the same group based on common side-chain properties, see above) with the species-dependent antibody residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence outside of the variable domain shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or similarity.\n\n\nFollowing production of the antibody mutant, the biological activity of that molecule relative to the species-dependent antibody is determined. As noted above, this may involve determining the binding affinity and/or other biological activities of the antibody. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a panel of antibody mutants are prepared above and are screened for binding affinity for the antigen from the second mammalian species. One or more of the antibody mutants selected from this initial screen are optionally subjected to one or more further biological activity assays to confirm that the antibody mutant(s) with enhanced binding affinity are indeed useful, e.g. for preclinical studies. In preferred embodiments, the antibody mutant retains the ability to bind the antigen from the first mammalian species with a binding affinity similar to the species-dependent antibody. This may be achieved by avoiding altering hypervariable region residues involved in binding the antigen from the first mammalian species. In other embodiments, the antibody mutant may have a significantly altered binding affinity for the antigen from the first mammalian species (e.g. the binding affinity for that antigen is preferably better, but may be worse than the species-dependent antibody).\n\n\nThe antibody mutant(s) so selected may be subjected to further modifications, oftentimes depending on the intended use of the antibody. Such modifications may involve further alteration of the amino acid sequence, fusion to heterologous polypeptide(s) and/or covalent modifications such as those elaborated below. With respect to amino acid sequence alterations, exemplary modifications are elaborated above. For example, any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody mutant also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant cross linking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment). Another type of amino acid mutant has an altered glycosylation pattern. This may be achieved by deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody. Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used. Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\nTechniques for producing antibodies, which may be species-dependent and therefore require modification according to the techniques elaborated herein, follow:\n\n\nA. Generation of High-Affinity Anti-VEGF Antibodies from Synthetic Antibody Phage Libraries\n\n\nThe invention also provides a method for generating and selecting novel high-affinity anti-VEGF antibodies using a unique phage display approach. The approach involves generation of synthetic antibody phage libraries based on a single framework template, design of sufficient diversities within variable domains, display of polypeptides having the diversified variable domains, selection of candidate antibodies with high affinity to target VEGF antigen, and isolation of the selected antibodies.\n\n\nDetails of the phage display methods can be found, for example, in the provisional U.S. Application No. 60/385,338 (filed Jun. 3, 2002) and relating applications, the entire disclosures of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the antibody libraries used in the invention can be generated by mutating the solvent accessible and/or highly diverse positions in at least one CDR of an antibody variable domain. Some or all of the CDRs can be mutated using the methods provided herein. In some embodiments, it may be preferable to generate diverse antibody libraries by mutating positions in CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3 to form a single library or by mutating positions in CDRL3 and CDRH3 to form a single library or by mutating positions in CDRL3 and CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3 to form a single library.\n\n\nA library of antibody variable domains can be generated, for example, having mutations in the solvent accessible and/or highly diverse positions of CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3. Another library can be generated having mutations in CDRL1, CDRL2 and CDRL3. These libraries can also be used in conjunction with each other to generate binders of desired affinities. For example, after one or more rounds of selection of heavy chain libraries for binding to a target antigen, a light chain library can be replaced into the population of heavy chain binders for further rounds of selection to increase the affinity of the binders.\n\n\nPreferably, a library is created by substitution of original amino acids with variant amino acids in the CDRH3 region of the variable region of the heavy chain sequence. The resulting library can contain a plurality of antibody sequences, wherein the sequence diversity is primarily in the CDRH3 region of the heavy chain sequence.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the library is created in the context of the humanized antibody 4D5 sequence, or the sequence of the framework amino acids of the humanized antibody 4D5 sequence. Preferably, the library is created by substitution of at least residues 95-100a of the heavy chain with amino acids encoded by the DVK codon set, wherein the DVK codon set is used to encode a set of variant amino acids for every one of these positions. An example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (DVK)\n7\n. In some embodiments, a library is created by substitution of residues 95-100a with amino acids encoded by both DVK and NNK codon sets. An example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (DVK)\n6 \n(NNK). In another embodiment, a library is created by substitution of at least residues 95-100a with amino acids encoded by both DVK and NNK codon sets. An example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (DVK)\n5 \n(NNK). Another example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (NNK)\n6\n. Other examples of suitable oligonucleotide sequences can be determined by one skilled in the art according to the criteria described herein.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, different CDRH3 designs are utilized to isolate high affinity binders and to isolate binders for a variety of epitopes. The range of lengths of CDRH3 generated in this library is 11 to 13 amino acids, although lengths different from this can also be generated. H3 diversity can be expanded by using NNK, DVK and NVK codon sets, as well as more limited diversity at N and/or C-terminal.\n\n\nDiversity can also be generated in CDRH1 and CDRH2. The designs of CDR-H1 and H2 diversities follow the strategy of targeting to mimic natural antibodies repertoire as described with modification that focus the diversity more closely matched to the natural diversity than previous design.\n\n\nFor diversity in CDRH3, multiple libraries can be constructed separately with different lengths of H3 and then combined to select for binders to target antigens. The multiple libraries can be pooled and sorted using solid support selection and solution sorting methods as described previously and herein below. Multiple sorting satrategies may be employed. For example, one variation involves sorting on target bound to a solid, followed by sorting for a tag that may be present on the fusion polypeptide (eg. anti-gD tag) and followed by another sort on target bound to solid. Alternatively, the libraries can be sorted first on target bound to a solid surface, the eluted binders are then sorted using solution phase binding with decreasing concentrations of target antigen. Utilizing combinations of different sorting methods provides for minimization of selection of only highly expressed sequences and provides for selection of a number of different high affinity clones.\n\n\nHigh affinity binders for the target VEGF antigen can be isolated from the libraries. Limiting diversity in the H1/H2 region decreases degeneracy about 10\n4 \nto 10\n5 \nfold, and allowing more H3 diversity provides for more high affinity binders. Utilizing libraries with different types of diversity in CDRH3 (eg. utilizing DVK or NVT) provides for isolation of binders that may bind to different epitopes of a target antigen.\n\n\nOf the binders isolated from the pooled libraries as described above, it has been discovered that affinity may be further improved by providing limited diversity in the light chain. Light chain diversity is generated in this embodiment as follows in CDRL1: \namino acid position\n 28 is encoded by RDT; \namino acid position\n 29 is encoded by RKT; \namino acid position\n 30 is encoded by RVW; \namino acid position\n 31 is encoded by ANR; \namino acid position\n 32 is encoded by THT; optionally, \namino acid position\n 33 is encoded by CTG; in CDRL2: \namino acid position\n 50 is encoded by KBG; \namino acid position\n 53 is encoded by AVC; and optionally, \namino acid position\n 55 is encoded by GMA; in CDRL3: \namino acid position\n 91 is encoded by TMT or SRT or both; \namino acid position\n 92 is encoded by DMC; \namino acid position\n 93 is encoded by RVT; \namino acid position\n 94 is encoded by NHT; and \namino acid position\n 96 is encoded by TWT or YKG or both.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a library or libraries with diversity in CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3 regions is generated. In this embodiment, diversity in CDRH3 is generated using a variety of lengths of H3 regions and using primarily codon sets XYZ and NNK or NNS. Libraries can be formed using individual oligonucleotides and pooled or oligonucleotides can be pooled to form a subset of libraries. The libraries of this embodiment can be sorted against target bound to solid. Clones isolated from multiple sorts can be screened for specificity and affinity using ELISA assays. For specificity, the clones can be screened against the desired target antigens as well as other nontarget antigens. Those binders to the target VEGF antigen can then be screened for affinity in solution binding competition ELISA assay or spot competition assay. High affinity binders can be isolated from the library utilizing XYZ codon sets prepared as described above. These binders can be readily produced as antibodies or antigen binding fragments in high yield in cell culture.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, it may be desirable to generate libraries with a greater diversity in lengths of CDRH3 region. For example, it may be desirable to generate libraries with CDRH3 regions ranging from about 7 to 19 amino acids.\n\n\nHigh affinity binders isolated from the libraries of these embodiments are readily produced in bacterial and eukaryotic cell culture in high yield. The vectors can be designed to readily remove sequences such as gD tags, viral coat protein component sequence, and/or to add in constant region sequences to provide for production of full length antibodies or antigen binding fragments in high yield.\n\n\nA library with mutations in CDRH3 can be combined with a library containing variant versions of other CDRs, for example CDRL1, CDRL2, CDRL3, CDRH1 and/or CDRH2. Thus, for example, in one embodiment, a CDRH3 library is combined with a CDRL3 library created in the context of the humanized 4D5 antibody sequence with variant amino acids at \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 28, 29, 30, 31, and/or 32 using predetermined codon sets. In another embodiment, a library with mutations to the CDRH3 can be combined with a library comprising variant CDRH1 and/or CDRH2 heavy chain variable domains. In one embodiment, the CDRH1 library is created with the humanized antibody 4D5 sequence with variant amino acids at \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n 28, 30, 31, 32 and 33. A CDRH2 library may be created with the sequence of humanized antibody 4D5 with variant amino acids at \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n 50, 52, 53, 54, 56 and 58 using the predetermined codon sets.\n\n\nB. Vectors, Host Cells and Recombinant Methods\n\n\nThe anti-VEGF antibody of the invention can be produced recombinantly, using techniques and materials readily obtainable.\n\n\nFor recombinant production of an anti-VEGF antibody, the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated or synthesized using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to DNA encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\n(i) Signal Sequence Component\n\n\nThe antibody of this invention may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, which is preferably a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the native antibody signal sequence, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, 1 pp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the native signal sequence may be substituted by, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, α factor leader (including \nSaccharomyces \nand \nKluyveromyces \nα-factor leaders), or acid phosphatase leader, the \nC. albicans \nglucoamylase leader, or the signal described in WO 90/13646. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available.\n\n\nThe DNA for such a precursor region is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the antibody.\n\n\n(ii) Origin of Replication Component\n\n\nBoth expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally, in cloning vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA, and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2μ plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors (the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter).\n\n\n(iii) Selection Gene Component\n\n\nExpression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for Bacilli.\n\n\nOne example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.\n\n\nAnother example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid, such as DHFR, thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I and -II, preferably primate metallothionein genes, adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.\n\n\nFor example, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity.\n\n\nAlternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR) transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding antibody, wild-type DHFR protein, and another selectable marker such as \naminoglycoside\n 3′-phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,199.\n\n\nA suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 (Stinchcomb et al., \nNature, \n282:39 (1979)). The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example, ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1. Jones, \nGenetics, \n85:12 (1977). The presence of the trp1 lesion in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. Similarly, Leu2-deficient yeast strains (ATCC 20,622 or 38,626) are complemented by known plasmids bearing the Leu2 gene.\n\n\nIn addition, vectors derived from the 1.6 nm circular plasmid pKD1 can be used for transformation of \nKluyveromyces \nyeasts. Alternatively, an expression system for large-scale production of recombinant calf chymosin was reported for \nK. lactis\n. Van den Berg, \nBio/Technology, \n8:135 (1990). Stable multi-copy expression vectors for secretion of mature recombinant human serum albumin by industrial strains of \nKluyveromyces \nhave also been disclosed. Fleer et al., \nBio/Technology, \n9:968-975 (1991).\n\n\n(iv) Promoter Component\n\n\nExpression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the antibody nucleic acid. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the phoA promoter, β-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system, and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. However, other known bacterial promoters are suitable. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding the antibody.\n\n\nPromoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT (SEQ ID NO:930) region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3′ end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA (SEQ ID NO:931) sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3′ end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.\n\n\nExamples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase.\n\n\nOther yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for \nalcohol dehydrogenase\n 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, metallothionein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73,657. Yeast enhancers also are advantageously used with yeast promoters.\n\n\nAntibody transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and most preferably Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.\n\n\nThe early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,978. See also Reyes et al., \nNature \n297:598-601 (1982) on expression of human β-interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively, the rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.\n\n\n(v) Enhancer Element Component\n\n\nTranscription of a DNA encoding the antibody of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, α-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv, \nNature \n297:17-18 (1982) on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a \nposition\n 5′ or 3′ to the antibody-encoding sequence, but is preferably located at a \nsite\n 5′ from the promoter.\n\n\n(vi) Transcription Termination Component\n\n\nExpression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5′ and, occasionally 3′, untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding the antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94/11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.\n\n\n(vii) Selection and Transformation of Host Cells\n\n\nSuitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein are the prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryote cells described above. Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for example, Enterobacteriaceae such as \nEscherichia\n, e.g., \nE. coli, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella\n, e.g., \nSalmonella typhimurium, Serratia\n, e.g., \nSerratia marcescans\n, and \nShigella\n, as well as Bacilli such as \nB. subtilis \nand \nB. licheniformis \n(e.g., \nB. licheniformis \n41P disclosed in DD 266,710 published 12 Apr. 1989), \nPseudomonas \nsuch as \nP. aeruginosa\n, and \nStreptomyces\n. One preferred \nE. coli \ncloning host is \nE. coli \n294 (ATCC 31,446), although other strains such as \nE. coli \nB, \nE. coli \nX1776 (ATCC 31,537), and \nE. coli \nW3110 (ATCC 27,325) are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.\n\n\nIn addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody-encoding vectors. \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n, or common baker's yeast, is the most commonly used among lower eukaryotic host microorganisms. However, a number of other genera, species, and strains are commonly available and useful herein, such as \nSchizosaccharomyces pombe; Kluyveromyces \nhosts such as, e.g., \nK. lactis, K. fragilis \n(ATCC 12,424), \nK. bulgaricus \n(ATCC 16,045), \nK. wickeramii \n(ATCC 24,178), \nK. waltii \n(ATCC 56,500), \nK. drosophilarum \n(ATCC 36,906), \nK. thermotolerans\n, and \nK. marxianus; yarrowia \n(EP 402,226); \nPichia pastoris \n(EP 183,070); \nCandida; Trichoderma reesia \n(EP 244,234); \nNeurospora crassa; Schwanniomyces \nsuch as \nSchwanniomyces occidentalis\n; and filamentous fungi such as, e.g., \nNeurospora, Penicillium, Tolypocladium\n, and \nAspergillus \nhosts such as \nA. nidulans \nand \nA. niger. \n \n\n\nSuitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antibody are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as \nSpodoptera frugiperda \n(caterpillar), \nAedes aegypti \n(mosquito), \nAedes albopictus \n(mosquito), \nDrosophila melanogaster \n(fruitfly), and \nBombyx mori \nhave been identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available, e.g., the L-1 variant of \nAutographa californica \nNPV and the Bm-5 strain of \nBombyx mori \nNPV, and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention, particularly for transfection of \nSpodoptera frugiperda \ncells. Plant cell cultures of cotton, corn, potato, soybean, petunia, tomato, and tobacco can also be utilized as hosts.\n\n\nHowever, interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells, and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., \nJ. Gen Virol. \n36:59 (1977)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/−DHFR (CHO, Urlaub et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n77:4216 (1980)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, \nBiol. Reprod. \n23:243-251 (1980)); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TR1 cells (Mather et al., \nAnnals N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n383:44-68 (1982)); \nMRC\n 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma line (Hep G2).\n\n\nHost cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n(viii) Culturing the Host Cells\n\n\nThe host cells used to produce the antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in Ham et al., \nMeth. Enz. \n58:44 (1979), Barnes et al., \nAnal. Biochem. \n102:255 (1980), U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; 4,560,655; or 5,122,469; WO 90/03430; WO 87/00195; or U.S. Pat. No. Re. 30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN™drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\n(ix) Antibody Purification\n\n\nWhen using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, is removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al., \nBio/Technology \n10:163-167 (1992) describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of \nE. coli\n. Briefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.\n\n\nThe antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human γ1, γ2, or γ4 heavy chains (Lindmark et al., \nJ. Immunol. Meth. \n62:1-13 (1983)). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human γ3 (Guss et al., \nEMBO J. \n5:1567-1575 (1986)). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX™resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE™ chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.\n\n\nFollowing any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).\n\n\nC. Pharmaceutical Formulations\n\n\nTherapeutic formulations of the antibody are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (\nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\nThe formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example, it may be desirable to further provide an immunosuppressive agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.\n\n\nThe active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsule and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsule, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).\n\n\nThe formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.\n\n\nSustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and γ ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37° C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S—S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.\n\n\nD. Non-Therapeutic Uses for the Antibody\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention may be used as affinity purification agents. In this process, the antibodies are immobilized on a solid phase such a Sephadex resin or filter paper, using methods well known in the art. The immobilized antibody is contacted with a sample containing the antigen to be purified, and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except the antigen to be purified, which is bound to the immobilized antibody. Finally, the support is washed with another suitable solvent, such as glycine buffer, pH 5.0, that will release the antigen from the antibody.\n\n\nThe antibodies of this invention may also be useful in diagnostic assays, e.g., for detecting expression of an antigen of interest in specific cells, tissues, or serum.\n\n\nFor diagnostic applications, the antibody typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety. Numerous labels are available which can be generally grouped into the following categories:\n\n\n(a) Radioisotopes, such as \n35\nS, \n14\nC, \n125\nI, \n3\nH and \n131\nI. The antibody can be labeled with the radioisotope using the techniques described in \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology\n, \n \nVolumes\n \n 1 and 2, Coligen et al., Ed. Wiley-Interscience, New York, N.Y., Pubs. (1991) for example and radioactivity can be measured using scintillation counting.\n\n\n(b) Fluorescent labels such as rare earth chelates (europium chelates) or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, Lissamine, phycoerythrin and Texas Red are available. The fluorescent labels can be conjugated to the antibody using the techniques disclosed in \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology\n, supra, for example. Fluorescence can be quantified using a fluorimeter.\n\n\n(c) Various enzyme-substrate labels are available and U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149 provides a review of some of these. The enzyme generally catalyzes a chemical alteration of the chromogenic substrate which can be measured using various techniques. For example, the enzyme may catalyze a color change in a substrate, which can be measured spectrophotometrically. Alternatively, the enzyme may alter the fluorescence or chemiluminescence of the substrate. Techniques for quantifying a change in fluorescence are described above. The chemiluminescent substrate becomes electronically excited by a chemical reaction and may then emit light which can be measured (using a chemiluminometer, for example) or donates energy to a fluorescent acceptor. Examples of enzymatic labels include luciferases (e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase; U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, malate dehydrogenase, urease, peroxidase such as horseradish peroxidase (HRPO), alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases (e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), heterocyclic oxidases (such as uricase and xanthine oxidase), lactoperoxidase, microperoxidase, and the like. Techniques for conjugating enzymes to antibodies are described in O'Sullivan et al., Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme-Antibody Conjugates for use in Enzyme Immunoassay, in \nMethods in Enzym\n. (ed J. Langone & H. Van Vunakis), Academic press, New York, 73:147-166 (1981).\n\n\nExamples of enzyme-substrate combinations include, for example\n\n\n(i) Horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) with hydrogen peroxidase as a substrate, wherein the hydrogen peroxidase oxidizes a dye precursor (e.g., orthophenylene diamine (OPD) or 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine hydrochloride (TMB));\n\n\n(ii) alkaline phosphatase (AP) with para-Nitrophenyl phosphate as chromogenic substrate; and\n\n\n(iii) β-D-galactosidase ((3-D-Gal) with a chromogenic substrate (e.g., p-nitrophenyl-3-D-galactosidase) or fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-3-D-galactosidase.\n\n\nNumerous other enzyme-substrate combinations are available to those skilled in the art. For a general review of these, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,275,149 and 4,318,980.\n\n\nSometimes, the label is indirectly conjugated with the antibody. The skilled artisan will be aware of various techniques for achieving this. For example, the antibody can be conjugated with biotin and any of the three broad categories of labels mentioned above can be conjugated with avidin, or vice versa. Biotin binds selectively to avidin and thus, the label can be conjugated with the antibody in this indirect manner. Alternatively, to achieve indirect conjugation of the label with the antibody, the antibody is conjugated with a small hapten (e.g., digoxin) and one of the different types of labels mentioned above is conjugated with an anti-hapten antibody (e.g., anti-digoxin antibody). Thus, indirect conjugation of the label with the antibody can be achieved.\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the invention, the antibody need not be labeled, and the presence thereof can be detected using a labeled antibody which binds to the antibody.\n\n\nThe antibodies of the present invention may be employed in any known assay method, such as competitive binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays. Zola, \nMonoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques\n, pp. 147-158 (CRC Press, Inc. 1987).\n\n\nCompetitive binding assays rely on the ability of a labeled standard to compete with the test sample analyte for binding with a limited amount of antibody. The amount of antigen in the test sample is inversely proportional to the amount of standard that becomes bound to the antibodies. To facilitate determining the amount of standard that becomes bound, the antibodies generally are insolubilized before or after the competition, so that the standard and analyte that are bound to the antibodies may conveniently be separated from the standard and analyte which remain unbound.\n\n\nSandwich assays involve the use of two antibodies, each capable of binding to a different immunogenic portion, or epitope, of the protein to be detected. In a sandwich assay, the test sample analyte is bound by a first antibody which is immobilized on a solid support, and thereafter a second antibody binds to the analyte, thus forming an insoluble three-part complex. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110. The second antibody may itself be labeled with a detectable moiety (direct sandwich assays) or may be measured using an anti-immunoglobulin antibody that is labeled with a detectable moiety (indirect sandwich assay). For example, one type of sandwich assay is an ELISA assay, in which case the detectable moiety is an enzyme.\n\n\nFor immunohistochemistry, the tumor sample may be fresh or frozen or may be embedded in paraffin and fixed with a preservative such as formalin, for example.\n\n\nThe antibodies may also be used for in vivo diagnostic assays. Generally, the antibody is labeled with a radionuclide (such as \n111\nIn, \n99\nTc, \n14\nC, \n131\nI, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, \n32\nP or \n35\nS) or a dye so that the tumor can be localized using immunoscintiography.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a method of detecting VEGF in a biological sample (e.g., tissue, blood, sera, spinal fluid) or a prepared biological sample can comprise the step of contacting an antibody of this invention with the sample and observing the anti-VEGF antibody bound to the VEGF in the sample or determining the amount of the anti-VEGF antibody bound to VEGF in the sample. In another embodiment, a method of detecting VEGF in a subject comprises the step of administering an antibody of this invention to the subject and observing the anti-VEGF antibody bound to the VEGF in the subject or determining the amount of the anti-VEGF antibody bound to VEGF in the subject (e.g., human, mouse, rabbit, rat, etc).\n\n\nE. Diagnostic Kits\n\n\nAs a matter of convenience, the antibody of the present invention can be provided in a kit, i.e., a packaged combination of reagents in predetermined amounts with instructions for performing the diagnostic assay. Where the antibody is labeled with an enzyme, the kit will include substrates and cofactors required by the enzyme (e.g., a substrate precursor which provides the detectable chromophore or fluorophore). In addition, other additives may be included such as stabilizers, buffers (e.g., a block buffer or lysis buffer) and the like. The relative amounts of the various reagents may be varied widely to provide for concentrations in solution of the reagents which substantially optimize the sensitivity of the assay. Particularly, the reagents may be provided as dry powders, usually lyophilized, including excipients which on dissolution will provide a reagent solution having the appropriate concentration.\n\n\nF. In Vivo Uses for the Antibody\n\n\nIt is contemplated that the antibody of the present invention may be used to treat a mammal. In one embodiment, the antibody is administered to a nonhuman mammal for the purposes of obtaining preclinical data, for example. Exemplary nonhuman mammals to be treated include nonhuman primates, dogs, cats, rodents and other mammals in which preclinical studies are performed. Such mammals may be established animal models for a disease to be treated with the antibody or may be used to study toxicity of the antibody of interest. In each of these embodiments, dose escalation studies may be performed in the mammal. Where the antibody is an anti-VEGF antibody, it may be administered to a host rodent in a solid tumor model, for example.\n\n\nIn addition, or in the alternative, the antibody is used to treat a human, e.g. a patient suffering from a disease or disorder who could benefit from administration of the antibody. The conditions which can be treated with the antibody are many and include conditions arising from or exacerbated by abnormal angiogenesis, e.g., by excessive, inappropriate or uncontrolled angiogenesis. For example, such conditions include, cancer such as colorectal cancer and NSCLS and others described above and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and others described above.\n\n\nThe following references describe lymphomas and CLL, their diagnoses, treatment and standard medical procedures for measuring treatment efficacy.

Saunders Company, Philadelphia, 1998; van Besien K and Cabanillas, F: \nClinical Manifestations, Staging and Treatment of Non\n-\nHodgkin's Lymphoma\n, Chap. 70, pp 1293-1338, in: Hematology, Basic Principles and Practice, 3rd ed. Hoffman et al. (editors). Churchill Livingstone, Philadelphia, 2000; and Rai, K and Patel, D:Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Chap. 72, pp 1350-1362, in: Hematology, Basic Principles and Practice, 3rd ed. Hoffman et al. (editors). Churchill Livingstone, Philadelphia, 2000.\n\n\nThe parameters for assessing efficacy or success of treatment of an autoimmune or autoimmune-related disease will be known to the physician of skill in the appropriate disease. Generally, the physician of skill will look for reduction in the signs and symptoms of the specific disease. The following are by way of examples.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the methods and compositions of the invention are useful to treat rheumatoid arthritis. RA is characterized by inflammation of multiple joints, cartilage loss and bone erosion that leads to joint destruction and ultimately reduced joint function. Additionally, since RA is a systemic disease, it can have effects in other tissues such as the lungs, eyes and bone marrow.\n\n\nThe VEGF binding antibodies can be used as first-line therapy in patients with early RA (i.e., methotrexate (MTX) naive), or in combination with, e.g., MTX or cyclophosphamide. Or, the antibodies can be used in treatment as second-line therapy for patients who were DMARD and/or MTX refractory, in combination with, e.g., MTX. In one preferred embodiment, the VEGF binding antibodies of this invention are administered to mammals who are DMARD and/or MTX refractory. The anti-VEGF antibodies are useful to prevent and control joint damage, delay structural damage, decrease pain associated with inflammation in RA, and generally reduce the signs and symptoms in moderate to severe RA. The RA patient can be treated with the anti-VEGF antibodies of this invention prior to, after or together with treatment with other drugs used in treating RA (see combination therapy below). In one embodiment, patients who had previously failed disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and/or had an inadequate response to methotrexate alone are treated with an anti-VEGF binding antibody. In another embodiment, the patients are administered an anti-VEGF antibody of this invention plus cyclophosphamide or anti-VEGF binding antibody plus methotrexate.\n\n\nOne method of evaluating treatment efficacy in RA is based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, which measures the percentage of improvement in tender and swollen joints, among other things. The RA patient can be scored at for example, ACR 20 (20 percent improvement) compared with no antibody treatment (e.g, baseline before treatment) or treatment with placebo. Other ways of evaluating the efficacy of antibody treatment include X-ray scoring such as the Sharp X-ray score used to score structural damage such as bone erosion and joint space narrowing. Patients can also be evaluated for the prevention of or improvement in disability based on Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ] score, AIMS score, SF-36 at time periods during or after treatment. The \nACR\n 20 criteria may include 20% improvement in both tender (painful) joint count and swollen joint count plus a 20% improvement in at least 3 of 5 additional measures:\n\n\n1. patient's pain assessment by visual analog scale (VAS),\n\n\n2. patient's global assessment of disease activity (VAS),\n\n\n3. physician's global assessment of disease activity (VAS),\n\n\n4. patient's self-assessed disability measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire, and\n\n\n5. acute phase reactants, CRP or ESR.\n\n\nThe \n \nACR\n \n 50 and 70 are defined analogously. Preferably, the patient is administered an amount of anti-VEGF binding antibody of the invention alone or in combination with other agents for treating rheumatoid arthritis effective to achieve at least a score of \nACR\n 20, preferably at \nleast ACR\n 30, more preferably at least ACR50, even more preferably at least ACR70, most preferably at \nleast ACR\n 75 and higher.\n\n\nPsoriatic arthritis has unique and distinct radiographic features. For psoriatic arthritis, joint erosion and joint space narrowing can be evaluated by the Sharp score as well. The anti-VEGF binding antibodies disclosed herein can be used to prevent the joint damage as well as reduce disease signs and symptoms of the disorder.\n\n\nThe antibody is administered by any suitable means, including parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local immunosuppressive treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. In addition, the antibody is suitably administered by pulse infusion, particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Preferably the dosing is given by injections, most preferably intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.\n\n\nFor the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of antibody will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments.\n\n\nDepending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 μg/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g., 0.1-20 mg/kg) of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 μg/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays. An exemplary dosing regimen for an anti-LFA-1 or anti-ICAM-1 antibody is disclosed in WO 94/04188. Exemplary dosing regimens and therapeutic combinations for treating cancer can be found in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/474,480, filed May 30, 2003.\n\n\nThe antibody composition will be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The “therapeutically effective amount” of the antibody to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat a disease or disorder. The antibody need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99% of the heretofore employed dosages. Generally, alleviation or treatment of a disease or disorder involves the lessening of one or more symptoms or medical problems associated with the disease or disorder. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug can accomplish one or a combination of the following: reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., to decrease to some extent and/or stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. In some embodiments, a composition of this invention can be used to prevent the onset or reoccurrence of the disease or disorder in a subject or mammal.\n\n\nG. Articles of Manufacture\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, and test tubes. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a composition which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). The active agent in the composition is the antibody. The label on, or associated with, the container indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice. The article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and package inserts with instructions for use.\n\n\nIncorporated by reference in their entirety are United States Provisional Applications from which this application claims benefit: U.S. Ser.

The disclosures of all patent and scientific literatures cited herein are expressly incorporated in their entirety by reference.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nGeneration of the Synthetic Antibody Phage Libraries\n\n\nIn general, two types of combinatorial antibody libraries have been developed, distinguished by the source of repertoires. Most libraries to date are “natural” antibody libraries which use the natural repertoires as the source for their diversity, where the genes as message RNA of immune cells from naïve or immunized animals or human were amplified and cloned into vector for phage display or other display technology, such as ribosome or yeast display. The natural antibodies usually have multiple frameworks, which together with variable CDRs sequences and the recombination of light chains and heavy chains made up the diversity of the library. The size of the library determines the performance of the library since the repertoires are in general larger than the library size (Marks et al). The synthetic library, on the other hand, is a new branch of library where the diversity is designed and built into the library with synthetic DNA. Single or multiple frameworks have been used. For single framework library, the source of the diversity solely depends on the degeneracy of synthetic DNA designed to create the diverse CDR loops. Both the diversity design and the size of the libraries are critical for the library performance, which can be measured by the affinity of the antibodies found from the libraries.\n\n\nWe developed a strategy of building synthetic antibody phage libraries upon the template of a single framework. Residues were selected from CDR loops that are either solvent exposed or highly variable in natural antibody repertoires according to Kabat database and were randomized by mimicking the natural diversity using tailored codons. We also explored restricting the randomization to heavy chains, which often contribute to the main binding interaction with antigen among natural antibodies, and found it was sufficient to find binders to naïve targets. One of the reasons to restrict the diversity is so that the gap between the DNA degeneracy and practical phage library size is not overwhelmingly large and the sequence space will be covered at sufficient density.\n\n\nThe first library was built on humanized 4D5 framework with a randomized heavy chain and fixed light chain in the format of single chain Fv (ScFv). To the target antigen murine VEGF (mVEGF), many unique binders were found.\n\n\nThe libraries were then generally further improved by fine-tuning the diversity of CDR-H1 and H2 or the light chain to closely mimic the natural diversity, and by exploring the diversity design of CDR-H3 in the Fab format of display. See \nFIG. 1\n for illustrations of different types of antibody libraries. We found libraries with different designs of CDR-H3 of similar size resulted in binders of hVEGF and mVEGF with sub-nM affinity. The affinity of these binders can be further improved to pM range by a second step of randomizing their light chain CDRs.\n\n\nFor details of strategies and methods for generating synthetic antibody libraries with a single template, see, for example, U.S. provisional application U.S. Ser. No. 60/385,338 (filed Jun. 3, 2002), the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. Thus, novel antibodies with high affinity to both human VEGF and mouse VEGF could be found in diverse synthetic antibody phage libraries based on a single framework template.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nG6 and B20 Derived Antibodies\n\n\n(a) Selection of High Affinity Anti-VEGF Fab Clones\n\n\nThe selection procedures for high affinity anti-VEGF Fab clones consisted of various combinations of solid-supported and solution-binding sortings. In solid-supported sortings, the antibody phage library was panned with target antigen coated on NUNC 96-well Maxisorp immunoplate at a concentration of 5 ug/ml. In the solution-binding sorting method, phage library was incubated with decreasing concentration of biotinylated antigen in solution, which then was captured by neutravidin coated on the 96-well Maxisorp plate (2˜5 ug/ml). Decreasing concentration allowed more stringency in panning to fish for tighter binders. To the target antigen mVEGF, a two-step sorting strategy was developed such that, in \nstep\n 1, potent binders were isolated from naïve libraries by means of the solid-supported selection, and subsequently in \nstep\n 2, those stronger affinity binders could be isolated from weaker ones by the progressive solution-binding method with decreasing target antigen concentration. To quickly screen out these binders, the high throughput single-spot competition binding ELISA was used. Low amount of mVEGF (25 nM) was applied in this assay to screen 16 clones from each library after the 3\nrd \nround sorting.\n\n\nAs the result of combining solid-supported and solution-binding sortings, three Fab clones, G6, B29, and C3, all from NNK library, were identified as high affinity binders. And after the 5\nth \nround sorting, the whole library was dominated by G6 clone. Interestingly, B20, which came from NVT library, was found by solution-binding sorting alone. This suggested that more clones can be found by different strategies of sorting methods, which may bias for different clones. With different library designs, more VEGF binding clones with distinct sequences should be identified also. The four unique clones with distinct sequences were first characterized for their binding affinity to murine and human VEGF using competition-binding ELISA at 25° C. IC50 data from phage binding assays represent an estimation of their affinities, and G6 was identified as the highest affinity binder with IC50 at 0.5-1 nM for both human and murine VEGF (\nFIG. 2\n).\n\n\n(b) Activities and Properties\n\n\nA series of in vitro assays were conducted to examine properties and activities of the selected novel anti-VEGF antibodies.\n\n\nEpitope Blocking Assay\n\n\nFirst, the antibody phage clones were examined for their possible binding epitopes on VEGF. A phage-blocking assay was used, wherein the bindings of the phage clones (at constant concentration) to mVEGF-coated wells were measured in the presence of either a full extracellular domain (ECD) of KDR or a second domain of Flt-1 (Flt-1\nD2\n), both at increasing concentrations, respectively. Full ECD of KDR or Flt-1 has seven immunoglobulin-like domains, and binds VEGF through the second and third domain. The second domain of Flt-1 alone can bind VEGF at Kd of 2 nM with known epitopes on VEGF, based on the published crystal structure of theVEGF-VEGFR complex (Wiesmann et al. (1997) \nCell \n91:695-704). The Kd of KDR ECD binding to VEGF is about 5 nM. We expected the binding of the phage clones to be reduced with the increasing addition of receptors, if the epitopes for an antibody on phage overlap significantly with the receptors.\n\n\nFor receptor blocking assay at protein level with purified Fab expressed from \nE. coli\n, (mouse or human VEGF), VEGF receptor immobilized plate by coating baculovirus expressed Flt-1 ECD fragments (Ig domain 1-5) (Flt-1\nD\n1-5) directly, or 293 cell-expressed KDR-Ig fusion, which presents KDR ECD (Ig domain 1-7) as Fcγ fusion captured with goat anti-human IgG Fcγ (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab. West Grove, Pa.) coated on the 96-well Maxisorp immunoplate and blocked with 0.5% BSA and 0.02% Tween20. Biotinylated bacterially expressed hVEGF or mVEGF at 0.2 nM was first incubated with three-fold serial diluted anti-VEGF Fabs, G6, Fab-12 (the Fab of the Avastin™ antibody), or Y0317 in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). After 1 h incubation at room temperature, the mixtures were transferred to a VEGF receptor immobilized plate and incubated for 10 min. The VEGF-A that was not blocked by anti-VEGF was captured with VEGF receptor coated wells and detected by streptavidin-HRP conjugate and developed with TMB substrate as described above.\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 3\n, the four clones were blocked to different extents by Flt-1\nD2 \nand KDR. The results of the blocking assay suggested that these four clones might have different binding epitopes on VEGF that are nonetheless overlapped with receptor binding epitope. The affinities of the antibody clones did not correlate with the efficiency of blocking by receptor in this blocking assay. Y0959, a phage clone with known epitope was used as a control. Among the four novel clones, G6 and B20 appeared to have epitopes that sufficiently overlapped with those for both Flt-1 and KDR, since their bindings to mVEGF were significantly reduced in the presence of the receptor fragments. The difference in the blocking efficiency is small but has been consistent with multiple assays. One prediction is that G6 or B20 will have epitopes that match with those of receptors on VEGF much better than Fab-12 or its variants, Y0317 and Y0959 (Muller, Y. A., et al., (1998) \nStructure \n6:1153-1167). Therefore, we proceeded to generate Fab protein to confirm the binding and examine the epitope. G6 was chosen first for further study since it has the highest affinity against both mVEGF and hVEGF.\n\n\nBinding Specificity and Neutralizing Activity\n\n\nTo determine the binding specificity of G6 Fab clone, ELISA assays were conducted using human, mouse, rat and rabbit VEGF-A\n165 \nas well as VEGF homologs including mouse and human placenta growth factor (P1GF-2), mVEGF-D and human VEGF-B. Human and murine placental growth factor (P1GF-2), murine VEGF-D, rat VEGF-A and human VEGF-B were from R&D system. The tested antigens were coated on NUNC 96-well Maxisorp immunoplate at the concentration of 2 ug/ml. Binding with increasing concentrations of G6 Fab protein was measured by Protein G-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and substrate. For example, Fab protein was prepared from \nE. coli \nharboring the plasmid of G6 Fab expression construct under the promoter of alkaline phosphatase and secretion leader sequences stII and purified with Protein G affinity column. G6 Fab binding to VEGF and its homologs were measured by direct ELISA. VEGF homolog-coated wells (at 2 ug/ml in PBS concentration) were blocked with 0.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween20 at 25° C. Fab at increasing concentrations were incubated with the VEGF homolog-coated wells for 1 h at 25° C. and measured with anti-human Fab antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate diluted in PBT buffer, then developed with TMB substrate. Solution binding assays were also carried out for some proteins by incubating 0.5 nM of G6 Fab with increasing concentrations of a VEGF homolog for 1-2 h at 25° C., and the unbound Fab was captured with mVEGF-A-coated wells and measured. As shown in \nFIG. 4\n, the G6 Fab protein binds equally well to both mVEGF and hVEGF (approximately 0.6 nM and 1.4 nM, respectively). Moreover, the G6 antibody did not bind to other VEGF homologs at all, and thus is highly specific to VEGF. The G6 Fab bound rat and rabbit VEGF with similar affinity as for mVEGF (data not shown).\n\n\nTo test if G6 not only binds to VEGF at high affinity, but also is capable of effectively blocking VEGF's binding to VEGF receptors, blocking assays were conducted, wherein either hVEGF or mVEGF was tested for its binding to KDR in the presence of increasing concentrations of the G6 Fab clone. Also used as control were the two anti-hVEGF antibodies, Fab-12 (the Fab of Avastin™) and Y0317, that are capable of effectively blocking hVEGF but neither bind to mVEGF nor block its activities. As shown in \nFIG. 5\n, G6 effectively blocked hVEGF's binding to KDR with an efficacy similar to that of Fab-12 or Y0317. Furthermore, G6 can also significantly block mVEGF's binding to KDR. In comparison, neither Fab-12 nor Y0317 showed any blocking effect on mVEGF.\n\n\nThus, the novel anti-VEGF antibody G6 of this invention is a high affinity anti-VEGF antibody capable of binding and blocking VEGF from both human and murine species.\n\n\nCell-Based Assay\n\n\nTo further determine binding specificity and blocking activities of the novel antibody G6, a cell-based assay using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was conducted, wherein various anti-VEGF antibodies were tested for their abilities to block either human or murine VEGF induced cell proliferation. Basically, 96-well tissue culture plates were seeded with 3000 HuVECs per well and fasted in the assay medium (F12:DMEM 50:50 supplemented with 1.5% (v/v) diafiltered fetal bovine serum) for 24 hours. The concentration of VEGF used for stimulating the growth of cells was determined by first titrating to identify the amount of VEGF that can induce 90% of maximal DNA synthesis. Fresh assay medium with fixed amounts of VEGF (0.1 nM final concentration) and increasing concentrations of anti-VEGF Fab were then added. After 24 hours of incubation, cells were pulsed with 0.5 μCi per well of [\n3\nH] thymidine for 24 hours, and then harvested onto 96-well filter plate for counting by a TopCount gamma counter. Here the DNA synthesis was measured by incorporation of tritiated thymidine. In this assay, the anti-VEGF antibodies serving as the control were Fab-12 and Y0317.\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 6\n, G6 antibody significantly reduced both hVEGF and mVEGF's abilities to promote HUVEC proliferation. The basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) experiment here served as a control to demonstrate that none of the anti-VEGF Fabs used in this assay had any non-specific toxicity to the host cells.\n\n\n(c) Affinity Improvement of the G6 and B20 Anti-VEGF Antibodies\n\n\nTwo novel antibody clones, G6 and B20, were chosen for further improvement on binding affinities. To improve affinity, several selected residues of the light chain CDR were randomized, since both clones came from a library with only randomized heavy chain and a fixed light chain. Surface exposed CDR residues and residues that are highly diverse in the Kabat database of natural antibody sequences were chosen. Site-directed mutagenesis was used with tailored degenerate codons to generate amino acid diversity that mimicked the natural immune repertoire at each CDR site on light chain (\nFIG. 7\n). Sorting was first performed by adding the library on immobilized hVEGF or mVEGF on the Maxisorp 96-well plate to maximize the recovery of binders, followed by solution sorting with decreasing concentration of biotinylated hVEGF or mVEGF as two separate tracks of selection. Concentration of biotinylated VEGF was selected based on the initial affinity of the clone to gauge the pressure of the sorting. The selection pressure was also increased by incubating phage binders with 1000 fold excess of un-biotinylated antigen in solution for different lengths of time at different temperatures after initial incubation of the phage library with biotinylated VEGF and before capturing by neutravidin coated on 96-well Maxisorp plate.\n\n\nAs an example of the above-described processes, G6 having 1 nM affinity was subject to further affinity improvement. The first round of sorting used solid-supported methods to capture all clones that still bound VEGF, and then at the second round of sorting, the phage library was incubated with 1 nM of VEGF. Next, the solution-binding used 1 nM biotinylated hVEGF to select most binders. Before capturing, 1 uM unbiotinylated hVEGF was added and incubated at RT for 15 min to compete off fast off-rate binders. Then in the following rounds of sorting (3\nrd \nand 4\nth\n), more selection pressure was put into solution sorting by using less biotinylated hVEGF (0.1 nM) to select and 100 nM unbiotinylated hVEGF at 37 C for 30 min or longer (2 hr or 6 hr) to compete off high off-rate binders and fish for low off-rate binders.\n\n\nThe same strategy was utilized to improve the B20 clone, except that less stringent conditions were used because of its low affinity against hVEGF (IC50˜150 nM). The mVEGF selection track followed the same procedures and conditions as what were used with hVEGF. Enrichment was calculated by the eluted phage titers ratio to selection without biotinylated target. After sorting, high throughput single-spot competition binding ELISA as described above was used to quickly screen for improved affinity clones.\n\n\nIn this assay, low amounts of hVEGF or mVEGF (10 nM) were applied to screen 51 clones from the G6-based phage library and 110 clones from the B20-based phage library with the control of wild type G6 and B20 binders. Several improved G6 clones, collectively termed G6-II variants, were selected out and showed remarkably increased binding affinity to both human and murine VEGF by over one hundred fold by comparing the phage IC50 values with wild-type clones (\nFIG. 7\n). Clones with many unique sequences were found that have improved affinity, which suggested that there are many light chains that can accommodate the heavy chain of the selected clones. It is also interesting to note that binding specificities of some clones were changed. This suggests that the light chain is able to modulate the interaction of the heavy chain with its antigen sufficiently to alter its specificities. As for the clone sequences, most G6-II clones were different from G6 only in their third light chain CDR (CDR-L3).\n\n\nTo generate Fab protein or IgG protein for affinity and activity assays, we cloned the variable region into a Fab expression plasmid for expression in an \nE. coli \nor a mammalian cell (a phagemid vector that had been modified by deleting the sequence encoding the C-terminal domain of phage coat protein p3 and adding a termination sequence for ribosome binding about 20 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon at the end of the heavy chain's first constant domain). Fab protein was generated by growing transformed 34B8 \nE. coli \ncells in AP5 media at 30° C. for 24 h as described (Presta, Let al., (1997) \nCancer Res \n57:4593-4599). IgG was purified with Protein A columns and Fab was purified with Protein G affinity chromatography. The production yield for Fab was typically 5-10 mg/L in small scale shake flask growth and 0.5-3 g/L in fermenter growth. IgG production was reasonably high at 10-50 mg/L small scale culture with some clone to clone differences.\n\n\nThree G6-II improved clones, G6-8, G6-23 and G6-31 (see \nFIG. 7\n for residue changes in light chain CDRs), were selected to make into Fab protein for affinity measurement, epitope mapping by receptor blocking assay, and activity study in HuVEC growth inhibition assay. For affinity determinations of anti-mVEGF Fabs, we used surface plasmon resonance assays on a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25° C. and 37° C. with immobilized mVEGF or hVEGF CM5 chips at ˜100 response units (RU) as described (Chen, Y., et al., (1999) \nJ. Mol. Biol \n293:865-881). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) were activated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Human or murine VEGF was diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5 ug/ml (˜0.2 uM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 ul/minute to achieve approximately 100 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of 1M ethanolamine to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (100 to 0.78 nM or 3 nM to 500 nM) were injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25° C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 ul/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) were calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n.\n\n\nSince the k\non \nof affinity improved G6 variants did not result in satisfactory statistics with the available binding model in BIAcore evaluation methods, solution competition binding assays using phage-displayed proteins were also carried out to measure the relative affinity of those antibodies at equilibrium. VEGF displayed on phage were incubated with serial dilutions of Fab at room temperature for 20 h to reach equilibrium and the unbound VEGF-phage were captured with G6 Fab briefly (10 min) and measured with anti-M13-HRP and substrate TMB as above. A second format of solution competition binding assay was also carried out where Fab was displayed on phage and interacted with dilutions of VEGF to reach equilibrium (20 h) and unbound Fab were captured on VEGF coated 96-well plate and measured as above. The two IC50s values were averaged to get binding affinities as final IC50. Binding of Fabs to mVEGF were assayed only with second format due to the lack of the reagent of mVEGF displaying phage.\n\n\nFrom initial SPR experiments, it was noted that there was significant k\non \nimprovement. For example, we found that G6-23 had the most significant improvement in on-rate at 25° C. and 37° C. against both human and murine VEGF, and small reduction in off-rate (\nFIG. 8\n). The k\non \nfor G6-31 improved as compared to G6 as well (data not shown). Further, the solution competition binding assays confirmed that G6-23 was the most affinity-improved clone with its high affinity of IC50 of 20 pM against hVEGF and mVEGF (\nFIG. 7\n).\n\n\nFluorescent quenching assays were also performed to determine the k\non \nrates of the higher affinity G6 series antibodies. Therefore, three of the affinity matured Fabs (G6-8, G6-23 and G6-31) were purified as Fab proteins, and their affinities for mVEGF were compared to G6 by using fluorescence quenching in solution for the rate of association (on rate, k\non\n) (Table I and \nFIGS. 30A\n and B).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAffinity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nClone\n\n\nk\non \n(10\n5 \nM\n−1 \nS\n−1\n)\n\n\nK\noff \n(10\n−4 \nS\n−1\n)\n\n\nKd (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG6\n\n\n1.75 (1.93)\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n0.91\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG6-23\n\n\n56.6\n\n\n1.21\n\n\n0.021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG6-31\n\n\n21.6\n\n\n0.35\n\n\n0.016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG6-8\n\n\n16.8\n\n\n1.29\n\n\n0.077\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fluorescence quenching assays were performed as follows. The change of fluorescence intensity in complexing the Fab and VEGF was used to determine the rate of association as developed for the on-rate determination of Fab-12 variants and VEGF (Marvin J. S. and H. B. Loman (2003) \nBiochemistry \n42:7077-7083). We first determined that the fluorescence intensity with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm of G6 (or variants)-VEGF complex was lower than the sum of individual components using an 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophometer (Thermo-Spectronic) by adding 100 nM VEGF to a stirred cuvette containing 20 nM Fab in PBS, pH 7.2, at 25° C. Next, increasing concentrations of VEGF (100-400 nM) were mixed with equal volumes of 40 nM Fab in a stop-flow (Aviv Instruments) equipped spectrophometer to observe the rate of the decrease of fluorescence intensity at 25° C. For each experiment, nine measurements were performed for each concentration and fitted to a single-exponential curve. The observed rate was then plotted against VEGF concentrations for pseudo-first order analysis, and the slope is the rate of association. Two to three independent experiments were carried out and the differences were within 50%.\n\n\nThe estimated k\non \nof the improved clones from the SPR method were ˜3-6-fold lower than the measurements by solution-based fluorescence quenching assay, whereas k\non \nmeasurements for parent G6 Fab from SPR were statistically sound and within 1.2-fold difference with fluorescence quenching assays. It is possible that using BIAcore SPR technology for fast on-rate measurements was limited by the complex flow dynamics, or there could be some differences in protein behaviors between the parent clone and affinity-improved clones, though aggregation problems were not observed with these proteins. Based on the fluorescence assays, the three Fabs exhibited improvements over G6 in the on-rate by 6, 8 or 20-fold for G6-8, G6-31 or G6-23, respectively. Fab-G6-31 also exhibited an ˜4-fold improvement in the off-rate, and as a result, the affinity of Fab-G6-31 (K\nd\n=16 pM) and Fab-G6-23 (K\nd\n=21 pM) was ˜40-60-fold improved compared to the G6 parent (K\nd\n=910 pM). It was consistent with the solution phase competition assays, which showed a 20-60-fold improvement in IC\n50 \nvalue for G6-31 (30 pM) or G6-23 (10 pM) in comparison with G6 (0.67 nM). We applied the light chain affinity maturation strategy to five other heavy chain sequences and have observed 10- to 30-fold improvements in binding affinities (data not shown). Unlike G6, many improved clones adopted new sequences for all three light chain CDRs. Thus, we found that the three G6 variants increased binding affinity to both human and murine VEGF over G6, predominantly by the increase in the rate of association (on rate or k\non\n). G6-23 had the highest on rate followed by G6-8 and then G6-31. The improvement in the rate of dissociation (off rate or k\noff\n) was 2-3 fold for G6-23, and 8 or 13-fold for G6-31 for hVEGF or mVEGF, respectively. Compared to Fab-12 and Y0317, G6 and G6-23 had significantly different binding kinetics (\nFIG. 32\n). G6-23 had similar Kd as Y0317 but a faster kinetics with fast on rate of over 10\n6 \n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n), and moderate rate of dissociation (off rate or k\noff\n) at 1-2×10\n−4 \ns\n−1\n, whereas Y0317 has slow k\non \nat 3×10\n4 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n, and very slow k\noff \nat ˜5×10\n−6 \ns′ (\nFIG. 32\n).\n\n\nThe solution competition binding assay used biotinylated protein antigens equilibrated with serial dilutions of purified Fab or IgG proteins, and the unbound biotin-antigen was captured with immobilized Fab or IgG coated on Maxisorb plates and was detected with streptavidin conjugated HRP. Alternatively Fab or IgG proteins were equilibrated with serial dilutions of protein antigen, and the unbound Fab or IgG was captured with immobilized antigen and detected with protein A-HRP.\n\n\nFor the VEGF receptor blocking assay using purified Fab, VEGF receptors were immobilized on a plate by coating Flt-1 ECD fragment (Ig domain 1-5) (Flt-1\nD1-5\n) directly, or by first coating with goat anti-human IgG Fey (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab. West Grove, Pa.) and then treating with KDR-IgG fusion receptor which presented KDR ECD (Ig domain 1-7) as a dimer, on a 96-well Maxisorp immunoplate. The plate was then blocked with 0.5% BSA and 0.02% Tween20. Sub-nanomolar concentrations of biotinylated hVEGF or mVEGF at 0.2 nM were incubated with three-fold serial diluted anti-VEGF Fabs, G6, G6-II (G6-8, 23, and 31), Fab-12, or Y0317 in PBST. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, the mixtures were transferred to the plate containing immobilized VEGF receptor and incubated for 10 min. The VEGF-A that was not blocked by anti-VEGF was captured with VEGF receptor-coated wells and detected by streptavidin-HRP conjugate, and developed with TMB substrate as described above. The results showed that, compared to the original G6, the selected G6-II Fabs indeed have increased blocking activities for both hVEGF and mVEGF. Strong blocking had been observed with both G6 and B20 phage display clones which suggested that their binding epitopes on VEGF overlapped with the epitopes for receptors. G6 Fab was also shown to block the binding of both human and murine VEGF to Flt-1 ECD (\nFIG. 31\n) efficiently. In comparison, Fab-12 can only block hVEGF but not mVEGF binding to receptor, consistent with binding specificities. An Fab-12 variant with improved affinity for hVEGF (Kd=20 pM), Y0317, inadvertently acquired some weak affinity to mVEGF (Kd ˜300 nM at 25° C., Y. Chen and H. Lowman, unpublished results) and showed a slight receptor blocking activity to mVEGF at high concentrations.\n\n\nInhibition of VEGF activity in the endothelial cell growth assay (HuVEC) was performed as described above. Like G6, G6-II specifically inhibited the growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cell stimulated by human and murine VEGF, but not the growth stimulated by human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The concentration required to inhibit 50% of the growth of the cells stimulated by both human and murine VEGF (HuVEC IC50) correlated well with the affinity measured by BIAcore or solution binding ELISA assay at 37° C. Compared with G6, G6-23 and G6-31 showed at least 100 fold improvement in inhibiting HuVECs growth stimulated by hVEGF or mVEGF. Fab-12 and Y0317 Fabs were also measured in the same assays to serve as controls. Fab-12 showed no measurable binding to mVEGF, whereas Y0317 Fab could bind mVEGF at 350 nM affinity. Therefore, as expected, Y0317 and Fab-12 did not show any inhibitory effects on mVEGF-mediated HUVEC growth. We showed that many G6-II variants with different light chains can have improved affinity and the solution-binding assay can also predict the outcome of the potency as an inhibitor in HuVEC cell assay.\n\n\nVEGF bindings of G6-23 were compared with that of G6 as well as Fab-12. As shown in \nFIG. 8\n, G6-23 has a significantly improved on-rate for binding to both hVEGF and mVEGF. While the off-rate of G6-23 is substantially similar to that of G6, the overall Kd of G6-23 is at least about 7 fold better than that of G6 for both hVEGF and mVEGF.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nMapping of VEGF Binding Sites on G6 and G6-23 Antibodies\n\n\nFunctional Mapping of G6 and G6-23 by Shotgun Alanine and Homolog Scanning\n\n\nFunctional mapping of G6 and G6-23 by shotgun alanine and homolog scanning were performed to identify residues that are important for binding hVEGF and finding residues that can be improved further for binding VEGF. We generated combinatorial phage libraries which allowed heavy chain or light chain CDR residues in separate libraries to be either alanine or wild type (alanine scanning), or either homologous amino acid or wild type (homolog scanning).\n\n\nMutagenic Oligonucleotides for Shotgun Scanning Libraries\n\n\nThe following mutagenic oligonucleotides for shotgun alanine (A)- and homolog (H)-scan library constructions to randomize CDR residues in G6 and G6-23 antibodies were designed using previously described shotgun codons (Vajdos et al. (2002) \nJ. Mol. Biol \n320:415-428). Equimolar DNA degeneracies are represented in the IUB code (K=G/T, M=A/C, R=A/G, S=G/C, V=A/C/G, W=A/T, Y═C/T), and the degenerate codons are shown in bold text. All the following oligonucleotides were generated by Genentech DNA synthesis group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOligo\n \nSequence\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nH1-A\n \nGCA GCT TCT GGC TTC ACC ATT KCC GMT KMT KSG\n \n \n \n \n \nATA CAC TGG GTG CGT CAG\n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 3)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nH2-A\n \nAAG GGC CTG GAA TGG GTT GCA GST ATT RCT CCT\n \n \n \n \n \nGST GST GGT KMT ACT KMT TAT GCC GAT AGC GTC\n \n \n \n \n \nAAG GGC\n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 4)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nH3-A\n \nACT GCC GTC TAT TAT TGT GCA CGC KYT GYT KYT\n \n \n \n \n \nKYT SYT SCA KMT GCT ATG GAC TAC TGG GGT CAA\n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 5)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nL1-A\n \nACC TGC CGT GCC AGT SMA GMT GYT KCC RCT GST\n \n \n \n \n \nGTA GCC TGG TAT CAA CAG AAA C\n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 6)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nL2-A\n \nCCG AAG CTT CTG ATT KMT KCC GCA TCC KYT CTC\n \n \n \n \n \nKMT TCT GGA GTC CCT TCT CGC\n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 7)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nL3-A1\n \nGCA ACT TAT TAC TGT \nSMA \nCAA \nKCC KMT RCT RCT\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCCT \nSCA \nACG TTC GGA CAG GGT ACC\n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 8)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nL3-A2\n \nGCA ACT TAT TAC TGT \nRMA \nCAA \nGST KMT GST RMC\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCCT \nKSG \nACG TTC GGA CAG GGT ACC\n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 9)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nH1-H\n \nGCA GCT TCT GGC TTC ACC ATT \nKCC GAM TWC YKG\n \n \n \n \n \n \nATA CAC TGG GTG CGT CAG\n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 10)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nH2-H\n \nAAG GGC CTG GAA TGG GTT \nGCA GST RTT ASC SCA\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKCT GST GST TWC ASC TWC \nTAT GCC GAT AGG GTC\n \n \n \n \n \nAAG GGC\n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 11)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nH3-H\n \nACT GCC GTC TAT TAT TGT GCA \nCGC TWC RTT TWC\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTWC MTC SCA TWC \nGCT ATG GAC TAC TGG GGT CAA\n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 12)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nL1-H\n \nACC TGC CGT GCC AGT \nSAA GAM RTT KCC ASC KCT\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGTA GCC TGG TAT CAA CAG AAA C\n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 13)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nL2-H\n \nCCG AAG CTT CTG ATT \nTWC KCC \nGCA TCC \nTWC \nCTC\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTWC \nTCT GGA GTC CCT TCT CGC\n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 14)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nL3-H1\n \nGGA ACT TAT TAC TGT \nVAR VAR KCC TWC ASC ASC\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCCT \nSCA \nACG TTC GGA CAG GGT ACC\n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 15)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nL3-H2\n \nGCA ACT TAT TAC TGT \nVAR VAR GST TWC KCT RAC\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCCT \nTKG \nACG TTC GGA CAG GGT ACC\n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 16)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPhagemid Template Vectors for Shotgun Scanning Library Constructions\n\n\n(A) Phagemid pV350-2b\n\n\n\nPhagemid pV0350-2b, which was previously used to display h4D5 Fab, a humanized antibody against the extracellular domain (ECD) of EGF-related binding receptor 2 (ErbB2), monovalently on the surface of M13 bacteriophage and contained stop codon (TAA) in all three CDR in heavy chain (hc), served as the template for G6 heavy chain shotgun-scan library construction.\n\n\nMore specifically, the phagemid pV0350-2b was derived from the pS0643 phagemid. The phagemid vector, pS0643 (also known as phGHam-g3, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,666, Example 8), contains pBR322 and f1 origins of replication, an ampicillin-resistant gene, an \nE. coli \nalkaline phosphatase (phoA) promoter (Bass et al., (1990) \nProteins \n8:309-314), a sequence encoding a stII secretion signal sequence fused to residues 1-191 of human growth hormone (hGH) and a sequence encoding the C-terminal residues 267-421 of protein III of M13 phage (hereinafter, cP3 or pIII). The pS0643 phagemid also contains an XbaI site and an amber stop codon following residue 191 of hGH. The sill secretion signal sequence can export a protein to the periplasm of a bacteria cell (e.g., a light chain region (LC) of an antibody). The sequence encoding the human growth hormone (hGH) was removed from the pS0643 vector and replaced with a NsiI/XbaI nucleic acid fragment encoding a humanized anti-Her2 Fab fragment (“h4D5” sequence) ligated in frame with the stII secretion signal (humAb4D5-8, see Carter et al., (1992) \nPNAS \n89:4285-4289 therein or U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337, for sequence). The amber stop codon between the heavy chain fragment and cP3 was deleted, as this modification has been shown to increase the levels of Fab displayed on phage.\n\n\nThe h4D5 antibody is a humanized antibody that specifically recognizes a cancer-associated antigen known as Her-2 (erbB2). The h4d5 sequence was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using the humAb4D5 version 8 (“humAb4D5-8”) sequence and primers engineered to give rise to a 5′ NsiI site and a 3′ XbaI site in the PCR product (Carter et al., (1992) \nPNAS \n89:4285-4289). The PCR product was cleaved with NsiI and XbaI and ligated into the pS0643 phagemid vector. The h4D5 nucleic sequence encodes modified CDR regions from a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for Her-2 in a mostly human consensus sequence Fab framework. Specifically, the sequence contains a kappa light chain (LC region) upstream of VH and CH1 domains (HC region). The method of making the anti-Her-2 antibody and the identity of the variable domain sequences are provided in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,821,337 and 6,054,297. The pS0643 plasmid containing humanized 4D5 (version 8) was still further modified. For example, a herpes \nsimplex virus type\n 1 glycoprotein D epitope tag (gD tag—MADPNRFRGKDLGG (SEQ ID NO:17)) was added in frame to the c-terminus of the LC using site-directed mutagenesis. Following the stop codon downstream of the LC, a ribosome binding site and a nucleic acid molecule encoding a stII signal sequence were ligated to the N-terminus of the RC sequence. Consequently, the HC sequence is in frame with the C-terminal domain of the p3 (cP3), a minor coat protein of M13 phage. Thus, a Fab displayed on phage can be produced from one construct. This Fab phagemid vector is referred to as pV0350-2b and is schematically illustrated in \nFIG. 1\n. The light gene in pV0350-2b was further modified by mutating a few other amino acid residues, e.g., Arg66 to a Gly and S93 to Ala.\n\n\nTo generate F(ab)′2 displayed on phage, the PV0350-4 vector was further modified by inserting a dimerizable leucine zipper GCN4 sequence (GRMKQLEDKVEELLSKNYHLENEVARLKKLVGERG) (SEQ ID NO:18) between the HC and cP3 sequences by cassette mutagenesis. The GCN4 leucine zipper brings two sets of LC/HC-cP3 fusion polypeptides together in the \nE. coli \nperiplasm and presents the dimer on the surface of phage. This F(ab)′2 phagemid vector is referred to as pV0350-4 is also schematically illustrated in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\nFor G6-23 heavy chain shotgun-scan library construction, phagemid pW0448-2 was constructed by introducing G6-23 CDRL3 sequence into pV0350-2b phagemid using Kunkel mutagenesis method (Kunkel et al., (1991) \nMethods Enzymol \n204:125-139)). Phagemid pW0448-1 was also generated from pV0350-2b as template for G6 and G6-23 light chain shotgun-scanning library that contains the heavy chain variable domain of G6 and stop codon (TAA) in all three CDRs in light chain.\n\n\nConstruction of Shotgun Scanning Libraries\n\n\nPhage-displayed libraries were constructed using Kunkel mutagenesis method as described (Kunkel et al., 1991, supra). In total, eight libraries were generated: hcA-G6, hcA-G6.23, lcA-G6 and IcA-G6.23 were alanine scanning libraries of heavy chain (hc) or light chain (lc) of G6 and G6-23; hcH-G6, hcH-G6.23, lcH-G6, lcH-G6.23 were homolog scanning libraries.\n\n\nThe template containing TAA stop codon within all three heavy or light chain CDRs was simultaneously repaired during the mutagenesis reaction by the above mutagenic oligonucleotides with designed degenerate codons. After mutagenesis, 10 ug of DNA were electroporated into \nE. coli \nSS320 cells (˜10\n11 \ncells) (Sidhu et al., (2000) \nMethods Enzymol \n328:333-363), which were grown overnight at 30° C. in 2YT broth supplemented with M13-KO7 helper phage (New England Biolabs), 50 ug/mlcarbenicillin and kanamycin. Library sizes were 2-5×10\n9\n. Phage were concentrated from the culture media by precipitation with PEG/NaCl and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as described previously (Sidhu et al., 2000, supra).\n\n\nLibrary Sorting and Screening Assays\n\n\nProtein target, VEGF or anti-gD tag antibody (provided by Genentech research groups), was immobilized on NUNC (Roskilde, Denmark) 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates overnight at 4° C., and before sorting, the plates were blocked with bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) for 2 hours at room temperature (RT). Phage libraries from the above preparation (˜10\n13 \nphage/ml) were incubated in the target-coated immunoplates for 1 h at RT to allow for phage binding. Plates were then washed 15 times with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 (PST) buffer, and bound phage were eluted with 0.1 M HCl for 15 minutes and neutralized with 1.0 M Tris base. Eluted phage were propagated in \nE. coli \nXL1-blue (Stratagene) for the next round of selection.\n\n\nIndividual clones selected from the second round of panning were grown in a 96-well plate overnight at 37° C. with 150 ul of 2YT broth supplemented with 50 ug/ml carbenicillin and M13-VCS helper phage (1:2500)(Stratagene). The culture supernatants were directly used in phage competitive enzyme-linked immuno-absorbant assays (phage ELISAs) to screen functional phage-displayed G6 or G6-23 Fab variants binding to target proteins coated on the plate (Sidhu et al., 2000, supra). The clones exhibited both positive phage ELISA signals to VEGF antigen and anti-gD tag antibody were subjected to DNA sequence analysis.\n\n\nDNA Sequencing and Analysis\n\n\nThe functional clones from the above screening were grown in 96-well plates with 100 ul of 2YT broth and 50 ug/ml carbenicillin at 37° C. for 2 hours. A small amount of culture supernatants (1˜2 ul) served as template for PCRs (GeneAmp® PCR System 9700, Applied Biosystems) to amplify the phagemid DNA fragments containing the light and heavy chain genes with sequencing primers to add M13 (−21) universal sequences at the 5′ end of the amplified fragments, thus facilitating the use of M13 forward primers in sequencing reactions. Amplified DNA fragments in a 96-well format were sequenced using Big-Dye terminator sequencing reactions and analyzed on an ABI Prism 3700 96-capillary DNA analyzer (PE Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) by Genentech DNA sequencing group. The sequences were analyzed with the program SGCOUNT as described previously (Weiss et al., (2000) \nPNAS USA \n97:8950-8954).\n\n\nThe following number of functional clones in parenthesis selected from each library against VEGF antigen was subjected to DNA sequence analysis: hcA-G6 (107), hcA-G6-23 (124), lcA-G6 (111), lcA-G6-23 (102), hcH-G6 (111), hcH-G6-23 (135), lcH-G6 (106), lcH-G6-23 (97). For the clones from anti-gD tag antibody binding selection: hcA-G6 (108), hcA-G6-23 (130), 1cA-G6 (116), lcA-G6-23 (98), hcH-G6 (120), hcH-G6-23 (122), lcH-G6 (111), lcH-G6-23 (102).\n\n\nFab G6 and G6-23 Point Mutants and Affinity Measurements\n\n\nTo generate G6 and G6-23 Fab mutants for affinity measurements, we used a previously modified Fab expression plasmid from phage-displayed vector with an \nE. coli \nalkaline phosphatase (phoA) promoter (Presta et al., (1997) \nCancer Res \n57:4593-4599). Each point mutant was constructed using the Kunkel site-directed mutagenesis method (Kunkel et al., 1991, supra) with oligonucleotides designed to have point mutation within CDRs. For mutant productions, expression plasmids were transformed into 34B8 \nE. coli \ncells, and a single colony was picked and grown in complete C.R.A.P. medium (Presta et al., 1997, supra) supplemented with 25 ug/ml carbenicillin at 30° C. for 24 h. The expressed recombinant proteins were purified through a Protein G high trap column (Amersham Pharmacia) and quantitated by UV absorption at 280 nm (Presta et al., 1997, supra). The binding affinities of G6 and G6-23 Fab mutants were evaluated using competitive solution binding ELISA with hVEGF displaying phage as described. The fold reduction in wild-type VEGF phage binding activity due to each point mutation was determined by dividing the IC\n50 \nfor the G6 or G6-23 point mutant by the IC\n50 \nfor wild-type G6 or G6-23 Fab respectively. BIACORE™ binding analysis for FabG6 and G6-23 variants\n\n\nFor binding kinetics, surface plasmon resonance (SRP) measurement with a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) was used as previously described (Karlsson & Fält, (1997) \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n200:121-133). Carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CMS, BIAcore Inc.) were activated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Human VEGF (hVEGF) was diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5 ug/ml (˜0.2 uM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 ul/minute to achieve approximately 100 response units (RU) of coupled protein followed by the injection of 1M ethanolamine to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of G6 or G6-23 Fab variants (0.7 nM to 100 nM) were injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25° C. at a flow rate of 25 ul/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) were calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore™ Evaluation Software version 3.2). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. Based on the selection of the phage library, two residues in heavy chain CDR2 appeared to prefer to be alanine or homologous amino acid: HC-Y58 preferred to be alanine, HC-I51 preferred to be valine for binding VEGF. We therefore generated mutant protein Fab with a single mutation to confirm the finding from phage libraries. The top graph in \nFIG. 9\n shows that the BIAcore analysis of mutation G6-23-Y58A (G6-23.1) (50 nM) binding to human VEGF coated chip improved the binding on-rate compared to G6-23, which already had a much improved on-rate compared to G6. The lower graph showed the BIAcore analysis of mutant G6-Y58A (G6-1) or G6-151V (G6-2) to VEGF coated chip. Both had improved on-rate compared to G6. In fact, the double mutant (Y58A/151V) had an additive effect on the on-rate improvement for G6 and G6-23.\n\n\nResults of Shotgun Scanning of G6 and G6-23\n\n\nThe results of both shotgun scanning on G6 and G6-23 antibodies indicated that heavy chain CDR side-chains dominated the binding interactions with hVEGF. When mapped onto the X-ray crystal structure of G6 Fab, the functionally important residues in combination represent a portion of the structural epitope, which is defined by the residues in direct contact with hVEGF. The shotgun alanine-scan results revealed the functional epitope comprising the solvent-exposed ridge, which was composed of residues Y32, W33, G54, V96, F97, F98, L99, and Y100a on the heavy chain and Y49 on the light chain. Interestingly, the numbers of functionally important residues revealed by the shotgun homolog-scan were significantly smaller and contained within the group of residues that were important functionally in the shotgun alanine-scan. These hot spots are W33, G54, V96, F97, and L99, which constitute a small patch that overlapped in both scans, suggesting that this surface makes precise contact with the antigen hVEGF that even homologous amino acid substitutions were disruptive. G55 was substituted with alanine only in the homolog scan and it was a highly disruptive, so we believe that G55 is also within this patch.\n\n\nOther functional important residues revealed by both scans on the heavy chain, G50 and T52, are not part of the solvent-exposed surface of G6 since they are buried inside according to the structural information, acting as scaffolding side-chains that pack against residues in the functional epitope in order to hold this epitope in a binding-competent conformation (C. Wiesmann, unpublished results). As for F95 in CDR-H3 of G6, definitely, alanine substitution at this position in alanine-scan was disruptive; nonetheless, this residue is capable of tolerating tyrosine substitution in homolog-scan, suggesting that its role is in maintaining the structure integrity of the antigen-binding site, which has also been confirmed with structural information.\n\n\nFor Y32, F98, and Y100a, the structural information demonstrated that these surface residues were critical and represented 30% of total heavy chain buried surface areas upon binding hVEGF. The alanine substitutions at these residues were definitely disruptive for affinity with significant function ratios (F\nwt/mut \nvalue) greater than 30, yet interestingly, they tolerated homologous amino acid substitutions (Tyr for Phe and vice versa), suggesting that the aromatic rings for these positions were making the important interactions with hVEGF antigen, and adding or removing the hydroxyl group was not making much impact, which was distinct from the above scaffolding residues.\n\n\nBoth shotgun scans identified new mutations in the heavy chain for further affinity improvement, which were 151V and Y58A. These intriguing observations were verified through producing Fab point mutants, and testing binding activity with competitive ELISA and BIAcore™ (\nFIG. 23\n and \nFIG. 18\n). Because 151 and Y58 are not the members of structural epitope (C. Wiesmann, unpublished results), it was believed that the affinity improvement, especially in on-rate, with single or double mutation was not from the introduction of new contact with antigen hVEGF, but probably through optimizing the structure integrity of CDR-H2 loop, to make it more competent for antigen binding.\n\n\nBased on the structural epitope, G6 light chain CDR residues represented 25% of total structural epitope surface (878 Å\n2\n) (C. Wiesmann, unpublished results). Interestingly, the only residue that showed functional importance in both shotgun scanning was Y49 in CDR-L2, which only stood for 2% of the total structural epitope surface, suggesting that most structural epitope residues in the light chain were not involved in the energetic contact with hVEGF antigen. This readout implies that G6 light chain is more important structurally than functionally since it still retained the same sequence as 4D5, the template used for displaying antibody library on the phage where G6 was isolated from in the first place (Carter et al., 1992).\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nG6 and G6-23 Derived Antibodies\n\n\n(a) Libraries for Selection\n\n\nAdditional anti-VEGF antibodies were obtained by sorting phage from the shotgun alanine and homolog scanning libraries described in Example 2. Specifically, at particular residues, scanned residues were allowed to vary as either wild type or alanine (alanine scan), or either wild type or a homologue residue (homolog scan). (\nFIGS. 14A\n and B). For the G6, shotgun alanine and homolog scanning were performed on the G6 light chain and heavy chain separately, resulting in four libraries. For G623, shotgun alanine and homolog scanning were performed on the G623 light chain, and shotgun homolog scanning was performed on G623 heavy chain, resulting in three libraries. A G623 shotgun alanine scanning library was not prepared because, as discussed above, G623 is a high affinity antibody, with most of its residues critical for binding located in the heavy chain. Mutating heavy chain residues to alanine, which means truncating the heavy chain amino acid side chains, would most likely disrupt binding and result in lower affinity antibody variants.\n\n\n(b) Selecting Anti-VEGF Antibodies\n\n\nIn the first round, a plate sorting strategy was used for selection. Human VEGF (hVEGF, provided by Genentech Research Groups) was immobilized on 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates (NUNC) by incubating wells with 5 ug/ml of protein target over night at 4° C. The plates were blocked with 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, Sigma) for 30 min in RT, after which 1% Tween20 was added for additional 30 min. The phage libraries described above were incubated on the hVEGF coated immunoplates at a concentration of ˜1E13 phage/ml for 1 h in RT under agitation, to allow binding of the phage displayed Fab to the target. After binding, plates were washed 15 times with PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween20. Bound phage were eluted by incubating wells with 0.1 M HCl for 30 min. Elutions were neutralized with 1.0 M Tris base, \npH\n 11. \nE. Coli \nXL1-blue (Stratagene) were infected with the eluted phage and M13-K07 helper phage (New England Biolabs). The phage was propagated over night for the next round of selection.\n\n\nThe bacterial culture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 4° C. and the supernatant collected. The phage was precipitated from the media by addition of 1/5 volume of PEG/NaCl. After 5 min incubation on ice the phage containing culture media was centrifuged at 10 krpm for 15 min in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 4° C. and the supernatant discarded. The remaining phage pellet was resuspended in PBS and centrifuged at 15 krpm for 5 min in a SS-34 rotor at 4° C. to pellet insoluble matter. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and the phage concentration was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 268 nm.\n\n\nThe following rounds of sorting were performed by a solution-phase sorting method with increasing stringency. Purified phage was incubated with biotinylated hVEGF for 1 hour at RT in PBS with 0.05% Tween20 and 0.5% Superblock (Pierce). After three to ten-fold dilution with superblock, the mixture was added to neutravidin coated wells blocked with 1% BSA (Sigma) and Tween20. The hVEGF-conjugated biotin was allowed to bind the immobilized neutravidin for 10 min. After capture the plate was washed 10-15 times with 0.05% Tween20 in PBS. To study the background, i.e. nonspecific binding on the phage to neutravidin, a control reaction lacking the biotinylated hVEGF was added to a coated well. The stringency was increased each round by decreasing antigen concentration in solution, as well as phage concentration or increasing temperature. Increasing the number of washes is also a way to achieve more stringent conditions. For the third and fourth round of sorting non-biotinylated hVEGF was added to the reaction mix of biotin-hVEGF and library phage to compete off low affinity binders. By adding 1000 fold excess of competitor for 30 min in 37° C. before capturing, stringency could be increased additionally in the last rounds in order to select for high affinity binders. Manipulating binding and capture times could further increase the stringency from round to round.\n\n\nFor G623 the starting concentration of biotinylated hVEGF was 1 nM for the heavy chain shotgun library and 0.2 nM for the light chain shotgun-scanning library. The concentration was decreased to 0.5 nM and 0.1 nM respectively in the last round. For G6, with lower starting affinity than G623, library sorting was performed with less stringent starting conditions; 5 nM for heavy chain libraries and 2 nM for the light chain libraries, which was decreased to 1.75 and 0.5 nM respectively in the last round of sorting.\n\n\nTo study the enrichment of hVEGF specific Fabs displayed on the phage, 90 ul \nE. Coli \nXL-Blue (Stratagene) was infected with 10 ul phage elution from the captured library binding reactions as well as the background mixtures for 30 min at 37° \nC. A\n 5 ul culture was plated out on carbencillin supplemented plates and incubated at 37° C. over night. The number of phage particles in the elution could be calculated from the number of colonies from each elution. After the last two rounds of sorting, 50 ul of the above mentioned culture of phagemid-containing bacteria was plated out on carbencillin-supplemented plates and grown over night at 37° C. The resulting clones were subject to screening.\n\n\n(c) Single Spot Competitive ELISA\n\n\nTo screen for high affinity clones a high-throughput single point competitive ELISA assay in 96-well format was performed. For both antibodies approximately a hundred clones from the last two rounds of selection were picked randomly and screened in this assay. Phagemid containing \nE. Coli \nXL1-blue clones were grown in 400 ul rich 2YT broth, supplemented with carbencillin and M13-KO7 helper phage (New England Biolabs) by shaking over night at 37° C. The culture supernatant of each clone was diluted five times with 0.05% Tween20 and 0.5% BSA in PBS with addition of hVEGF as well as without. After 1 h incubation by shaking in RT, 80 ul of the reactions were transferred to hVEGF-coated immunoplates and incubated for 10 min. The plate was washed 8 times with 0.05% Tween20 in PBS and incubated 30 min with 100 ul anti-M13 antibody horseradish conjugate (New England Biolabs) diluted 5000 times in PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween20 and 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma). The plates were washed an additional 8 times and developed with TMB substrate for 5 min. The reactions were stopped with 1.0 M H\n3\nPO\n4 \nand read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. To estimate the relative affinity, the ratio of the optical density in the presence of hVEGF to that of the absence of hVEGF was calculated. A low ratio suggests that most Fab displayed on on the phage bound hVEGF in solution. As a consequence little Fab can bind to the immobilized hVEGF on the immunoplate. Clones showing lower ratio than wild type (WT) G6 or G623 were selected and, their supernatants used to infect XL1-blue. Phagemid containing bacteria were streaked out on carbencillin plates and grown over night at 37° C. for sequencing.\n\n\nThe selection of the G6 heavy chain libraries resulted in no more than three unique sequences out of the 33 clones analyzed, suggesting that most G6 heavy chain changes result in loss of binding affinity. Furthermore, all unique heavy chain variants derived were from the homolog scan library. It seems that alanine mutation of G6 heavy chain residues can result in a dramatic loss of binding. This intolerance to changes in amino acid sequence selection supports the view that G6 heavy chain harbors many key residues for VEGF binding. The single spot assay result is summarized in Table 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle Spot Summary\n\n\nG623\n\n\nG6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary\n\n\nLC Ala\n\n\nLC Hom\n\n\nHC Hom\n\n\nLC Ala and Hom\n\n\nHC Ala and Hom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of clones screened\n\n\n84\n\n\n84\n\n\n88\n\n\n88\n\n\n96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelection Critieria\n\n\nClones with significantly lower ratio (Signal + hVEGF/Signal − hVEGF) than WT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCut Off\n\n\nCut off = 2 fold reduction\n\n\nCut off = 5 fold reduction\n\n\nCut Off = WT ratio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Clones with ratio < \nWT\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n17\n\n\n29\n\n\n56\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of \nunique clones\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n12\n\n\n18\n\n\n53\n\n\n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults from Single spot assay of G6 and G623 variants. Similar selection crieria was used for both antibody libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, lower cut off was used for G6 LC library compared to G6 HC library as HC variants were expected to show less affinity improvment compared to WT than LC variants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG6 alanine and homologe libraries were pooled before screening of heavy chain and light chain variants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of unique clones from the selected pool was determined by DNA sequencing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLC = Light Chain,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHC = Heavy Chain,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT = Wild Type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHom = Homolog scanning library,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAla = Alanine scanning library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) DNA Sequencing and Analysis\n\n\nClones selected from the single spot screening were grown in 96-well plates with 100 ul 2YT broth supplemented with carbencillin for 2 hours. 1 ul of the culture was subjected to PCR (GeneAmp® PCR System 9700, Applied Biosystems) in order to amplify the DNA encoding the light chain or heavy chain of the different clones. The primers used in the PCR reaction were designed to add M13 universal sequences at the 5′ end of the amplified fragment. By adding this sequence, M13 forward primers could be used in the following sequencing reactions. After amplification in 96-well format, the DNA fragments were sequenced by Genentech DNA sequencing group using Big-Dye terminator sequencing reactions and analyzed with an ABI Prism 3700 96-capillary DNA analyzer. (PE Biosystems, Fosters City, Calif.). The heavy and light chain sequences were aligned and identical sequences eliminated. Based on their sequence, clones were selected for affinity determination by IC50 measurement.\n\n\n(e) Affinity Measurement of Phage Clones\n\n\nThe IC50 values for the phage clones were determined by competitive phage ELISA. A single colony of the selected clones was grown in 5 ml 2YT media supplemented with 50 ug/ml carbencillin for 5 hours. The culture was then infected with M13-K07 helper phage (New England Biolabs) for 1 h and transferred to a 25 ml culture supplemented with 50 ug/ml carbencillin and 50 ug/ml kanamycin. The phage was propagated over night at 37° C. After phage purification as described above, the phage was serially diluted with 0.05% Tween20 and 0.5% BSA in PBS and incubated on a hVEGF-coated immunoplate to assess antigen binding at different phage concentrations. The phage dilution that gave ˜70% saturating signal was used in the IC50 determination assay. Phage was incubated with increasing concentration of hVEGF over night at 37° C. The unbound phage was captured on an hVEGF coated immunoplate for 10 min. The plate was washed, and the bound phage was detected with an anti-M13 antibody horseradish conjugate (New England Biolabs) followed by TMB development, as previously described. The hVEGF concentration that inhibited 50% of phage binding to the immobilized antigen represented the IC50. The signals, which indicate bound phage, were plotted against the hVEGF concentration, and the data was fitted to a competitive binding curve by non-linear regression, enabling IC\n50 \ndetermination.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 34 and 35\n show the IC\n50 \nvalues of G6 and G6-23 variants, respectively, as well as the alterations in sequences compared to G6 or G6-23. From the G6 pool, many binders with apparent better affinity than wild type G6 were identified. Many more affinity-improved G6 variants were derived from the light chain homolog library (\nFIG. 34A\n). However, two higher affinity G6 variants were selected from the heavy chain homolog scan library (\nFIG. 34B\n).\n\n\nSome G6 variants showed up to a hundred-fold affinity improvement, according to the IC\n50 \ndeterminations. Of the few G6 heavy chain variants selected, they differed in only a few residues from wild type G6. These heavy chain mutations were located in CDR-H1 and CDR-H2. The conserved nature of the heavy chain, and CDR-H3 in particular, confirmed that most residues important for G6 binding to hVEGF are present in this region. Mutations were more abundant in the G6 light chain variants. They were mainly located in CDR-L1 and CDR-L3 regions, indicating that changing CDR-L2 residues impairs binding instead of improving affinity. A combination of mutations in CDR-L1 and CDR-L3 seem to be favorable for binding, allowing significant affinity improvement compared to wild type.\n\n\nMost G623 variants showed similar or slightly reduced binding affinity compared to wild type according to their IC\n50 \nvalues (\nFIG. 35\n). The highest affinity variants were derived from both homolog and alanine light chain shotgun library. Only a small number of high affinity binders were identified in the heavy chain shotgun scan pool. As for G6, heavy chain residues were conserved, and only few mutations present among the clones studied. The light chain variants also showed a similar mutation-pattern as G6 variants, with most changes located in CDR-L1 and CDR-L3.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nAlanine Scanning of hVEGF to Map Anti-VEGF Antibody Binding Sites\n\n\nTo understand the molecular basis of the cross reactivity of G6 and G6-23 and to map their functional epitopes, the relative binding affinities of G6 or G6-23 Fab for individual alanine-substituted hVEGF mutants versus wild type hVEGF were measured using hVEGF displaying phage ELISA as previously described (Muller et al., (1997) \nPNAS USA \n94:7192-7197). hVEGF was mutated at sites near the binding epitopes of Flt-1, KDR, the Avastin™ antibody and Y0317 with Kunkel mutagenesis method and phage displaying the individual mutant was generated as described previously (Muller et al., (1997) \nPNAS USA \n94:7192-7197). Solution binding phage ELISAs were used to determine the relative binding affinity of each mutant VEGF mutant versus wild type (wt) VEGF on Fab G6-23, G6-23. Briefly, 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates (NUNC) were coated overnight at 4° C. with G6 or G6-23 Fab at a concentration of 2 ug/ml in PBS, and blocked with PBS, 0.5% BSA, and 0.05% Tween20 (PBT) for 2 h at room temperature. Serial dilutions of phage displaying hVEGF mutants in PBT were first incubated on the G6-Fab-coated plates for 15 min at room temperature, and the plates were washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween20 (PBST). Bound phage were detected with anti-M13 monoclonal antibody horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia) conjugate diluted 1:5000 in PBT, developed with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Kirkegaard & Perry Labs, Gaithersburg, Md.) substrate for approximately 5 min, quenched with 1.0 M H\n3\nPO\n4\n, and read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. The relative IC\n50 \nvalues (IC\n50,Ala\n/IC\n50,wt\n) to represent the fold of reduction in binding affinity, and evaluate the energetic contribution of individual side-chains of hVEGF for interacting with G6 or G6-23 Fab were calculated.\n\n\nThe ratios of IC50 represented the energetic contribution of the individual side chain in the interaction with G6 Fab (\nFIG. 19\n). The general folding of alanine mutants, especially ones that had significant reduction in binding G6, was verified by its near-wild type binding to other molecules that have distinct epitopes on VEGF, such as the Avastin™ antibody, Y0317 or Flt-1, as mapped previously (\nFIG. 19\n). It is evident that G6 had a distinct epitope as compared to hybridoma derived Avastin™ antibody. All functionally important hVEGF residues for binding G6 were conserved between human and murine VEGF, thus explaining in part its cross reactivity. The Fab of the Avastin™ antibody (Fab-12) and Y0317, on the other hand, lost most of their binding to VEGF upon alanine substitution at residue Gly88, which is Ser in mVEGF. To visualize the epitope on a VEGF molecule, functionally important residues for binding G6 were highlighted on the surface of hVEGF crystal structure according to their relative affinities for G6. G6 epitope mapped to a patch that was conserved between human and mouse VEGF and dotted with a few energetically important residues, Phe17, Tyr21, Tyr, 11e83 and G1n89, which clustered in close proximity. This is indicative of a functional epitope with an interaction “hot spot”.\n\n\nWe next compared the functional epitope of G6 to the structural epitope of Fab-12 (same as Y0317) or Flt-1D2, the VEGF residues that became buried upon forming a complex with these molecules based on the crystal structure of the complex. Interestingly, the functional epitope of G6 on VEGF matches the structural epitope for Flt-1D2 more closely than does the structural epitope of Fab-12. Further, G6 shared a similar hot spot as Flt-1 for VEGF since residues Phe17, Tyr21 and Tyr25 were highly important energetically for both interactions (\nFIG. 19\n). Fab-12 or Y0317, on the other hand, centered on the non-conserved and functionally important residue, Gly88, which is believed to be the reason for its lack of binding to mVEGF. It appeared that phage library derived antibody G6 targeted a conserved epitope on VEGF in a nearly identical fashion as the VEGF receptor, while a hybridoma for hVEGF avoided generating a self-reactive anti-mouse antibody. There was, however, sufficient overlap between the two epitopes of G6 and Fab-12 as the binding of G6 and Fab-12 (Y0317) to hVEGF were mutually exclusive (data not shown).\n\n\nComparing the important sites on hVEGF for binding G6 and G6-23 indicated that the residues contributing most energetically, F17, Y21, and Y25 on 20's helix, and Q89A on 80's loop, remained the same, except the impact of residues on binding seemed to change (\nFIG. 19\n). For example, residues Y21 and Q89 when changed to alanine became a bigger hit for G6-23 than for G6. There were sites that modestly decreased its relative impact of its side chain in binding to G6-23 as compared to G6, e.g., I83, H86, and I91A.\n\n\nThere were no new functionally important residues observed for the affinity-improved version, G6-23, yet a shuffling of energetic contributions among these functionally important residues in both antibodies, which was consistent with the finding structurally that identical positions of hVEGF were buried upon complexing with G6 or G6-23 (structural data below). When mapping these functionally important residues along with other moderate contributors on hVEGF structure, they appeared as a contiguous patch within the structural epitope of Flt-1D2, which were highly conserved between human and mouse VEGF, which explains the fact that both antibodies had equal affinity for both VEGF. By comparison of the footprint of both structural and functional epitopes for G6 on hVEGF structure, it clearly showed that heavy chain CDR residues were the ones making contact with the positions on VEGF where alanine mutations were disruptive, such as the 20's helix and 80′ loop of hVEGF, whereas light chain CDR residues contact the 60's loop of hVEGF where the side chains were not functionally as important.\n\n\nThe dilutions of phage that produced the sub-maximal binding signal (50-70%) were used in the solution competition assay where wild type or mutant hVEGF phage in PBT buffer were first incubated with increasing concentration of competing G6 or G6-23 Fab for 1-2 h at room temperature, then the mixtures were transferred to G6-Fab-coated plates to capture the unbound phage for 15 min, and bound phage were detected as described above. Competition curves were fitted with a four-parameter non-linear regression curve-fitting program (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software) to determine the IC\n50 \nvalues which were calculated as the concentration of G6 or G6-23 Fab in solution binding stage that inhibited 50% of the phage from binding to immobilized G6 Fab. The ratio of the IC\n50 \nof mutant versus wild type hVEGF is the relative fold difference in binding affinities. For mutants that have severe reduced binding to G6-Fab-coated plate, Fab12 (Presta, 1997) or Flt-1\nD1-5 \nwere used as coat to capture to mutant phage after incubations with G6 or G6-23 Fab. Binding of hVEGF-phage to G6, G6-23 Fab, Fab12, Fab and Flt-1\nD1-5 \nwere mutually exclusive as tested with wild type VEGF phage.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nStructural Mapping of VEGF Binding Sites on G6 and G6-23 and of G6 Binding Sites on VEGF by Crystallography\n\n\nExpression, Purification Crystallization and Structural Analysis\n\n\nResidues 8-109 of human VEGF were expressed, refolded, and purified as previously described (Christinger, H. W., et al., (1996). \nProt. Struct. Funct Genet. \n26, 353-357).\n\n\nG6 Fab was expressed in \nE. coli \nand the cell paste was thawed into PBS, 25 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF. The mixture was homogenized and then passed twice through a microfluidizer. The suspension was then centrifuged at 12 k rpm for 60 min. The protein was loaded onto a Protein G column previously equilibrated with PBS at 5 ml/min. The column was washed with PBS to baseline and then eluted with 0.58% acetic acid. Fractions containing G6 Fab were pooled and loaded directly onto a SP-sepharose column equilibrated with 20 mM MES, pH 5.5. The protein was eluted with a salt gradient of 0 to 0.25 M NaCl.\n\n\nG6 eluted from the SP-sepharose column was mixed with hVEGF8-109 and further purified over a \nSuperdex\n 200 column equilibrated with 30 mM Tris .Cl, pH 7.5 and 0.4 M NaCl. Fractions containing the complex were pooled, concentrated and used in crystallization trials. Crystals were grown at 19° C. using vapor diffusion method in sitting drops. Crystallization buffer containing 2.0 M ammonium sulfate and 5% iso-propanol was mixed in equal volume with protein solution (8 mg/ml protein). Crystals appeared after 3 days and belonged to space group P3121 with cell dimensions of a=117.9 Å and c=212.6 Å. These crystal forms contained 1 complex comprising of a VEGF dimer and 2 Fab molecules in the asymmetric unit.\n\n\nThe crystals were soaked in mother liquor, dipped in artificial mother liquor containing 25% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. A 2.8 Å data set was collected on an SSRL Synchrotron Source on beam line 9-1. The data were reduced using programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, Z. (1993). DENZO. In \nData Collection and Processing\n, L. Sawyer, N. Isaacs, and S. Bailey, eds. (Warrington, UK: 1993)).\n\n\nStructure Determination and Refinement\n\n\nThe structure was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of VEGF (from PDB code 1FLT), constant and variable domains of the antibody in 1BJ1 (Brookhaven database) and program AMoRe (CCP4 1994). Model building was done with \nprogram\n 0 and refinement with Refmac (CCP4 1994). The final Rvalue and Rfree are 19.87% and 23.92%, respectively.\n\n\nThe following programs were used to calculate the surface areas of interaction RESAREA version 3.2: 5, Aug. 1993 and AREAIMOL version 3.2: 19, Dec. 1995. These programs are part of the CCP4 suite Collaborative Computational Project, \nNumber\n 4. 1994 (“The CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography” Acta Cryst. D50, 760-763).\n\n\nThe surface area of each residue of an anti-VEGF antibody that is buried in VEGF (Å\n2\n), is reported below, together with the percentage of the total surface area of the residue that is buried. Also reported is the surface area of each residue of VEGF antibod that is buried in VEGF (Å\n2\n) is reported below together with the percentage of the total surface area of the residue that is buried. See values for G6:VEGF, G6-23:VEGF, Fab-12:VEGF, YADS-1:VEGF and YADS-2:VEGF complex below. In all cases, because VEGF is a dimer, the residue numbers of VEGF referring to monomer 1 (of the VEGF dimer) are 8-109 and residue numbers of VEGF referring to monomer 2 (of the VEGF dimer) are 1008-1109. The first column in each table below recites the residue numbers of the protein being examined (either VEGF or an anti-VEGF antibody) (e.g., for section (a) below, \nPHE A\n 17 refers to F17, LYS A1048 refers to K48; MET A1081 refers to \nMET\n 81 of VEGF). The second column recites the buried surface of that residue (Å\n2\n).

These results help describe the regions in VEGF and the regions in the antibodies that contact one another. Together with functional data relating to the binding VEGF presented earlier, common features of the G6 series of antibodies and the B20 series of antibodies (structural data not shown) can be observed. G6, G6-23 and B20 antibodies, as well as others bound to both mouse and human VEGF with relatively high affinities, unlike Fab-12 or YO317 (data not shown). Mutations of human VEGF G88A or G88S severely affected binding of Fab-12 or YO317 to VEGF, whereas the G6 series of antibodies and the B20 series of antibodies (structural data not shown) were relatively unaffected. Further, the binding of antibodies such as Fab-12 to VEGF resulted in the surface area of G88 being 100% buried whereas the binding of G6 and G6-23 resulted in G88 being less than 66% buried. Thus, it is believed that although partial contact with G88 is allowable for antibodies having the property of recognizing both mouse and human VEGF with good affinity, it is not likely that antibodies that contact human VEGF such that the surface area of Gly88 of human VEGF is 80% or more buried will bind to both mouse and human VEGF with good affinity. The functional epitope mapping results also show that the footprint of the G series of antibodies on VEGF is different from Fab-12 in that it has a greater contact extending into the 20s helix of VEGF (approximately residues numbered 10-30 of human VEGF) as well as contacting residues in the 80s loop (approximately residues 80-94 of human VEGF). The structural studies correlate well with the functional studies (see \nFIG. 19\n) in that mutations to several residues in the 20s helix decrease binding of the G6 and B20 series antibodies. The functional studies described in \nFIG. 19\n indicate that the G6 and the B20 series antibodies interact well with residues that are important for both Flt-1 and KDR binding as compared to A4.6.1\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nTetranomial Diversity libraries\n\n\nTo investigate whether a small subset of the natural amino acids could be used to generate antigen-binding surfaces, we constructed naïve heavy chain phage-displayed libraries of antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) based on the humanized Fab4D5 (30), which recognizes the extracellular domain of the human receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 (Fendly, B. M., et al., (1990), \nCancer Res. \n50:1550-1558). First, a previously described phagemid was modified to display bivalent Fab4D5 (Fab′-zip) on the surface of M13 bacteriophage. The gene coding for the Fab′-zip was fused to the C-terminal domain of the M13 gene-3 minor coat protein and expressed under the control of the phoA promoter (Lee, V., et al., (2004) \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n284:119-132). The phagemid was modified by a single mutation in the light chain (R66G) and by the introduction of TAA stop codons into all three heavy chain CDRs. For each library construction, the resulting phagemid (pV-0116c) was used as the “stop template” in a mutagenesis reaction with oligonucleotides designed to repair simultaneously the stop codons and introduce designed mutations at the desired sites, as described previously (Sidhu, S. S. et al., (2004) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n338(2):299-310; Sidhu, S S et al., (2000) \nMethods in Enzymology \n328:333-363).\n\n\na. Construction of KMT Library\n\n\nSolvent-accessible positions within the heavy chain CDRs encoded by the phagemid were replaced by a single type of degenerate codon, KMT, that produced equal proportions of four amino acids (Y, A, D, S). The number of possible tetranomial combinations of the 20 natural amino acids is too great to be investigated exhaustively, and thus, we chose combinations that fulfilled two criteria. Firstly, we were restricted to combinations that could be accessed with standard DNA synthesis methods. Secondly, we ensured that each tetranomial set contained at least one small amino acid (glycine, serine or alanine), as we reasoned that small residues would provide conformational flexibility and prevent steric crowding. A total of 18 positions were chosen for randomization: \npositions\n 28 and 30-33 in CDR-H1; positions 50, 52, 53, 54, 56 and 58 in CDR-H2; and positions 95-100a in CDR-H3. Each constructed library contained ˜10\n10 \nunique members, and thus, the library diversities were only about one order of magnitude less than the maximum theoretical diversity (4\n18\n=)7×10\n10\n. The KMT library name corresponds to the degenerate codon used; equimolar DNA degeneracies are represented by IUB code (K=G/T, M=A/C, R=A/G, S=G/C, W=A/T, Y=C/T).\n\n\nb. Sorting and Binding Assays for the KMT library\n\n\nPhage from the naïve heavy chain library was cycled through rounds of binding selection with either human vascular endothelial growth factor (hVEGF) or other antigens on 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates (NUNC) as the capture target, as described previously (Sidhu, S. S. et al., (2004) supra; Sidhu, S S et al., (2000) \nMethods in Enzymology \n328:333-363). Bound phage were eluted with 0.1 M HCl for 10 min and the eluant was neutralized with 1.0 M Tris base. Phage were propogated in \nE. coli \nXL1-blue (Stratagene) with the addition of M13-KO7 helper phage (New England Biolabs).\n\n\nAfter three rounds of selection, individual clones were grown in a 96-well format in 500 ul of 2YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin and M13-KO7. The culture supernatants were used in phage ELISAs to detect positive clones that bound to antigen-coated plates but not to BSA-coated plates (Sidhu, S. S. et al., (2004) supra). Positive clones were subjected to DNA sequence analysis and assessed for antigen-specific binding with phage enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISAs) (Sidhu, S. S. et al., (2004) supra). Approximately 100 clones were screened against each antigen and specific binding clones were identified in each case. DNA sequencing revealed the number of unique clones isolated against each antigen. At least one tyrosine-containing library was successful against each antigen. In particular, Library-KMT was successful against 3 of the 4 antigens and generated 11 unique clones against human vascular endothelial growth factor (hVEGF).\n\n\nc. Second KMT library—Light Chain diversity\n\n\nWe constructed new versions of the KMT Library in which the CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 diversities were the same as described above, but the diversity of CDR-H3 was increased by allowing for all possible length variations ranging from 3-15 residues inserted between \nresidues\n 94 and 100b. Altogether, the pooled libraries contained a diversity of ˜10\n1\n° unique members that were cycled through selections for binding to hVEGF. Phage ELISA screens identified 93 hVEGF binders and DNA sequencing revealed 15 unique sequences (\nFIG. 36\n). Most of the clones contained CDR-H3 sequences with seven inserted residues, but we also identified two clones that contained longer insertions. The unique clones were subjected to competitive phage ELISAs (Sidhu, S. S. et al., (2004) supra) and exhibited estimated affinities in the 10 micromolar range (data not shown).\n\n\nd. Affinity Maturation of Unique Clones from Second KMT Library\n\n\nWe next investigated whether the low affinity anti-VEGF clones could be affinity matured to obtain Fabs with affinities comparable to those of natural antibodies. To this end, we recombined the 15 heavy chains (\nFIG. 36\n) with a light chain library in which 12 solvent-accessible positions were replaced with the same tetranomial KMT codon. Specifically, the following light chain positions were randomized: positions 28-32 in CDR-L1, positions 50 and 53 in CDR-L2, and positions 91-94 and 96 in CDR-L3. The libraries contained ˜10\n10 \nunique members which greatly exceeded the theoretical diversity of possible light chains (4\n12\n=2×10\n7\n). The phagemid selected for the display of a heavy chain sequence and above light chain sequence had been modified by the introduction of TAA stop codons into all three light chain CDRs. The resulting phagemid was used as the “stop template” in a mutagenesis reaction that repaired the stop codons and introduced desired mutations, as described above.\n\n\nPhage from the light chain libraries were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma), 0.5% Superblock (Pierce) with 100 nM hVEGF biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin reagent (Pierce). Biotinylated hVEGF and bound phage were captured for 5 min with neutravidin (Pierce) immobilized on Maxisorp immunoplates. The plates were washed with PBS, 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 and the bound phage were eluted and propagated for additional rounds of selection, as described above.\n\n\nAfter selection, individual clones were grown in a 96-well format in 500 ul of 2YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin and M13-KO7. The culture supernatants were used in phage ELISAs to detect positive clones that bound to antigen-coated plates but not to BSA-coated plates (Sidhu, S. S. et al., (2004) supra). Positive clones were subjected to DNA sequence analysis.\n\n\nhVEGF in solution was used for a high stringency selection. We sequenced 256 clones and identified 64 unique light chains combined with 9 of the 15 heavy chains (top 9 sequences in \nFIG. 36\n). Competitive phage ELISAs were used to estimate affinities of clones (Sidhu, S. S. et al., (2004) supra). Such ELISAs were carried out generally as follows. Phage clones were propagated from a single colony by growing in 40 ml of 2YT culture supplemented with carbenicillin and KO7 helper phage overnight at 30° C. Phage purified by PEG/NaCl precipitation were first serially diluted in PBST and tested for binding to an antigen-coated plate (hVEGF or mVEGF). The dilution that gave 50-70% saturating signal was used in the solution binding assay in which phage were first incubated with increasing concentration of antigen for 1-2 h and then transferred to antigen coated plate to capture the unbound phage for 10-15 min. An IC\n50 \nwas calculated as the concentration of antigen in solution binding stage that inhibited 50% of the phage from binding to immobilized antigen.

Generally, the variable domains were cloned into vectors designed for Fab expression in \nE. coli \nor transient IgG expression in mammalian cells. The Fab expression vector was derived from the phage display phagemid by deleting the sequence encoding for cP3 and adding a terminator sequence (GCTCGGTTGCCGCCGGGCGTTTTTTAT) (SEQ ID NO:920) about 20 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon at the end of \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1. Fab protein was generated by growing the transformed 34B8 \nE. coli \ncells in AP5 media at 30° C. for 24 h as described (Presta, L. G., et al., (1997) \nCancer Res. \n57, 4593-4599). Fab was purified with Protein G affinity chromatography. The production yield for Fab was typically 5-10 mg/L in small scale shake flask growth and 0.5-3 g/L in fermenter growth.\n\n\nBinding kinetic values for the purified Fabs based on surface plasmon resonance are shown below. hVEGF\n8-109 \nor mVEGF were immobilized on CM5 chips at ˜100 response units in a BIAcore™-3000, as described previously (Chen, Y., et al., (1999) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n293:865-881). Serial dilutions of Fab proteins (3-500 nM) were injected, and binding responses on the hVEGF or mVEGF flow cell were corrected by subtraction of responses on a blank flow cell. For kinetic analysis, a 1:1 Languir model with separate fittings of k\non \nand k\noff \nwas used. The K\nd \nvalues were estimated from the ratios of k\non \nand k\noff\n. All three Fabs bound with high affinity to hVEGF, but only two exhibited appreciable affinity for the highly homologous murine VEGF (mVEGF, 90% amino acid identity). We reasoned that YADS2 and YADS3 recognized VEGF through a very similar mechanism, as they exhibited high sequence homology in their CDRs and bound to both human and murine VEGF. In contrast, YADS1 likely represented a unique mode of antigen recognition as it contained very different CDR sequences and did not recognize mVEGF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKinetic analysis of Fabs binding to immobilized VEGF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nk\non \n(s\n−1 \nM\n−1\n)\n\n\nk\noff \n(s\n−1\n)\n\n\nK\nd \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFab\n\n\nhVEGF\n\n\nmVEGF\n\n\nhVEGF\n\n\nmVEGF\n\n\n \nhVEGF\n \n \nmVEGF\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYADS\n \n \n \n 1\n\n\n3 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n \nND\n \n \n \n1\n \n\n\n5 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\nND\n1\n \n\n\n1.8 ± 0.3\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYADS\n 2\n\n\n1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n8 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n1 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n4 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n10 ± 2 \n\n\n5.0 ± 0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYADS\n 3\n\n\n1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n3 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n5 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n2.0 ± 0.4\n\n\n3.7 ± 0.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nValues could not be determined due to the low affinity of the interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nCrystallization, Structure Determination and Refinement of YADS1 and YADS2\n\n\nWe wanted to study the structural basis for antigen recognition, and so, the crystal structures of YADS1 and YADS2 in complex with hVEGF.\n\n\na. Fab Protein Preparation for Crystal Structure Analysis\n\n\nWhole cell broth was obtained from a 10 liter \nE. coli \nfermentation. The cells were lysed with a Manton-Gaulin homogenizer. The suspension was centrifuged, the supernatant was loaded on a protein A-Sepharose column (Genentech, Inc.), and the column was eluted with 0.1 M acetic acid. The pH was adjusted to 4.0 with 1.0 M Tris, pH 8.0 and the eluant was loaded on a SP-Sepharose column (Pharmacia). The column was washed with equilibration buffer (20 mM MES, pH 5.5) and Fab protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient in equilibration buffer. Residues 8-109 of human VEGF were expressed, refolded, and purified as previously described (Christinger, H. W., et al., (1996). \nProt. Struct. Funct. Genet. \n26, 353-357).\n\n\nThe complex between each Fab and the receptor-binding fragment of hVEGF was formed and purified, as described previously (Muller, Y. A., (1998), supra). The complex (in PBS, 25 mM EDTA) was concentrated to an optical density of A\n280\n=10. Hanging-drop experiments were performed using the vapor-diffusion method with 10 ul drops consisting of a 1:1 ratio of protein solution and reservoir solution. The reservoir solution for the YADS1 complex was 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 25% PEG 3350 (w/v), 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5. The reservoir solution for the YADS2 complex was 1.0 M lithium chloride, 10% PEG 6000 (w/v), 0.1 M MES, pH 6.0. After 1-2 weeks at 19° C., plate or spindle shaped crystals grew for the YADS1 or YADS2 complex, respectively.\n\n\nCrystals were incubated in reservoir solution supplemented with 25% glycerol prior to flash freezing. A data set was collected from a single frozen crystal at the beam line 5.0.2 of the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley) for YADS1 and at the beam line 9.2 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Stanford University) for YADS2. The data was processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, Z. M., (1997) \nMethods Enzymol. \n276:307-326). The structures were solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (CCP4 (1994) \nActa Cryst. D\n50:760-763) and the coordinates of a previously solved Fab-hVEGF complex (PDB entry 1BJ1). The structure was refined using the programs REFMAC(CCP4 (1994), supra). The models were manually adjusted using program 0 (Jomes, T. A., et al., (1991) \nActa Crystallogra \nA 47 (Pt2):969-995). The following programs were used to calculate the surface areas of interaction RESAREA version 3.2: 5, Aug. 1993 and AREAIMOL version 3.2: 19, Dec. 1995. These programs are part of the CCP4 suite Collaborative Computational Project, \nNumber\n 4. 1994 (“The CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography” Acta Cryst. D50, 760-763). The crystal structures of YADS1 and YADS2 in complex with hVEGF were solved and refined at 2.65 and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively (Table 9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nData collection and refinement statistics for YADS1 and YADS2 hVEGF complexes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nYADS\n 1\n\n\n \nYADS\n 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.

Also reported is the surface area of each residue of VEGF antibody that is buried in VEGF (Å\n2\n) is reported below together with the percentage of the total surface area of the residue that is buried. See values for YADS-1:VEGF and YADS-2:VEGF complexes below. In all cases, because VEGF is a dimer, the residue numbers of VEGF referring to monomer 1 (of the VEGF dimer) are 8-109 and residue numbers of VEGF referring to monomer 2 (of the VEGF dimer) are 1008-1109.

These results help describe the regions in VEGF and the regions in the antibodies that contact one another. Together with functional data relating to the binding VEGF presented earlier, common features of the G6 series of antibodies YADS-2 and YADS-3 antibodies can be observed. The binding of antibodies such as Fab-12 and YADS-1 to VEGF resulted in the surface area of G88 being 100% and 95%, respectively, buried whereas the binding of G6, G6-23 and YADS-2 resulted in G88 being only 66% or less buried.\n\n\nThe Fab frameworks were essentially unchanged in comparison with the structure of the parental Fab4D5; the C\nα\n atoms of the YADS1 and YADS2 frameworks superimposed with Fab4D5 with root mean square deviations (rmsd) of 0.87 and 0.55 Å, respectively. The Cα atoms of the hVEGF molecules in the two structures superimpose well onto each other with rmsds of 0.7 Å for 87 Cα positions. The largest deviation of 3.7 Å occurs at residue \nglutamic acid\n 64. The loop containing this residue has inherent flexibility as shown by Muller et al., supra.\n\n\nIn both complexes, antigen recognition was entirely mediated by contacts with the CDR loops. In terms of buried surface area, YADS1 used both the heavy (498 Å\n2\n) and light chain (407 Å\n2\n), whereas YADS2 used mostly the heavy chain (543 Å\n2\n) and a small contribution from the light chain (157 A\n2\n). Notably, residues at randomized positions accounted for essentially all of the buried surface area (98% and 100% for YADS1 and YADS2, respectively), and furthermore, the buried surface area involved almost entirely side chain atoms (82% and 80% for YADS1 and YADS2, respectively). Thus, both Fabs bound to antigen through interactions that were almost entirely mediated by side chains located at positions that were randomized in the libraries.\n\n\nOn the hVEGF side, the structural epitopes for binding to YADS1 and YADS2 overlap with each other, and also, with the structural epitope for binding to \ndomain\n 2 of the hVEGF receptor Flt-1 (Flt-1\nD2\n,). The YADS1 and YADS2 antibodies can inhibit binding of Flt to human VEGF in vitro (data not shown), and they are expected to inhibit binding of KDR to human VEGF too. Nonetheless, there are significant differences between the structural epitopes for the two Fabs. In particular, of the 11 residues that differ between human and murine VEGF, only \nresidue\n 88 is in contact with the Fabs, but the interactions involving this residue explain the differing affinities of YADS1 and YADS2 for mVEGF. In the YADS2 complex, Gly88 is partially exposed to solvent, while in the YADS1 complex it is completely buried in the interface. Murine VEGF contains a larger serine residue at \nposition\n 88; this substitution can be readily accommodated in the YADS2 complex, but in the YADS1 model, the introduction of a serine side chain at the buried Gly88 position would require major rearrangements for the complex to be preserved.\n\n\nAs described above, both Fabs bind to antigen through contacts almost exclusively involving side chains at varied sites. In total, the CDRs of YADS1 and YADS2 contain 66 residues derived from randomized codons, and these residues are almost equally distributed amongst the four amino acid types allowed in the library design. However, when we consider the subset of residues that make contact with antigen, there is a clear bias in that 16 tyrosines account for 50% of the contact residues. Indeed, all but two of the tyrosines selected in the CDRs of YADS1 and YADS2 make contact with antigen, and all told, tyrosines contribute 71% of the surface area buried upon complexation with hVEGF. Thus, essentially every selected tyrosine side chain is involved in directly mediating antigen recognition and the other selected amino acids apparently play auxiliary roles.\n\n\nDespite the predominance of tyrosine in the synthetic antigen-binding sites, an examination of the heavy atom (non-hydrogen) content of buried surface areas reveals that the Fab-hVEGF interfaces are no more hydrophobic than the interface between hVEGF and Flt-1\nD2\n. On the hVEGF side, the heavy atom composition of the buried surface area is very similar in all three cases, being composed predominantly of carbon but also containing significant proportions of nitrogen and oxygen. Within the buried surface areas of the Fabs, nitrogen atoms are almost entirely absent, because the side chains allowed in the libraries were composed entirely of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. Nonetheless, both Fabs bury a large number of oxygen atoms upon binding to hVEGF, and in both cases, the proportion of the buried surface area contributed by carbon is considerably less than that contributed by carbon to the buried surface area of Flt-1\nD2\n. Thus, the predominance of tyrosine in the synthetic CDRs does not produce highly hydrophobic Fab-antigen interfaces dominated by aromatic interactions. On the contrary, the tyrosine residues make specific contacts with a wide variety of residues on the hVEGF surface, and these interactions utilize both the side chain hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings.\n\n\nThus, we circumvented the complexity of the natural immune system by using precisely defined synthetic libraries, and as a result, we were able to investigate the special role that tyrosine plays in antigen-binding sites. We generated libraries with restricted diversities and displayed the diverse surfaces on a fixed scaffold formed by the framework regions and buried CDR residues. Our results dramatically demonstrate that, in the context of a suitable scaffold, the tyrosine side chain is capable of mediating most of the contacts necessary for high affinity antigen recognition. Thus, it seems very likely that the overabundance of tyrosine in natural antigen-binding sites is a consequence of the side chain being particularly well suited for making productive contacts with antigen.\n\n\nThis supposition is also consistent with the chemical nature of tyrosine. As noted previously, the tyrosine side chain is large enough to sweep out large volumes of space with only a few torsion angles, and it can form hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and attractive electrostatic interactions with positively charged groups (Zemlin, M., et al., (2003) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n334:733-749). In addition, the uncharged tyrosine side chain avoids electrostatic repulsion effects, and its midrange hydrophilicity allows it to adapt favorably to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments (Zemlin, (2003), supra; Ivanov, I., et al., (2002) in \nThe Antibodies\n, eds. Zanetti, M. & Capra, J. (Taylor & Fancis, London, New York), pp. 43-67; Mian, I. S., et al., (1991) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n217:133-151).\n\n\nWe also observed that, while alanine and serine residues did not make many direct contacts with antigen, they allowed for space and conformational flexibility which may be crucial for appropriate positioning of the large tyrosine side chains. Thus, these small residues may serve an auxiliary function in facilitating productive contacts between tyrosine and antigen. It is worth noting that, perhaps not coincidentally, serine is also highly abundant in natural antigen-binding sites (Mian, (1991), supra). Finally, the paucity of antigen contacts mediated by aspartate suggests that it may be possible to further minimize the chemical diversity of these synthetic antigen-binding sites.\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nAnti-VEGF Antibodies from YADS-A and YADS-B Libraries\n\n\n(a) Construction of Phage-Displayed Fab Libraries YADS-A and YADS-B\n\n\nTwo phage displayed libraries (YADS-A and YADS-B) were constructed, as generally described in Example 6, with a previously described phagemid designed to display bivalent Fab moieties dimerized by a leucine zipper domain inserted between the Fab heavy chain and the C-terminal domain of the gene-3 minor coat protein (P3C), except that the following positions of 4D5 were randomized as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRandomized Positions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary\n\n\nCDRH1\n\n\nCDRH2\n\n\nCDRH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYADS-\n \n \n \n \nA\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n28, 30, 31, 32, 33\n\n\n50, 52, 53, 54, 56,\n\n\n95, 96, 97, 98, 99,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n58\n\n\n100, 100a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYADS-\n \n \n \n \nB\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n28, 30, 31, 32, 33\n\n\n50, 52, 53, 54, 56,\n\n\n95, 96, 97, 98, 99,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n58\n\n\n100, 100a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor library YADS-A, two separate mutagenesis reactions were performed. In the first reaction, diversity was introduced into CDR-H1, CDR H2 and CDR-H3 with oligonucleotides YADS-H1, YADS-H2 and YADS-H3-7, respectively. This resulted in the introduction of degenerate codons that encoded for the four amino acids tyrosine, alanine, aspartate, and serine (YADS). In the second reaction, diversity was introduced into CDR-H1, CDR H2 and CDR-H3 with oligonucleotides YTNS-H1, YTNS-H2 and YTNS-H3-7, respectively. This resulted in the introduction of degenerate codons that encoded for the four amino acids tyrosine, threonine, asparagine, and serine (YTNS). The two reactions were pooled.\n\n\nFor library YADS-B, 13 separate mutagenesis reactions were performed. The reactions resulted in the introduction of degenerate codons that encoded for the four amino acids tyrosine, alanine, aspartate, and serine (YADS). In each reaction, diversity was introduced into CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 with oligonucleotides YADS-H1 and YADS-H2. For each reaction, one of the following oligonucleotides was used to introduce diversity into CDR-H3: YADS-H3-3, YADS-H3-4, YADS-H3-5, YADS-H3-6, YADS-H3-7, YADS-H3-8, YADS-H3-9, YADS-H3-10, YADS-H3-11, YADS-H3-12, YADS-H3-13, YADS-H3-14, or YADS-H3-15. The 13 reactions were pooled.\n\n\nFor both libraries, the pooled mutagenesis reactions were electroporated in \nE. coli \nSS320 (Sidhu et al., supra). The transformed cells were grown overnight in the presence of M13-KO7 helper phage (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) to produce phage particles that encapsulated the phagemid DNA and displayed Fab fragments on their surfaces. The size of libraries YADS-A and YADS-B were both 7×10\n9\n.\n\n\n(b) Selection of Anti-hVEGF Specific Antibodies from YADS-A and YADS-B Naïve Libraries.\n\n\nPhage from library YADS-A and YADS-B were cycled separately through rounds of binding selection to enrich for clones binding to h-VEGF. The binding selections were conducted using previously described methods (Sidhu et al., supra).\n\n\nNUNC 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates were coated overnight at 4° C. with capture target (5 μg/mL) and blocked for 2 h with BSA (Sigma). After overnight growth at 37° C., phage were concentrated by precipitation with PEG/NaCl and resuspended in PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma), as described previously (Sidhu et al., supra). Phage solutions (˜10\n12 \nphage/mL) were added to the coated immunoplates. Following a 2 h incubation to allow for phage binding, the plates were washed 10 times with PBS, 0.05% Tween20. Bound phages were eluted with 0.1 M HCl for 10 min and the eluant was neutralized with 1.0 M Tris base. Eluted phage were amplified in \nE. coli \nXL1-blue and used for further rounds of selection.\n\n\nThe libraries were subjected to 4 rounds of selection against each target protein. Individual clones from each round were grown in a 96-well format in 500 μL of 2YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin and M13-VCS, and the culture supernatants were used directly in phage ELISAs (Sidhu et al., supra) to detect phage-displayed Fabs that bound to plates coated with target protein but not to plates coated with BSA. A clone was considered to be a specific binder if the ELISA signal on target coated plates was at least 20 times greater than that on BSA coated plates.\n\n\nSpecific binders were sequenced, and the sequences of unique clones are shown in \nFIGS. 37 and 38\n for libraries YADS-A and YADS-B, respectively. Sequences from \nFIG. 37\n were obtained by sorting with human VEGF8-109. Sequences from \nFIG. 38\n were obtained by sorting with murine VEGF.\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nNNK Variants of YADS2\n\n\n(a) Construction of Phage-Displayed Fab Libraries by Randomizing Selected Positions of the YADS2 Anti-VEGF Antibody with the NNK Codon.\n\n\nPhage-displayed Fab libraries were constructed using a phagemid vector that resulted in the display of bivalent Fab moieties dimerized by a leucine zipper domain inserted between the Fab heavy chain and the C-terminal domain of the gene-3 minor coat protein (P3C). This vector comprised the YADS2 sequence. The humanized antibody YADS2 variable domains were expressed under the control of the IPTG-inducible Ptac promoter.\n\n\nLibrary NNK was constructed with randomized residues in the heavy chain CDR-3 of YADS2. The specific residues that were randomized are 50, 95, 97, 99, 100, and 100a of the heavy chain.\n\n\nAt each of the randomized positions, the wild-type codon was replaced by a degenerate NNK codon (N=A/T/G/C, K=G/T in an equimolar ratio) that encoded for all 20 natural amino acids.\n\n\nLibraries were constructed using the method of Kunkel (Kunkel, T. A., Roberts, J. D. & Zakour, R. A., \nMethods Enzymol. \n(1987), 154, 367-382) with previously described methods (Sidhu, S. S., Lowman, H. B., Cunningham, B. C. & Wells, J. A., \nMethods Enzymol. \n(2000), 328, 333-363). A unique “stop template” version of the Fab display vector was used to generate the NNK library. We used a template phagemid bearing the gene coding for YADS2 fab with TAA stop codons inserted at \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 30, 33, 52, 54, 56, 57, 60, 102, 103, 104, 107, and 108 of the heavy chain. Mutagenic oligonucleotides with degenerate NNK codons at the positions to be diversified were used to simultaneously introduce CDR diversity and repair the stop codons. Diversity was introduced into CDR-H3 with the oligonucleotide named NNK-H1 (GCA GCT TCT GGC TTC GCT ATT TAT GAT TAT GAT ATA CAC TGG GTG CGT (SEQ ID NO:25)), NNK-H2 (CTG GAA TGG GTT GCA NNK ATT GCT CCA TAT GCT GGT GCT ACT GCT TAT GCC GAT AGC GTC (SEQ ID NO:26)) and NNK-H3 GTC TAT TAT TGT AGC CGC NNK TCT NNK GCT NNK NNK NNK GCT ATG GAC TAC TGG (SEQ ID NO:27)). The mutagenic oligonucleotides for all three heavy chain CDRs were incorporated simultaneously in a single mutagenesis reaction, so that so that simultaneous incorporation of the mutagenic oligonucleotide resulted in the introduction of the designed diversity at each position and simultaneously repaired all the TAA stop codons, thus generating an open reading frame that encoded a Fab library member fused to a homodimerizing leucine zipper and P3C. Note that the oligonucleotide NNK-H1 does not contain any degenerate codons and is added to the mutagenesis reaction to repair the TAA stop codons and introduce the wild type YADS2 sequence.\n\n\nThe mutagenesis reactions were electroporated into \nE. coli \nSS320 (Sidhu et al., supra), and the transformed cells were grown overnight in the presence of M13-KO7 helper phage (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) to produce phage particles that encapsulated the phagemid DNA and displayed Fab fragments on their surfaces. Each library contained greater than 5×10\n9 \nunique members.\n\n\n(b) Selection of Specific Anti-VEGF Antibodies from the NNK Library\n\n\nPhage from library NNK were cycled through rounds of binding selection to enrich for clones binding to human VEGF. The binding selections were conducted using previously described methods (Sidhu et al., supra).\n\n\nNUNC 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates were coated overnight at 4° C. with capture target (5 μg/mL) and blocked for 2 h with Superblock TBS (tris-buffered saline) (Pierce). After overnight growth at 37° C., phage were concentrated by precipitation with PEG/NaCl and resuspended in Superblock TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma), as described previously (Sidhu et al., supra). Phage solutions (˜10\n12 \nphage/mL) were added to the coated immunoplates. Following a 2 h incubation to allow for phage binding, the plates were washed 10 times with PBS, 0.05\n% Tween\n 20. Bound phage were eluted with 0.1 M HCl for 10 min and the eluant was neutralized with 1.0 M Tris base. Eluted phage were amplified in \nE. coli \nXL1-blue and used for further rounds of selection.\n\n\nThe libraries were subjected to 5 rounds of selection against VEGF. Individual clones from each round of selection were grown in a 96-well format in 500 μL of 2YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin and M13-VCS, and the culture supernatants were used directly in phage ELISAs (Sidhu et al., supra) to detect phage-displayed Fabs that bound to plates coated with target protein but not to plates coated with BSA. Specific binders were defined as those phage clones that exhibited an ELISA signal at least 15-fold greater on target-coated plates in comparison with BSA-coated plates. Individual clones were screened after 3 to 5 rounds of selection for VEGF binding.\n\n\nIndividual clones representing specific binders were subjected to DNA sequence analysis, and the sequences of the randomized CDR positions are shown in \nFIG. 40\n. The affinity of the different YADS variants was estimated by using a “two point competitive phage ELISA”. The three best clones were produced as soluble Fab and were tested for their affinity with respect to hVEGF. BIAcore data was obtained according to Chen et al., \nJ Mol Biol. \n(1999), 293(4):865-81. Briefly, binding affinities were calculated from association and dissociation rate constants measured using a BIAcore™-3000 surface plasmon resonance system (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). A biosensor chip was activated for covalent coupling of VEGF using N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) instructions. hVEGF or mVEGF was buffer-exchanged into 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8 and diluted to approximately 30 mg/ml. Aliquots of VEGF were injected at a flow rate of 2 microL/minute to achieve approximately 200-300 response units (RU) of coupled protein. A solution of 1 M ethanolamine was injected as a blocking agent. For kinetics measurements, twofold serial dilutions of Fab were injected in PBS/Tween buffer (0.05% Tween20 in phosphate-buffered saline) at 25° C. at a flow rate of 10 microL/minute. Equilibrium dissociation constants, Kd values from surface plasmon resonance measurements were calculated as k\noff\n/k\non\n.

This vector comprises the humanized antibody 4D5 variable domains under the control of the IPTG-inducible Ptac promoter as described above. The humanized antibody 4D5 is an antibody which has mostly human consensus sequence framework regions in the heavy and light chains, and CDR regions from a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for Her-2. The method of making the anti-Her-2 antibody and the identity of the variable domain sequences are provided in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,821,337 and 6,054,297.\n\n\nTwo libraries were constructed. Library YS-A was constructed with randomized residues in all three heavy chain CDRs, while Library YS-B was constructed with randomized residues in all three heavy chain CDRs and light chain CDR3. The specific residues that were randomized are shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRandomized Positions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary\n\n\nCDRL3\n\n\nCDRH1\n\n\nCDRH2\n\n\nCDRH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYS-\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n28, 30, 31,\n\n\n50, 52, 53,\n\n\n95, 96, 97, 98, 99,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32, 33\n\n\n54, 56, 58\n\n\n100, 100a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYS-B\n\n\n91-94, 96\n\n\n28, 30, 31,\n\n\n50, 52, 53,\n\n\n95, 96, 97, 98, 99,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32, 33\n\n\n54, 56, 58\n\n\n100, 100a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt each of the randomized positions, the wild-type codon was replaced by a degenerate TMT codon (M=A/C in an equimolar ratio) that encoded for Tyr and Ser in an equimolar ratio. In addition, the length of CDRH3 was varied by using oligonucleotides that replaced the 7 wild-type codons between positions 101 to 107 with varying numbers of TMT codons (7 to 20 for Library YS-A and 7 to 15 for Library YS-B). In addition, the CDRL3 of Library YS-B was randomized so that 50% of the library members contained a deletion at \nposition number\n 91 while the other 50% contained the wildtype Gln residue at this position.\n\n\nLibraries were constructed using the method of Kunkel (Kunkel, T. A., Roberts, J. D. & Zakour, R. A., \nMethods Enzymol. \n(1987), 154, 367-382) with previously described methods (Sidhu, S. S., Lowman, H. B., Cunningham, B. C. & Wells, J. A., \nMethods Enzymol. \n(2000), 328, 333-363). A unique “stop template” version of the Fab display vector was used to generate both libraries YS-A and YS-B. We used a template phagemid designated pV0350-4 with TAA stop codons inserted at \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 30, 33, 52, 54, 56, 57, 60, 102, 103, 104, 107, and 108 of the heavy chain. No stops were introduced in the light chain CDR3. Mutagenic oligonucleotides with degenerate TMT codons at the positions to be diversified were used to simultaneously introduce CDR diversity and repair the stop codons. For both libraries, diversity was introduced into CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 with oligonucleotides H1 and H2, respectively. For Library YS-A, diversity was introduced into CDR-H3 with an equimolar mixture of oligonucleotides. For library YS-B, diversity was introduced into CDR-H3 with an equimolar mixture of oligonucleotides. For library YS-B, diversity was introduced into CDR-L3 with an equimolar mixture of oligonucleotides. The mutagenic oligonucleotides for all CDRs to be randomized were incorporated simultaneously in a single mutagenesis reaction, so that simultaneous incorporation of all the mutagenic oligonucleotides resulted in the introduction of the designed diversity at each position and simultaneously repaired all the TAA stop codons, thus generating an open reading frame that encoded a Fab library member fused to a homodimerizing leucine zipper and P3C.\n\n\nThe mutagenesis reactions were electroporated into \nE. coli \nSS320 (Sidhu et al., supra), and the transformed cells were grown overnight in the presence of M13-KO7 helper phage (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) to produce phage particles that encapsulated the phagemid DNA and displayed Fab fragments on their surfaces. Each library contained greater than 5×10\n9 \nunique members.\n\n\n(b) Selection of Specific Antibodies from the Naïve Libraries YS-A and YS-B\n\n\nPhage from library YS-A or YS-B were cycled through rounds of binding selection to enrich for clones binding to targets of interest. Target proteins, human VEGF\n8-109 \nand murine VEGF were analyzed separately with each library. The binding selections were conducted using previously described methods (Sidhu et al., supra).\n\n\nNUNC 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates were coated overnight at 4° C. with capture target (5 μg/mL) and blocked for 2 h with Superblock TBS (tris-buffered saline) (Pierce). After overnight growth at 37° C., phage were concentrated by precipitation with PEG/NaCl and resuspended in Superblock TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma), as described previously (Sidhu et al., supra). Phage solutions (10\n12 \nphage/mL) were added to the coated immunoplates. Following a 2 h incubation to allow for phage binding, the plates were washed 10 times with PBS, 0.05\n% Tween\n 20. Bound phage were eluted with 0.1 M HCl for 10 min and the eluant was neutralized with 1.0 M Tris base. Eluted phage were amplified in \nE. coli \nXL1-blue and used for further rounds of selection.\n\n\nThe libraries were subjected to 5 rounds of selection against each target protein, and at each round, titers were obtained for phage binding to either the target protein or blank wells coated with Superblock TBS. The titer of phage bound to target-coated wells divided by the titer of phage bound to the blank wells was defined as an enrichment ratio used to quantify specific binding of phage pools to the target protein; larger enrichment ratios indicate higher specific binding. The enrichment ratios were observed after 3, 4, or 5 rounds of selection.\n\n\nIndividual clones from each round of selection were grown in a 96-well format in 500 μL of 2YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin and M13-VCS, and the culture supernatants were used directly in phage ELISAs (Sidhu et al., supra) to detect phage-displayed Fabs that bound to plates coated with target protein but not to plates coated with BSA. Specific binders were defined as those phage clones that exhibited an ELISA signal at least 15-fold greater on target-coated plates in comparison with BSA-coated plates. Individual clones were screened after 2 rounds of selection for binding to human VEGF or after 5 rounds of selection for the other target proteins. These data were used to calculate the percentage of specific binders, and the results for each library against each target protein. Each library produced binders against each target protein.\n\n\nIndividual clones representing specific binders were subjected to DNA sequence analysis, and the sequences of the randomized CDR positions are shown in \nFIG. 41\n. It can be seen that, for each target protein, it was possible to select specific binders that contained only Tyr or Ser at the randomized positions (although some non-designed mutations were observed, which were likely created during library construction probably due to impurities in the oligonucleotides). Furthermore, the sequences of specific binders were unique to the target protein against which they were selected.\n\n\nTwo of the binders listed in \nFIG. 41\n (\nhVEGF binder #\n3 and #18) were tested for their affinity with respect to hVEGF and mVEGF. BIAcore data was obtained according to Chen et al., \nJ Mol Biol. \n(1999), 293(4):865-881. Briefly, binding affinities of \nhVEGF binder #\n3 and #18 for hVEGF and mVEGF were calculated from association and dissociation rate constants measured using a BIAcore™-2000 surface plasmon resonance system (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). A biosensor chip was activated for covalent coupling of VEGF using N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) instructions. hVEGF or mVEGF was buffer-exchanged into 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8 and diluted to approximately 30 mg/ml. Aliquots of VEGF were injected at a flow rate of 2 microL/minute to achieve approximately 200-300 response units (RU) of coupled protein. A solution of 1 M ethanolamine was injected as a blocking agent. For kinetics measurements, twofold serial dilutions of Fab were injected in PBS/Tween buffer (0.05% Tween20 in phosphate-buffered saline) at 25° C. at a flow rate of 10 microL/minute.

A phagemid designed to display bivalent Fab4D5 on the surface of M13 bacteriophage was used to construct libraries, as described above. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to replace CDR positions with TMT degenerate codons, (M=A/C in equal proportions). The positions chosen for randomization were as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRandomized Positions\n \n \n \n \n \nLibrary\n \nCDRL3\n \nCDRH1\n \nCDRH2\n \nCDRH3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYS-\n \n \n \n \n \nA\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n28, 30, 31,\n \n50, 52, 53,\n \n95-100 replaced\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n32, 33\n \n54, 56, 58\n \nwith 7-20 residues\n \n \n \nYS-B\n \n91-94, 96\n \n28, 30, 31,\n \n50, 52, 53,\n \n95-100a replaced\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n32, 33\n \n54, 56, 58\n \nwith 7-15\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresidues.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIn CDR-H3, positions 95 through 100a were replaced with random loops of all possible lengths ranging from 7 to 20 residues (library A) or 7 to 15 residues (library B). Each library contained ˜10\n10 \nunique members, and thus, the actual library diversities were comparable to the maximum number of unique sequences encoded by the library designs (4×10\n9\n).\n\n\n\nPhage from the libraries were cycled through rounds of binding selection with antigen immobilized on 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates (NUNC) as the capture target, as described previously (Sidhu, S. S., et al., (2000) \nMethods Enzymol. \n328:333-363). After five rounds of selection, phage were produced from individual clones grown in a 96-well format and the culture supernatants were used in phage ELISAs to detect specific binding clones. Specific binding clones were determined to be Fab-phage that bound to the cognate antigen but did not exhibit detectable binding to seven other proteins.\n\n\nCompetitive phage ELISA. A modified phage ELISA was used to estimate the binding affinities of Fabs (Sidhu, (2000), supra; Deshayes, K., et al., (2002) \nChem. Biol. \n9:495-505). Phage ELISAs were carried out on plates coated with antigen, as described above. Phage displaying antibody fragments were serially diluted in PBS, 0.5% (w/v) BSA, 0.1% (v/v) \nTween\n 20, and binding was measured to determine a phage concentration giving ˜50% of the signal at saturation. A fixed, sub-saturating concentration of phage was preincubated for 2 hours with serial dilutions of antigen and then transferred to assay plates coated with antigen. After 15 minutes incubation, the plates were washed with PBS, 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 and incubated 30 minutes with horseradish peroxidase/anti-M13 antibody conjugate (1:5000 dilution) (Pharmacia). The plates were washed, developed with TMB substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories), quenched with 1.0 M H\n3\nPO\n4\n, and read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. The binding affinities of the Fabs were determined as IC\n50 \nvalues defined as the concentration of antigen that blocked 50% of the phage binding to the immobilized antigen. DNA sequencing of 184 binding clones revealed 63 unique sequences shown in \nFIG. 42\n. Interestingly, the clones from library B exhibit homology within the selected CDR-L3 and CDR-H3 sequences. In contrast, the CDR-H3 sequences of the clones from library A exhibit homology amongst themselves but are very different from the sequences from library B. Thus, it appears that the nature of the CDR-L3 sequence influenced the selection of CDR-H3 sequences, and as a result, two distinct classes of anti-hVEGF antibodies arose from the two different libraries. The clones were screened by competitive phage ELISA and exhibited IC\n50 \nvalues ranging from approximately 60 nM to greater than 5 μM.\n\n\nProtein purification and affinity analysis. The three anti-hVEGF clones with the highest estimated affinities (top three sequences in \nFIG. 42\n) were purified as free Fab proteins. Fab proteins were purified from \nE. coli \nas described previously (Muler, Y. A., et al., (1998) \nStructure \n6:1153-1167). See \nFIG. 43\n for YS1 Fab sequence. The binding kinetics of the purified Fabs (designated Fab-YS1, Fab-YS2 and Fab-YS3) were studied by surface plasmon resonance. Binding kinetics were determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore™-3000 with hVEGF immobilized on CM5 chips at ˜500 response units, as described previously (Chen, Y., et al., (1999) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n293:865-881). Serial dilutions of Fab proteins were injected, and binding responses were corrected by subtraction of responses on a blank flow cell. For kinetic analysis, a 1:1 Langmuir model of global fittings of k\non \nand k\noff \nwas used. The K\nd \nvalues were determined from the ratios of k\non \nand k\noff\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYS1\n \nYS2\n \nYS3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nk\na \n(10\n4 \n· M\n−1 \n· s\n−1\n)\n \n5 ± 1\n \n 6 ± 1\n \n5 ± 1\n \n \n \n \n \nkd (10\n−3 \n· s\n−1\n)\n \n2.8 ± 0.1\n \n11.7 ± 0.4\n \n9.4 ± 0.1\n \n \n \n \n \nK\nD \n(nM)\n \n60 ± 20\n \n220 ± 60\n \n190 ± 40 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFab-YS1 exhibited the highest affinity for hVEGF (K\nd\n=60 nM), while the other two Fabs bound approximately 5-fold less tightly due to faster off rates. The sequences of Fab-YS1 and Fab-YS2 differ in only three positions, and thus, these three differences account for the improved affinity of Fab-YS1 in comparison with Fab-YS2.\n\n\n\nImmunohistochemistry. We next investigated the specificity of Fab-YS1 by using the protein to visualize VEGF in mammalian cells transfected with a gene encoding for VEGF fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Human A673 cells expressing murine VEGF-GFP were stained and imaged, as described (Peden, A. A., et al., (2004) \nJ. Cell. Biol. \n164:1065-1076). In the plus VEGF panel, Fab-YS1 was pre-incubated for 5 minutes with a 5-fold excess of recombinant VEGF before being incubated with the cells. The immunohistochemical staining with Fab-YS1 precisely overlapped with the fluorescence signal from the VEGF-GFP fusion (data not shown). Furthermore, the signal was completely blocked by incubating Fab-YS1 with hVEGF prior to the staining.\n\n\nImmunoprecipitation. We also conducted immunoprecipitations of endogenous hVEGF and compared the performance of Fab-YS1 to that of a highly specific, natural anti-hVEGF monoclonal antibody (A4.6.1) (Kim, K. J., et al., (1992) \nGrowth Factors \n7:53-64). A673 cells were metabolically labelled and immunoprecipitations were performed from the media, as described (Kim, K. J., et al., supra) using 15 ug of anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Clontech), Fab-YS1 or monoclonal antibody A4.6.1. The immune complexes were eluted by boiling and resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 14% acrylamide gel under reducing conditions. The gel was dried and then exposed to a phosphoimager plate overnight. Both antibodies immunoprecipitated an identical set of bands that likely represent hVEGF variants generated by alternative mRNA splicing (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that Fab-YS1 binds to hVEGF with high affinity and specificity comparable to that of a natural antibody, even in the complex cellular milieu.\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\nIn vivo Activities of the Anti-VEGF Antibodies\n\n\nG6-23 inhibits neonate mouse growth and survival. Newborn mice (C57/BL6) were intra-peritoneally (i.p.) injected daily at 1 day post-natally with G6-23 IgG (50 mg/kg) or Flt-1 (1-3) Fc (50 mg/kg), or appropriate controls, gp120-Fc, PBS or no injection. The body weights were measured daily and the survival rate of the mice were counted. As shown in \nFIG. 10\n, G6-23 reduced body weight as potently as mFlt-1 (1-3)Fc, which is a known mVEGF antagonist. Moreover, mouse survival rates were also equivalent between the two groups. Significantly, the results of G6-23 specifically indicated that mVEGF is required for the growth and survival of new born mice, whereas the effect of Flt-1 (1-3) Fc is less specific since it is known to block not only mVEGF, but also placental growth factor (PlGF) and VEGF-B.\n\n\nG6-23 effectively inhibits the growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice. KM12 and SW480, two human colon-rectal cancer cell lines, were grown in cell culture first and about 10\n6 \ncells from each cell line were injected into host nude mice. When the tumor reached approximately 100 mm\n3 \nin size (1 week after injection), G6-23 or control were injected (10 mg/kg) twice weekly (six nude mice were used for each group). The tumor sizes were measured until \nday\n 13 after antibody injection. As shown in \nFIG. 11\n, G6-23 was significantly effective in reducing tumor volumes of both KM12 (left graph) and SW480 (right graph) cell lines.\n\n\nGene expressions for both hVEGF and mVEGF were examined in KM12 xenograft mice. Samples of tumors and surrounding tissues were extracted and Tagman was used to quantify the gene expression levels. In these xenograft models, hVEGF came from the implanted human KM12 tumor cells, whereas mVEGF came from surrounding host stromal cells. As shown in \nFIG. 12\n, samples from mice treated with G6-23 on \nday\n 3 and \nday\n 13 had higher gene expression levels for both hVEGF and mVEGF compared to the control groups. The results indicate that while mice treated with G6-23 had reduced tumor growth and much decreased vascularity, expressions of both mVEGF and hVEGF were up-regulated in response to the reduction of angiogenesis. It also indicates that at the tumor site, there is significant infiltration of mouse stromal cells, which is a major source of VEGF for the tumor angiogenesis. Therefore, in a preclinical animal model such as the xenograft model described herein, an antibody capable of cross-reacting and blocking both hVEGF and mVEGF is necessary for studying its efficacy.\n\n\nMouse (Lewis) lung carcinoma (LL2) cells were also used in a nude mice model to test the inhibitory effect of G6-23. About 10\n6 \nLL2 cells in a matrigel formulation were administered subcutaneously in the flank of 5-week old beige nude mice. One group of six mice were then treated with G6-23 at 10 mg/kg, injected via i.p. twice weekly for a span of 19 days. Other control agents (i.e., mFlt(1-3)-IgG, rag-10) were also used to treat groups of six mice. As shown in \nFIG. 13\n, G6-23 significantly reduced the rate of tumor growth with a pharmacological effect comparable to that of mFlt(1-3)-IgG, which is known to be multi-potent in blocking not only mVEGF, but also other angiogenic factors mPIGF and mVEGF-B. Serum levels of bioactive G6-23 was also measured. The result indicates that its levels (62-121 ug/ml) are well within the expected range for a therapeutic neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody.\n\n\nHM-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were also used to study the tumor growth inhibition in nude mice. G6 IgG antibody, G6-31 IgG antibody, the Avastin™ antibody, and the Y0317 IgG antibody used in this study were expressed in and purified from CHO cells. HM-7 cells were maintained in culture with F12:DMEM medium, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 1% Glutamine. Cells were grown at 37° C. in 5% CO2 until confluence, harvested, counted, washed and resuspended in sterile Metrigel at a concentration of 25×10\n6 \ncells per ml. Xenografts were established in 4- to 6-week-old female Beige Nude XID mice by injecting 5×10\n6 \nof HM-7 cultured cells into the dorsal flank of the mice and allowed to grow. After 48 hours, the tumors were palpable in all mice, and cohorts were randomly selected (n=10) to provide day-0 controls. The remaining mice were divided into 23 groups and injected twice weekly with different anti-VEGF antibodies. The treatments for the study groups are as follows: Group A (n=10×1): mice treated with control antibody MAB (an anti-ragweed antibody) in 0.1 ml by interperitoneal injection twice/week with a high dose (5 mg/kg). Group B (n=10×5): mice treated with G6 IgG antibody in 0.1 ml by interperitoneal injection twice/week with the same dose (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 2 or 5 mg/kg). Group C (n=10×5): mice treated with Y0317 IgG antibody in 0.1 ml by interperitoneal injection twice/week with the same dose (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 2 or 5 mg/kg). Group D (n=10×5): mice treated with the Avastin™ antibody in 0.1 ml by interperitoneal injection twice/week with the same dose (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 2 or 5 mg/kg). Group E (n=10×5): mice treated with G6-31 IgG antibody in 0.1 ml by interperitoneal injection twice/week with the same dose (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 2 or 5 mg/kg). The mice (n=10 control and treated animals) were killed at \n \n \n \n \n \ndays\n \n \n \n \n \n 4, 7, 11, 14, 17 and 21 after initiation of injections, and the tumors were excised and weighed.\n\n\nThe results show that there was a significant suppression of tumor growth when the G6, G6-31, Y0317 and the Avastin™ antibodies were administered (p<0.5) (\nFIGS. 33A-E\n). The excised tissues from the anti-VEGF antibody treated mice were smaller in size and less vascularized as compared to the tumors excised from the control mice. As discussed above, the G6 and the G6-23 antibody unlike the Avastin™ antibody and the Y0317 antibody can bind to both human VEGF and mouse VEGF, including mouse stromal VEGF which can be upregulated upon implantation of human colorectal tumors in mouse models. Direct comparison of the activity of the G6 and G6-31 antibodies, which antibodies bind similar epitopes, indicates that at most datapoints the antibody with the higher affinity for VEGF-A, the G6-31 antibody, had increased tumor growth inhibiting properties.\n\n\nOther Embodiments\n\n\nFrom the foregoing description, it will be apparent that variations and modifications may be made to the invention described herein to adopt it to various usages and conditions.

No. 60/414,433, filed Sep. 27, 2002, all of which are expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to novel optimized Fc variants, engineering methods for their generation, and their application, particularly for therapeutic purposes.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nAntibodies are immunological proteins that bind a specific antigen. In most mammals, including humans and mice, antibodies are constructed from paired heavy and light polypeptide chains. Each chain is made up of individual immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, and thus the generic term immunoglobulin is used for such proteins. Each chain is made up of two distinct regions, referred to as the variable and constant regions. The light and heavy chain variable regions show significant sequence diversity between antibodies, and are responsible for binding the target antigen. The constant regions show less sequence diversity, and are responsible for binding a number of natural proteins to elicit important biochemical events. In humans there are five different classes of antibodies including IgA (which includes subclasses IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, IgE, IgG (which includes subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4), and IgM. The distinguishing features between these antibody classes are their constant regions, although subtler differences may exist in the V region. \nFIG. 1\n shows an IgG1 antibody, used here as an example to describe the general structural features of immunoglobulins. IgG antibodies are tetrameric proteins composed of two heavy chains and two light chains. The IgG heavy chain is composed of four immunoglobulin domains linked from N- to C-terminus in the order V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3, referring to the heavy chain variable domain, \nconstant gamma\n 1 domain, \nconstant gamma\n 2 domain, and \nconstant gamma\n 3 domain respectively. The IgG light chain is composed of two immunoglobulin domains linked from N- to C-terminus in the order V\nL\n-C\nL\n, referring to the light chain variable domain and the light chain constant domain respectively.\n\n\nThe variable region of an antibody contains the antigen binding determinants of the molecule, and thus determines the specificity of an antibody for its target antigen. The variable region is so named because it is the most distinct in sequence from other antibodies within the same class. The majority of sequence variability occurs in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). There are 6 CDRs total, three each per heavy and light chain, designated V\nH \nCDR1, V\nH \nCDR2, V\nH \nCDR3, V\nL \nCDR1, V\nL \nCDR2, and V\nL \nCDR3. The variable region outside of the CDRs is referred to as the framework (FR) region. Although not as diverse as the CDRs, sequence variability does occur in the FR region between different antibodies. Overall, this characteristic architecture of antibodies provides a stable scaffold (the FR region) upon which substantial antigen binding diversity (the CDRs) can be explored by the immune system to obtain specificity for a broad array of antigens. A number of high-resolution structures are available for a variety of variable region fragments from different organisms, some unbound and some in complex with antigen. The sequence and structural features of antibody variable regions are well characterized (Morea et al., 1997\n, Biophys Chem \n68:9-16; Morea et al., 2000\n, Methods \n20:267-279), and the conserved features of antibodies have enabled the development of a wealth of antibody engineering techniques (Maynard et al., 2000\n, Annu Rev Biomed Eng \n2:339-376). For example, it is possible to graft the CDRs from one antibody, for example a murine antibody, onto the framework region of another antibody, for example a human antibody. This process, referred to in the art as “humanization”, enables generation of less immunogenic antibody therapeutics from nonhuman antibodies. Fragments comprising the variable region can exist in the absence of other regions of the antibody, including for example the antigen binding fragment (Fab) comprising V\nH\n-Cγ1 and V\nH\n-C\nL\n, the variable fragment (Fv) comprising V\nH \nand V\nL\n, the single chain variable fragment (scFv) comprising V\nH \nand V\nL \nlinked together in the same chain, as well as a variety of other variable region fragments (Little et al., 2000\n, Immunol Today \n21:364-370).\n\n\nThe Fc region of an antibody interacts with a number of Fc receptors and ligands, imparting an array of important functional capabilities referred to as effector functions. For IgG the Fc region, as shown in \nFIG. 1\n, comprises Ig domains Cγ2 and Cγ3 and the N-terminal hinge leading into Cγ2. An important family of Fc receptors for the IgG class are the Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs). These receptors mediate communication between antibodies and the cellular arm of the immune system (Raghavan et al., 1996, \nAnnu Rev Cell Dev Biol \n12:181-220; Ravetch et al., 2001\n, Annu Rev Immunol \n19:275-290). In humans this protein family includes FcγRI (CD64), including isoforms FcγRIa, FcγRIb, and FcγRIc; FcγRII (CD32), including isoforms FcγRIIa (including allotypes H131 and R131), FcγRIIb (including FcγRIIb-1 and FcγRIIb-2), and FcγRIIc; and FcγRIII (CD16), including isoforms FcγRIIIa (including allotypes V158 and F158) and FcγRIIb (including allotypes FcγRIIIb-NA1 and FcγRIIb-NA2) (Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65). These receptors typically have an extracellular domain that mediates binding to Fc, a membrane spanning region, and an intracellular domain that may mediate some signaling event within the cell. These receptors are expressed in a variety of immune cells including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, B cells, large granular lymphocytes, Langerhans' cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and γγ T cells. Formation of the Fc/FcγR complex recruits these effector cells to sites of bound antigen, typically resulting in signaling events within the cells and important subsequent immune responses such as release of inflammation mediators, B cell activation, endocytosis, phagocytosis, and cytotoxic attack. The ability to mediate cytotoxic and phagocytic effector functions is a potential mechanism by which antibodies destroy targeted cells. The cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Raghavan et al., 1996\n, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol \n12:181-220; Ghetie et al., 2000\n, Annu Rev Immunol \n18:739-766; Ravetch et al., 2001\n, Annu Rev Immunol \n19:275-290). The cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP). A number of structures have been solved of the extracellular domains of human FcγRs, including FcγRIIa (pdb accession code 1H9V) (Sondermann et al., 2001, \nJ Mol Biol \n309:737-749) (pdb accession code 1FCG)(Maxwell et al., 1999\n, Nat Struct Biol \n6:437-442), FcγRIIb (pdb accession code 2FCB)(Sondermann et al., 1999\n, Embo J \n18:1095-1103); and FcγRIIIb (pdb accession code 1E4J)(Sondermann et al., 2000\n, Nature \n406:267-273.). All FcγRs bind the same region on Fc, at the N-terminal end of the Cγ2 domain and the preceding hinge, shown in \nFIG. 2\n. This interaction is well characterized structurally (Sondermann et al., 2001\n, J Mol Biol \n309:737-749), and several structures of the human Fc bound to the extracellular domain of human FcγRIIIb have been solved (pdb accession code 1E4K)(Sondermann et al., 2000\n, Nature \n406:267-273.) (pdb accession codes 1IIS and 1IIX)(Radaev et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:16469-16477), as well as has the structure of the human IgE Fc/FcεRIα complex (pdb accession code 1F6A)(Garman et al., 2000\n, Nature \n406:259-266).\n\n\nThe different IgG subclasses have different affinities for the FcγRs, with IgG1 and IgG3 typically binding substantially better to the receptors than IgG2 and IgG4 (Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65). All FcγRs bind the same region on IgG Fc, yet with different affinities: the high affinity binder FcγRI has a Kd for IgG1 of 10\n−8 \nM\n−1\n, whereas the low affinity receptors FcγRII and FcγRIII generally bind at 10\n−6 \nand 10\n−5 \nrespectively. The extracellular domains of FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIIb are 96% identical, however FcγRIIIb does not have a intracellular signaling domain. Furthermore, whereas FcγRI, FcγRIIa/c, and FcγRIIIa are positive regulators of immune complex-triggered activation, characterized by having an intracellular domain that has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), FcγRIIb has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and is therefore inhibitory. Thus the former are referred to as activation receptors, and FcγRIIb is referred to as an inhibitory receptor. The receptors also differ in expression pattern and levels on different immune cells. Yet another level of complexity is the existence of a number of FcγR polymorphisms in the human proteome. A particularly relevant polymorphism with clinical significance is V158/F158 FcγRIIIa. Human IgG1 binds with greater affinity to the V158 allotype than to the F158 allotype. This difference in affinity, and presumably its effect on ADCC and/or ADCP, has been shown to be a significant determinant of the efficacy of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (Rituxan®, a registered trademark of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation). Patients with the V158 allotype respond favorably to rituximab treatment; however, patients with the lower affinity F158 allotype respond poorly (Cartron et al., 2002, \nBlood \n99:754-758). Approximately 10-20% of humans are V158/V158 homozygous, 45% are V158/F158 heterozygous, and 35-45% of humans are F158/F158 homozygous (Lehrnbecher et al., 1999, \nBlood \n94:4220-4232; Cartron et al., 2002, \nBlood \n99:754-758). Thus 80-90% of humans are poor responders, that is they have at least one allele of the F158 FcγRIIIa.\n\n\nAn overlapping but separate site on Fc, shown in \nFIG. 1\n, serves as the interface for the complement protein C1q. In the same way that Fc/FcγR binding mediates ADCC, Fc/C1q binding mediates complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). C1q forms a complex with the serine proteases C1r and C1s to form the C1 complex. C1q is capable of binding six antibodies, although binding to two IgGs is sufficient to activate the complement cascade. Similar to Fc interaction with FcγRs, different IgG subclasses have different affinity for C1q, with IgG1 and IgG3 typically binding substantially better to the FcγRs than IgG2 and IgG4 (Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65). There is currently no structure available for the Fc/C1q complex; however, mutagenesis studies have mapped the binding site on human IgG for C1q to a region involving residues D270, K322, K326, P329, and P331, and E333 (Idusogie et al., 2000\n, J Immunol \n164:4178-4184; Idusogie et al., 2001\n, J Immunol \n166:2571-2575).\n\n\nA site on Fc between the Cγ2 and Cγ3 domains, shown in \nFIG. 1\n, mediates interaction with the neonatal receptor FcRn, the binding of which recycles endocytosed antibody from the endosome back to the bloodstream (Raghavan et al., 1996, \nAnnu Rev Cell Dov Biol \n12:181-220; Ghetie etat, 2000, \nAnnu Rev Immunol \n18:739-766). This process, coupled with preclusion of kidney filtration due to the large size of the full length molecule, results in favorable antibody serum half-lives ranging from one to three weeks. Binding of Fc to FcRn also plays a key role in antibody transport. The binding site for FcRn on Fc is also the site at which the bacterial proteins A and G bind. The tight binding by these proteins is typically exploited as a means to purify antibodies by employing protein A or protein G affinity chromatography during protein purification. Thus the fidelity of this region on Fc is important for both the clinical properties of antibodies and their purification. Available structures of the rat Fc/FcRn complex (Martin et al., 2001, \nMol Cell \n7:867-877), and of the complexes of Fc with proteins A and G (Deisenhofer, 1981, \nBiochemistry \n20:2361-2370; Sauer-Eriksson et al., 1995, \nStructure \n3:265-278; Tashiro et al., 1995\n, Curr Opin Struct Biol \n5:471-481) provide insight into the interaction of Fc with these proteins.\n\n\nA key feature of the Fc region is the conserved N-linked glycosylation that occurs at N297, shown in \nFIG. 1\n. This carbohydrate, or oligosaccharide as it is sometimes referred, plays a critical structural and functional role for the antibody, and is one of the principle reasons that antibodies must be produced using mammalian expression systems. While not wanting to be limited to one theory, it is believed that the structural purpose of this carbohydrate may be to stabilize or solubilize Fc, determine a specific angle or level of flexibility between the Cγ3 and Cγ2 domains, keep the two Cγ2 domains from aggregating with one another across the central axis, or a combination of these. Efficient Fc binding to FcγR and C1q requires this modification, and alterations in the composition of the N297 carbohydrate or its elimination affect binding to these proteins (Umana et al., 1999\n, Nat Biotechnol \n17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001\n, Biotechnol Bioeng \n74:288-294; Mimura et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:45539-45547.; Radaev et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:16478-16483; Shields at al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604; Shields et al., 2002\n, J Biol Chem \n277:26733-26740; Simmons et al., 2002\n, J Immunol Methods \n263:133-147). Yet the carbohydrate makes little if any specific contact with FcγRs (Radaev et al., 2001\n, J Bol Chem \n276:16469-16477), indicating that the functional role of the N297 carbohydrate in mediating Fc/FcγR binding may be via the structural role it plays in determining the Fc conformation. This is supported by a collection of crystal structures of four different Fc glycoforms, which show that the composition of the oligosaccharide impacts the conformation of Cγ2 and as a result the Fc/FcγR interface (Krapp at al., 2003\n, J Mol Biol \n325:979-989).\n\n\nThe features of antibodies discussed above—specificity for target, ability to mediate immune effector mechanisms, and long half-life in serum—make antibodies powerful therapeutics. Monoclonal antibodies are used therapeutically for the treatment of a variety of conditions including cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. There are currently over ten antibody products on the market and hundreds in development. In addition to antibodies, an antibody-like protein that is finding an expanding role in research and therapy is the Fc fusion (Charnow et al, 1996\n, Trends Biotechnol \n14:52-60; Ashkenazi et al., 1997\n, Curr Opin Immunol \n9:195-200). An Fc fusion is a protein wherein one or more polypeptides is operably linked to Fc. An Fc fusion combines the Fc region of an antibody, and thus its favorable effector functions and pharmacokinetics, with the target-binding region of a receptor, ligand, or some other protein or protein domain. The role of the latter is to mediate target recognition, and thus it is functionally analogous to the antibody variable region. Because of the structural and functional overlap of Fc fusions with antibodies, the discussion on antibodies in the present invention extends directly to Fc fusions.\n\n\nDespite such widespread use, antibodies are not optimized for clinical use. Two significant deficiencies of antibodies are their suboptimal anticancer potency and their demanding production requirements. These deficiencies are addressed by the present invention\n\n\nThere are a number of possible mechanisms by which antibodies destroy tumor cells, including anti-proliferation via blockage of needed growth pathways, intracellular signaling leading to apoptosis, enhanced down regulation and/or turnover of receptors, CDC, ADCC, ADCP, and promotion of an adaptive immune response (Cragg et al., 1999, \nCurr Opin Immunol \n11:541-547; Glennie et al., 2000\n, Immunol Today \n21:403-410). Anti-tumor efficacy may be due to a combination of these mechanisms, and their relative importance in clinical therapy appears to be cancer dependent. Despite this arsenal of anti-tumor weapons, the potency of antibodies as anti-cancer agents is unsatisfactory, particularly given their high cost. Patient tumor response data show that monoclonal antibodies provide only a small improvement in therapeutic success over normal single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. For example, just half of all relapsed low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients respond to the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (McLaughlin et al., 1998\n, J Clin Oncol \n16:2825-2833). Of 166 clinical patients, 6% showed a complete response and 42% showed a partial response, with median response duration of approximately 12 months. Trastuzumab (Herceptin®, a registered trademark of Genentech), an anti-HER2/neu antibody for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, has less efficacy. The overall response rate using trastuzumab for the 222 patients tested was only 15%, with 8 complete and 26 partial responses and a median response duration and survival of 9 to 13 months (Cobleigh et al., 1999\n, J Clin Oncol \n17:2639-2648). Currently for anticancer therapy, any small improvement in mortality rate defines success. Thus there is a significant need to enhance the capacity of antibodies to destroy targeted cancer cells.\n\n\nA promising means for enhancing the anti-tumor potency of antibodies is via enhancement of their ability to mediate cytotoxic effector functions such as ADCC, ADCP, and CDC. The importance of FcγR-mediated effector functions for the anti-cancer activity of antibodies has been demonstrated in mice (Clynes et al., 1998\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n95:652-656; Clynes et al., 2000\n, Nat Med \n6:443-446), and the affinity of interaction between Fc and certain FcγRs correlates with targeted cytotoxicity in cell-based assays (Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604; Presta et al., 2002\n, Biochem Soc Trans \n30:487-490; Shields et al., 2002\n, J Biol Chem \n277:26733-25740). Additionally, a correlation has been observed between clinical efficacy in humans and their allotype of high (V158) or low (F158) affinity polymorphic forms of FcγRIIIa (Cartron et al., 2002, \nBlood \n99:754-758). Together these data suggest that an antibody with an Fc region optimized for binding to certain FcγRs may better mediate effector functions and thereby destroy cancer cells more effectively in patients. The balance between activating and inhibiting receptors is an important consideration, and optimal effector function may result from an Fc with enhanced affinity for activation receptors, for example FcγRI, FcγRIIa/c, and FcγRIIIa, yet reduced affinity for the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb. Furthermore, because FcγRs can mediate antigen uptake and processing by antigen presenting cells, enhanced Fc/FcγR affinity may also improve the capacity of antibody therapeutics to elicit an adaptive immune response.\n\n\nMutagenesis studies have been carried out on Fc towards various goals, with substitutions typically made to alanine (referred to as alanine scanning) or guided by sequence homology substitutions (Duncan et al, 1988\n, Nature \n332:563-564; Lund et al., 1991\n, J Immunol \n147:2657-2662; Lund et al., 1992\n, Mol Immunol \n29:53-59; Jefferis et al., 1995\n, Immunol Lett \n44: 111-117; Lund et al., 1995\n, Faseb J \n9:115-119; Jefferis et al., 1996\n, Immunol Lett \n54:101-104; Lund et al., 1996\n, J Immunol \n157:4963-4969; Armour et al., 1999\n, Eur J Immunol \n29:2613-2624; Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604; Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65) (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,821; 5,885,573; PCT WO 00/42072; PCT WO 99/58572). The majority of substitutions reduce or ablate binding with FcγRs. However some success has been achieved at obtaining Fc variants with higher FcγR affinity. (See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821, and PCT WO 00/42072). For example, Winter and colleagues substituted the human amino acid at position 235 of mouse IgG2b antibody (a glutamic acid to leucine mutation) that increased binding of the mouse antibody to human FcγRI by 100-fold (Duncan et al., 1988, \nNature \n332:563-564) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821). Shields et al., used alanine scanning mutagenesis to map Fc residues important to FcγR binding, followed by substitution of select residues with non-alanine mutations (Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604; Presta et al., 2002\n, Biochem Soc Trans \n30:487-490) (PCT WO 00/42072). Several mutations disclosed in this study, including S298A, E333A, and K334A, show enhanced binding to the activating receptor FcγRIIIa and reduced binding to the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb. These mutations were combined to obtain double and triple mutation variants that show additive improvements in binding. The best variant disclosed in this study is a S298A/E333A/K334A triple mutant with approximately a 1.7-fold increase in binding to F158 FcγRIIIa, a 5-fold decrease in binding to FcγRIIb, and a 2.1-fold enhancement in ADCC.\n\n\nEnhanced affinity of Fc for FcγR has also been achieved using engineered glycoforms generated by expression of antibodies in engineered or variant cell lines (Umaña et al., 1999\n, Nat Biotechnol \n17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001\n, Biotechnol Bioeng \n74:288-294; Shields et al., 2002\n, J Biol Chem \n277:26733-26740; Shinkawa et al., 2003\n, J Biol Chem \n278:3466-3473). This approach has generated substantial enhancements of the capacity of antibodies to bind FcγRIIIa and to mediate ADCC. Although there are practical limitations such as the growth efficiency of the expression strains under large scale production conditions, this approach for enhancing Fc/FcγR affinity and effector function is promising. Indeed, coupling of these alternate glycoform technologies with the Fc variants of the present invention may provide additive or synergistic effects for optimal effector function.\n\n\nAlthough there is a need for greater effector function, for some antibody therapeutics reduced or eliminated effector function may be desired. This is often the case for therapeutic antibodies whose mechanism of action involves blocking or antagonism but not killing of the cells bearing target antigen. In these cases depletion of target cells is undesirable and can be considered a side effect. For example, the ability of anti-CD4 antibodies to block CD4 receptors on T cells makes them effective anti-inflammatories, yet their ability to recruit FcγR receptors also directs immune attack against the target cells, resulting in T cell depletion (Reddy et al., 2000\n, J Immunol \n164:1925-1933). Effector function can also be a problem for radiolabeled antibodies, referred to as radioconjugates, and antibodies conjugated to toxins, referred to as immunotoxins. These drugs can be used to destroy cancer cells, but the recruitment of immune cells via Fc interaction with FcγRs brings healthy immune cells in proximity to the deadly payload (radiation or toxin), resulting in depletion of normal lymphoid tissue along with targeted cancer cells (Hutchins et al, 1995\n, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA \n92:11980-11984; White et al., 2001, \nAnnu Rev Med \n52:125-145). This problem can potentially be circumvented by using IgG isotypes that poorly recruit complement or effector cells, for example IgG2 and IgG4. An alternate solution is to develop Fc variants that reduce or ablate binding (Alegre et al., 1994\n, Transplantation \n57:1537-1543; Hutchins et al, 1995\n, Proc Natl Aced Sci USA \n92:11980-11984; Armour et al., 1999\n, Eur J Immunol \n29:2613-2624; Reddy et al., 2000\n, J Immunol \n164:1925-1933; Xu et al., 2000\n, Cell Immunol \n200:16-26; Shields et al., 2001\n, J Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604) (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,194,551; 5,885,573; PCT WO 99/58572). A critical consideration for the reduction or elimination of effector function is that other important antibody properties not be perturbed. Fc variants should be engineered that not only ablate binding to FcγRs and/or C1q, but also maintain antibody stability, solubility, and structural integrity, as well as ability to interact with other important Fc ligands such as FcRn and proteins A and G.\n\n\nThe present invention addresses another major shortcoming of antibodies, namely their demanding production requirements (Garber, 2001\n, Nat Biotechnol \n19:184-185; Dove, 2002\n, Nat Biotechnol \n20:777-779). Antibodies must be expressed in mammalian cells, and the currently marketed antibodies together with other high-demand biotherapeutics consume essentially all of the available manufacturing capacity. With hundreds of biologics in development, the majority of which are antibodies, there is an urgent need for more efficient and cheaper methods of production. The downstream effects of insufficient antibody manufacturing capacity are three-fold. First, it dramatically raises the cost of goods to the producer, a cost that is passed on to the patient. Second, it hinders industrial production of approved antibody products, limiting availability of high demand therapeutics to patients. Finally, because clinical trials require large amounts of a protein that is not yet profitable, the insufficient supply impedes progress of the growing antibody pipeline to market.\n\n\nAlternative production methods have been explored in attempts at alleviating this problem. Transgenic plants and animals are being pursued as potentially cheaper and higher capacity production systems (Chadd et al., 2001\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n12:188-194). Such expression systems, however, can generate glycosylation patterns significantly different from human glycoproteins. This may result in reduced or even lack of effector function because, as discussed above, the carbohydrate structure can significantly impact FcγR and complement binding. A potentially greater problem with nonhuman glycoforms may be immunogenicity; carbohydrates are a key source of antigenicity for the immune system, and the presence of nonhuman glycoforms has a significant chance of eliciting antibodies that neutralize the therapeutic, or worse cause adverse immune reactions. Thus the efficacy and safety of antibodies produced by transgenic plants and animals remains uncertain. Bacterial expression is another attractive solution to the antibody production problem. Expression in bacteria, for example \nE. coli\n, provides a cost-effective and high capacity method for producing proteins. For complex proteins such as antibodies there are a number of obstacles to bacterial expression, including folding and assembly of these complex molecules, proper disulfide formation, and solubility, stability, and functionality in the absence of glycosylation because proteins expressed in bacteria are not glycosylated. Full length unglycosylated antibodies that bind antigen have been successfully expressed in \nE. coli \n(Simmons et al., 2002\n, J Immunol Methods \n263:133-147), and thus, folding, assembly, and proper disulfide formation of bacterially expressed antibodies are possible in the absence of the eukaryotic chaperone machinery. However the ultimate utility of bacterially expressed antibodies as therapeutics remains hindered by the lack of glycosylation, which results in lack effector function and may result in poor stability and solubility. This will likely be more problematic for formulation at the high concentrations for the prolonged periods demanded by clinical use.\n\n\nAn aglycosylated Fc with favorable solution properties and the capacity to mediate effector functions would be significantly enabling for the alternate production methods described above. By overcoming the structural and functional shortcomings of aglycosylated Fc, antibodies can be produced in bacteria and transgenic plants and animals with reduced risk of immunogenicity, and with effector function for clinical applications in which cytotoxicity is desired such as cancer. The present invention describes the utilization of protein engineering methods to develop stable, soluble Fc variants with effector function. Currently, such Fc variants do not exist in the art.\n\n\nIn summary, there is a need for antibodies with enhanced therapeutic properties. Engineering of optimized or enhanced Fc variants is a promising approach to meeting this need. Yet a substantial obstacle to engineering Fc variants with the desired properties is the difficulty in predicting what amino acid modifications, out of the enormous number of possibilities, will achieve the desired goals, coupled with the inefficient production and screening methods for antibodies. Indeed one of the principle reasons for the incomplete success of the prior art is that approaches to Fc engineering have thus far involved hit-or-miss methods such as alanine scans or production of glycoforms using different expression strains. In these studies, the Fc modifications that were made were fully or partly random in hopes of obtaining variants with favorable properties. The present invention provides a variety of engineering methods, many of which are based on more sophisticated and efficient techniques, which may be used to overcome these obstacles in order to develop Fc variants that are optimized for the desired properties. The described engineering methods provide design strategies to guide Fc modification, computational screening methods to design favorable Fc variants, library generation approaches for determining promising variants for experimental investigation, and an array of experimental production and screening methods for determining the Fc variants with favorable properties.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides Fc variants that are optimized for a number of therapeutically relevant properties.\n\n\nIt is an object of the present invention to provide novel Fc positions at which amino acid modifications may be made to generate optimized Fc variants. Said Fc positions include 240, 244, 245, 247, 262, 263, 266, 299, 313, 325, 328, and 332, wherein the numbering of the residues in the Fc region is that of the EU index as in Kabat. The present invention describes any amino acid modification at any of said novel Fc positions in order to generate an optimized Fc variant.\n\n\nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide Fc variants that have been screened computationally.

Antibody structure and function. Shown is a model of a full length human IgG1 antibody, modeled using a humanized Fab structure from pdb accession code 1CE1 (James et al., 1999, \nJ Mol Biol \n289:293-301) and a human IgG1 Fc structure from pdb accession code 1DN2 (DeLano et al., 2000\n, Science \n287:1279-1283). The flexible hinge that links the Fab and Fc regions is not shown. IgG1 is a homodimer of heterodimers, made up of two light chains and two heavy chains. The Ig domains that comprise the antibody are labeled, and include V\nL \nand C\nL \nfor the light chain, and V\nH\n, Cgamma1 (Cγ1), Cgamma2 (Cγ2), and Cgamma3 (Cγ3) for the heavy chain. The Fc region is labeled. Binding sites for relevant proteins are labeled, including the antigen binding site in the variable region, and the binding sites for FcγRs, FcRn, C1q, and proteins A and G in the Fc region.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n. The FcFcγRIIb complex structure 1IIS. Fc is shown as a gray ribbon diagram, and FcγRIIb is shown as a black ribbon. The N297 carbohydrate is shown as black sticks.\n\n\n \nFIG. 3\n. \nFIG. 3\n depicts SEQ ID NO: 1. The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain of the antibody alemtuzumab (Campath®, a registered trademark of Ilex Pharmaceuticals LP), illustrating positions numbered sequentially (2 lines above the amino acid sequence) and positions numbered according to the EU index as in Kabat (2 lines below the amino acid sequence. The approximate beginnings of 1g domains VH1, Cγ1, the hinge, Cγ2, and Cγ3 are also labeled above the sequential numbering. Polymorphisms have been observed at a number of Fc positions, including but not limited to \nKabat\n 270, 272, 312, 315, 356, and 358, and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the prior art may exist.\n\n\n \nFIG. 4\n. Experimental library residues mapped onto the Fc/FcγRIIIb complex structure 1IIS. Fc is shown as a gray ribbon diagram, and FcγRIIIb is shown as a black ribbon. Experimental library residues are shown as black ball and slicks. The N297 carbohydrate is shown as black sticks.\n\n\n \nFIG. 5\n. \nFIG. 5\n depicts SEQ ID NO: 2. The human IgG1 Fc sequence showing positions relevant to the design of the Fc variant experimental library. The sequence includes the hinge region, domain Cγ2, and domain Cγ3. Residue numbers are according to the EU index as in Kabat. Positions relevant to the experimental library are underlined. Because of observed polymorphic mutations at a number of Fc positions, slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the literature may exist.\n\n\n \nFIG. 6\n. Expression of Fc variant and wild type (WT) proteins of alemtuzumab in 293T cells. Plasmids containing alemtuzumab heavy chain genes (WT or variants) were co-transfected with plasmid containing the alemtuzumab light chain gene. Media were harvested 5 days after transfection. For each transfected sample, 10 ul medium was loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel for Western analysis. The probe for Western was peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG (Jackson Immuno-Research, catalog #109-035-088). WT: wild type alemtuzumab; 1-10: alemtuzumab variants. H and L indicate antibody heavy chain and light chain, respectively.\n\n\n \nFIG. 7\n. Purification of alemtuzumab using protein A chromatography. WT alemtuzumab proteins was expressed in 293T cells and the media was harvested 5 days after transfection. The media were diluted 1:1 with PBS and purified with protein A (Pierce, Catalog #20334). O: original sample before purification; FT: flow through; E: elution; C: concentrated final sample. The left picture shows a Simple Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel, and the right shows a western blot labeled using peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG.\n\n\n \nFIG. 8\n. Production of deglycosylated antibodies. Wild type and variants of alemtuzumab were expressed in 293T cells and purified with protein A chromatography. Antibodies were incubated with peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase F) at 37° C. for 24 h. For each antibody, a mock treated sample (-PNGase F) was done in parallel. WT: wild-type alemtuzumab; #15, #16, #17, #18, #22: alemtuzumab variants F241E/F243R/V262E/V264R, F241E/F243Q/V262T/V264E, F241R/F243Q/V262T/V264R, F241E/F243Y/V262T/V264R, and I332E respectively. The faster migration of the PNGase F treated versus the mock treated samples represents the deglycosylated heavy chains.\n\n\n \nFIG. 9\n. Alemtuzumab expressed from 293T cells binds its antigen. The antigenic CD52 peptide, fused to GST, was expressed in \nE. coli \nBL21 (DE3) under IPTG induction. Both uninduced and induced samples were run on a SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to PVDF membrane. For western analysis, either alemtuzumab from Sotec (α-CD52, Sotec) (final concentration 2.5 ng/ul) or media of transfected 293T cells (Campath, Xencor) (final alemtuzumab concentration approximately 0.1-0.2 ng/ul) were used as primary antibody, and peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG was used as secondary antibody. M: pre-stained marker; U: un-induced sample for GST-CD52; I. induced sample for GST-CD52.\n\n\n \nFIG. 10\n. Expression and purification of extracellular region of human V158 FcγRIIIa. Tagged FcγRIIa was transfected in 293T cells, and media containing secreted FcγRIIIa were harvested 3 days later and purified using affinity chromatography. 1: media; 2: flow through; 3: wash; 4-8: serial elutions. Both simple blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel and western result are shown. For the western blot, membrane was probed with anti-GST antibody.\n\n\n \nFIG. 11\n. Binding to human V158 FcγRIIIa by select alemtuzumab Fc variants from the experimental library as determined by the AlphaScreen™ assay, described in Example 2. In the presence of competitor antibody (Fc variant or WT alemtuzumab) a characteristic inhibition curve is observed as a decrease in luminescence signal. Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) alone was used as the negative control. These data were normalized to the maximum and minimum luminescence signal provided by the baselines at low and high concentrations of competitor antibody respectively. The curves represent the fits of the data to a one site competition model using nonlinear regression. These fits provide IC50s for each antibody, illustrated for WT and S239D by the dotted lines.\n\n\n \nFIG. 12\n. AlphaScreen™ assay showing binding of select alemtuzumab Fc variants to human FcγRIIb. The data were normalized, and the curves represent the fits of the data to a one site competition model. PBS was used as a negative control.\n\n\n \nFIG. 13\n. AlphaScreen™ assay showing binding of select alemtuzumab Fc variants to human Val158 FcγRIIIa. The data were normalized, and the curves represent the fits of the data to a one site competition model.

Such definitions are meant to encompass grammatical equivalents.\n\n\nBy “ADCC” or “antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity” as used herein is meant the cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell.\n\n\nBy “ADCP” or antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis as used herein is meant the cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell.\n\n\nBy “amino acid modification” herein is meant an amino acid substitution, insertion, and/or deletion in a polypeptide sequence. The preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution.\n\n\nBy “antibody” herein is meant a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by all or part of the recognized immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes, for example in humans, include the kappa (κ), lambda (λ), and heavy chain genetic loci, which together comprise the myriad variable region genes, and the constant region genes mu (μ), delta (δ), gamma (γ), sigma (ε), and alpha (α) which encode the IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, and IgA isotypes respectively. Antibody herein is meant to include full length antibodies and antibody fragments, and may refer to a natural antibody from any organism, an engineered antibody, or an antibody generated recombinantly for experimental, therapeutic, or other purposes as further defined below. Thus, “antibody” includes both polyclonal and monoclonal antibody (mAb). Methods of preparation and purification of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are known in the art and e.g., are described in Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988). As outlined herein, “antibody” specifically includes Fc variants described herein, “full length” antibodies including the Fc variant fragments described herein, and Fc variant fusions to other proteins as described herein.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, antibodies can be neutralizing or inhibitory, or stimulatory, and in preferred embodiments, as described herein, the stimulatory activity is measured by an increase in affinity of a variant antibody to a receptor, as compared to either the parent antibody (e.g. when a non-naturally occurring variant is used as the starting point for the computation analysis herein), or to the original wild-type antibody. Accordingly, by “neutralization,” “neutralize,” “neutralizing” and grammatical equivalents herein is meant to inhibit or lessen the biological effect of the antibody, in some cases by binding (e.g. competitively) to a antigen and avoiding or decreasing the biological effect of binding, or by binding that results in decreasing the biological effect of binding.\n\n\nThe term “antibody” include antibody fragments, as are known in the art, such as Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)2, Fcs or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies, such as, single chain antibodies (Fv for example), chimeric antibodies, etc., either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or those synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA technologies. Particularly preferred are Fc variants as described herein. The term “antibody” further comprises polyclonal antibodies and mAbs which can be agonist or antagonist antibodies.\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention specifically bind to Fc receptors, as outlined herein. By “specifically bind” herein is meant that the LC antibodies have a binding constant in the range of at least 10\n−4\n-10\n−6 \nM\n−1\n, with a preferred range being 10\n−7\n-10\n−9 \nM\n−1\n.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are humanized. Using current monoclonal antibody technology one can produce a humanized antibody to virtually any target antigen that can be identified [Stein, Trends Biotechnol. 15:88-90 (1997)]. Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric molecules of immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fc, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)2 or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues form a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin [Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992)]. Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues, which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers [Jones et al., supra; Riechmann et al., supra; and Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)], by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Additional examples of humanized murine monoclonal antibodies are also known in the art, e.g., antibodies binding human protein C [O'Connor et al., Protein Eng. 11:321-8 (1998)], \ninterleukin\n 2 receptor [Queen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 86:10029-33 (1989]), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [Carter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89:4285-9 (1992)]. Accordingly, such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are based on human sequences, and are thus human sequences are used as the “base” sequences, against which other sequences, such as rat, mouse and monkey sequences. In order to establish homology to primary sequence or structure, the amino acid sequence of a precursor or parent Fc is directly compared to the human Fc sequence outlined herein. After aligning the sequences, using one or more of the homology alignment programs described herein (for example using conserved residues as between species), allowing for necessary insertions and deletions in order to maintain alignment (i.e., avoiding the elimination of conserved residues through arbitrary deletion and insertion), the residues equivalent to particular amino acids in the primary sequence of human Fc are defined. Alignment of conserved residues preferably should conserve 100% of such residues. However, alignment of greater than 75% or as little as 50% of conserved residues is also adequate to define equivalent residues (sometimes referred to herein as “corresponding residues”).\n\n\nEquivalent residues may also be defined by determining homology at the level of tertiary structure for an Fc fragment whose tertiary structure has been determined by x-ray crystallography. Equivalent residues are defined as those for which the atomic coordinates of two or more of the main chain atoms of a particular amino acid residue of the parent or precursor (N on N, CA on CA, C on C and O on O) are within 0.13 nm and preferably 0.1 nm after alignment. Alignment is achieved after the best model has been oriented and positioned to give the maximum overlap of atomic coordinates of non-hydrogen protein atoms of the Fc variant fragment.\n\n\nSpecifically included within the definition of “antibody” are aglycosylated antibodies. By “aglycosylated antibody” as used herein is meant an antibody that lacks carbohydrate attached at position 297 of the Fc region, wherein numbering is according to the EU system as in Kabat. The aglycosylated antibody may be a deglycosylated antibody, that is an antibody for which the Fc carbohydrate has been removed, for example chemically or enzymatically. Alternatively, the aglycosylated antibody may be a nonglycosylated or unglycosylated antibody, that is an antibody that was expressed without Fc carbohydrate, for example by mutation of one or residues that encode the glycosylation pattern or by expression in an organism that does not attach carbohydrates to proteins, for example bacteria.\n\n\nSpecifically included within the definition of “antibody” are full-length antibodies that contain an Fc variant portion. By “full length antibody” herein is meant the structure that constitutes the natural biological form of an antibody, Including variable and constant regions. For example, in most mammals, including humans and mice, the full length antibody of the IgG class is a tetramer and consists of two identical pairs of two immunoglobulin chains, each pair having one light and one heavy chain, each light chain comprising immunoglobulin domains V\nL \nand C\nL\n, and each heavy chain comprising immunoglobulin domains V\nH\n, Cγ1, Cγ2, and Cγ3. In some mammals, for example in camels and llamas, IgG antibodies may consist of only two heavy chains, each heavy chain comprising a variable domain attached to the Fc region. By “IgG” as used herein is meant a polypeptide belonging to the class of antibodies that are substantially encoded by a recognized immunoglobulin gamma gene. In humans this class comprises IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. In mice this class comprises IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3.\n\n\nBy “amino acid” and “amino acid identity” as used herein is meant one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids or any non-natural analogues that may be present at a specific, defined position. By “protein” herein is meant at least two covalently attached amino acids, which includes proteins, polypeptides, oligopeptides and peptides. The protein may be made up of naturally occurring amino acids and peptide bonds, or synthetic peptidomimetic structures, i.e. “analogs”, such as peptoids (see Simon et al., PNAS USA 89(20):9367 (1992)) particularly when LC peptides are to be administered to a patient. Thus “amino acid”, or “peptide residue”, as used herein means both naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids. For example, homophenylalanine, citrulline and noreleucine are considered amino acids for the purposes of the invention. “Amino acid” also includes imino acid residues such as proline and hydroxyproline. The side chain may be in either the (R) or the (S) configuration. In the preferred embodiment, the amino acids are in the (S) or L-configuration. If non-naturally occurring side chains are used, non-amino acid substituents may be used, for example to prevent or retard in vivo degradation.\n\n\nBy “computational screening method” herein is meant any method for designing one or more mutations in a protein, wherein said method utilizes a computer to evaluate the energies of the interactions of potential amino acid side chain substitutions with each other and/or with the rest of the protein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, evaluation of energies, referred to as energy calculation, refers to some method of scoring one or more amino acid modifications. Said method may involve a physical or chemical energy term, or may involve knowledge-, statistical, sequence-based energy terms, and the like. The calculations that compose a computational screening method are herein referred to as “computational screening calculations”.\n\n\nBy “effector function” as used herein is meant a biochemical event that results from the interaction of an antibody Fc region with an Fc receptor or ligand. Effector functions include but are not limited to ADCC, ADCP, and CDC. By “effector cell” as used herein is meant a cell of the immune system that expresses one or more Fc receptors and mediates one or more effector functions. Effector cells include but are not limited to monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritc cells, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, B cells, large granular lymphocytes, Langerhans' cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and γγ T cells, and may be from any organism including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. By “library” herein is meant a set of Fc variants in any form, including but not limited to a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, a list of nucleic acid or amino acid substitutions at variable positions, a physical library comprising nucleic acids that encode the library sequences, or a physical library comprising the Fc variant proteins, either in purified or unpurified form.\n\n\nBy “Fc”, “Fc region”, FC polypeptide”, etc. as used herein is meant an antibody as defined herein that includes the polypeptides comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA, IgD, and IgG, and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM, and the flexible hinge N-terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM Fc may include the J chain. For IgG, as illustrated in \nFIG. 1\n, Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains Cgamma2 and Cgamma3 (Cγ2 and Cγ3) and the hinge between Cgamma1 (Cγ1) and Cgamma2 (Cγ2). Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to comprise residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl-terminus, wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. Fc may refer to this region in isolation, or this region in the context of an antibody, antibody fragment, or Fc fusion. An Fc may be an antibody, Fc fusion, or an protein or protein domain that comprises Fc. Particularly preferred are Fc variants, which are non-naturally occurring variants of an Fc.\n\n\nBy “Fc fusion” as used herein is meant a protein wherein one or more polypeptides is operably linked to Fc. Fc fusion is herein meant to be synonymous with the terms “immunoadhesin”, “Ig fusion”, “Ig chimera”, and “receptor globulin” (sometimes with dashes) as used in the prior art (Chamow et al., 1996\n, Trends Biotechnol \n14:52-60; Ashkenazi et al., 1997\n, Curr Opin Immunol \n9:195-200). An Fc fusion combines the Fc region of an immunoglobulin with a fusion partner, which in general can be any protein, including, but not limited to, the target-binding region of a receptor, an adhesion molecule, a ligand, an enzyme, or some other protein or protein domain. The role of the non-Fc part of an Fc fusion is to mediate target binding, and thus it is functionally analogous to the variable regions of an antibody.\n\n\nBy “Fc gamma receptor” or “FcγR” as used herein is meant any member of the family of proteins that bind the IgG antibody Fc region and are substantially encoded by the FcγR genes. In humans this family includes but is not limited to FcγRI (CD64), including isoforms FcγRIa, FcγRIb, and FcγRIc; FcγRII (CD32), including isoforms FcγRIIa (including allotypes H131 and R131), FcγRIIb (including FcγRIIb-1 and FcγRIIb-2), and FcγRIIc; and FcγRIII (CD16), including isoforms FcγRIIIa (including allotypes V158 and F158) and FcγRIIIb (including allotypes FcγRIIIb-NA1 and FcγRIIb-NA2) (Jefferis et al., 2002\n, Immunol Lett \n82:57-65), as well as any undiscovered human FcγRs or FcγR isoforms or allotypes. An FcγR may be from any organism, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. Mouse FcγRs include but are not limited to FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32), FcγRIII (CD16), and FcγRIII-2 (CD16-2), as well as any undiscovered mouse FcγRs or FcγR isoforms or allotypes.\n\n\nBy “Fc ligand” as used herein is meant a molecule, preferably a polypeptide, from any organism that binds to the Fc region of an antibody to form an Fc-ligand complex. Fc ligands include but are not limited to FcγRs, FcγRs, FcγRs, FcRn, C1q, C3, mannan binding lectin, mannose receptor, staphylococcal protein A, streptococcal protein G, and viral FcγR. Fc ligands may include undiscovered molecules that bind Fc\n\n\nBy “IgG” as used herein is mean1 a polypeptide belonging to the class of antibodies that are substantially encoded by a recognized immunoglobulin gamma gene. In humans this class comprises IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. In mice this class comprises IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3. By “immunoglobulin (Ig)” herein is meant a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes. Immunoglobulins include but are not limited to antibodies. Immunoglobulins may have a number of structural forms, including but not limited to full length antibodies, antibody fragments, and individual immunoglobulin domains. By “immunoglobulin (Ig) domain” herein is meant a region of an immunoglobulin that exists as a distinct structural entity as ascertained by one skilled in the art of protein structure. Ig domains typically have a characteristic □-sandwich folding topology. The known Ig domains in the IgG class of antibodies are V\nH\n, Cγ1, Cγ2, Cγ3, V\nL\n, and C\nL\n.\n\n\nBy “parent polypeptide” or “precursor polypetide” (including Fc parent or precursors) as used herein is meant a polypeptide that is subsequently modified to generate a variant. Said parent polypeptide may be a naturally occurring polypeptide, or a variant or engineered version of a naturally occurring polypeptide. Parent polypeptide may refer to the polypeptide itself, compositions that comprise the parent polypeptide, or the amino acid sequence that encodes it. Accordingly, by “parent Fc polypeptide” as used herein is meant an unmodified Fc polypeptide that is modified to generate a variant, and by “parent antibody” as used herein is meant an unmodified antibody that is modified to generate a variant antibody.\n\n\nAs outlined above, certain positions of the Fc molecule can be altered. By “Position” as used herein is meant a location in the sequence of a protein. Positions may be numbered sequentially, or according to an established format, for example the EU index as in Kabat. For example, position 297 is a position in the human antibody IgG1. Corresponding positions are determined as outlined above, generally through alignment with other parent sequences.\n\n\nBy “residue” as used herein is meant a position in a protein and its associated amino acid identity. For example, Daragine 297 (also referred to as N297, also referred to as N297) is a residue in the human antibody IgG1.\n\n\nBy “target antigen” as used herein is meant the molecule that is bound specifically by the variable region of a given antibody. A target antigen may be a protein, carbohydrate, lipid, or other chemical compound.\n\n\nBy “target cell” as used herein is meant a cell that expresses a target antigen.\n\n\nBy “variable region” as used herein is meant the region of an immunoglobulin that comprises one or more Ig domains substantially encoded by any of the Vκ, Vλ, and/or V\nH \ngenes that make up the kappa, lambda, and heavy chain immunoglobulin genetic loci respectively.\n\n\nBy “variant polypeptide” as used herein is meant a polypeptide sequence that differs from that of a parent polypeptide sequence by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. Variant polypeptide may refer to the polypeptide itself, a composition comprising the polypeptide, or the amino sequence that encodes it. Preferably, the variant polypeptide has at least one amino acid modification compared to the parent polypeptide, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid modifications, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid modifications compared to the parent. The variant polypeptide sequence herein will preferably possess at least about 80% homology with a parent polypeptide sequence, and most preferably at least about 90% homology, more preferably at least about 95% homology. Accordingly, by “Fc variant” as used herein is meant an Fc sequence that differs from that of a parent Fc sequence by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. An Fc variant may only encompass an Fc region, or may exist in the context of an antibody, Fc fusion, or other polypeptide that is substantially encoded by Fc. Fc variant may refer to the Fc polypeptide itself, compositions comprising the Fc variant polypeptide, or the amino acid sequence that encodes it.\n\n\nFor all positions discussed in the present invention, numbering of an immunoglobulin heavy chain is according to the EU index (Kabat et al., 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., United States Public Health Svice, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). The “EU index as in Kabat” refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be optimized for a variety of properties. Properties that may be optimized include but are not limited to enhanced or reduced affinity for an FcγR. In a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to possess enhanced affinity for a human activating FcγR, preferably FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIc, FcγRIIIa, and FcγRIIIb, most preferably FcγRIIIa. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are optimized to possess reduced affinity for the human inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb. These preferred embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans, for example enhanced effector function and greater anti-cancer potency. In an alternate embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to have reduced or ablated affinity for a human FcγR, including but not limited to FcγRI, FCγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIc, FcγRIIIa, and FcγRIIIb. These embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans, for example reduced effector function and reduced toxicity. Preferred embodiments comprise optimization of Fc binding to a human FcγR, however in alternate embodiments the Fc variants of the present invention possess enhanced or reduced affinity for FcγRs from nonhuman organisms, including but not limited to mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. Fc variants that are optimized for binding to a nonhuman FcγR may find use in experimentation. For example, mouse models are available for a variety of diseases that enable testing of properties such as efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics for a given drug candidate. As is known in the art, cancer cells can be grafted or injected into mice to mimic a human cancer, a process referred to as xenografting. Testing of antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise Fc variants that are optimized for one or more mouse FcγRs, may provide valuable information with regard to the efficacy of the antibody or Fc fusion, its mechanism of action, and the like. The Fc variants of the present invention may also be optimized for enhanced functionality and/or solution properties in aglycosylated form. In a preferred embodiment, the aglycosylated Fc variants of the present invention bind an Fc ligand with greater affinity than the aglycosylated form of the parent Fc polypeptide. Said Fc ligands include but are not limited to FcγRs, C1q, FcRn, and proteins A and G, and may be from any source including but not limited to human, mouse, rat, rabbit, or monkey, preferably human. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are optimized to be more stable and/or more soluble than the aglycosylated form of the parent Fc polypeptide. An Fc variant that is engineered or predicted to display any of the aforementioned optimized properties is herein referred to as an “optimized Fc variant”.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be derived from parent Fc polypeptides that are themselves from a wide range of sources. The parent Fc polypeptide may be substantially encoded by one or more Fc genes from any organism, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, camels, llamas, dromedaries, monkeys, preferably mammals and most preferably humans and mice. In a preferred embodiment, the parent Fc polypeptide composes an antibody, referred to as the parent antibody. The parent antibody may be fully human, obtained for example using transgenic mice (Bruggemann et al., 1997\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n8:455-458) or human antibody libraries coupled with selection methods (Griffiths at al., 1998\n, Curr Opin Biotechnol \n9:102-108). The parent antibody need not be naturally occurring. For example, the parent antibody may be an engineered antibody, including but not limited to chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies (Clark, 2000\n, Immunol Today \n21:397-402). The parent antibody may be an engineered variant of an antibody that is substantially encoded by one or more natural antibody genes. In one embodiment, the parent antibody has been affinity matured, as is known in the art. Alternatively, the antibody has been modified in some other way, for example as described in U.S. Ser. No 10/339,788, filed on Mar. 3, 2003.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes belonging to any of the antibody classes. In a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention find use in antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise sequences belonging to the IgG class of antibodies, including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4. In an alternate embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention find use in antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise sequences belonging to the IgA (including subclasses IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, IgE, IgG, or IgM classes of antibodies. The Fc variants of the present invention may comprise more than one protein chain. That is, the present invention may find use in an antibody or Fc fusion that is a monomer or an oligomer, including a homo- or hetero-oligomer.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other Fc modifications, including but not limited to modifications that alter effector function. Such combination may provide additive, synergistic, or novel properties in antibodies or Fc fusions. In one embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other known Fc variants (Duncan et al., 1988, \nNature \n332:563-564; Lund et al., 1991\n, J Immunol \n147:2657-2662; Lund et al., 1992, \nMol Immunol \n29:53-59; Alegre et al., 1994, \nTransplantation \n57:1537-1543; Hutchins et al., 1995, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n92:11980-11984; Jefferis et al., 1995, \nImmunol Lett \n44:111-117; Lund et al., 1995, \nFasebJ \n9:115-119; Jefferis et al., 1996, \nImmunol Lett \n54:10′-104; Lund et al., 1996, \nJ Immunol \n157:4963-4969; Armour et al., 1999, \nEur J Immunol \n29:2613-2624; Idusogie et al., 2000, \nJ Immunol \n164:4178-4184; Reddy et al., 2000, \nJ Immunol \n164:1925-1933; Xu et al, 2000, \nCell Immunol \n200:16-26; Idusogie et al., 2001, \nJ Immunol \n166:2571-2575; Shields et al., 2001, \nJ Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604; Jefferis et al., 2002, \nImmunol Lett \n82:57-65; Presta et al., 2002, \nBiochem Soc Trans \n30:487-490) (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,821; 5,885,573; 6,194,551; PCT WO 00/42072; PCT WO 99/58572). In an alternate embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are incorporated into an antibody or Fc fusion that comprises one or more engineered glycoforms. By “engineered glycoform” as used herein is meant a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to an Fc polypeptide, wherein said carbohydrate composition differs chemically from that of a parent Fc polypeptide. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to enhancing or reducing effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by any method, for example by using engineered or variant expression strains, by co-expression with one or more enzymes, for example β1-4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), by expressing an Fc polypeptide in various organisms or cell lines from various organisms, or by modifying carbohydrate(s) after the Fc polypeptide has been expressed. Methods for generating engineered glycoforms are known in the art, and include but are not limited to (Umaña et al., 1999, \nNat Biotechnol \n17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001, \nBiotechnol Bioeng \n74:288-294; Shields et al., 2002, \nJ Biol Chem \n277:26733-26740; Shinkawa et al., 2003, \nJ Biol Chem \n278:3466-3473) U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684; U.S. Ser. Nos. 10/277,370; 10/113,929; PCT WO 00/61739A1; PCT WO 01/29246A1; PCT WO 02/31140A1; PCT WO 02/30954A1; Potelligent™ technology (Biowa, Inc., Princeton, N.J.); GlycoMAb™ glycosylation engineering technology (GLYCART biotechnology AG, Zürich, Switzerland)). Engineered glycoform typically refers to the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide; thus an Fc polypeptide, for example an antibody or Fc fusion, may comprise an engineered glycoform. Alternatively, engineered glycoform may refer to the Fc polypeptide that comprises the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide. Thus combinations of the Fc variants of the present invention with other Fc modifications, as well as undiscovered Fc modifications, are contemplated with the goal of generating novel antibodies or Fc fusions with optimized properties.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody. By “antibody of the present invention” as used herein is meant an antibody that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention. The present invention may, in fact, find use in any protein that comprises Fc, and thus application of the Fc variants of the present invention is not limited to antibodies. The Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an Fc fusion. By “Fc fusion of the present invention” as used herein refers to an Fc fusion that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention. Fc fusions may comprise an Fc variant of the present invention operably linked to a cytokine, soluble receptor domain, adhesion molecule, ligand, enzyme, peptide, or other protein or protein domain, and include but are not limited to Fc fusions described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,843,725; 6,018,026; 6,291,212; 6,291,646; 6,300,099; 6,323,323; PCT WO 00/24782; and in (Chamow et al., 1996, \nTrends Biotechnol \n14:52-60; Ashkenazi et al., 1997, \nCurr Opin Immunol \n9:195-200).\n\n\nVirtually any antigen may be targeted by the antibodies and fusions of the present invention, including but are not limited to the following list of proteins, subunits, domains, motifs, and epitopes belonging to the following list of proteins: CD2; CD3, CD3E, CD4, CD11, CD11a, CD14, CD16, CD18, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD28, CD29, CD30, CD32, CD33 (p67 protein), CD38, CD40, CD40L, CD52, CD54, CD56, CD80, CD147, GD3, IL-1, IL-1R, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-6R, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-23, interferon alpha, interferon beta, interferon gamma; TNF-alpha, TNFbeta2, TNFc, TNFalphabeta, TNF-RI, TNF-RII, FasL, CD27L, CD30L, 4-1BBL, TRAIL, RANKL, TWEAK, APRIL, BAFF, LIGHT, VEG1, OX40L, TRAIL Receptor-1, A1 Adenosine Receptor, Lymphotoxin Beta Receptor, TACI, BAFF-R, EPO; LFA-3, ICAM-1, ICAM-3, EpCAM, integrin beta1, integrin beta2, integrin alpha4/beta7, integrin alpha2, integrin alpha3, integrin alpha4, integrin alpha5, integrin alpha6, integrin alphav, alphaVbeta3 integrin, FGFR-3, Keratinocyte Growth Factor, VLA-1, VLA-4, L-selectin, anti-id, E-selectin, HLA, HLA-DR, CTLA-4, T cell receptor, B7-1, B7-2, VNRintegrin, TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2, eotaxin1, BLyS (B-lymphocyte Stimulator), complement C5, IgE, factor VII, CD64, CBL, NCA 90, EGFR (ErbB-1), Her2/neu (ErbB-2), Her3 (ErbB-3), Her4 (ErbB-4), Tissue Factor, VEGF, VEGFR, endothelin receptor, VLA-4, Hapten NP-cap or NIP-cap, T cell receptor alpha/beta, E-selectin, digoxin, placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and testicular PLAP-like alkaline phosphatase, transferrin receptor, Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CEACAM5, HMFG PEM, mucin MUC1, MUC18, Heparanase I, human cardiac myosin, tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG-72), tumor-associated antigen CA 125, Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), High molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA), carcinoma-associated antigen, Gcoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa), tumor-associated antigen expressing Lewis Y related carbohydrate, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gH envelope glycoprotein, HIV gp120, HCMV, respiratory syncital virus RSV F, RSVF Fgp, VNRintegrin, IL-8, cytokeratin tumor-associated antigen, Hep B gp120, CMV, gpllbllla, HIV IIIB gp120 V3 loop, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Fgp, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) gD glycoprotein, HSV gB glycoprotein, HCMV gB envelope glycoprotein, and \nClostridium perfringens \ntoxin.\n\n\nOne skilled in the art will appreciate that the aforementioned list of targets refers not only to specific proteins and biomolecules, but the biochemical pathway or pathways that comprise them. For example, reference to CTLA-4 as a target antigen implies that the ligands and receptors that make up the T cell co-stimulatory pathway, including CTLA-4, B7-1, B7-2, CD28, and any other undiscovered ligands or receptors that bind these proteins, are also targets. Thus target as used herein refers not only to a specific biomolecule, but the set of proteins that interact with said target and the members of the biochemical pathway to which said target belongs. One skilled in the art will further appreciate that any of the aforementioned target antigens, the ligands or receptors that bind them, or other members of their corresponding biochemical pathway, may be operably linked to the Fc variants of the present invention in order to generate an Fc fusion. Thus for example, an Fc fusion that targets EGFR could be constructed by operably linking an Fc variant to EGF, TGFα, or any other ligand, discovered or undiscovered, that binds EGFR. Accordingly, an Fc variant of the present invention could be operably linked to EGFR in order to generate an Fc fusion that binds EGF, TGFα, or any other ligand, discovered or undiscovered, that binds EGFR. Thus virtually any polypeptide, whether a ligand, receptor, or some other protein or protein domain, including but not limited to the aforementioned targets and the proteins that compose their corresponding biochemical pathways, may be operably linked to the Fc variants of the present invention to develop an Fc fusion.\n\n\nA number of antibodies and Fc fusions that are approved for use, in clinical trials, or in development may benefit from the Fc variants of the present invention. Said antibodies and Fc fusions are herein referred to as “clinical products and candidates”. Thus in a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in a range of clinical products and candidates. For example, a number of antibodies that target CD20 may benefit from the Fc variants of the present invention. For example the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody that is substantially similar to rituximab (Rituxan®, IDEC/Genentech/Roche) (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,137), a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody approved to treat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; HuMax-CD20, an anti-CD20 currently being developed by Genmab, an anti-CD20 antibody described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362, AME-133 (Applied Molecular Evoluton), hA20 (Immunomedics, Inc.), and HumaLYM (Intracel). A number of antibodies that target members of the family of epidermal growth factor receptors, including EGFR (ErbB-1), Her2/neu (ErbB-2), Her3 (ErbB-3), Her4 (ErbB-4), may benefit from the Fc variants of the present invention. For example the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody that is substantially similar to trastuzumab (Herceptin®, Genentech) (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,171), a humanized anti-Her2/neu antibody approved to treat breast cancer; pertuzumab (rhuMab-2C4, Omnitarg™), currently being developed by Genentech; an anti-Her2 antibody described in U.S. Pat.

to their precise composition. The Fc variants of the present invention may be incorporated into the aforementioned clinical candidates and products, or into antibodies and Fc fusions that are substantially similar to them. The Fc variants of the present invention may be incorporated into versions of the aforementioned clinical candidates and products that are humanized, affinity matured, engineered, or modified in some other way. Furthermore, the entire polypeptide of the aforementioned clinical products and candidates need not be used to construct a new antibody or Fc fusion that incorporates the Fc variants of the present invention; for example only the variable region of a clinical product or candidate antibody, a substantially similar variable region, or a humanized, affinity matured, engineered, or modified version of the variable region may be used. In another embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody or Fc fusion that binds to the same epitope, antigen, ligand, or receptor as one of the aforementioned clinical products and candidates.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may find use in a wide range of antibody and Fc fusion products. In one embodiment the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is a therapeutic, a diagnostic, or a research reagent, preferably a therapeutic. Alternatively, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be used for agricultural or industrial uses. In an alternate embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention compose a library that may be screened experimentally. This library may be a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, or may be a physical composition of nucleic acids or polypeptides that encode the library sequences. The Fc variant may find use in an antibody composition that is monoclonal or polyclonal. In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are used to kill target cells that bear the target antigen, for example cancer cells. In an alternate embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are used to block, antagonize, or agonize the target antigen, for example for antagonizing a cytokine or cytokine receptor. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are used to block, antagonize, or agonize the target antigen and kill the target cells that bear the target antigen.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be used for various therapeutic purposes. In a preferred embodiment, the Fc variant proteins are administered to a patient to treat an antibody-related disorder. A “patient” for the purposes of the present invention includes both humans and other animals, preferably mammals and most preferably humans. Thus the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention have both human therapy and veterinary applications. In the preferred embodiment the patient is a mammal, and in the most preferred embodiment the patient is human. The term “treatment” in the present invention is meant to include therapeutic treatment, as well as prophylactic, or suppressive measures for a disease or disorder. Thus, for example, successful administration of an antibody or Fc fusion prior to onset of the disease results in treatment of the disease. As another example, successful administration of an optimized antibody or Fc fusion after clinical manifestation of the disease to combat the symptoms of the disease comprises treatment of the disease. “Treatment” also encompasses administration of an optimized antibody or Fc fusion protein after the appearance of the disease in order to eradicate the disease. Successful administration of an agent after onset and after clinical symptoms have developed, with possible abatement of clinical symptoms and perhaps amelioration of the disease, comprises treatment of the disease. Those “in need of treatment” include mammals already having the disease or disorder, as well as those prone to having the disease or disorder, including those in which the disease or disorder is to be prevented. By “antibody related disorder” or “antibody responsive disorder” or “condition” or “disease” herein are meant a disorder that may be ameliorated by the administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention. Antibody related disorders include but are not limited to autoimmune diseases, immunological diseases, infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, neurological diseases, and oncological and neoplastic diseases including cancer. By “cancer” and “cancerous” herein refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth.

Within the scope of the present invention this is meant to include diseases and disorders characterized by aberrant proteins, due for example to alterations in the amount of a protein present, the presence of a mutant protein, or both. An overabundance may be due to any cause, including but not limited to overexpression at the molecular level, prolonged or accumulated appearance at the site of action, or increased activity of a protein relative to normal. Included within this definition are diseases and disorders characterized by a reduction of a protein. This reduction may be due to any cause, including but not limited to reduced expression at the molecular level, shortened or reduced appearance at the site of action, mutant forms of a protein, or decreased activity of a protein relative to normal. Such an overabundance or reduction of a protein can be measured relative to normal expression, appearance, or activity of a protein, and said measurement may play an important role in the development and/or clinical testing of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is the only therapeutically active agent administered to a patient. Alternatively, the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is administered in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents, including but not limited to cytotoxic agents, chemotherapeutic agents, cytokines, growth inhibitory agents, anti-hormonal agents, kinase inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, cardioprotectants, or other therapeutic agents. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be administered concomitantly with one or more other therapeutic regimens. For example, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be administered to the patient along with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In one embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be administered in conjunction with one or more antibodies or Fc fusions, which may or may not comprise an Fc variant of the present invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are administered with a chemotherapeutic agent.

By “prodrug” as used herein is meant a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance that is less cytotoxic to tumor cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically activated or converted into the more active parent form. See, for example Wilman, 1986, Biochemical Society Transactions, 615th Meeting Belfast, 14:375-382; and Stella et al., “Prodrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery,” Directed Drug Delivery, Borchardt et al., (ed.): 247-267, Humana Press, 1985, The prodrugs that may find use with the present invention include but are not limited to phosphate-containing prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing prodrugs, sulfate-containing prodrugs, peptide-containing prodrugs, D-amino acid-modified prodrugs, glycosylated prodrugs, beta-lactam-containing prodrugs, optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide-containing prodrugs, 5-fluorocytosine and other 5-fluorouridine prodrugs which can be converted into the more active cytotoxic free drug. Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use with the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention include but are not limited to any of the aforementioned chemotherapeutic agents.\n\n\nThe antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be combined with other therapeutic regimens. For example, in one embodiment, the patient to be treated with the antibody or Fc fusion may also receive radiation therapy. Radiation therapy can be administered according to protocols commonly employed in the art and known to the skilled artisan. Such therapy includes but is not limited to cesium, iridium, iodine, or cobalt radiation. The radiation therapy may be whole body irradiation, or may be directed locally to a specific site or tissue in or on the body, such as the lung, bladder, or prostate. Typically, radiation therapy is administered in pulses over a period of time from about 1 to 2 weeks. The radiation therapy may, however, be administered over longer periods of time. For instance, radiation therapy may be administered to patients having head and neck cancer for about 6 to about 7 weeks. Optionally, the radiation therapy may be administered as a single dose or as multiple, sequential doses. The skilled medical practitioner can determine empirically the appropriate dose or doses of radiation therapy useful herein. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention and one or more other anti-cancer therapies are employed to treat cancer cells ex vivo. It is contemplated that such ex vivo treatment may be useful in bone marrow transplantation and particularly, autologous bone marrow transplantation. For instance, treatment of cells or tissue(s) containing cancer cells with antibody or Fc fusion and one or more other anti-cancer therapies, such as described above, can be employed to deplete or substantially deplete the cancer cells prior to transplantation in a recipient patient. It is of course contemplated that the antibodies and Fc fusions of the invention can be employed in combination with still other therapeutic techniques such as surgery.\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are administered with a cytokine.

As used herein, the term cytokine includes proteins from natural sources or from recombinant cell culture, and biologically active equivalents of the native sequence cytokines.\n\n\nA variety of other therapeutic agents may find use for administration with the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention. In one embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is administered with an anti-angiogenic agent. By “anti-angiogenic agent” as used herein is meant a compound that blocks, or interferes to some degree, the development of blood vessels. The anti-angiogenic factor may, for instance, be a small molecule or a protein, for example an antibody, Fc fusion, or cytokine, that binds to a growth factor or growth factor receptor involved in promoting angiogenesis. The preferred anti-angiogenic factor herein is an antibody that binds to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is administered with a therapeutic agent that induces or enhances adaptive immune response, for example an antibody that targets CTLA-4. In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is administered with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. By “tyrosine kinase inhibitor” as used herein is meant a molecule that inhibits to some extent tyrosine kinase activity of a tyrosine kinase.

No. 5,804,396; PCT WO 99/09016 (American Cyanimid); PCT WO 98/43960 (American Cyanamid); PCT WO 97/38983 (Warner-Lambert); PCT WO 99/06378 (Warner-Lambert); PCT WO 99/06396 (Warner-Lambert); PCT WO 96/30347 (Pfizer, Inc); PCT WO 96/33978 (AstraZeneca); PCT WO96/3397 (AstraZeneca); PCT WO 96/33980 (AstraZeneca), gefitinib (IRESSA™, ZD1839, AstraZeneca), and OSI-774 (Tarceva™, OSI Pharmaceuticals/Genentech).\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is conjugated or operably linked to another therapeutic compound. The therapeutic compound may be a cytotoxic agent, a chemotherapeutic agent, a toxin, a radioisotope, a cytokine, or other therapeutically active agent. Conjugates of the antibody or Fc fusion and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glulareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntolyene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., 1971, Science 238:1098. Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetc acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See PCT WO 94/11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker, peptidase-sensitive linker, dimethyl linker or disulfidecontaining linker (Chari et al., 1992, Cancer Research 52: 127-131) may be used. Alternatively, the antibody or Fc fusion is operably linked to the therapeutic agent, e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis.\n\n\nChemotherapeutic agents that may be useful for conjugation to the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention have been described above. In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated or operably linked to a toxin, including but not limited to small molecule toxins and enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and/or variants thereof. Small molecule toxins include but are not limited to calicheamicin, maytansine (U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020), trichothene, and CC1065. In one embodiment of the invention, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated to one or more maytansine molecules (e.g. about 1 to about 10 maytansine molecules per antibody molecule). Maytansine may, for example, be converted to May-SS-Me which may be reduced to May-SH3 and reacted with modified antibody or Fc fusion (Chari et al., 1992, \nCancer Research \n52: 127-131) to generate a maytansinoid-antibody or maytansinoid-Fc fusion conjugate. Another conjugate of interest comprises an antibody or Fc fusion conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. Structural analogues of calicheamicin that may be used include but are not limited to γ\n1\n \n1\n, α\n2\n \n1\n, α\n3\n, N-acetyl-γ\n1\n \n1\n, PSAG, and Θ\n1\n \n1\n, (Hinman et al, 1993, \nCancer Research \n53:3336-3342; Lode et al., 1998, \nCancer Research \n58:2925-2928) (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,714,586; 5,712,374; 5,264,586; 5,773,001). \nDolastatin\n 10 analogs such as auristatin E (AE) and monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) may find use as conjugates for the Fc variants of the present invention (Doronina et al., 2003, \nNat Biotechnol \n21 (7):778-84; Francisco et al., 2003 \nBlood \n102(4):1456-65). Useful enyzmatically active toxins include but are not limited to diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, \nPhytolaca americana \nproteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin and the tricothecenes. See, for example, PCT WO 93/21232. The present invention further contemplates a conjugate or fusion formed between an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention and a compound with nucleolytic activity, for example a ribonuclease or DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease (DNase).\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be conjugated or operably linked to a radioisotope to form a radioconjugate. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugate antibodies and Fc fusions. Examples include, but are not limited to, At\n211\n, I\n131\n, I\n125\n, Y\n90\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188\n, Sm\n153\n, Bi\n212\n, P\n32\n, and radioactive isotopes of Lu.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be conjugated to a “receptor” (such streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pretargeting wherein the antibody-receptor or Fc fusion-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a “ligand” (e.g. avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g. a radionucleotide). In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated or operably linked to an enzyme in order to employ Antibody Dependent Enzyme Mediated Prodrug Therapy (ADEPT). ADEPT may be used by conjugating or operably linking the antibody or Fc fusion to a prodrug-activating enzyme that converts a prodrug (e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent, see PCT WO 81/01145) to an active anti-cancer drug. See, for example, PCT WO 88/07378 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278. The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active, cytotoxic form. Enzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; cytosine deaminase useful for converting non-toxic 5-fluorocytosine into the anti-cancer drug, 5-fluorouracil; proteases, such as serrata protease, thermolysin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidases and cathepsins (such as cathepsins B and L), that are useful for converting peptide-containing prodrugs into free drugs; D-alanylcarboxypeptidases, useful for converting prodrugs that contain D-amino acid substituents; carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes such as .beta.-galactosidase and neuramimidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs; beta-lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with .alpha.-lactams into free drugs; and penicillin amidases, such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase, useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups, respectively, into free drugs. Alternatively, antibodies with enzymatic activity, also known in the art as “abzymes”, can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs (see, for example, Massey, 1987, \nNature \n328: 457-458). Antibody-abzyme and Fc fusion-abzyme conjugates can be prepared for delivery of the abzyme to a tumor cell population. Other modifications of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are contemplated herein. For example, the antibody or Fc fusion may be linked to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyoxyalkylenes, or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions are contemplated wherein an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention and one or more therapeutically active agents are formulated. Formulations of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are prepared for storage by mixing said antibody or Fc fusion having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed., 1980), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, acetate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl orbenzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins: chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; sweeteners and other flavoring agents; fillers such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, corn and other starches; binding agents; additives; coloring agents; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG). In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition that comprises the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is in a water-soluble form, such as being present as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which is meant to include both acid and base addition salts. “Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt” refers to those salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free bases and that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. “Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts” include those derived from inorganic bases such as sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum salts and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, and ethanolamine. The formulations to be used for in vivo administration are preferrably sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes or other methods.\n\n\nThe antibodies and Fc fusions disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle comprising various types of lipids, phospholipids and/or surfactant that is useful for delivery of a therapeutic agent to a mammal. Liposomes containing the antibody or Fc fusion are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein et al., 1985, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA, \n82:3688; Hwang et al., 1980, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA, \n77:4030; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045; 4,544,545; and PCT WO 97/38731. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. A chemotherapeutic agent or other therapeutically active agent is optionally contained within the liposome (Gabizon et al., 1989, \nJ National Cancer Inst \n81:1484).\n\n\nThe antibodies, Fc fusions, and other therapeutically active agents may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared by methods including but not limited to coacervation techniques, interfacial polymerization (for example using hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules, or poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules), colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules), and macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed., 1980. Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymer, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (which are injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid, and ProLease® (commercially available from Alkermes), which is a microsphere-based delivery system composed of the desired bioactive molecule incorporated into a matrix of poly-DL-lactide-co-glycolide (PLG).\n\n\nThe concentration of the therapeutically active antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention in the formulation may vary from about 0.1 to 100 weight %. In a preferred embodiment, the concentration of the antibody or Fc fusion is in the range of 0.003 to 1.0 molar. In order to treat a patient, a therapeutically effective dose of the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be administered. By “therapeutically effective dose” herein is meant a dose that produces the effects for which it is administered. The exact dose will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques. Dosages may range from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg of body weight or greater, for example 0.1, 1, 10, or 50 mg/kg of body weight, with 1 to 10 mg/kg being preferred. As is known in the art, adjustments for antibody or Fc fusion degradation, systemic versus localized delivery, and rate of new protease synthesis, as well as the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, drug interaction and the severity of the condition may be necessary, and will be ascertainable with routine experimentation by those skilled in the art.\n\n\nAdministration of the pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention, preferably in the form of a sterile aqueous solution, may be done in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, orally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intranasally, intraotically, transdermally, topically (e.g., gels, salves, lotions, creams, etc.), intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intrapulmonary (e.g., AERx® inhalable technology commercially available from Aradigm, or Inhance™ pulmonary delivery system commercially available from Inhale Therapeutics), vaginally, parenterally, rectally, or intraocularly. In some instances, for example for the treatment of wounds, Inflammation, etc., the antibody or Fc fusion may be directly applied as a solution or spray. As is known in the art, the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated accordingly depending upon the manner of introduction.\n\n\nEngineering Methods\n\n\nThe present invention provides engineering methods that may be used to generate Fc variants. A principal obstacle that has hindered previous attempts at Fc engineering is that only random attempts at modification have been possible, due in part to the inefficiency of engineering strategies and methods, and to the low-throughput nature of antibody production and screening. The present invention describes engineering methods that overcome these shortcomings. A variety of design strategies, computational screening methods, library generation methods, and experimental production and screening methods are contemplated. These strategies, approaches, techniques, and methods may be applied individually or in various combinations to engineer optimized Fc variants.\n\n\nDesign Strategies\n\n\nThe most efficient approach to generating Fc variants that are optimized for a desired property is to direct the engineering efforts toward that goal. Accordingly, the present invention teaches design strategies that may be used to engineer optimized Fc variants. The use of a design strategy is meant to guide Fc engineering, but is not meant to constrain an Fc variant to a particular optimized property based on the design strategy that was used to engineer it. At first thought this may seem counterintuitive; however its validity is derived from the enormous complexity of subtle interactions that determine the structure, stability, solubility, and function of proteins and protein-protein complexes. Although efforts can be made to predict which protein positions, residues, interactions, etc. are important for a design goal, often times critical ones are not predictable. Effects on protein structure, stability, solubility, and function, whether favorable or unfavorable, are often unforeseen. Yet there are innumerable amino acid modifications that are detrimental or deleterious to proteins. Thus often times the best approach to engineering comes from generation of protein variants that are focused generally towards a design goal but do not cause detrimental effects. In this way, a principal objective of a design strategy may be the generation of quality diversity. At a simplistic level this can be thought of as stacking the odds in one's favor. As an example, perturbation of the Fc carbohydrate or a particular domain-domain angle, as described below, are valid design strategies for generating optimized Fc variants, despite the fact that how carbohydrate and domain-domain angles determine the properties of Fc is not well understood. By reducing the number of detrimental amino acid modifications that are screened, i.e. by screening quality diversity, these design strategies become practical. Thus the true value of the design strategies taught in the present invention is their ability to direct engineering efforts towards the generation of valuable Fc variants. The specific value of any one resulting variant is determined after experimentation.\n\n\nOne design strategy for engineering Fc variants is provided in which interaction of Fc with some Fc ligand is altered by engineering amino acid modifications at the interface between Fc and said Fc ligand. Fc ligands herein may include but are not limited to FcγRs, C1q, FcRn, protein A or G, and the like. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at Fc positions that impact the binding interface, variants can be engineered that sample new interface conformations, some of which may improve binding to the Fc ligand, some of which may reduce Fc ligand binding, and some of which may have other favorable properties. Such new interface conformations could be the result of, for example, direct interaction with Fc ligand residues that form the interface, or indirect effects caused by the amino acid modifications such as perturbation of side chain or backbone conformations. Variable positions may be chosen as any positions that are believed to play an important role in determining the conformation of the interface. For example, variable positions may be chosen as the set of residues that are within a certain distance, for example 5 Angstroms (Å), preferrably between 1 and 10 Å, of any residue that makes direct contact with the Fc ligand.\n\n\nAn additional design strategy for generating Fc variants is provided in which the conformation of the Fc carbohydrate at N297 is optimized. Optimization as used in this context is meant to includes conformational and compositional changes in the N297 carbohydrate that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an FcγR. Such a strategy is supported by the observation that the carbohydrate structure and conformation dramatically affect Fc/FcγR and Fc/C1q binding (Umaña et al., 1999, \nNat Biotechnol \n17:176-180; Davies et al., 2001, \nBiotechnol Bioeng \n74:288-294; Mimura et al., 2001, \nJ Biol Chem \n276:45539-45547; Radaev et al., 2001, \nJ Biol Chem \n276:16478-16483; Shields et al., 2002, \nJ Biol Chem \n277:26733-26740; Shinkawa et al., 2003, \nJ Biol Chem \n278:3466-3473). However the carbohydrate makes no specific contacts with FcγRs. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at positions that interact with carbohydrate, a quality diversity of variants can be engineered that sample new carbohydrate conformations, some of which may improve and some of which may reduce binding to one or more Fc ligands. While the majority of mutations near the Fc/carbohydrate interface appear to alter carbohydrate conformation, some mutations have been shown to alter the glycosylation composition (Lund et al., 1996, \nJ Immunol \n157:4963-4969; Jefferis et al., 2002, \nImmunol Lett \n82:57-65).\n\n\nAnother design strategy for generating Fc variants is provided in which the angle between the Cγ2 and Cγ3 domains is optimized Optimization as used in this context is meant to describe conformational changes in the Cγ2-Cγ3 domain angle that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an FcγR. This angle is an important determinant of Fc/FcγR affinity (Radaev et al., 2001, \nJ Biol Chem \n276:16478-16483), and a number of mutations distal to the Fc/FcγR interface affect binding potentially by modulating it (Shields et al., 2001, \nJ Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604). By exploring energetically favorable substitutions positions that appear to play a key role in determining the Cγ2-Cγ3 angle and the flexibility of the domains relative to one another, a quality diversity of variants can be designed that sample new angles and levels of flexibility, some of which may be optimized for a desired Fc property.\n\n\nAnother design strategy for generating Fc variants is provided in which Fc is reengineered to eliminate the structural and functional dependence on glycosylation. This design strategy involves the optimization of Fc structure, stability, solubility, and/or Fc function (for example affinity of Fc for one or more Fc ligands) in the absence of the N297 carbohydrate. In one approach, positions that are exposed to solvent in the absence of glycosylation are engineered such that they are stable, structurally consistent with Fc structure, and have no tendency to aggregate. The Cγ2 is the only unpaired Ig domain in the antibody (see \nFIG. 1\n). Thus the N297 carbohydrate covers up the exposed hydrophobic patch that would normally be the interface for a protein-protein interaction with another Ig domain, maintaining the stability and structural integrity of Fc and keeping the Cγ2 domains from aggregating across the central axis. Approaches for optimizing aglycosylated Fc may involve but are not limited to designing amino acid modifications that enhance aglycoslated Fc stability and/or solubility by incorporating polar and/or charged residues that face inward towards the Cγ2-Cγ2 dimer axis, and by designing amino acid modifications that directly enhance the aglycosylated Fc/FcγR interface or the interface of aglycosylated Fc with some other Fc ligand.\n\n\nAn additional design strategy for engineering Fc variants is provided in which the conformation of the Cγ2 domain is optimized Optimization as used in this context is meant to describe conformational changes in the Cγ2 domain angle that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an FcγR. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at Cγ2 positions that impact the Cγ2 conformation, a quality diversity of variants can be engineered that sample new Cγ2 conformations, some of which may achieve the design goal. Such new Cγ2 conformations could be the result of, for example, alternate backbone conformations that are sampled by the variant. Variable positions may be chosen as any positions that are believed to play an important role in determining Cγ2 structure, stability, solubility, flexibility, function, and the like. For example, Cγ2 hydrophobic core residues, that is Cγ2 residues that are partially or fully sequestered from solvent, may be reengineered. Alternatively, noncore residues may be considered, or residues that are deemed important for determining backbone structure, stability, or flexibility.\n\n\nAn additional design strategy for Fc optimization is provided in which binding to an FcγR, complement, or some other Fc ligand is altered by modifications that modulate the electrostatic interaction between Fc and said Fc ligand. Such modifications may be thought of as optimization of the global electrostatic character of Fc, and include replacement of neutral amino acids with a charged amino acid, replacement of a charged amino acid with a neutral amino acid, or replacement of a charged amino acid with an amino acid of opposite charge (i.e. charge reversal). Such modifications may be used to effect changes in binding affinity between an Fc and one or more Fc ligands, for example FcγRs. In a preferred embodiment, positions at which electrostatic substitutions might affect binding are selected using one of a variety of well known methods for calculation of electrostatic potentials. In the simplest embodiment, Coulomb's law is used to generate electrostatic potentials as a function of the position in the protein. Additional embodiments include the use of Debye-Huckel scaling to account for ionic strength effects, and more sophisticated embodiments such as Poisson-Boltzmann calculations. Such electrostatic calculations may highlight positions and suggest specific amino acid modifications to achieve the design goal. In some cases, these substitutions may be anticipated to variably affect binding to different Fc ligands, for example to enhance binding to activating FcγRs while decreasing binding affinity to inhibitory FcγRs.\n\n\nComputational Screening\n\n\nA principal obstacle to obtaining valuable Fc variants is the difficulty in predicting what amino acid modifications, out of the enormous number of possibilities, will achieve the desired goals. Indeed one of the principle reasons that previous attempts at Fc engineering have failed to produce Fc variants of significant clinical value is that approaches to Fc engineering have thus far involved hit-or-miss approaches. The present invention provides computational screening methods that enable quantitative and systematic engineering of Fc variants. These methods typically use atomic level scoring functions, side chain rotamer sampling, and advanced optimization methods to accurately capture the relationships between protein sequence, structure, and function. Computational screening enables exploration of the entire sequence space of possibilities at target positions by filtering the enormous diversity which results. Variant libraries that are screened computationally are effectively enriched for stable, properly folded, and functional sequences, allowing active optimization of Fc for a desired goal. Because of the overlapping sequence constraints on protein structure, stability, solubility, and function, a large number of the candidates in a library occupy “wasted” sequence space. For example, a large fraction of sequence space encodes unfolded, misfolded, incompletely folded, partially folded, or aggregated proteins. This is particularly relevant for Fc engineering because Ig domains are small beta sheet structures, the engineering of which has proven extremely demanding (Quinn et al., 1994, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n91:8747-8751; Richardson et al., 2002, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n99:2754-2759). Even seemingly harmless substitutions on the surface of a beta sheet can cause severe packing conflicts, dramatically disrupting folding equilibrium (Smith et al., 1995, \nScience \n270:980-982); incidentally, alanine is one of the worst beta sheet formers (Minor et al., 1994, \nNature \n371:264-267). The determinants of beta sheet stability and specificity are a delicate balance between an extremely large number of subtle interactions. Computational screening enables the generation of libraries that are composed primarily of productive sequence space, and as a result increases the chances of identifying proteins that are optimized for the design goal. In effect, computational screening yields an increased hit-rate, thereby decreasing the number of variants that must be screened experimentally. An additional obstacle to Fc engineering is the need for active design of correlated or coupled mutations. For example, the greatest Fc/FcγR affinity enhancement observed thus far is S298A/E333A/K334A, obtained by combining three better binders obtained separately in an alanine scan (Shields et al., 2001, \nJ Biol Chem \n276:6591-6604). Computational screening is capable of generating such a three-fold variant in one experiment instead of three separate ones, and furthermore is able to test the functionality of all 20 amino acids at those positions instead of just alanine. Computational screening deals with such complexity by reducing the combinatorial problem to an experimentally tractable size.\n\n\nComputational screening, viewed broadly, has four steps: 1) selection and preparation of the protein template structure or structures, 2) selection of variable positions, amino acids to be considered at those positions, and/or selection of rotamers to model considered amino acids, 3) energy calculation, and 4) combinatorial optimization. In more detail, the process of computational screening can be described as follows. A three-dimensional structure of a protein is used as the starting point. The positions to be optimized are identified, which may be the entire protein sequence or subset(s) thereof. Amino acids that will be considered at each position are selected. In a preferred embodiment, each considered amino acid may be represented by a discrete set of allowed conformations, called rotamers. Interaction energies are calculated between each considered amino acid and each other considered amino acid, and the rest of the protein, including the protein backbone and invariable residues. In a preferred embodiment, interaction energies are calculated between each considered amino acid side chain rotamer and each other considered amino acid side chain rotamer and the rest of the protein, including the protein backbone and invariable residues. One or more combinatorial search algorithms are then used to identify the lowest energy sequence and/or low energy sequences.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the computational screening method used is substantially similar to Protein Design Automation® (PDA®) technology, as is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,188,965; 6,269,312; 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790; 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. In another preferred embodiment, a computational screening method substantially similar to Sequence Prediction Algorithm™ (SPA™) technology is used, as is described in (Raha et al., 2000, \nProtein Sci \n9:1106-1119), U.S. Ser. Nos. 091877,695, and 10/071,859. In another preferred embodiment, the computational screening methods described in U.S. Ser. No. 10/339,788, filed on Mar. 3, 2003, entitled “ANTIBODY OPTIMIZATION”, are used. In some embodiments, combinations of different computational screening methods are used, including combinations of PDA® technology and SPA™ technology, as well as combinations of these computational methods in combination with other design tools. Similarly, these computational methods can be used simultaneously or sequentially, in any order.\n\n\nA template structure is used as input into the computational screening calculations. By “template structure” herein is meant the structural coordinates of part or all of a protein to be optimized. The template structure may be any protein for which a three dimensional structure (that is, three dimensional coordinates for a set of the protein's atoms) is known or may be calculated, estimated, modeled, generated, or determined. The three dimensional structures of proteins may be determined using methods including but not limited to X-ray crystallographic techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, de novo modeling, and homology modeling. If optimization is desired for a protein for which the structure has not been solved experimentally, a suitable structural model may be generated that may serve as the template for computational screening calculations. Methods for generating homology models of proteins are known in the art, and these methods find use in the present invention. See for example, Luo, et al. 2002, \nProtein Sci\n1: 1218-1226, Lehmann & Wyss, 2001, \nCurr Opin Biotechnol \n12(4):371-5.; Lehmann et al., 2000, Biochim Biophys Acta 1543(2):408-415; Rath & Davidson, 2000, \nProtein Sci, \n9(12):2457-69; Lehmann et al., 2000, \nProtein Eng \n13(1):49-57; Desjarlais & Berg, 1993, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n90(6):2256-60; Desjarlais & Berg, 1992, \nProteins \n12(2):101-4; Henikoff & Henikoff, 2000, \nAdv Protein Chem \n54:73-97; Henikoff & Henikoff, 1994, \nJ Mol Biol \n243(4):574-8; Morea et al., 2000, \nMethods \n20:267-269. Protein/protein complexes may also be obtained using docking methods. Suitable protein structures that may serve as template structures include, but are not limited to, all of those found in the Protein Data Base compiled and serviced by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB, formerly the Brookhaven National Lab).\n\n\nThe template structure may be of a protein that occurs naturally or is engineered. The template structure may be of a protein that is substantially encoded by a protein from any organism, with human, mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey preferred. The template structure may comprise any of a number of protein structural forms. In a preferred embodiment the template structure comprises an Fc region or a domain or fragment of Fc. In an alternately preferred embodiment the template structure comprises Fc or a domain or fragment of Fc bound to one or more Fc ligands, with an Fc/FcγR complex being preferred. The Fc in the template structure may be glycosylated or unglycosylated. The template structure may comprise more than one protein chain. The template structure may additionally contain nonprotein components, including but not limited to small molecules, substrates, cofactors, metals, water molecules, prosthetic groups, polymers and carbohydrates. In a preferred embodiment, the template structure is a plurality or set of template proteins, for example an ensemble of structures such as those obtained from NMR. Alternatively, the set of template structures is generated from a set of related proteins or structures, or artificially created ensembles. The composition and source of the template structure depends on the engineering goal. For example, for enhancement of human Fc/FcγR affinity, a human Fc/FcγR complex structure or derivative thereof may be used as the template structure. Alternatively, the uncomplexed Fc structure may be used as the template structure. If the goal is to enhance affinity of a human Fc for a mouse FcγR, the template structure may be a structure or model of a human Fc bound to a mouse FcγR.\n\n\nThe template structure may be modified or altered prior to design calculations. A variety of methods for template structure preparation are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,188,965; 6,269,312; 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790; 09/877,695; 10/071,859, 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. For example, in a preferred embodiment, explicit hydrogens may be added if not included within the structure. In an alternate embodiment, energy minimization of the structure is run to relax strain, including strain due to van der Waals clashes, unfavorable bond angles, and unfavorable bond lengths. Alternatively, the template structure is altered using other methods, such as manually, including directed or random perturbations. It is also possible to modify the template structure during later steps of computational screening, including during the energy calculation and combinatorial optimization steps. In an alternate embodiment, the template structure is not modified before or during computational screening calculations.\n\n\nOnce a template structure has been obtained, variable positions are chosen. By “variable position” herein is meant a position at which the amino acid identity is allowed to be altered in a computational screening calculation. As is known in the art, allowing amino acid modifications to be considered only at certain variable positions reduces the complexity of a calculation and enables computational screening to be more directly tailored for the design goal. One or more residues may be variable positions in computational screening calculations. Positions that are chosen as variable positions may be those that contribute to or are hypothesized to contribute to the protein property to be optimized, for example Fc affinity for an FcγR, Fc stability, Fc solubility, and so forth. Residues at variable positions may contribute favorably or unfavorably to a specific protein property. For example, a residue at an Fc/FcγR interface may be involved in mediating binding, and thus this position may be varied in design calculations aimed at improving Fc/FcγR affinity. As another example, a residue that has an exposed hydrophobic side chain may be responsible for causing unfavorable aggregation, and thus this position may be varied in design calculations aimed at improving solubility. Variable positions may be those positions that are directly involved in interactions that are determinants of a particular protein property. For example, the FcγR binding site of Fc may be defined to include all residues that contact that particular FγcR. By “contact” herein is meant some chemical interaction between at least one atom of an Fc residue with at least one atom of the bound FcγR, with chemical interaction including, but not limited to van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bond interactions, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions. In an alternative embodiment, variable positions may include those positions that are indirectly involved in a protein property, i.e. such positions may be proximal to residues that are known to or hypothesized to contribute to an Fc property. For example, the FcγR binding site of an Fc may be defined to include all Fc residues within a certain distance, for example 4-10 Å, of any Fc residue that is in van der Waals contact with the FcγR. Thus variable positions in this case may be chosen not only as residues that directly contact the FcγR, but also those that contact residues that contact the FcγR and thus influence binding indirectly. The specific positions chosen are dependent on the design strategy being employed.\n\n\nOne or more positions in the template structure that are not variable may be floated. By “floated position” herein is meant a position at which the amino acid conformation but not the amino acid identity is allowed to vary in a computational screening calculation. In one embodiment, the floated position may have the parent amino acid identity. For example, floated positions may be positions that are within a small distance, for example 5 Å, of a variable position residue. In an alternate embodiment, a floated position may have a non-parent amino acid identity. Such an embodiment may find use in the present invention, for example, when the goal is to evaluate the energetic or structural outcome of a specific mutation.\n\n\nPositions that are not variable or floated are fixed. By “fixed position” herein is meant a position at which the amino acid identity and the conformation are held constant in a computational screening calculation. Positions that may be fixed include residues that are not known to be or hypothesized to be involved in the property to be optimized. In this case the assumption is that there is little or nothing to be gained by varying these positions. Positions that are fixed may also include positions whose residues are known or hypothesized to be important for maintaining proper folding, structure, stability, solubility, and/or biological function. For example, positions may be fixed for residues that interact with a particular Fc ligand or residues that encode a glycosylation site in order to ensure that binding to the Fc ligand and proper glycosylation respectively are not perturbed. Likewise, if stability is being optimized, it may be beneficial to fix positions that directly or indirectly interact with an Fc ligand, for example an FcγR, so that binding is not perturbed. Fixed positions may also include structurally important residues such as cysteines participating in disulfide bridges, residues critical for determining backbone conformation such as proline or glycine, critical hydrogen bonding residues, and residues that form favorable packing interactions.\n\n\nThe next step in computational screening is to select a set of possible amino acid identities that will be considered at each particular variable position. This set of possible amino acids is herein referred to as “considered amino acids” at a variable position. “Amino acids” as used herein refers to the set of natural 20 amino acids and any nonnatural or synthetic analogues. In one embodiment, all 20 natural amino acids are considered. Alternatively, a subset of amino acids, or even only one amino acid is considered at a given variable position. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, there is a computational benefit to considering only certain amino acid identities at variable positions, as it decreases the combinatorial complexity of the search. Furthermore, considering only certain amino acids at variable positions may be used to tailor calculations toward specific design strategies. For example, for solubility optimization of aglycosylated Fc, it may be beneficial to allow only polar amino acids to be considered at nonpolar Fc residues that are exposed to solvent in the absence of carbohydrate. Nonnatural amino acids, including synthetic amino acids and analogues of natural amino acids, may also be considered amino acids. For example see Chin et al., 2003, \nScience, \n301(5635):964-7; and Chin et al., 2003, \nChem Biol. \n10(6):511-9.\n\n\nA wide variety of methods may be used, alone or in combination, to select which amino acids will be considered at each position. For example, the set of considered amino acids at a given variable position may be chosen based on the degree of exposure to solvent. Hydrophobic or nonpolar amino acids typically reside in the interior or core of a protein, which are inaccessible or nearly inaccessible to solvent. Thus at variable core positions it may be beneficial to consider only or mostly nonpolar amino acids such as alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine. Hydrophilic or polar amino acids typically reside on the exterior or surface of proteins, which have a significant degree of solvent accessibility. Thus at variable surface positions it may be beneficial to consider only or mostly polar amino acids such as alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine and histidine. Some positions are partly exposed and partly buried, and are not clearly protein core or surface positions, in a sense serving as boundary residues between core and surface residues. Thus at such variable boundary positions it may be beneficial to consider both nonpolar and polar amino acids such as alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine histidine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine. Determination of the degree of solvent exposure at variable positions may be by subjective evaluation or visual inspection of the template structure by one skilled in the art of protein structural biology, or by using a variety of algorithms that are known in the art. Selection of amino acid types to be considered at variable positions may be aided or determined wholly by computational methods, such as calculation of solvent accessible surface area, or using algorithms that assess the orientation of the Cα-Cα vectors relative to a solvent accessible surface, as outlined in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,188,965; 6,269,312; 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790; 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. In one embodiment, each variable position may be classified explicitly as a core, surface, or boundary position or a classification substantially similar to core, surface, or boundary.\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, selection of the set of amino acids allowed at variable positions may be hypothesis-driven. Hypotheses for which amino acid types should be considered at variable positions may be derived by a subjective evaluation or visual inspection of the template structure by one skilled in the art of protein structural biology. For example, if it is suspected that a hydrogen bonding interaction may be favorable at a variable position, polar residues that have the capacity to form hydrogen bonds may be considered, even if the position is in the core. Likewise, if it is suspected that a hydrophobic packing interaction may be favorable at a variable position, nonpolar residues that have the capacity to form favorable packing interactions may be considered, even if the position is on the surface. Other examples of hypothesis-driven approaches may involve issues of backbone flexibility or protein fold. As is known in the art, certain residues, for example proline, glycine, and cysteine, play important roles in protein structure and stability. Glycine enables greater backbone flexibility than all other amino acids, proline constrains the backbone more than all other amino acids, and cysteines may form disulfide bonds. It may therefore be beneficial to include one or more of these amino acid types to achieve a desired design goal. Alternatively, it may be beneficial to exclude one or more of these amino acid types from the list of considered amino acids.\n\n\nIn an alternate embodiment, subsets of amino acids may be chosen to maximize coverage. In this case, additional amino acids with properties similar to that in the template structure may be considered at variable positions. For example, if the residue at a variable position in the template structure is a large hydrophobic residue, additional large hydrophobic amino acids may be considered at that position. Alternatively, subsets of amino acids may be chosen to maximize diversity. In this case, amino acids with properties dissimilar to those in the template structure may be considered at variable positions. For example, if the residue at a variable position in the template is a large hydrophobic residue, amino acids that are small, polar, etc. may be considered.\n\n\nAs is known in the art, some computational screening methods require only the identity of considered amino acids to be determined during design calculations. That is, no information is required concerning the conformations or possible conformations of the amino acid side chains. Other preferred methods utilize a set of discrete side chain conformations, called rotamers, which are considered for each amino acid. Thus, a set of rotamers may be considered at each variable and floated position. Rotamers may be obtained from published rotamer libraries (see for example, Lovel et al., 2000, \nProteins: Structure Function and Genetics \n40:389-408; Dunbrack & Cohen, 1997, \nProtein Science \n6:1661-1681; DeMaeyer ot al., 1997, \nFolding and Design \n2:53-66; Tuffery et al., 1991, \nJ Biomol Struct Dyn \n8:1267-1289, Ponder & Richards, 1987, \nJ Mol Blot \n193:775-791). As is known in the art, rotamer libraries may be backbone-independent or backbone-dependent. Rotamers may also be obtained from molecular mechanics or ab initio calculations, and using other methods. In a preferred embodiment, a flexible rotamer model is used (see Mendes et al., 1999, \nProteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics \n37:530-543). Similarly, artificially generated rotamers may be used, or augment the set chosen for each amino acid and/or variable position. In one embodiment, at least one conformation that is not low in energy is included in the list of rotamers. In an alternate embodiment, the rotamer of the variable position residue in the template structure is included in the list of rotamers allowed for that variable position. In an alternate embodiment, only the identity of each amino acid considered at variable positions is provided, and no specific conformational states of each amino acid are used during design calculations. That is, use of rotamers is not essential for computational screening.\n\n\nExperimental information may be used to guide the choice of variable positions and/or the choice of considered amino acids at variable positions. As is known in the art, mutagenesis experiments are often carried out to determine the role of certain residues in protein structure and function, for example, which protein residues play a role in determining stability, or which residues make up the interface of a protein-protein interaction. Data obtained from such experiments are useful in the present invention. For example, variable positions for Fc/FcγR affinity enhancement could involve varying all positions at which mutation has been shown to affect binding. Similarly, the results from such an experiment may be used to guide the choice of allowed amino acid types at variable positions. For example, if certain types of amino acid substitutions are found to be favorable, similar types of those amino acids may be considered. In one embodiment, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that were found to be favorable experimentally may be considered at variable positions. For example, if experimental mutation of a variable position at an Fc/FcγR interface to a large hydrophobic residue was found to be favorable, the user may choose to include additional large hydrophobic amino acids at that position in the computational screen. As is known in the art, display and other selection technologies may be coupled with random mutagenesis to generate a list or lists of amino acid substitutions that are favorable for the selected property. Such a list or lists obtained from such experimental work find use in the present invention. For example, positions that are found to be invariable in such an experiment may be excluded as variable positions in computational screening calculations, whereas positions that are found to be more acceptable to mutation or respond favorably to mutation may be chosen as variable positions. Similarly, the results from such experiments may be used to guide the choice of allowed amino acid types at variable positions. For example, if certain types of amino acids arise more frequently in an experimental selection, similar types of those amino acids may be considered. In one embodiment, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that were found to be favorable experimentally may be considered at variable positions. For example, if selected mutations at a variable position that resides at an Fc/FcγR interface are found to be uncharged polar amino acids, the user may choose to include additional uncharged polar amino acids, or perhaps charged polar amino acids, at that position.\n\n\nSequence information may also be used to guide choice of variable positions and/or the choice of amino acids considered at variable positions. As is known in the art, some proteins share a common structural scaffold and are homologous in sequence. This information may be used to gain insight into particular positions in the protein family. As is known in the art, sequence alignments are often carried out to determine which protein residues are conserved and which are not conserved. That is to say, by comparing and contrasting alignments of protein sequences, the degree of variability at a position may be observed, and the types of amino acids that occur naturally at positions may be observed. Data obtained from such analyses are useful in the present invention. The benefit of using sequence information to choose variable positions and considered amino acids at variable positions are several fold. For choice of variable positions, the primary advantage of using sequence information is that insight may be gained into which positions are more tolerant and which are less tolerant to mutation. Thus sequence information may aid in ensuring that quality diversity, i.e. mutations that are not deleterious to protein structure, stability, etc., is sampled computationally. The same advantage applies to use of sequence information to select amino acid types considered at variable positions. That is, the set of amino acids that occur in a protein sequence alignment may be thought of as being pre-screened by evolution to have a higher chance than random for being compatible with a protein's structure, stability, solubility, function, etc. Thus higher quality diversity is sampled computationally. A second benefit of using sequence information to select amino acid types considered at variable positions is that certain alignments may represent sequences that may be less immunogenic than random sequences. For example, if the amino acids considered at a given variable position are the set of amino acids which occur at that position in an alignment of human protein sequences, those amino acids may be thought of as being pre-screened by nature for generating no or low immune response if the optimized protein is used as a human therapeutic.\n\n\nThe source of the sequences may vary widely, and include one or more of the known databases, including but not limited to the Kabat database (Johnson & Wu, 2001, \nNucleic Acids Res \n29:205-206; Johnson & Wu, 2000, \nNucleic Acids Res \n28:214-218), the IMGT database (IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics information System®; Lefranc et al., 1999, \nNucleic Acids Res \n27:209-212; Ruiz et al., 2000 \nNucleic Acids Re. \n28:219-221; Lefranc et al., 2001, \nNucleic Acids Res\n29:207-209; Lefranc et al., 2003, \nNucleic Acids Res \n31:307-310), and VBASE, SwissProt, GenBank and Entrez, and EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database. Protein sequence information can be obtained, compiled, and/or generated from sequence alignments of naturally occurring proteins from any organism, including but not limited to mammals. Protein sequence information can be obtained from a database that is compiled privately. There are numerous sequence-based alignment programs and methods known in the art, and all of these find use in the present invention for generation of sequence alignments of proteins that comprise Fc and Fc ligands.\n\n\nOnce alignments are made, sequence information can be used to guide choice of variable positions. Such sequence information can relate the variability, natural or otherwise, of a given position. Variability herein should be distinguished from variable position. Variability refers to the degree to which a given position in a sequence alignment shows variation in the types of amino acids that occur there. Variable position, to reiterate, is a position chosen by the user to vary in amino acid identity during a computational screening calculation. Variability may be determined qualitatively by one skilled in the art of bioinformatics. There are also methods known in the art to quantitatively determine variability that may find use in the present invention. The most preferred embodiment measures Information Entropy or Shannon Entropy. Variable positions can be chosen based on sequence information obtained from closely related protein sequences, or sequences that are less closely related.\n\n\nThe use of sequence information to choose variable positions finds broad use in the present invention. For example, if an Fc/FcγR interface position in the template structure is tryptophan, and tryptophan is observed at that position in greater than 90% of the sequences in an alignment, it may be beneficial to leave that position fixed. In contrast, if another interface position is found to have a greater level of variability, for example if five different amino acids are observed at that position with frequencies of approximately 20% each, that position may be chosen as a variable position. In another embodiment, visual inspection of aligned protein sequences may substitute for or aid visual inspection of a protein structure. Sequence information can also be used to guide the choice of amino acids considered at variable positions. Such sequence information can relate to how frequently an amino acid, amino acids, or amino acid types (for example polar or nonpolar, charged or uncharged) occur, naturally or otherwise, at a given position. In one embodiment, the set of amino acids considered at a variable position may comprise the set of amino acids that is observed at that position in the alignment. Thus, the position-specific alignment information is used directly to generate the list of considered amino acids at a variable position in a computational screening calculation. Such a strategy is well known in the art; see for example Lehmann & Wyss, 2001, \nCurr Opin Biotechnol \n12(4):371-5; Lehmann et al., 2000, \nBiochim Biophys Acta \n1543(2):408-415; Rath & Davidson, 2000, \nProtein Sci, \n9(12):2457-69; Lehmann et al., 2000, \nProtein Eng \n13(1):49-57; Desjarlais & Berg, 1993, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n90(6):2256-60; Desjarlais & Berg, 1992, \nProteins \n12(2):101-4; Henikoff & Henikoff, 2000, \nAdv Protein Chem \n54:73-97; Henikoff & Henikoff, 1994, \nJ Mol Biol \n243(4):574-8. In an alternate embodiment, the set of amino acids considered at a variable position or positions may comprise a set of amino acids that is observed most frequently in the alignment. Thus, a certain criteria is applied to determine whether the frequency of an amino acid or amino acid type warrants its inclusion in the set of amino acids that are considered at a variable position. As is known in the art, sequence alignments may be analyzed using statistical methods to calculate the sequence diversity at any position in the alignment and the occurrence frequency or probability of each amino acid at a position. Such data may then be used to determine which amino acids types to consider. In the simplest embodiment, these occurrence frequencies are calculated by counting the number of times an amino acid is observed at an alignment position, then dividing by the total number of sequences in the alignment. In other embodiments, the contribution of each sequence, position or amino acid to the counting procedure is weighted by a variety of possible mechanisms. In a preferred embodiment, the contribution of each aligned sequence to the frequency statistics is weighted according to its diversity weighting relative to other sequences in the alignment. A common strategy for accomplishing this is the sequence weighting system recommended by Henikoff and Henikoff (Henikoff & Henikoff, 2000, \nAdv Protein Chem \n54:73-97; Henikoff & Henikoff, 1994, \nJ Mol Biol \n243:574-8. In a preferred embodiment, the contribution of each sequence to the statistics is dependent on its extent of similarity to the target sequence, i.e. the template structure used, such that sequences with higher similarity to the target sequence are weighted more highly. Examples of similarity measures include, but are not limited to, sequence identity, BLOSUM similarity score, PAM matrix similarity score, and BLAST score. In an alternate embodiment, the contribution of each sequence to the statistics is dependent on its known physical or functional properties. These properties include, but are not limited to, thermal and chemical stability, contribution to activity, and solubility. For example, when optimizing aglycosylated Fc for solubility, those sequences in an alignment that are known to be most soluble (for example see Ewert et al., 2003, \nJ Mol Bio/\n325:531-553), will contribute more heavily to the calculated frequencies.\n\n\nRegardless of what criteria are applied for choosing the set of amino adds in a sequence alignment to be considered at variable positions, use of sequence information to choose considered amino acids finds broad use in the present invention. For example, to optimize Fc solubility by replacing exposed nonpolar surface residues, considered amino acids may be chosen as the set of amino acids, or a subset of those amino acids which meet some criteria, that are observed at that position in an alignment of protein sequences. As another example, one or more amino acids may be added or subtracted subjectively from a list of amino acids derived from a sequence alignment in order to maximize coverage. For example, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that are found in a sequence alignment may be considered at variable positions. For example, if an Fc position that is known to or hypothesized to bind an FcγR is observed to have uncharged polar amino adds in a sequence alignment, the user may choose to include additional uncharged polar amino acids in a computational screening calculation, or perhaps charged polar amino acids, at that position.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, sequence alignment information is combined with energy calculation, as discussed below. For example, pseudo energies can be derived from sequence information to generate a scoring function. The use of a sequence-based scoring function may assist in significantly reducing the complexity of a calculation. However, as is appreciated by those skilled in the art, the use of a sequence-based scoring function alone may be inadequate because sequence information can often indicate misleading correlations between mutations that may in reality be structurally conflicting. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, a structure-based method of energy calculation is used, either alone or in combination with a sequence-based scoring function. That is, preferred embodiments do not rely on sequence alignment information alone as the analysis step.\n\n\nEnergy calculation refers to the process by which amino acid modifications are scored. The energies of interaction are measured by one or more scoring functions. A variety of scoring functions find use in the present invention for calculating energies. Scoring functions may include any number of potentials, herein referred to as the energy terms of a scoring function, including but not limited to a van der Waals potential, a hydrogen bond potential, an atomic salvation potential or other solvation models, a secondary structure propensity potential, an electrostatic potential, a torsional potential, and an entropy potential. At least one energy term is used to score each variable or floated position, although the energy terms may differ depending on the position, considered amino acids, and other considerations. In one embodiment, a scoring function using one energy term is used. In the most preferred embodiment, energies are calculated using a scoring function that contains more than one energy term, for example describing van der Waals, solvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions, and combinations thereof. In additional embodiments, additional energy terms include but are not limited to entropic terms, torsional energies, and knowledge-based energies.\n\n\nA variety of scoring functions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,188,965; 6,269,312; 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790, 09/877,695; 10/071,859, 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, scoring functions need not be limited to physico-chemical energy terms. For example, knowledge-based potentials may find use in the computational screening methodology of the present invention. Such knowledge-based potentials may be derived from protein sequence and/or structure statistics including but not limited to threading potentials, reference energies, pseudo energies, homology-based energies, and sequence biases derived from sequence alignments. In a preferred embodiment, a scoring function is modified to include models for immunogenicity, such as functions derived from data on binding of peptides to MHC (Major Htocompatability Complex), that may be used to identify potentially immunogenic sequences (see for example U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/903,378; 10/039,170; 60/222,697; 10/339,788; PCT WO 01/21823; and PCT WO 02/00165). In one embodiment, sequence alignment information can be used to score amino acid substitutions. For example, comparison of protein sequences, regardless of whether the source of said proteins is human, monkey, mouse, or otherwise, may be used to suggest or score amino acid mutations in the computational screening methodology of the present invention. In one embodiment, as is known in the art, one or more scoring functions may be optimized or “trained” during the computational analysis, and then the analysis re-run using the optimized system. Such altered scoring functions may be obtained for example, by training a scoring function using experimental data. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a number of force fields, which are comprised of one or more energy terms, may serve as scoring functions. Force fields include but are not limited to ab initio or quantum mechanical force fields, semi-empirical force fields, and molecular mechanics force fields. Scoring functions that are knowledge-based or that use statistical methods may find use in the present invention. These methods may be used to assess the match between a sequence and a three-dimensional protein structure, and hence may be used to score amino acid substitutions for fidelity to the protein structure. In one embodiment, molecular dynamics calculations may be used to computationally screen sequences by individually calculating mutant sequence scores.\n\n\nThere are a variety of ways to represent amino acids in order to enable efficient energy calculation. In a preferred embodiment, considered amino acids are represented as rotamers, as described previously, and the energy (or score) of interaction of each possible rotamer at each variable and floated position with the other variable and floated rotamers, with fixed position residues, and with the backbone structure and any non-protein atoms, is calculated. In a preferred embodiment, two sets of interaction energies are calculated for each side chain rotamer at every variable and floated position: the interaction energy between the rotamer and the fixed atoms (the “singles” energy), and the interaction energy between the variable and floated positions rotamer and all other possible rotamers at every other variable and floated position (the “doubles” energy). In an alternate embodiment, singles and doubles energies are calculated for fixed positions as well as for variable and floated positions. In an alternate embodiment, considered amino acids are not represented as rotamers.\n\n\nAn important component of computational screening is the identification of one or more sequences that have a favorable score, i.e. are low in energy. Determining a set of low energy sequences from an extremely large number of possibilities is nontrivial, and to solve this problem a combinatorial optimization algorithm is employed. The need for a combinatorial optimization algorithm is illustrated by examining the number of possibilities that are considered in a typical computational screening calculation. The discrete nature of rotamer sets allows a simple calculation of the number of possible rotameric sequences for a given design problem. A backbone of length n with m possible rotamers per position will have m\nn \npossible rotamer sequences, a number that grows exponentially with sequence length. For very simple calculations, it is possible to examine each possible sequence in order to identify the optimal sequence and/or one or more favorable sequences. However, for a typical design problem, the number of possible sequences (up to 10\n80 \nor more) is sufficiently large that examination of each possible sequence is intractable. A variety of combinatorial optimization algorithms may then be used to identify the optimum sequence and/or one or more favorable sequences. Combinatorial optimization algorithms may be divided into two classes: (1) those that are guaranteed to return the global minimum energy configuration if they converge, and (2) those that are not guaranteed to return the global minimum energy configuration, but which will always return a solution. Examples of the first class of algorithms include but are not limited to Dead-End Elimination (DEE) and Branch & Bound (B&B) (including Branch and Terminate) (Gordon & Mayo, 1999, \nStructure Fold Des \n7:1089-98). Examples of the second class of algorithms include, but are not limited to, Monte Carlo (MC), self-consistent mean field (SCMF), Boltzmann sampling (Metropolis et al., 1953, \nJ Chem Phys \n21:1087), simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983, \nScience, \n220:671-680), genetic algorithm (GA), and Fast and Accurate Side-Chain Topology and Energy Refinement (FASTER) (Desmet, et al., 2002, \nProteins, \n48:31-43). A combinatorial optimization algorithm may be used alone or in conjunction with another combinatorial optimization algorithm.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the strategy for applying a combinatorial optimization algorithm is to find the global minimum energy configuration. In an alternate embodiment, the strategy is to find one or more low energy or favorable sequences. In an alternate embodiment, the strategy is to find the global minimum energy configuration and then find one or more low energy or favorable sequences. For example, as outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 6,269,312, preferred embodiments utilize a Dead End Elimination (DEE) step and a Monte Carlo step. In other embodiments, tabu search algorithms are used or combined with DEE and/or Monte Carlo, among other search methods (see Modern Heuristic Search Methods, edited by V. J. Rayward-Smith et al., 1996, John Wiley & Sons Ltd.; U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102; and PCT WO 02/25588). In another preferred embodiment, a genetic algorithm may be used; see for example U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/877,695 and 10/071,859. As another example, as is more fully described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,188,965; 6,269,312; 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790; 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588, the global optimum may be reached, and then further computational processing may occur, which generates additional optimized sequences. In the simplest embodiment, design calculations are not combinatorial. That is, energy calculations are used to evaluate amino acid substitutions individually at single variable positions. For other calculations it is preferred to evaluate amino acid substitutions at more than one variable position. In a preferred embodiment, all possible interaction energies are calculated prior to combinatorial optimization. In an alternatively preferred embodiment, energies may be calculated as needed during combinatorial optimization.\n\n\nLibrary Generation\n\n\nThe present invention provides methods for generating libraries that may subsequently be screened experimentally to single out optimized Fc variants. By “library” as used herein is meant a set of one or more Fc variants. Library may refer to the set of variants in any form. In one embodiment, the library is a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, or a list of nucleic acid or amino acid substitutions at variable positions. For example, the examples used to illustrate the present invention below provide libraries as amino acid substitutions at variable positions. In one embodiment, a library is a list of at least one sequence that are Fc variants optimized for a desired property. For example see, Filikov et al., 2002, \nProtein Sci \n11:1452-1461 and Luo et al., 2002, \nProtein Sci \n11:1218-1226. In an alternate embodiment, a library may be defined as a combinatorial list, meaning that a list of amino acid substitutions is generated for each variable position, with the implication that each substitution is to be combined with all other designed substitutions at all other variable positions. In this case, expansion of the combination of all possibilities at all variable positions results in a large explicitly defined library. A library may refer to a physical composition of polypeptides that comprise the Fc region or some domain or fragment of the Fc region. Thus a library may refer to a physical composition of antibodies or Fc fusions; either in purified or unpurified form. A library may refer to a physical composition of nucleic acids that encode the library sequences. Said nucleic acids may be the genes encoding the library members, the genes encoding the library members with any operably linked nucleic acids, or expression vectors encoding the library members together with any other operably linked regulatory sequences, selectable markers, fusion constructs, and/or other elements. For example, the library may be a set of mammalian expression vectors that encode Fc library members, the protein products of which may be subsequently expressed, purified, and screened experimentally. As another example, the library may be a display library. Such a library could, for example, comprise a set of expression vectors that encode library members operably linked to some fusion partner that enables phage display, ribosome display, yeast display, bacterial surface display, and the like.\n\n\nThe library may be generated using the output sequence or sequences from computational screening. As discussed above, computationally generated libraries are significantly enriched in stable, properly folded, and functional sequences relative to randomly generated libraries. As a result, computational screening increases the chances of identifying proteins that are optimized for the design goal. The set of sequences in a library is generally, but not always, significantly different from the parent sequence, although in some cases the library preferably contains the parent sequence. As is known in the art, there are a variety of ways that a library may be derived from the output of computational screening calculations. For example, methods of library generation described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790; 10/218,102; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588 find use in the present invention. In one embodiment, sequences scoring within a certain range of the global optimum sequence may be included in the library. For example, all sequences within 10 kcal/mol of the lowest energy sequence could be used as the library. In an alternate embodiment, sequences scoring within a certain range of one or more local minima sequences may be used. In a preferred embodiment, the library sequences are obtained from a filtered set. Such a list or set may be generated by a variety of methods, as is known in the art, for example using an algorithm such as Monte Carlo, B&B, or SCMF. For example, the top 10\n3 \nor the top 10\n5 \nsequences in the filtered set may comprise the library. Alternatively, the total number of sequences defined by the combination of all mutations may be used as a cutoff criterion for the library. Preferred values for the total number of recombined sequences range from 10 to 10\n20\n, particularly preferred values range from 100 to 10\n9\n. Alternatively, a cutoff may be enforced when a predetermined number of mutations per position is reached. In some embodiments, sequences that do not make the cutoff are included in the library. This may be desirable in some situations, for instance to evaluate the approach to library generation, to provide controls or comparisons, or to sample additional sequence space. For example, the parent sequence may be included in the library, even if it does not make the cutoff.\n\n\nClustering algorithms may be useful for classifying sequences derived by computational screening methods into representative groups. For example, the methods of clustering and their application described in U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102 and PCT WO 02/25588, find use in the present invention. Representative groups may be defined, for example, by similarity. Measures of similarity include, but are not limited to sequence similarity and energetic similarity. Thus the output sequences from computational screening may be clustered around local minima, referred to herein as clustered sets of sequences. For example, sets of sequences that are close in sequence space may be distinguished from other sets. In one embodiment, coverage within one or a subset of clustered sets may be maximized by including in the library some, most, or all of the sequences that make up one or more clustered sets of sequences. For example, it may be advantageous to maximize coverage within the one, two, or three lowest energy clustered sets by including the majority of sequences within these sets in the library. In an alternate embodiment, diversity across clustered sets of sequences may be sampled by including within a library only a subset of sequences within each clustered set. For example, all or most of the clustered sets could be broadly sampled by including the lowest energy sequence from each clustered set in the library.\n\n\nSequence information may be used to guide or filter computationally screening results for generation of a library. As discussed, by comparing and contrasting alignments of protein sequences, the degree of variability at a position and the types of amino acids which occur naturally at that position may be observed. Data obtained from such analyses are useful in the present invention. The benefits of using sequence information have been discussed, and those benefits apply equally to use of sequence information to guide library generation. The set of amino acids that occur in a sequence alignment may be thought of as being pre-screened by evolution to have a higher chance than random at being compatible with a protein's structure, stability, solubility, function, and immunogenicity. The variety of sequence sources, as well as the methods for generating sequence alignments that have been discussed, find use in the application of sequence information to guiding library generation. Likewise, as discussed above, various criteria may be applied to determine the importance or weight of certain residues in an alignment. These methods also find use in the application of sequence information to guide library generation. Using sequence information to guide library generation from the results of computational screening finds broad use in the present invention. In one embodiment, sequence information is used to filter sequences from computational screening output. That is to say, some substitutions are subtracted from the computational output to generate the library. For example the resulting output of a computational screening calculation or calculations may be filtered so that the library includes only those amino acids, or a subset of those amino acids that meet some criteria, for example that are observed at that position in an alignment of sequences. In an alternate embodiment, sequence information is used to add sequences to the computational screening output. That is to say, sequence information is used to guide the choice of additional amino acids that are added to the computational output to generate the library. For example, the output set of amino acids for a given position from a computational screening calculation may be augmented to include one or more amino acids that are observed at that position in an alignment of protein sequences. In an alternate embodiment, based on sequence alignment information, one or more amino acids may be added to or subtracted from the computational screening sequence output in order to maximize coverage or diversity. For example, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that are found in a sequence alignment may be added to the library. For example, if a position is observed to have uncharged polar amino acids in a sequence alignment, additional uncharged polar amino acids may be included in the library at that position.\n\n\nLibraries may be processed further to generate subsequent libraries. In this way, the output from a computational screening calculation or calculations may be thought of as a primary library. This primary library may be combined with other primary libraries from other calculations or other libraries, processed using subsequent calculations, sequence information, or other analyses, or processed experimentally to generate a subsequent library, herein referred to as a secondary library. As will be appreciated from this description, the use of sequence information to guide or filter libraries, discussed above, is itself one method of generating secondary libraries from primary libraries. Generation of secondary libraries gives the user greater control of the parameters within a library. This enables more efficient experimental screening, and may allow feedback from experimental results to be interpreted more easily, providing a more efficient design/experimentation cycle.\n\n\nThere are a wide variety of methods to generate secondary libraries from primary libraries. For example, U.S. Ser. No. 10/218,102 and PCT WO 02/25588, describes methods for secondary library generation that find use in the present invention. Typically some selection step occurs in which a primary library is processed in some way. For example, in one embodiment a selection step occurs wherein some set of primary sequences are chosen to form the secondary library. In an alternate embodiment, a selection step is a computational step, again generally including a selection step, wherein some subset of the primary library is chosen and then subjected to further computational analysis, including both further computational screening as well as techniques such as “in silico” shuffling or recombination (see, for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,830,721; 5,811,238; 5,605,793; and 5,837,458, error-prone PCR, for example using modified nucleotides; known mutagenesis techniques including the use of multi-cassettes; and DNA shuffling (Crameri et al., 1998, \nNature \n391:288-291; Coco et al., 2001, \nNat Biotechnol \n19:354-9; Coco et al., 2002, \nNat Biotechnol, \n20:1246-50), heterogeneous DNA samples (U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,250); ITCHY (Ostermeier et al., 1999, \nNat Biotechnol \n17:1205-1209); StEP (Zhao et al., 1998, \nNat Biotechnol \n16:258-261), GSSM (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,171,820 and 5,965,408); in vivo homologous recombination, ligase assisted gene assembly, end-complementary PCR, profusion (Roberts & Szostak, 1997, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n94:12297-12302); yeast/bacteria surface display (Lu et al., 1995, \nBiotechnology \n13:366-372); Seed & Aruffo, 1987, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n84(10):3365-3369; Boder & Wittrup, 1997, \nNat Biotechnol \n15:553-557). In an alternate embodiment, a selection step occurs that is an experimental step, for example any of the library screening steps below, wherein some subset of the primary library is chosen and then recombined experimentally, for example using one of the directed evolution methods discussed below, to form a secondary library. In a preferred embodiment, the primary library is generated and processed as outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312.\n\n\nGeneration of secondary and subsequent libraries finds broad use in the present invention. In one embodiment, different primary libraries may be combined to generate a secondary or subsequent library. In another embodiment, secondary libraries may be generated by sampling sequence diversity at highly mutatable or highly conserved positions. The primary library may be analyzed to determine which amino acid positions in the template protein have high mutational frequency, and which positions have low mutational frequency. For example, positions in a protein that show a great deal of mutational diversity in computational screening may be fixed in a subsequent round of design calculations. A filtered set of the same size as the first would now show diversity at positions that were largely conserved in the first library. Alternatively, the secondary library may be generated by varying the amino acids at the positions that have high numbers of mutations, while keeping constant the positions that do not have mutations above a certain frequency.\n\n\nThis discussion is not meant to constrain generation of libraries subsequent to primary libraries to secondary libraries. As will be appreciated, primary and secondary libraries may be processed further to generate tertiary libraries, quaternary libraries, and so on. In this way, library generation is an iterative process. For example, tertiary libraries may be constructed using a variety of additional steps applied to one or more secondary libraries; for example, further computational processing may occur, secondary libraries may be recombined, or subsets of different secondary libraries may be combined. In a preferred embodiment, a tertiary library may be generated by combining secondary libraries. For example, primary and/or secondary libraries that analyzed different parts of a protein may be combined to generate a tertiary library that treats the combined parts of the protein. In an alternate embodiment, the variants from a primary library may be combined with the variants from another primary library to provide a combined tertiary library at lower computational cost than creating a very long filtered set. These combinations may be used, for example, to analyze large proteins, especially large multi-domain proteins, of which Fc is an example. Thus the above description of secondary library generation applies to generating any library subsequent to a primary library, the end result being a final library that may screened experimentally to obtain protein variants optimized for a design goal. These examples are not meant to constrain generation of secondary libraries to any particular application or theory of operation for the present invention. Rather, these examples are meant to illustrate that generation of secondary libraries, and subsequent libraries such as tertiary libraries and so on, is broadly useful in computational screening methodology for library generation.\n\n\nExperimental Production and Screening\n\n\nThe present invention provides methods for producing and screening libraries of Fc variants. The described methods are not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular application or theory of operation. Rather, the provided methods are meant to illustrate generally that one or more Fc variants or one or more libraries of Fc variants may be produced and screened experimentally to obtain optimized Fc variants. Fc variants may be produced and screened in any context, whether as an Fc region as precisely defined herein, a domain or fragment thereof, or a larger polypeptide that comprises Fc such as an antibody or Fc fusion. General methods for antibody molecular biology, expression, purification, and screening are described in Antibody Engineering, edited by Duebel & Kontermann, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, 2001; and Hayhurst & Georgiou, 2001, \nCurr Opin Chem Biol \n5:683-689; Maynard & Georgiou, 2000, \nAnnu Rev Biomed Eng \n2:339-76.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the library sequences are used to create nucleic acids that encode the member sequences, and that may then be cloned into host cells, expressed and assayed, if desired. Thus, nucleic acids, and particularly DNA, may be made that encode each member protein sequence. These practices are carried out using well-known procedures. For example, a variety of methods that may find use in the present invention are described in Molecular Cloning—A Laboratory Manual, 3\nrd \nEd. (Maniatis, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 2001), and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (John Wiley & Sons). As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the generation of exact sequences for a library comprising a large number of sequences is potentially expensive and time consuming. Accordingly, there are a variety of techniques that may be used to efficiently generate libraries of the present invention. Such methods that may find use in the present invention are described or referenced in U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790; 10/218,102; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588. Such methods include but are not limited to gene assembly methods, PCR-based method and methods which use variations of PCR, ligase chain reaction-based methods, pooled oligo methods such as those used in synthetic shuffling, error-prone amplification methods and methods which use oligos with random mutations, classical site-directed mutagenesis methods, cassette mutagenesis, and other amplification and gene synthesis methods. As is known in the art, there are a variety of commercially available kits and methods for gene assembly, mutagenesis, vector subcloning, and the like, and such commercial products find use in the present invention for generating nucleic acids that encode Fc variant members of a library.\n\n\nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be produced by culturing a host cell transformed with nucleic acid, preferably an expression vector, containing nucleic acid encoding the Fc variants, under the appropriate conditions to induce or cause expression of the protein. The conditions appropriate for expression will vary with the choice of the expression vector and the host cell, and will be easily ascertained by one skilled in the art through routine experimentation. A wide variety of appropriate host cells may be used, including but not limited to mammalian cells, bacteria, insect cells, and yeast. For example, a variety of cell lines that may find use in the present invention are described in the ATCC® cell line catalog, available from the American Type Culture Collection.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are expressed in mammalian expression systems, including systems in which the expression constructs are introduced into the mammalian cells using virus such as retrovirus or adenovirus. Any mammalian cells may be used, with human, mouse, rat, hamster, and primate cells being particularly preferred. Suitable cells also include known research cells, including but not limited to Jurkat T cells, NIH3T3, CHO, COS, and 293 cells. In an alternately preferred embodiment, library proteins are expressed in bacterial cells. Bacterial expression systems are well known in the art, and include \nEscherichia coli \n(\nE. coli\n), \nBacillus subtills, Streptococcus cremoris\n, and \nStreptococcus lividans\n. In alternate embodiments, Fc variants are produced in insect cells or yeast cells. In an alternate embodiment, Fc variants are expressed in vitro using cell free translation systems. In vitro translation systems derived from both prokaryotic (e.g. \nE. coli\n) and eukaryotic (e.g. wheat germ, rabbit reticulocytes) cells are available and may be chosen based on the expression levels and functional properties of the protein of interest. For example, as appreciated by those skilled in the art, in vitro translation is required for some display technologies, for example ribosome display. In addition, the Fc variants may be produced by chemical synthesis methods.\n\n\nThe nucleic acids that encode the Fc variants of the present invention may be incorporated into an expression vector in order to express the protein. A variety of expression vectors may be utilized for protein expression. Expression vectors may comprise self-replicating extra-chromosomal vectors or vectors which integrate into a host genome. Expression vectors are constructed to be compatible with the host cell type. Thus expression vectors which find use in the present invention include but are not limited to those which enable protein expression in mammalian cells, bacteria, insect cells, yeast, and in in vitro systems. As is known in the art, a variety of expression vectors are available, commercially or otherwise, that may find use in the present invention for expressing Fc variant proteins.\n\n\nExpression vectors typically comprise a protein operably linked with control or regulatory sequences, selectable markers, any fusion partners, and/or additional elements. By “operably linked” herein is meant that the nucleic acid is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. Generally, these expression vectors include transcriptional and translational regulatory nucleic acid operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the Fc variant, and are typically appropriate to the host cell used to express the protein. In general, the transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences may include promoter sequences, ribosomal binding sites, transcriptional start and stop sequences, translational start and stop sequences, and enhancer or activator sequences. As is also known in the art, expression vectors typically contain a selection gene or marker to allow the selection of transformed host cells containing the expression vector. Selection genes are well known in the art and will vary with the host cell used.\n\n\nFc variants may be operably linked to a fusion partner to enable targeting of the expressed protein, purification, screening, display, and the like. Fusion partners may be linked to the Fc variant sequence via a linker sequences. The linker sequence will generally comprise a small number of amino acids, typically less than ten, although longer linkers may also be used. Typically, linker sequences are selected to be flexible and resistant to degradation. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, any of a wide variety of sequences may be used as linkers. For example, a common linker sequence comprises the amino acid sequence GGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 6). A fusion partner may be a targeting or signal sequence that directs Fc variant protein and any associated fusion partners to a desired cellular location or to the extracellular media. As is known in the art, certain signaling sequences may target a protein to be either secreted into the growth media, or into the periplasmic space, located between the inner and outer membrane of the cell. A fusion partner may also be a sequence that encodes a peptide or protein that enables purification and/or screening. Such fusion partners include but are not limited to polyhistidine tags (His-tags) (for example H\n6 \nand H\n10 \nor other tags for use with Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) systems (e.g. Ni\n+2 \naffinity columns)), GST fusions, MBP fusions, Strep-tag, the BSP biotinylation target sequence of the bacterial enzyme BirA, and epitope tags which are targeted by antibodies (for example c-myc tags, flag-tags, and the like). As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, such tags may be useful for purification, for screening, or both. For example, an Fc variant may be purified using a His-tag by immobilizing it to a Ni\n+2 \naffinity column, and then after purification the same His-tag may be used to immobilize the antibody to a Ni\n+2 \ncoated plate to perform an ELISA or other binding assay (as described below). A fusion partner may enable the use of a selection method to screen Fc variants (see below). Fusion partners that enable a variety of selection methods are well-known in the art, and all of these find use in the present invention. For example, by fusing the members of an Fc variant library to the gene III protein, phage display can be employed (Kay et al., Phage display of peptides and proteins: a laboratory manual, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1996; Lowman et al., 1991, \nBiochemistry \n30:10832-10838; Smith, 1985, \nScience \n228:1315-1317). Fusion partners may enable Fc variants to be labeled. Alternatively, a fusion partner may bind to a specific sequence on the expression vector, enabling the fusion partner and associated Fc variant to be linked covalently or noncovalently with the nucleic acid that encodes them. For example, U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/642,574; 10/080,376; 09/792,630; 10/023,208; 09/792,626; 10/082,671; 09/953,351; 10/097,100; \nUSSN\n 60/366,658; PCT WO 00/22906; PCT WO 01/49058; PCT WO 02/04852; PCT WO 02/04853; PCT WO 02/08023; PCT WO 01/28702; and PCT WO 02/07466 describe such a fusion partner and technique that may find use in the present invention.\n\n\nThe methods of introducing exogenous nucleic acid into host cells are well known in the art, and will vary with the host cell used. Techniques include but are not limited to dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, calcium chloride treatment, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, viral or phage infection, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei. In the case of mammalian cells, transfection may be either transient or stable.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, Fc variant proteins are purified or isolated after expression. Proteins may be isolated or purified in a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art. Standard purification methods include chromatographic techniques, including ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, affinity, sizing or gel filtration, and reversed-phase, carried out at atmospheric pressure or at high pressure using systems such as FPLC and HPLC. Purification methods also include electrophoretic, immunological, precipitation, dialysis, and chromatofocusing techniques. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration techniques, in conjunction with protein concentration, are also useful. As is well known in the art, a variety of natural proteins bind Fc and antibodies, and these proteins can find use in the present invention for purification of Fc variants. For example, the bacterial proteins A and G bind to the Fc region. Likewise, the bacterial protein L binds to the Fab region of some antibodies, as of course does the antibody's target antigen. Purification can often be enabled by a particular fusion partner. For example, Fc variant proteins may be purified using glutathione resin if a GST fusion is employed, Ni\n+2 \naffinity chromatography if a His-tag is employed, or immobilized anti-flag antibody if a flag-tag is used. For general guidance in suitable purification techniques, see Protein Purification: Principles and Practice, 3\nrd \nEd., Scopes, Springer-Verlag, NY, 1994. The degree of purification necessary will vary depending on the screen or use of the Fc variants. In some instances no purification is necessary. For example in one embodiment, if the Fc variants are secreted, screening may take place directly from the media. As is well known in the art, some methods of selection do not involve purification of proteins. Thus, for example, if a library of Fc variants is made into a phage display library, protein purification may not be performed.\n\n\nFc variants may be screened using a variety of methods, including but not limited to those that use in vitro assays, in vivo and cell-based assays, and selection technologies. Automation and high-throughput screening technologies may be utilized in the screening procedures. Screening may employ the use of a fusion partner or label. The use of fusion partners has been discussed above. By “labeled” herein is meant that the Fc variants of the invention have one or more elements, isotopes, or chemical compounds attached to enable the detection in a screen. In general, labels fall into three classes: a) immune labels, which may be an epitope incorporated as a fusion partner that is recognized by an antibody, b) isotopic labels, which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes, and c) small molecule labels, which may include fluorescent and colorimetric dyes, or molecules such as biotin that enable other labeling methods. Labels may be incorporated into the compound at any position and may be incorporated in vitro or in vivo during protein expression.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the functional and/or biophysical properties of Fc variants are screened in an in vitro assay. In vitro assays may allow a broad dynamic range for screening properties of interest. Properties of Fc variants that may be screened include but are not limited to stability, solubility, and affinity for Fc ligands, for example FcγRs. Multiple properties may be screened simultaneously or individually. Proteins may be purified or unpurified, depending on the requirements of the assay. In one embodiment, the screen is a qualitative or quantitative binding assay for binding of Fc variants to a protein or nonprotein molecule that is known or thought to bind the Fc variant. In a preferred embodiment, the screen is a binding assay for measuring binding to the antibody's or Fc fusions' target antigen. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the screen is an assay for binding of Fc variants to an Fc ligand, including but are not limited to the family of FcγRs, the neonatal receptor FcRn, the complement protein C1q, and the bacterial proteins A and G. Said Fc ligands may be from any organism, with humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys preferred. Binding assays can be carried out using a variety of methods known in the art, including but not limited to FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) and BRET (Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer)-based assays, AlphaScreen™ (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay), Scintillation Proximity Assay, ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance, also known as BIACORE®), isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, gel electrophoresis, and chromatography including gel filtration. These and other methods may take advantage of some fusion partner or label of the Fc variant. Assays may employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic, fluorescent, luminescent, or isotopic labels.\n\n\nThe biophysical properties of Fc variant proteins, for example stability and solubility, may be screened using a variety of methods known in the art. Protein stability may be determined by measuring the thermodynamic equilibrium between folded and unfolded states. For example, Fc variant proteins of the present invention may be unfolded using chemical denaturant, heat, or pH, and this transition may be monitored using methods including but not limited to circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, absorbance spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry, and proteolysis. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the kinetic parameters of the folding and unfolding transitions may also be monitored using these and other techniques. The solubility and overall structural integrity of an Fc variant protein may be quantitatively or qualitatively determined using a wide range of methods that are known in the art. Methods which may find use in the present invention for characterizing the biophysical properties of Fc variant proteins include gel electrophoresis, chromatography such as size exclusion chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, analytical ultra-centrifugation, dynamic light scattering, proteolysis, and cross-linking, turbidity measurement, filter retardation assays, immunological assays, fluorescent dye binding assays, protein-staining assays, microscopy, and detection of aggregates via ELISA or other binding assay. Structural analysis employing X-ray crystallographic techniques and NMR spectroscopy may also find use. In one embodiment, stability and/or solubility may be measured by determining the amount of protein solution after some defined period of time. In this assay, the protein may or may not be exposed to some extreme condition, for example elevated temperature, low pH, or the presence of denaturant. Because function typically requires a stable, soluble, and/or well-folded/structured protein, the aforementioned functional and binding assays also provide ways to perform such a measurement. For example, a solution comprising an Fc variant could be assayed for its ability to bind target antigen, then exposed to elevated temperature for one or more defined periods of time, then assayed for antigen binding again. Because unfolded and aggregated protein is not expected to be capable of binding antigen, the amount of activity remaining provides a measure of the Fc variant's stability and solubility.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the library is screened using one or more cell-based or in vivo assays. For such assays, Fc variant proteins, purified or unpurified, are typically added exogenously such that cells are exposed to individual variants or pools of variants belonging to a library. These assays are typically, but not always, based on the function of an antibody or Fc fusion that comprises the Fc variant; that is, the ability of the antibody or Fc fusion to bind a target antigen and mediate some biochemical event, for example effector function, ligand/receptor binding inhibition, apoptosis, and the like. Such assays often involve monitoring the response of cells to antibody or Fc fusion, for example cell survival, cell death, change in cellular morphology, or transcriptional activation such as cellular expression of a natural gene or reporter gene. For example, such assays may measure the ability of Fc variants to elicit ADCC, ADCP, or CDC. For some assays additional cells or components, that is in addition to the target cells, may need to be added, for example serum complement, or effector cells such as peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs), NK cells, macrophages, and the like. Such additional cells may be from any organism, preferably humans, mice, rat, rabbit, and monkey. Antibodies and Fc fusions may cause apoptosis of certain cell lines expressing the antibody's target antigen, or they may mediate attack on target cells by immune cells which have been added to the assay. Methods for monitoring cell death or viability are known in the art, and include the use of dyes, immunochemical, cytochemical, and radioactive reagents. For example, caspase staining assays may enable apoptosis to be measured, and uptake or release of radioactive substrates or fluorescent dyes such as alamar blue may enable cell growth or activation to be monitored. In a preferred embodiment, the DELFIA® EuTDA-based cytotoxicity assay (Perkin Elmer, Mass.) is used. Alternatively, dead or damaged target cells may be monitored by measuring the release of one or more natural intracellular proteins, for example lactate dehydrogenase. Transcriptional activation may also serve as a method for assaying function in cell-based assays. In this case, response may be monitored by assaying for natural genes or proteins which may be upregulated, for example the release of certain interleukins may be measured, or alternatively readout may be via a reporter construct. Cell-based assays may also involve the measure of morphological changes of cells as a response to the presence of an Fc variant. Cell types for such assays may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic, and a variety of cell lines that are known in the art may be employed.\n\n\nAlternatively, cell-based screens are performed using cells that have been transformed or transfected with nucleic acids encoding the Fc variants. That is, Fc variant proteins are not added exogenously to the cells. For example, in one embodiment, the cell-based screen utilizes cell surface display. A fusion partner can be employed that enables display of Fc variants on the surface of cells (Witrrup, 2001, \nCurr Opin Biotechnol, \n12:395-399). Cell surface display methods that may find use in the present invention include but are not limited to display on bacteria (Georgiou et al., 1997, \nNat Biotechnol \n15:29-34; Georgiou et al., 1993, \nTrends Biotechnol \n11:6-10; Lee et al., 2000, \nNat Biotechnol \n18:645-648; Jun et al., 1998, \nNat Biotechnol \n16:576-80), yeast (Boder & Wittrup, 2000, \nMethods Enzymol \n328:430-44; Boder & Wittrup, 1997, \nNat Biotechnol \n15:553-557), and mammalian cells (Whitehorn et al., 1995, \nBiotechnology \n13:1215-1219). In an alternate embodiment, Fc variant proteins are not displayed on the surface of cells, but rather are screened intracellularly or in some other cellular compartment. For example, periplasmic expression and cytometric screening (Chen et al., 2001, \nNat Biotechnol \n19: 537-542), the protein fragment complementation assay (Johnson & Varshavsky, 1994, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n91:10340-10344.; Pelletier et al., 1998, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n95:12141-12146), and the yeast two hybrid screen (Fields & Song, 1989, \nNature \n340:245-246) may find use in the present invention. Alternatively, if a polypeptide that comprises the Fc variants, for example an antibody or Fc fusion, imparts some selectable growth advantage to a cell, this property may be used to screen or select for Fc variants.\n\n\nAs is known in the art, a subset of screening methods are those that select for favorable members of a library. Said methods are herein referred to as “selection methods”, and these methods find use in the present invention for screening Fc variant libraries. When libraries are screened using a selection method, only those members of a library that are favorable, that is which meet some selection criteria, are propagated, isolated, and/or observed. As will be appreciated, because only the most fit variants are observed, such methods enable the screening of libraries that are larger than those screenable by methods that assay the fitness of library members individually. Selection is enabled by any method, technique, or fusion partner that links, covalently or noncovalently, the phenotype of an Fc variant with its genotype, that is the function of an Fc variant with the nucleic acid that encodes it. For example the use of phage display as a selection method is enabled by the fusion of library members to the gene III protein. In this way, selection or isolation of variant proteins that meet some criteria, for example binding affinity for an FcγR, also selects for or isolates the nucleic acid that encodes it. Once isolated, the gene or genes encoding Fc variants may then be amplified. This process of isolation and amplification, referred to as panning, may be repeated, allowing favorable Fc variants in the library to be enriched. Nucleic acid sequencing of the attached nucleic acid ultimately allows for gene identification.\n\n\nA variety of selection methods are known in the art that may find use in the present invention for screening Fc variant libraries. These include but are not limited to phage display (Phage display of peptides and proteins: a laboratory manual, Kay et al., 1996, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1996; Lowman et al., 1991, \nBiochemistry \n30:10832-10838; Smith, 1985, \nScience \n228:1315-1317) and its derivatives such as selective phage infection (Malmborg et al., 1997, J Mol Biol 273:544-551), selectively infective phage (Krebber et al., 1997, \nJ Mol Biol \n268:619-630), and delayed infectivity panning (Benhar et al, 2000, \nJ Mol Biol \n301:893-904), cell surface display (Witrrup, 2001, \nCurr Opin Biotechnol, \n12:395-399) such as display on bacteria (Georgiou et al., 1997, \nNat Biotechnol \n15:29-34; Georgiou et al., 1993, \nTrends Biotechnol \n11:6-10; Lee et al., 2000, \nNat Biotechnol \n18:645-648; Jun et al., 1998, \nNat Biotechnol \n16:576-80), yeast (Boder & Wittrup, 2000, \nMethods Enzymol \n328:430-44; Boder & Wittrup, 1997, \nNat Biotechnol \n15:553-557), and mammalian cells (Whitehorn et al., 1995, \nBio/technology \n13:1215-1219), as well as in vitro display technologies (Amstutz et al., 2001, \nCurr Opin Biotechnol \n12:400-405) such as polysome display (Mattheakis et al, 1994, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n91:9022-9026), ribosome display (Hanes et al., 1997, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n94:4937-4942), mRNA display (Roberts & Szostak, 1997, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n94:12297-12302; Nemoto et al., 1997, \nFEBS Lett \n414:405-408), and ribosome-inactivation display system (Zhou et al., 2002, \nJ Am Chem Soc \n124, 538-543)\n\n\nOther selection methods that may find use in the present invention include methods that do not rely on display, such as in Vivo methods including but not limited to periplasmic expression and cytometric screening (Chen et al., 2001, \nNat Biotechnol \n19:537-542), the protein fragment complementation assay (Johnsson & Varshavsky, 1994, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n91:10340-10344; Pelletier et al., 1998, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n95:12141-12146), and the yeast two hybrid screen (Fields & Song, 1989, \nNature \n340:245-246) used in selection mode (Visintin et al., 1999, \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n96:11723-11728). In an alternate embodiment, selection is enabled by a fusion partner that binds to a specific sequence on the expression vector, thus linking covalently or noncovalently the fusion partner and associated Fc variant library member with the nucleic acid that encodes them. For example, U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/642,574; 10/080,376; 09/792,630; 10/023,208; 09/792,626; 10/082,671; 09/953,351; 10/097,100; \nUSSN\n 60/366,658; PCT WO 00/22906; PCT WO 01/49058; PCT WO 02/04852; PCT WO 02/04853; PCT WO 02/08023; PCT WO 01/28702; and PCT WO 02/07466 describe such a fusion partner and technique that may find use in the present invention. In an alternative embodiment, in vivo selection can occur if expression of a polypeptide that comprises the Fc variant, such as an antibody or Fc fusion, imparts some growth, reproduction, or survival advantage to the cell.\n\n\nA subset of selection methods referred to as “directed evolution” methods are those that include the mating or breading of favorable sequences during selection, sometimes with the incorporation of new mutations. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, directed evolution methods can facilitate identification of the most favorable sequences in a library, and can increase the diversity of sequences that are screened. A variety of directed evolution methods are known in the art that may find use in the present invention for screening Fc variant libraries, including but not limited to DNA shuffling (PCT WO 00/42561 A3; PCT WO 01/70947 A3), exon shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 6,365,377; Kolkman & Stemmer, 2001, \nNat Biotechnol \n19:423-428), family shuffling (Crameri et al., 1998, \nNature \n391:288-291; U.S. Pat.

As is know in the art, drugs are often tested in animals, including but not limited to mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, cats, pigs, and monkeys, in order to measure a drug's efficacy for treatment against a disease or disease model, or to measure a drug's pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and other properties. Said animals may be referred to as disease models. Therapeutics are often tested in mice, including but not limited to nude mice, SCID mice, xenograft mice, and transgenic mice (including knockins and knockouts). For example, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention that is intended as an anti-cancer therapeutic may be tested in a mouse cancer model, for example a xenograft mouse. In this method, a tumor or tumor cell line is grafted onto or injected into a mouse, and subsequently the mouse is treated with the therapeutic to determine the ability of the antibody or Fc fusion to reduce or inhibit cancer growth. Such experimentation may provide meaningful data for determination of the potential of said antibody or Fc fusion to be used as a therapeutic. Any organism, preferably mammals, may be used for testing. For example because of their genetic similarity to humans, monkeys can be suitable therapeutic models, and thus may be used to test the efficacy, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, or other property of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention. Tests of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention in humans are ultimately required for approval as drugs, and thus of course these experiments are contemplated. Thus the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be tested in humans to determine their therapeutic efficacy, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and/or other clinical properties.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExamples are provided below to illustrate the present invention. These examples are not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular application or theory of operation.\n\n\nFor all positions discussed in the present invention, numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat (Kabat et al., 1991, \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5th Ed., United States Public Health Svice, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Those skilled in the art of antibodies will appreciate that this convention consists of nonsequential numbering in specific regions of an immunoglobulin sequence, enabling a normalized reference to conserved positions in immunoglobulin families. Accordingly, the positions of any given immunoglobulin as defined by the EU index will not necessarily correspond to its sequential sequence. \nFIG. 3\n (SEQ ID NO: 1) shows the sequential and EU index numbering schemes for the antibody alemtuzumab in order to illustrate this principal more clearly. It should also be noted that polymorphisms have been observed at a number of Fc positions, including but not limited to \nKabat\n 270, 272, 312, 315, 356, and 358, and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the scientific literature may exist.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nComputational Screening and Design of Fc Libraries\n\n\nComputational screening calculations were carried out to design optimized Fc variants. Fc variants were computationally screened, constructed, and experimentally investigated over several computation/experimentation cycles. For each successive cycle, experimental data provided feedback into the next set of computational screening calculations and library design. All computational screening calculations and library design are presented in Example 1. For each set of calculations, a table is provided that presents the results and provides relevant information and parameters.\n\n\nSeveral different structures of Fc bound to the extracellular domain of FcγRs served as template structures for the computational screening calculations. Publicly available Fc/FcγR complex structures included \npdb accession code\n 1 E4K (Sondermann et al., 2000, \nNature \n406:267-273.), and pdb accession codes 1IIS and IIX (Radaev et al., 2001, \nJ Biol Chom \n276:16469-16477). The extracellular regions of FcγRIIIb and FcγRIIIa are 96% identical, and therefore the use of the Fc/FcγRIIIb structure is essentially equivalent to use of FcγRIIIa. Nonetheless, for some calculations, a more precise Fc/FcγRIIIa template structure was constructed by modeling a D129G mutation in the 1IIS and 1E4K structures (referred to as D129G 1IIS and D129G 1E4K template structures). In addition, the structures for human Fc bound to the extracellular domains of human FcγRIIb, human F158 FcγRIIIa, and mouse FcγRIII were modeled using standard methods, the available FcγR sequence information, the aforementioned Fc/FcγR structures, as well as structural information for unbound complexes (pdb accession code 1H9V)(Sondermann et al., 2001, \nJ Mol Biol \n309:737-749) (\npdb accession code\n 1 FCG)(Maxwell et al., 1999, \nNat Struct Biol \n6:437-442), FcγRIIb (pdb accession code 2FCB)(Sondermann et al, 1999, \nEmbo J \n18:1095-1103), and FcγRIIIb (pdb accession code 1E4J)(Sondermann et al., 2000, \nNature \n406:267-273.).\n\n\nVariable positions and amino adds to be considered at those positions were chosen by visual inspection of the aforementioned Fc/FcγR and FcγR structures, and using solvent accessibility information and sequence information. Sequence information of Fcs and FcγRs was particularly useful for determining variable positions at which substitutions may provide distinguishing affinities between activating and inhibitory receptors. Virtually all Cγ2 positions were screened computationally. The Fc structure is a homodimer of two heavy chains (labeled chains A and B in the 1IIS, 1IIX, and 1E4K structures) that each include the hinge and Cγ2-Cγ3 domains (shown in \nFIG. 2\n). Because the FcγR (labeled chain C in the 1IIS, 1IIX, and 1E4K structures) binds asymmetrically to the Fc homodimer, each chain was often considered separately in design calculations. For some calculations, Fc and/or Fc□γR residues proximal to variable position residues were floated, that is the amino acid conformation but not the amino acid identity was allowed to vary in a protein design calculation to allow for conformational adjustments. These are indicated below the table for each set of calculations when relevant. Considered amino acids typically belonged to either the Core, Core XM, Surface, Boundary, Boundary XM, or All 20 classifications, unless noted otherwise. These classifications are defined as follows: Core=alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine; Core XM=alanine, valine, isoleucine, leudne, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; Surface=alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine and histidine; Boundary=alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine, histidine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine; Boundary XM=Boundary=alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine, histidine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; All 20=all 20 naturally occurring amino acids.\n\n\nThe majority of calculations followed one of two general types of computational screening methods. In one method, the conformations of amino acids at variable positions were represented as a set of backbone-independent side chain rotamers derived from the rotamer library of Dunbrack & Cohen (Dunbrack of al., 1997, \nProtein Sci \n6:1661-1681). The energies of all possible combinations of the considered amino acids at the chosen variable positions were calculated using a force field containing terms describing van der Waals, solvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions, and the optimal (ground state) sequence was determined using a Dead End Elimination (DEE) algorithm. As will be appreciated by those in the art, the predicted lowest energy sequence is not necessarily the true lowest energy sequence because of errors primarily in the scoring function, coupled with the fact that subtle conformational differences in proteins can result in dramatic differences in stability. However, the predicted ground state sequence is likely to be close to the true ground state, and thus additional favorable diversity can be explored by evaluating the energy of sequences that are close in sequence space and energy around the predicted ground state. To accomplish this, as well as to generate a diversity of sequences for a library, a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm was used to evaluate the energies of 1000 similar sequences around the predicted ground state. The number of sequences out of the 1000 sequence set that contain that amino acid at that variable position is referred to as the occupancy for that substitution, and this value may reflect how favorable that substitution is. This computational screening method is substantially similar to Protein Design Automation® (PDA®) technology, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,188,965; 6,269,312; 6,403,312; U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/782,004; 09/927,790; 10/218,102; PCT WO 98/07254; PCT WO 01/40091; and PCT WO 02/25588, and for ease of description, is referred to as PDA® technology throughout the examples. Tables that present the results of these calculations provide for each variable position on the designated chain (column 1) the amino acids considered at each variable position (column 2), the WT Fc amino acid identity at each variable position (column 3), the amino acid identity at each variable position in the DEE ground state sequence (column 4), and the set of amino acids and corresponding occupancy that are observed in the Monte Carlo output (column 5).\n\n\nOther calculations utilized a genetic algorithm (GA) to screen for low energy sequences, with energies being calculated during each round of “evolution” for those sequences being sampled. The conformations of amino acids at variable and floated positions were represented as a set of side chain rotamers derived from a backbone-independent rotamer library using a flexible rotamer model (Mendes et al., 1999, \nProteins \n37:530-543). Energies were calculated using a force field containing terms describing van der Waals, salvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions. This calculation generated a list of 300 sequences which are predicted to be low in energy. To facilitate analysis of the results and library generation, the 300 output sequences were clustered computationally into 10 groups of similar sequences using a nearest neighbor single linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm to assign sequences to related groups based on similarity scores (Diamond, 1995, \nActa Cryst D\n51:127-135). That is, all sequences within a group are most similar to all other sequences within the same group and less similar to sequences in other groups. The lowest energy sequence from each of these ten clusters are used as a representative of each group, and are presented as results. This computational screening method is substantially similar to Sequence Prediction Algorithm™ (SPA™) technology, as described in (Raha et al., 2000, \nProtein Sci \n9:1106-1119); U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/877,695; and 10/071,859, and for ease of description, is referred to as SPA™ technology throughout the examples.\n\n\nComputational screening was applied to design energetically favorable interactions at the Fc/FcγR interface at groups of variable positions that mediate or potentially mediate binding with FcγR. Because the binding interface involves a large number of Fc residues on the two different chains, and because FcγRs bind asymmetrically to Fc, residues were grouped in different sets of interacting variable positions, and designed in separate sets of calculations. In many cases these sets were chosen as groups of residues that were deemed to be coupled, that is the energy of one or more residues is dependent on the identity of one or more other residues. Various template structures were used, and in many cases calculations explored substitutions on both chains. For many of the variable position sets, calculations were carried out using both the PDA® and SPA™ technology computational screening methods described. The results of these calculations and relevant parameters and information are presented in Tables 1-30 below.\n\n\nTables that present the results of these calculations provide for each variable position on the designated chain (column 1) the amino acids considered at each variable position (column 2), the WT Fc amino acid identity at each variable position (column 3), and the amino acid identity at the variable positions for the lowest energy sequence from each cluster group (columns 4-13). Tables 1-59 are broken down into two sets, as labeled below, PDA® and SPA™ technology. \nColumn\n 4 of the PDA® tables show the frequency of each residue that occurs in the top 1000 sequences during that PDA® run. Thus, in the first row of Table 1, at position 328, when run using boundary amino acids as the set of variable residues for that position, L occurred 330 times in the top 1000 sequence, M occurred 302 times, etc.\n\n\nIn addition, included within the compositions of the invention are antibodies that have any of the listed amino acid residues in the listed positions, either alone or in any combination (note preferred combinations are listed in the claims, the summary and the figures). One preferred combination is the listed amino acids residues in the listed positions in a ground state (sometimes referred to herein as the “global solution”, as distinguished from the wild-type). Similarly, residue positions and particular amino acids at those residue positions may be combined between tables.\n\n\nFor SPA™ technology tables, such as Table 4, \ncolumn\n 4 is a SPA™ run that results in a protein with the six listed amino acids at the six listed positions (\ne.g. column\n 4 is a single protein with a wild-type sequence except for 239E, 265G, 267S, 269Y, 270T and 299S. Thus, each of these individual proteins are included within the invention. In addition, combinations between SPA™ proteins, both within tables and between tables, are also included.\n\n\nIn addition, each table shows the presence or absence of carbohydrate, but specifically included are the reverse sequences; e.g. Table 1 is listed for an aglycosylated variant, but these same amino acid changes can be done on a glycosylated variant.\n\n\nFurthermore, each table lists the template structure used, as well as “floated” residues; for example, Table 2 used a PDA® run that floated C120, C132 and C134.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConsidered\n\n\n \n\n\nGround\n\n\nSequences Around\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition\n\n\nAmino Acids\n\n\nWT\n\n\nState\n\n\nGround State\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n328 A\n\n\nBoundary\n\n\nL\n\n\nL\n\n\nL: 330 M: 302 E: 111 K: 62 A: 45 Q: 39 D: 36 S: 30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nT: 28 N: 10 R: 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n332 A\n\n\nSurface\n\n\nI\n\n\nR\n\n\nR: 247 K: 209 Q: 130 H: 95 E: 92 T: 59 D: 51 N: 51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nS: 42 A: 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n328 B\n\n\nBoundary\n\n\nL\n\n\nL\n\n\nL: 321 M: 237 T: 166 K: 73 R: 72 S: 55 Q: 20 D: 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nE: 13 A: 12 V: 10 N: 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n332 B\n\n\nSurface\n\n\nI\n\n\nE\n\n\nE: 269 Q: 180 R: 145 K: 111 D: 97 T: 78 N: 65 S: 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nA: 14 H: 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDA ® technology, 1IIS template structure;

Design calculations were aimed at designing favorable substitutions in the context of the aglycosylated Fc template structure at residue 297, residues proximal to it, residues at the Fc/FcγR interface, and residues at the Fc/carbohydrate interface. Variable positions were grouped in different sets of interacting variable positions and designed in separate sets of calculations, and various template structures were used. For many of the variable position sets, calculations were carried out using both the PDA® and SPA™ computational screening methods.

The N297 carbohydrate covers up the exposed hydrophobic patch that would normally be the interface for a protein-protein interaction with another Ig domain, maintaining the stability and structural integrity of Fc and keeping the Cγ2 domains from aggregating across the central axis. Key residues for design are F241, F243, V262, and V264, which reside behind the carbohydrate on Cγ2, in addition to residues such as L328, I332, and I336, which are exposed nonpolar residues facing inward towards the opposed Cγ2 domain, that were considered in previously presented calculations. The importance of these Cγ2 residues is supported by noting that the corresponding residues in the Cγ3 domain by sequence alignment either mediate the nonpolar interaction between the two Cγ3 domains or are buried in the Cγ3 core. The results of these design calculations are presented in Table 53.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConsidered\n\n\n \n\n\nGround\n\n\nSequences Around\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition\n\n\nAmino Acids\n\n\nWT\n\n\nState\n\n\nGround State\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n241 A\n\n\nSurface\n\n\nF\n\n\nE\n\n\nE: 190 R: 172 K: 138 H: 117\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nT: 93 Q: 91 D: 85 S: 49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nN: 49 A: 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 A\n\n\nSurface\n\n\nF\n\n\nR\n\n\nR: 190 H: 164 Q: 152 E: 149\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nK: 92 T: 71 D: 64 N: 58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nS: 42 A: 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n262 A\n\n\nSurface\n\n\nV\n\n\nD\n\n\nD: 416 E: 164 N: 138 Q: 87\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nT: 83 R: 44 S: 32 K: 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nA: 11 H: 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n264 A\n\n\nSurface\n\n\nV\n\n\nH\n\n\nR: 368 H: 196 K: 147 E: 108\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQ: 68 T: 34 N: 33 D: 25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nS: 15 A: 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDA ® technology; 1IIS template structure; −carbohydrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a final set of calculations, a SPA™ computational screening method was applied to evaluate the replacement of all chosen variable positions with all 20 amino acids. The lowest energy rotamer conformation for all 20 amino acids was determined, and this energy was defined as the energy of substitution for that amino acid at that variable position. These calculations thus provided an energy of substitution for each of the 20 amino acids at each variable position. These data were useful for a variety of design goals aimed at both glycosylated and aglycosylated Fc, including optimization of Fc/FcγR affinity, Fc stability, Fc solubility, carbohydrate conformation, and hinge conformation. Furthermore, because these calculations provide energies for both favorable and unfavorable substitutions, they guide substitutions that may enable differential binding to activating versus inhibitory FcγRs. Various template structures were used, and calculations explored substitutions on both chains. The results of these calculations and relevant parameters and information are presented in Tables 54-59 below. \nColumn\n 1 lists the variable positions on chain A and B of the 1IIS template structure. \nColumn\n 2 lists the wild-type amino acid identity at each variable position. The remaining 20 columns provide the energy for each of the natural 20 amino acids (shown in the top row). All substitutions were normalized with respect to the lowest energy substitution, which was set to 0 energy. For example in Table 54, for L235 on chain A, serine is the lowest energy substitution, and L235A is 0.9 kcal/mol less stable than L235S. Extremely high energies were set to 20 kcal/mol for energies between 20-50 kcal/mol, and 50 kcal/mold for energies greater than 50 kcal/mol. Favorable substitutions may be considered to be the lowest energy substitution for each position, and substitutions that have small energy differences from the lowest energy substitution, for example substitutions within 1-2, 1-3, 1-5, or 1-10 kcal/mol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

−carbohydrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the design calculations presented above in Tables 1-59 were used to construct a series of Fc variant libraries for experimental production and screening. Experimental libraries were designed in successive rounds of computational and experimental screening. Design of subsequent Fc libraries benefited from feedback from prior libraries, and thus typically comprised combinations of Fc variants that showed favorable properties in the previous screen. The entire set of Fc variants that were constructed and experimentally tested is shown in Table 60. In this table, \nrow\n 1 lists the variable positions, and the rows that follow indicate the amino acids at those variable positions for WT and the Fc variants. For example, \nvariant\n 18 has the following four mutations: F241E, F243Y, V262T, and V264R. The variable position residues that compose this set of Fc variants are illustrated structurally in \nFIG. 3\n (SEQ ID NO:3), and are presented in the context of the human IgG1 Fc sequence in \nFIG.

2\n\n\nExperimental Production and Screening of Fc Libraries\n\n\nThe majority of experimentation on the Fc variants was carried out in the context of the anti-cancer antibody alemtuzumab (Campath®, a registered trademark of Hex Pharmaceuticals LP). Alemtuzumab binds a short linear epitope within its target antigen CD52 (Hale et al., 1990, \nTissue Antigens \n35:118-127; Hale, 1995, \nImmunotechnology \n1:175-187). Alemtuzumab has been chosen as the primary engineering template because its efficacy is due in part to its ability to recruit effector cells (Dyer et al., 1989, \nBlood \n73:1431-1439; Friend et al., 1991, \nTransplant Proc \n23:2253-2254; Hale et al., 1998, \nBlood \n92:4581-4590; Glennie et al., 2000, \nImmunol Today \n21:403-410), and because production and use of its antigen in binding assays are relatively straightforward. In order to evaluate the optimized Fc variants of the present invention in the context of other antibodies, select Fc variants were evaluated in the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (Rituxan®, a registered trademark of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation), and the anti-Her2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin®, a registered trademark of Genentech). The use of alemtuzumab, rituximab, and trastuzumabfor screening purposes is not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular antibody.\n\n\nThe IgG1 full length light (V\nL\n-C\nL\n) and heavy (V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3) chain antibody genes for alemtuzumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab were constructed with convenient end restriction sites to facilitate subcloning. The genes were ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1Zeo (Invitrogen). The V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3 clone in pcDNA3.1zeo was used as a template for mutagenesis of the Fc region. Mutations were introduced into this clone using PCR-based mutagenesis techniques. Fc variants were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the sequence. Plasmids containing heavy chain gene (V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3) (wild-type or variants) were co-transfected with plasmid containing light chain gene (V\nL\n-C\nL\n) into 293T cells. Media were harvested 5 days after transfection. Expression of immunoglobulin was monitored by screening the culture supernatant of transfectomas by western using peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog #109-035-088). \nFIG. 6\n shows expression of wild-type alemtuzumab and \nvariants\n 1 through 10 in 293T cells. Antibodies were purified from the supernatant using protein A affinity chromatography (Pierce, Catalog #20334. \nFIG. 7\n shows results of the protein purification for WT alemtuzumab. Antibody Fc variants showed similar expression and purification results to WT. Some Fc variants were deglycosylated in order to determine their solution and functional properties in the absence of carbohydrate. To obtain deglycosylated antibodies, purified alemtuzumab antibodies were incubated with peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase F) at 37° C. for 24 h. \nFIG. 8\n presents an SDS PAGE gel confirming deglycosylation for several Fc variants and WT alemtuzumab.\n\n\nIn order to confirm the functional fidelity of alemtuzumab produced under these conditions, the antigenic CD52 peptide, fused to GST, was expressed in \nE. coli \nBL21 (DE3) under IPTG induction. Both un-induced and induced samples were run on a SDS PAGE gel, and transferred to PVDF membrane. For western analysis, either alemtuzumab from Sotec (final concentration 2.5 ng/ul) or media of transfected 293T cells (final alemtuzumab concentration about 0.1-0.2 ng/ul) were used as primary antibody, and peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG was used as secondary antibody. \nFIG. 9\n presents these results. The ability to bind target antigen confirms the structural and functional fidelity of the expressed alemtuzumab. Fc variants that have the same variable region as WT alemtuzumab are anticipated to maintain a comparable binding affinity for antigen.\n\n\nIn order to screen for Fc/FcγR binding, the extracellular regions of human V158 FcγRIIIa, human F158 FcγRIIIa, human FcγRIIb, human FcγRIIa, and mouse FcγRIII, were expressed and purified. \nFIG. 10\n presents an SDS PAGE gel that shows the results of expression and purification of human V158 FcγRIIIa. The extracellular region of this receptor was obtained by PCR from a clone obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC:22630). The receptor was fused with glutathione S-Transferase (GST) to enable screening. Tagged FcγRIIIa was transfected in 293T cells, and media containing secreted FcγRIIIa were harvested 3 days later and purified. For western analysis, membrane was probed with anti-GST antibody.\n\n\nBinding affinity to FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIb was measured for all designed Fc variants using an AlphaScreen™ assay (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay (ALPHA), PerkinElmer, Wellesley, Mass.), a bead-based non-radioactive luminescent proximity assay. Laser excitation of a donor bead excites oxygen, which if sufficiently close to the acceptor bead generates a cascade of chemiluminescent events, ultimately leading to fluorescence emission at 520-620 nm. The AlphaScreen™ assay was applied as a competition assay for screening Fc variants. WT alemtuzumab antibody was biotinylated by standard methods for attachment to streptavidin donor beads, and GST-tagged FcγR was bound to glutathione chelate acceptor beads. In the absence of competing Fc variants, WT antibody and FcγR interact and produce a signal at 520-620 nm. Addition of untagged Fc variant competes with the WT Fc/FcγR interaction, reducing fluorescence quantitatively to enable determination of relative binding affinities. All Fc variants were screened for V158 FcγRIIIa binding using the AlphaScreen™ assay. Select Fc variants were subsequently screened for binding to FcγRIIb, as well as other FcγRs and Fc ligands.\n\n\n \nFIG. 11\n shows AlphaScreen™ data for binding to human V158 FcγRIIIa by select Fc variants. The binding data were normalized to the maximum and minimum luminescence signal provided by the baselines at low and high concentrations of competitor antibody respectively. The data were fit to a one site competition model using nonlinear regression, and these fits are represented by the curves in the figure. These fits provide the \ninhibitory concentration\n 50% (IC50) (i.e. the concentration required for 50% inhibition) for each antibody, illustrated by the dotted lines in \nFIG. 11\n, thus enabling the relative binding affinities of Fc variants to be quantitatively determined. Here, WT alemtuzumab has an IC50 of (4.63×10\n−9\n)×(2)=9.2 nM, whereas S239D has an IC50 of (3.98×10\n−10\n)×(2)=0.8 nM. Thus S239D alemtuzumab binds 9.2 nM/0.8 nM=11.64-fold more tightly than WT alemtuzumab to human V158 FcγRIIIa. Similar calculations were performed for the binding of all Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa. Select Fc variants were also screened for binding to human FcγRIIb, and examples of these AlphaScreen™ binding data are shown in \nFIG. 12\n. Table 61 presents the fold-enhancement or fold-reduction relative to the parent antibody for binding of Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa (column 3) and human FcγRIIb (column 4), as determined by the AlphaScreen™ assay. For these data, a fold above 1 indicates an enhancement in binding affinity, and a fold below 1 indicates a reduction in binding affinity relative to WT Fc. All data were obtained in the context of alemtuzumab, except for those indicated with an asterix (*), which were tested in the context of trastuzumab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE

Table 61 provides Fc variants that bind more tightly to FcγRIIa, and thus are candidates for improving the effector function of antibodies and Fc fusions. These include a number of variants that comprise substitutions at 239, 264, 330, and 332. \nFIG. 13\n shows AlphaScreen™ binding data for some of these Fc variants. The majority of these Fc variants provide substantially greater FcγRIIIa binding enhancements over S298A/E333A/K334A.\n\n\nAlthough the majority of Fc variants were screened in the context of the antibody alemtuzumab, select Fc variants were also screened in the context of rituximab and trastuzumab. AlphaScreen™ data for binding of select Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa In the context of rituximab and trastuzumab are shown in \nFIGS. 14 and 15\n respectively. The results indicate that the Fc variants display consistent binding enhancements regardless of the antibody context, and thus the Fc variants of the present invention are broadly applicable to antibodies and Fc fusions.\n\n\nFc variants have been obtained that show differentially enhanced binding to FcγRIIIa over FcγRIIb. As discussed, optimal effector function may result from Fc variants wherein affinity for activating FcγRs is greater than affinity for the inhibitory FcγRIIb. AlphaScreen™ data directly comparing binding to FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIIb for two Fc variants with this specificity profile are shown in \nFIGS. 16\n \na \nand \n16\n \nb\n. This concept can be defined quantitatively as the fold-enhancement or -reduction of the activating FγR (Table 61, column 3) divided by the fold-enhancement or -reduction of the inhibitory FcγR (Table 61, column 4), herein referred to as the FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold ratio. This value provided in \nColumn\n 5 in Table 61. Table 61 shows that Fc variants provide this specificity profile, with a FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold ratio as high as 86:1.\n\n\nSome of the most promising Fc variants of the present invention for enhancing effector function have both substantial increases in affinity for FcγRIIIa and favorable FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold ratios. These include, for example, S239D/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold=56, FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold=3), S239D/A330Y/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold=130), S239D/A330L/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold=139, FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold=18), and S239D/S298A/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold=295, FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold=48). \nFIG. 17\n shows AlphaScreen™ binding data for these and other Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa.\n\n\nBecause there are a number of FcγRs that contribute to effector function, it may be worthwhile to additionally screen Fc variants against other receptors. \nFIG. 18\n shows AlphaScreen™ data for binding of select Fc variants to human R131 FcγRIIa. As can be seen, those aforementioned variants with favorable binding enhancements and specificity profiles also show enhanced binding to this activating receptor. The use of FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIb, and FcγRIIc for screening is not meant to constrain experimental testing to these particular FcγRs; other FcγRs are contemplated for screening, including but not limited to the myriad isoforms and allotypes of FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII from humans, mice, rats, monkeys, and the like, as previously described.\n\n\nTaken together, the FcγR binding data provided in \nFIGS. 11-18\n and Table 61 indicate that a number of substitutions at \n \npositions\n \n 234, 235, 239, 240, 243, 264, 266, 325, 328, 330, and 332 are promising candidates for improving the effector function of antibodies and Fc fusions. Because combinations of some of these substitutions have typically resulted in additive or synergistic binding improvements, it is anticipated that as yet unexplored combinations of the Fc variants provided in Table 61 will also provide favorable results. Thus all combinations of the Fc variants in Table 61 are contemplated. Likewise, combinations of any of the Fc variants in Table 61 with other discovered or undiscovered Fc variants may also provide favorable properties, and these combinations are also contemplated. Furthermore, it is anticipated from these results that other substitutions at \n \npositions\n \n 234, 235, 239, 240, 243, 264, 266, 325, 328, 330, and 332 may also provide favorable binding enhancements and specificities, and thus substitutions at these positions other than those presented in Table 61 are contemplated.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nReduced Binding to FcγRs\n\n\nAs discussed, although there is a need for greater effector function, for some antibody therapeutics, reduced or eliminated effector function may be desired. Several Fc variants in Table 61 substantially reduce or ablate FcγR binding, and thus may find use in antibodies and Fc fusions wherein effector function is undesirable. AlphaScreen™ binding data for some examples of such variants are shown in \nFIGS. 19\n \na \nand \n19\n \nb\n. These Fc variants, as well as their use in combination, may find use for eliminating effector function when desired, for example in antibodies and Fc fusions whose mechanism of action involves blocking or antagonism but not killing of the cells bearing target antigen.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nAglycosylated Fc Variants\n\n\nAs discussed, one goal of the current experiments was to obtain optimized aglycosylated Fc variants. Several Fc variants provide significant progress towards this goal. Because it is the site of glycosylation, substitution at N297 results in an aglycosylated Fc. Whereas all other Fc variants that comprise a substitution at N297 completely ablate FcγR binding, N297D/I332E has significant binding affinity for FcγRIIIa, shown in Table 61 and illustrated in \nFIG. 20\n. The exact reason for this result is uncertain in the absence of a high-resolution structure for this variant, although the computational screening predictions suggest that it is potentially due to a combination of new favorable Fc/FcγR interactions and favorable electrostatic properties. Indeed other electrostatic substitutions are envisioned for further optimization of aglycosylated Fc. Table 61 shows that other aglycosylated Fc variants such as S239D/N297D/I332E and N297D/A330Y/I332E provide binding enhancements that bring affinity for FcγRIIIa within 0.28- and 0.43-fold respectively of glycosylated WT alemtuzumab. Combinations of these variants with other Fc variants that enhance FcγR binding are contemplated, with the goal of obtaining aglycosylated Fc variants that bind one or more FcγRs with affinity that is approximately the same as or even better than glycosylated parent Fc. An additional set of promising Fc variants provide stability and solubility enhancements in the absence of carbohydrate. Fc variants that comprise substitutions at positions 241, 243, 262, and 264, positions that do not mediate FγR binding but do determine the interface between the carbohydrate and Fc, ablate FγR binding, presumably because they perturb the conformation of the carbohydrate. In deglycosylated form, however, Fc variants F241E/F243R/V262E/V264R, F241E/F243Q/V262T/V264E, F241R/F243Q/V262T/V264R, and F241E/F243Y/V262T/V264R show stronger binding to FcγRIIIa than in glycosylated form, as shown by the AlphaScreen™ data in \nFIG. 21\n. This result indicates that these are key positions for optimization of the structure, stability, solubility, and function of aglycosylated Fc. Together these results suggests that protein engineering can be used to restore the favorable functional and solution properties of antibodies and Fc fusions in the absence of carbohydrate, and pave the way for aglycosylated antibodies and Fc fusions with favorable solution properties and full functionality that comprise substitutions at these and other Fc positions.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nAffinity of Fc Variants for Polymorphic Forms of FcγRIIIa\n\n\nAs discussed above, an important parameter of Fc-mediated effector function is the affinity of Fc for both V158 and F158 polymorphic forms of FcγRIIIa. AlphaScreen™ data comparing binding of select variants to the two receptor allotypes are shown in \nFIG. 22\n \na \n(V158 FcγRIIIa) and \nFIG. 22\n \nb \n(F158 FcγRIIIa). As can be seen, all variants improve binding to both FcγRIIIa allotypes. These data indicate that those Fc variants of the present invention with enhanced effector function will be broadly applicable to the entire patient population, and that enhancement to clinical efficacy will potentially be greatest for the low responsive patient population who need it most.\n\n\nThe FcγR binding affinities of these Fc variants were further investigated using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). SPR is a sensitive and extremely quantitative method that allows for the measurement of binding affinities of protein-protein interactions, and has been used to effectively measure Fc/FcγR binding (Radaev et al., 2001, \nJ Biol Chem \n276:16478-16483). SPR thus provides an excellent complementary binding assay to the AlphaScreen™ assay. His-tagged V158 FcγRIIIa was immobilized to an SPR chip, and WT and Fc variant alemtuzumab antibodies were flowed over the chip at a range of concentrations. Binding constants were obtained from fitting the data using standard curve-fitting methods. Table 62 presents dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of select Fc variants to V158 FcγRIIIa and F158 FcγRIIIa obtained using SPR, and compares these with IC50s obtained from the AlphaScreen™ assay. By dividing the Kd and IC50 for each variant by that of WT alemtuzumab, the fold-improvements over WT (Fold) are obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSPR\n\n\nSPR\n\n\nAlphaScreen ™\n\n\nAlphaScreen ™\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV158 FcγRIIIa\n\n\nF158 FcγRIIIa\n\n\nV158 FcγRIIIa\n\n\nF158 FcγRIIIa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKd (nM)\n\n\nFold\n\n\nKd (nM)\n\n\nFold\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nFold\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nFold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT\n\n\n68\n\n\n \n\n\n730\n\n\n \n\n\n6.4\n\n\n \n\n\n17.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV264I\n\n\n64\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n550\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n11.5\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI332E\n\n\n31\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n72\n\n\n10.1\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n6.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV264I/I332E\n\n\n17\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n52\n\n\n14.0\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n12.8\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n15.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS298A\n\n\n52\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n285\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n12.0\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS298A/E333A/\n\n\n39\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n156\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK334A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SPR data corroborate the improvements to FcγRIIIa affinity observed by AlphaScreen™ assay. Table 62 further indicates the superiority of V264I/I332E and I332E over S298A and S298A/E333A/K334A; whereas S298A/E333A/K334A improves Fc binding to V158 and F158 FcγRIIIa by 1.7-fold and 4.7-fold respectively, I332E shows binding enhancements of 2.2-fold and 10.1-fold respectively, and V264I/I332E shows binding enhancements of 4.0-fold and 14-fold respectively. Also worth noting is that the affinity of V264I/I332E for F158 FcγRIIIa (52 nM) is better than that of WT for the V158 allotype (68 nM), suggesting that this Fc variant, as well as those with even greater improvements in binding, may enable the clinical efficacy of antibodies for the low responsive patient population to achieve that currently possible for high responders.

ADCC was measured using the DELFIA® EuTDA-based cytotoxicity assay (Perkin Elmer, Mass.) with purified human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) as effector cells. Target cells were loaded with BATDA at 1×10\n6 \ncells/ml, washed 4 times and seeded into 96-well plate at 10,000 cells/well. The target cells were then opsonized using Fc variant or WT antibodies at the indicated final concentration. Human PBMCs were added at the indicated fold-excess of target cells and the plate was incubated at 37° C. for 4 hrs. The co-cultured cells were centrifuged at 500×g, supernatants were transferred to a separate plate and incubated with Eu solution, and relative fluorescence units were measured using a Packard Fusion™ reader (Packard Biosciences, Ill.). Samples were run in triplicate to provide error estimates (n=3, +/−S.D.). PBMCs were allotyped for the V158 or F158 FcγRIIIa allotype using PCR.\n\n\nADCC assays were run on Fc variant and WT alemtuzumab using DoHH-2 lymphoma target cells. \nFIG. 24\n \na \nis a bar graph showing the ADCC of these proteins at 10 ng/ml antibody. Results show that alemtuzumab Fc variants I332E, V264I, and I332E/V264I have substantially enhanced ADCC compared to WT alemtuzumab, with the relative ADCC enhancements proportional to their binding improvements to FcγRIIIa as indicated by AlphaScreen™ assay and SPR. The dose dependence of ADCC on antibody concentration is shown in \nFIG. 24\n \nb\n. These data were normalized to the minimum and maximum fluorescence signal provided by the baselines at low and high concentrations of antibody respectively. The data were fit to a sigmoidal dose-response model using nonlinear regression, represented by the curve in the figure. The fits enable determination of the \neffective concentration\n 50% (EC50) (i.e. the concentration required for 50% effectiveness), which provides the relative enhancements to ADCC for each Fc variant. The EC50s for these binding data are analogous to the IC50s obtained from the AlphaScreen™ competition data, and derivation of these values is thus analogous to that described in Example 2 and \nFIG. 11\n. In \nFIG. 24\n \nb\n, the log(EC50)s, obtained from the fits to the data, for WT, V264I/I332E, and S239D/I332E alemtuzumab are 0.99, 0.60, and 0.49 respectively, and therefore their respective EC50s are 9.9, 4.0, and 3.0. Thus V264I/I332E and S239E/I332E provide a 2.5-fold and 3.3-fold enhancement respectively in ADCC over WT alemtuzumab using PBMCs expressing heterozygous V158/F158 FcγRIIIa. These data are summarized in Table 63 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlog\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(EC50)\n\n\nEC50 (ng/ml)\n\n\nFold Improvement Over WT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT\n\n\n0.99\n\n\n9.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV264I/I332E\n\n\n0.60\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS239D/I332E\n\n\n0.49\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to determine whether these ADCC enhancements are broadly applicable to antibodies, select Fc variants were evaluated in the context of rituximab and trastuzumab. ADCC assays were run on V264I/I332E, WT, and S298A/D333A/K334A rituximab using WIL2-S lymphoma target cells. \nFIG. 25\n \na \npresents a bar graph showing the ADCC of these proteins at 1 ng/ml antibody. Results indicate that V264I/I332E rituximab provides substantially enhanced ADCC relative to WT rituximab, as well as superior ADCC to S29BA/D333A/K334A, consistent with the FcγRIIIa binding improvements observed by AlphaScreen™ assay and SPR. \nFIG. 25\n \nb \nshows the dose dependence of ADCC on antibody concentration. The EC50s obtained from the fits of these data and the relative fold-improvements in ADCC are provided in Table 64 below. As can be seen V264I/I332E rituximab provides an 11.3-fold enhancement in EC50 over WT for PBMCs expressing homozygous F158/F158 FcγRIIIa. The greater improvements observed for rituximab versus alemtuzumab are likely due to the use of homozygous F158/F158 FcγRIIIa rather than heterozygous V158/F158 FcγRIIIa PBMCs, as well as potentially the use of different antibodies and target cell lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlog\n\n\n \n\n\nFold Improvement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(EC50)\n\n\nEC50 (ng/ml)\n\n\nOver WT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT\n\n\n0.23\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nS298A/E333A/K334A\n\n\n−0.44\n\n\n0.37\n\n\n4.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV264I/I332E\n\n\n−0.83\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n11.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADCC assays were run on Fc variant and WT trastuzumab using two breast carcinoma target cell lines BT474 and Sk-Br-3. \nFIG. 26\n \na \nshows a bar graph illustrating ADCC at 1 ng/ml antibody.

The AlphaScreen™ assay was used to measure binding of select Fc variants to the complement protein C1q. The assay was carried out with biotinylated WT alemtuzumab antibody attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2, and using C1q coupled directly to acceptor beads. Binding data of select Fc variants shown in \nFIG. 27\n \na \nindicate that C1q binding is uncompromised. Cell-based CDC assays were also performed on select Fc variants to investigate whether Fc variants maintain the capacity to activate complement. Amar Blue was used to monitor lysis of Fc variant and WT rituximab-opsonized WIL2-S lymphoma cells by human serum complement (Quidel, San Diego, Calif.). The results shown in \nFIG. 27\n \nb \nfor select Fc variants indicate that CDC is uncompromised.\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nProtein A Binding by Fc Variants\n\n\nAs discussed, bacterial protein A binds to the Fc region between the Cγ2 and Cγ3 domains, and is frequently employed for antibody purification. The AlphaScreen™ assay was used to measure binding of select Fc variants to the protein A using biotinylated WT alemtuzumab antibody attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2, and using protein A coupled directly to acceptor beads. The binding data shown in \nFIG. 28\n for select Fc variants indicate that the capacity of the Fc variants to bind protein A is uncompromised. These results suggest that affinity of the Fc variants for other Fc ligands that bind the same site on Fc as protein A, such as the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn and protein G, are also unaffected.\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\nCapacity of Fc Variants to Bind Mouse FcγRs\n\n\nOptimization of Fc to nonhuman FcγRs may be useful for experimentally testing Fc variants in animal models. For example, when tested in mice (for example nude mice, SCID mice, xenograft mice, and/or transgenic mice), antibodies and Fc fusions that comprise Fc variants that are optimized for one or more mouse FcγRs may provide valuable information with regard to efficacy, mechanism of action, and the like. In order to evaluate whether the Fc variants of the present invention may be useful in such experiments, affinity of select Fc variants for mouse FcγRIII was measured using the AlphaScreen™ assay. The AlphaScreen™ assay was carried out using biotinylated WT alemtuzumab attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2, and GST-tagged mouse FcγRIII bound to glutathione chelate acceptor beads, expressed and purified as described in Example 2. These binding data are shown in \nFIG. 29\n. Results show that some Fc variants that enhance binding to human FcγRIIa also enhance binding to mouse FcγRIII. This result indicates that the Fc variants of the present invention, or other Fc variants that are optimized for nonhuman FcγRs, may find use in experiments that use animal models.\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\nValidation of Fc Variants Expressed in CHO Cells\n\n\nWhereas the Fc variants of the present invention were expressed in 293T cells for screening purposes, large scale production of antibodies is typically carried out by expression in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines. In order to evaluate the properties of CHO-expressed Fc variants, select Fc variants and WT alemtuzumab were expressed in CHO cells and purified as described in Example 2. \nFIG. 30\n shows AlphaScreenTs data comparing binding of CHO- and 293T-expressed Fc variant and WT alemtuzumab to human V158 FcγRIIIa. The results indicate that the Fc variants of the present invention show comparable FcγR binding enhancements whether expressed in 293T or CHO.\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\nTherapeutic Application of Fc Variants\n\n\nA number of Fc variants described in the present invention have significant potential for improving the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer antibodies. For illustration purposes, a number of Fc variants of the present invention have been incorporated into the sequence of the antibody rituximab. The WT rituximab light chain and heavy chain, described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,137, are provided in \nFIGS. 31\n \na \n(SEQ ID NO. 3) and \n32\n \nb \n(SEQ ID NO:4). The improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences are provided in \nFIG. 31\n \nc\n. (SEQ ID NO: 5) The improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences comprise at least non-WT amino acid selected from the group consisting of X\n1\n, X\n2\n, X\n3\n, X\n4\n, X\n5\n, and X\n6\n. These improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences may also comprise a substitution Z\n1\n. The use of rituximab here is solely an example, and is not meant to constrain application of the Fc variants to this antibody or any other particular antibody or Fc fusion.\n\n\nAll references are herein expressly incorporated by reference.\n\n\nWhereas particular embodiments of the invention have been described above for purposes of illustration, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that numerous variations of the details may be made without departing from the invention as described in the appended claims."

Description\n\n\n\n\nThis application is entitled to priority pursuant to U.S.C. 35 §119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/015,869, filed Dec. 21, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nThis invention relates to binding members for interleukin (IL)-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα, also referred to as CD 124), especially antibody molecules, and their therapeutic use e.g. in treating or preventing disorders associated with IL-4Rα, IL-4 and/or IL-13, examples of which are asthma and COPD.\n\n\nThe human IL-4Rα subunit (Swiss Prot accession number P24394) is a 140 \nkDa type\n 1 membrane protein that binds human IL-4 with a high affinity (Andrews et al J. Biol. Chem. (2002) 277:46073-46078). The IL-4/IL-4Rα complex can dimerize with either the common gamma chain (γc, CD132) or the IL-13Ralpha1 (IL-13Rα1) subunit, via domains on IL-4, to create two different signalling complexes, commonly referred to as Type I and Type II receptors, respectively. Alternatively, IL-13 can bind IL-13Rα1 to form an IL-13/IL-13Rα1 complex that recruits the IL-4Rα subunit to form a Type II receptor complex. Thus, IL-4Rα mediates the biological activities of both IL-4 and IL-13 (reviewed by Gessner et al, Immunobiology, 201:285, 2000). In vitro studies have shown that IL-4 and IL-13 activate effector functions in a number of cell types, for example in T cells, B cells, eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, airway smooth muscle cells, respiratory epithelial cells, lung fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (reviewed by Steinke et al, Resp Res, 2:66, 2001, and by Willis-Karp, Immunol Rev, 202:175, 2004).\n\n\nIL-4Rα is expressed in low numbers (100-5000 molecules/cell) on a variety of cell types (Lowenthal et al, J Immunol, 140:456, 1988), e.g. peripheral blood T cells, monocytes, airway epithelial cells, B cells and lung fibroblasts. The type I receptor predominates in hematopoietic cells, whereas the type II receptor is expressed on both hematopoietic cells and non-hematopoietic cells.\n\n\nIL-4Rα polymorphisms in the human population have been described (reviewed by Gessner et al, Immunobiology, 201:285, 2000) and association with IgE levels or clinical atopy has been reported in some populations. For instance, V75R576 IL-4Rα is associated with allergic asthma and enhanced IL-4Rα function (Risma et al. J. Immunol. 169(3):1604-1610, 2002).\n\n\nSeveral lines of evidence support an important role for the IL-4/IL-13 pathway in asthma pathology (reviewed by Chatila, Trends in Molecular Med, 10:493, 2004), and also in a range of other conditions, as listed elsewhere herein. Increased secretion of IL-4 and IL-13 are believed to both initiate and maintain the disease process. IL-13 is thought to be the dominant partner in triggering airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), mucus hypersecretion and airway remodelling, whereas IL-4 is has been suggested to be the main inducer of Th2 polarisation and IgE production (Wynn, Annu Rev Immunol, 21: 425, 2003).\n\n\nThe role of IL-4Rα in asthma is further supported by evidence from animal models of disease. Administration of a functional murine IL-4R antagonist (IL-4 mutant; C118 deletion) during allergen challenge with ovalbumin (OVA, a model allergen) inhibited the development of allergic airway eosinophilia and AHR in mice previously sensitized with OVA (Tomkinson et al J. Immunol. 166(9):5792-5800, 2001). Furthermore, a number of in vivo studies have demonstrated positive effects of blocking either IL-13 or IL-4 in animal models of asthma. For instance, therapeutic dosing with an anti-IL-13 mAb in a chronic model of OVA-induced persistent airway inflammation inhibited AHR, halted progression of subepithelial fibrosis and inflammation and restored mucus hyperplasia to basal levels (Yang et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 313(1):8-15, 2005). In a mouse OVA model, inhibition of IL-4 by an anti-IL-4 antibody showed a marked reduction in eosinophil infiltration when administered during immunization (Coyle et al., Am J Resp Cell Mol Biol, 13:54, 1995). In a similar model, IL-4-deficient mice had substantially fewer eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage and much less peribronchial inflammation after OVA challenge (Brusselle et al., Clin Exp Allergy, 24:73, 1994).\n\n\nIn humans, phase IIa studies showed that an IL-4Rα antagonist (a so-called IL-4 mutein) reduced an allergen-induced late asthmatic response and attenuated the resting inflammatory status of the lungs in asthma patients (Wenzel et al., Lancet, 370:1422, 2007). These human data further strengthen the notion that an IL-4Rα antagonist may provide clinical utility in asthma.\n\n\nIn addition to its role in asthma, IL-4Rα has been linked with a number of other pathologies, e.g. as follows:\n\n\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) includes patient populations with varying degrees of chronic bronchitis, small airway disease and emphysema and is characterised by progressive irreversible lung function decline that responds poorly to current asthma based therapy. The underlying causes of COPD remain poorly understood. The “Dutch hypothesis” proposes that there is a common susceptibility to COPD and asthma and therefore, that similar mechanisms may contribute to the pathogenesis of both disorders (Sluiter et al., Eur Respir J, 4(4): p. 479-89, 1991). Zheng et al (J Clin Invest, 106(9):1081-93, 2000) have demonstrated that overexpression of IL-13 in the mouse lung caused emphysema, elevated mucus production and inflammation, reflecting aspects of human COPD. Furthermore, AHR, an IL-13 dependent response in murine models of allergic inflammation, has been shown to be predictive of lung function decline in smokers (Tashkin et al., Am J Respir Crit. Care Med, 153(6 Pt 1):1802-11, 1996). A link has also been established between an IL-13 promoter polymorphism and susceptibility to develop COPD (Van Der Pouw Kraan et al., Genes Immun, 3(7): 436-9, 2002). The signs are therefore that IL-4/IL-13 pathway, and in particular IL-13, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of COPD.\n\n\nIL-13 may play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Heller et al. (Heller et al., Immunity, 17(5):629-38, 2002) report that neutralisation of IL-13 by administration of soluble IL-13R.alpha.2 ameliorated colonic inflammation in a murine model of human ulcerative colitis. Correspondingly, IL-13 expression was higher in rectal biopsy specimens from ulcerative colitis patients when compared to controls (Inoue et al., Am J Gastroenterol, 94(9):2441-6, 1999).\n\n\nIn addition to asthma, the IL-4/Il-13 pathway has been linked to other fibrotic conditions, like systemic sclerosis (Hasegawa et al., J Rheumatol, 24(2):328-32, 1997), pulmonary fibrosis (Hancock et al., Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol, 18(1): 60-5, 1998), parasite-induced liver fibrosis (Fallon et al., J Immunol, 164(5): 2585-91, 2000; Chiaramonte et al, J Clin Invest, 104(6): 777-85, 1999; Chiaramonte Hepatology 34(2):273-82, 2001), and cystic fibrosis (Hauber et al., J. Cyst Fibr, 2:189, 2003).\n\n\nIL-4 and to some extent IL-13, are crucial for B cell mediated activities, such as B cell proliferation, immunoglobulin secretion, and expression of FcepsilonR. Clinical applications of an IL-4Rα inhibitor include for example, use in allergy therapy to suppress IgE synthesis (including for example atopic dermatitis and food allergy), use in transplation therapy to prevent transplant rejection, as well as suppression of delayed-type hypersensitivity or contact hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n\nIl-4R antagonists may also find use as adjuvants to allergy immunotherapy and as vaccine adjuvants.\n\n\nAntibodies to IL-4Rα have been described. Two examples are the neutralizing murine anti-IL-4Rα monoclonal antibodies MAB230 (clone 25463) and 16146 (clone 25463.11) which are supplied by R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn.) and Sigma (St Louis, Mo.), respectively. These antibodies are of the IgG2a subtype and were developed from mouse hybridomas developed from mice immunised with purified recombinant human IL-4Rα (baculovirus-derived). Two further neutralizing murine anti-IL-4Rα antibodies M57 and X2/45-12 are supplied by BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, N.J.) and eBioscience (San Diego, Calif.), respectively. These are IgG1 antibodies and are also produced by mouse hybridomas developed from mice immunized with recombinant soluble IL-4Rα.\n\n\nFully human antibodies are likely to be of better clinical utility than murine or chimeric antibodies. This is because human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) directed against the FC part of the mouse immunoglobulin are often produced, resulting in rapid clearance and possible anaphylactic reaction (Brochier et al., Int. J. Immunopharm., 17:41-48, 1995). Although chimeric antibodies (mouse variable regions and human constant regions) are less immunogenic than murine mAbs, human anti-Chimeric antibody (HACA) responses have been reported (Bell and Kamm, Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther., 14:501-514, 2000).\n\n\nWO 01/92340 (Immunex) describes human monoclonal antibodies against IL-4 receptor generated by procedures involving immunization of transgenic mice with soluble IL-4R peptide and the creation of hybridoma cell lines that secrete antibodies to IL-4R, the principal antibody 12B5 is disclosed as being an IgG1 antibody and fully human. WO 05/047331 (Immunex) discloses further antibodies derived from 12B5 (renamed H1L1) via oligonucleotide mutagenesis of the VH region. Each mutated VH chain was paired with one of 6 distinct VL chains to create a small repertoire of antibody molecules.\n\n\nWO 07/082,068 (Aerovance) discloses a method of treating asthma comprising administering a mutant human IL-4 protein having substitutions of R121D and Y124D. The specification teaches that such IL4 mutein administered in a pharmaceutical composition can antagonise the binding of wild type huIL-4 and wild type huIL-13 to receptors.\n\n\n \nWO\n 08/054,606 (Regeneron) discloses particular antibodies against human IL-4R that were raised in transgenic mice capable of producing human antibodies.\n\n\nThere are advantages and benefits in the discovery and development of an antibody to human IL-4Rα that also exhibits cross-reactivity to the orthologous protein from another species, for example cynomolgus monkey. Such an antibody would facilitate the characterization of such antibodies with respect to pharmacology and safety in vivo. Potency or affinity to another species, which is for example less than 10-fold different than the human activity may be appropriate for such an evaluation. However, the human IL-4Rα protein displays a relatively little similarity to the orthologous IL-4Rα protein from other species except chimpanzee. Therefore, the discovery of high affinity and potency antibodies appropriate for clinical use with cross-reactivity to a species widely considered suitable for safety and toxicological evaluation for clinical development would be very challenging.\n\n\nThrough appropriately designed selection techniques and assays, the inventors have developed binding members for IL-4Rα that inhibit the biological activity of human and cynomolgus monkey IL-4Rα.\n\n\nAs detailed in the Examples, from an initial lead identification program the inventors selected a single antibody molecule to human IL-4Rα that also exhibited some, but weak, binding to and functional neutralisation of, cynomolgus IL-4Rα. Following a planned and defined process of targeted and random mutagenesis and further selection of mutants from this parent antibody molecule, a larger panel of antibody molecules with greatly improved properties was developed. VH and VL regions, including the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the parent antibody (Antibody 1), and of the optimised antibodies, are shown in \nFIGS. 1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n and \n4\n. These antibody molecules, VH, VL, CDRs, and binding members comprising one or more of the CDRs, form aspects of the present invention.\n\n\nIn addition to wild-type IL-4Rα the binding members of the present invention have also been found to bind 175V IL-4Rα, a common human variant.\n\n\nDescribed herein are binding members that neutralise the biological effects of IL-4Rα with high potency, bind IL-4Rα with high affinity and inhibit signalling induced by IL-4 and IL-13. Notably, the binding members inhibit signalling from the high affinity complexes e.g. IL-4:IL-4Rα:γc, IL-4:IL-4Rα:IL-13Rα1, IL-13 IL-13Rα1:IL-4Rα. Such action prevents signalling of both IL-4 and IL-13. Additionally, the data indicate that the binding members inhibit interaction and signalling of IL-\n4Rα type\n 1 and \ntype\n 2 complexes. These and other properties and effects of the binding members are described in further detail below.\n\n\nThe binding members are useful for treating disorders in which IL-4Rα, IL-4 or IL-13 are expressed, e.g., one or more of the IL-4Rα-, IL-4- or IL-13-related disorders referred to elsewhere herein, such as asthma or COPD.\n\n\nAs described elsewhere herein, binding of a binding member to IL-4Rα may be determined using surface plasmon resonance e.g. BIAcore.\n\n\nSurface plasmon resonance data may be fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model (simultaneous ka kd) and an affinity constant KD calculated from the ratio of rate constants kd1/ka1. A binding member of the invention may have a monovalent affinity for binding human IL-4Rα that is less than 20 nM. In other embodiments the monovalent affinity for binding human IL-4Rα that is less than 10 nM, e.g. less than 8, less than 5 nM. In other embodiments the binding member also binds cynomolgus IL-4Rα. In one embodiment, a binding member of the present invention has a monovalent affinity for binding human IL-4Rα in the range 0.05 to 12 nM. In one embodiment, a binding member of the present invention has a monovalent affinity for binding human IL-4Rα in the range of 0.1 to 5 nM. In one embodiment, a binding member of the present invention has a monovalent affinity for binding human IL-4Rα in the range of 0.1 to 2 nM.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding member of the invention may immunospecifically bind to human IL-4Rα and may have an affinity (KD) of less than 5000 pM, less than 4000 pM, less than 3000 pM, less than 2500 pM, less than 2000 pM, less than 1500 pM, less than 1000 pM, less than 750 pM, less than 500 pM, less than 250 pM, less than 200 pM, less than 150 pM, less than 100 pM, less than 75 pM as assessed using a method described herein or known to one of skill in the art (e.g., a BIAcore assay, ELISA) (Biacore International AB, Uppsala, Sweden).\n\n\nIn a specific embodiment, a binding member of the invention may immunospecifically bind to human IL-4Rα and may have an affinity (KD) of between 25 to 5000 pM, 25 to 4000 pM, 25 to 3500 pM, 25 to 3000 pM, 25 to 2500 pM, 25 to 2000 pM, 25 to 1500 pM, 25 to 1000 pM, 25 to 750 pM, 25 to 500 pM, 25 to 250 pM, 25 to 100 pM, 25 to 75 pM, 25 to 50 pM as assessed using a method described herein or known to one of skill in the art (e.g., a BIAcore assay, ELISA). In another embodiment, an anti-IL-4Rα binding member (including an antibody) of the invention may immunospecifically bind to bind to human IL-4Rα and may have an affinity (KD) of 500 pM, 100 pM, 75 pM or 50 pM as assessed using a method described herein or known to one of skill in the art (e.g., a BIAcore assay, ELISA).\n\n\nAs described in more detail in the Examples, binding members according to the invention neutralise IL-4Rα with high potency. Neutralisation means inhibition of a biological activity mediated by IL-4Rα. Binding members of the invention may neutralise one or more activities mediated by IL-4Rα. The inhibited biological activity is likely mediated by prevention of IL-4Rα forming a signalling complex with gamma chain (or IL-13Rα) and either of the associated soluble ligands, e.g. IL-4 or IL-13.\n\n\nNeutralisation of IL-4 or IL-13 signalling through its IL-4Rα containing receptor complex may be measured by inhibition of IL-4 or IL-13 stimulated TF-1 cell proliferation.\n\n\nThe epitope of human IL4Rα to which the antibodies of the invention bind was located by a combination of mutagenesis and domain swapping. Whole domain swap chimeras localised the epitope to domain 1 (D1) of human IL4Rα (residues M1-E119). Human IL-4Rα contains five loop regions, which are in close proximity to IL4 in a crystal structure (Hage et al., \nCell \n97:271-281, 1999). Loop swap chimeras enabled the further localisation of the human IL-4Rα epitope bound by an antibody of the invention, to a major component in loop 3 (residues L89-N98) and a minor component in loop 2 (residues V65-H72). Chimeras without \nhuman loop\n 3 failed to inhibit human IL-4Rα binding to antibody and chimeras without \nloop\n 2 gave a 100 fold higher IC\n50 \nthan human IL-4Rα (Table 5). Consistent with the domain swap data both loop2 and loop3 are located in domain 1 (D1) (Hage et al., \nCell \n97:271-281, 1999).\n\n\nThe antibody epitope was located to a discontinuous epitope of 18 amino acids in two loop regions of human IL-4Rα; V65-H72 and L89-N98. The epitope can be further localised to amino acid residues L67 and L68 of \nloop\n 2 and D92 and V93 of loop3 (see SEQ ID NO: 454 or 460 for location of \n \n \nresidues\n \n \n 67, 68, 92 and 93). The D92 residues was the most important, followed by V93, for the antibody tested was still capable of binding chimeric IL-4Rα that lacked the L67 and/or L68 residues in loop2. Of course it is likely that the antibodies of the invention will also bind residues of the human IL-4Rα protein in addition to one of L67, L68, D92 and V93.\n\n\nAccording to one aspect of the invention there is provided an isolated binding member capable of binding to human interleukin-4 receptor alpha (hIL-4Rα) at least one amino acid residue selected from the amino acid at \n \n \n \nposition\n \n \n \n 67, 68, 92 and 93, according to the position in SEQ ID NO: 460. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided an isolated binding member capable of binding to at least one of \n \n \n \namino acid residues\n \n \n \n 67, 68, 92 and 93, according to the position in SEQ ID NO: 460, of native human interleukin-4 receptor alpha (hIL-4Rα). In a particular embodiment the isolated binding member is capable of binding to the amino acid at \nposition\n 92 of hIL-4Rα, according to the position in SEQ ID NO: 460. In another embodiment the isolated binding member is capable of binding to D92 and at least one other residue selected from L67, L68 and V93. In another embodiment the isolated binding member is capable of binding to D92 and V93. In another embodiment the isolated binding member is capable of binding to D92, V93 and either of L67 or L68. In another embodiment the antibody is capable of binding to each of L67, L68, D92 and V93. Each of these embodiments refers to amino acid positions in hIL-4Rα whose locations can be identified according to the hIL-4Rα amino acid sequence (from positions 1-229) depicted in SEQ ID NO: 460. In one embodiment the binding member is able to bind to the recited epitope residues (i.e. at least one of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 67, 68, 92 and 93) of full-length hIL-4Rα. In one embodiment the binding member is able to bind to the recited epitope residues (i.e. at least one of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 67, 68, 92 and 93) of native hIL-4Rα expressed on the cell surface. In one embodiment the binding member is able to bind to the recited epitope residues (i.e. at least one of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 67, 68, 92 and 93) of recombinantly expressed full-length (229 amino acid) hIL-4Rα.\n\n\nAccording to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an isolated binding member capable of binding human interleukin-4 receptor alpha (hIL-4Rα). In a particular embodiment the binding member is a human antibody. In a further embodiment the binding member is also capable of binding cynomolgus monkey interleukin-4 receptor alpha (cyIL-4Rα).\n\n\nAccording to another aspect of the invention there is provided an isolated binding member for human interleukin-4 receptor alpha (hIL-4Rα), which binding member has an IC\n50 \ngeomean for inhibition of human IL-4 (hIL-4) induced cell proliferation of less than 50 pM in TF-1 proliferation assay using 18 pM soluble human IL-4 protein and which binding member is also capable of binding cyIL-4Rα.\n\n\nIn particular embodiments of this aspect of the invention the binding member has an IC\n50 \ngeomean for inhibition of human IL-4 (hIL-4) induced cell proliferation of less than 50 pM, less than 35 pM, less than 25 pM, or less than 20 pM, in a TF-1 proliferation assay using 18 pM of soluble human IL-4. In particular embodiments the binding member of the invention has an IC\n50 \ngeomean for inhibition of human IL-4 (hIL-4) induced cell proliferation of between 1 to 50 pM, 1 to 35 pM, 2 to 30 pM, 2 to 25 pM, 2 to 12 pM, using 18 pM of soluble human IL-4 in a method described herein (e.g. Example 3.2.1) or known to one of skill in the art.\n\n\nBinding to cyIL-4Rα can be measured by any suitable means.\n\n\nSimilarly, binding members within the scope of the invention have an IC\n50 \ngeomean for inhibition of human IL-13 (hIL-13)-mediated TF-1 proliferation (via neutralisation of hIL-4Rα) of less than 200 pM using 400 pM soluble human IL-13 (hIL-13). In a particular embodiment the IC\n50 \ngeomean for inhibition of human IL-13 (hIL-13)-mediated TF-1 proliferation (via neutralisation of hIL-4Rα) using 400 pM soluble human IL-13 (hIL-13) is between 5 and 75 pM or between 5 and 45 pM.\n\n\nIn particular embodiments, the binding members of the invention are substantially incapable of binding to murine IL-4Rα. By this we mean that a binding member of the invention is capable of at least 500-fold (such as at least 500-fold, at least 1000-fold, at least 1500-fold, at least 2000-fold, at least 3000-fold, at least 4000-fold) greater binding to human interleukin-4 receptor alpha than to murine IL-4Rα (i.e. binding to murine IL-4Rα is at least 500 fold weaker than to human IL-4Rα). This can be measured, for example, by the HTRF competition assay as disclosed in Example 5.1.2.\n\n\nGeomean (also known as geometric mean), as used herein means the average of the logarithmic values of a data set, converted back to a base 10 number. This requires there to be at least two measurements, e.g. at least 2, preferably at least 5, more preferably at least 10 replicate. The person skilled in the art will appreciate that the greater the number of replicates the more robust the geomean value will be. The choice of replicate number can be left to the discretion of the person skilled in the art.\n\n\nInhibition of biological activity may be partial or total. In specific embodiments, binding members are provided that inhibit IL-4Rα biological activity by at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, or at least 50% of the activity in the absence of the binding member. The degree to which a binding member neutralises IL-4Rα is referred to as its neutralising potency. Potency may be determined or measured using one or more assays known to the skilled person and/or as described or referred to herein. For example, potency may be assayed in:\n\n \n \n \n \nReceptor-ligand binding assays in fluorescent (e.g. HTRF or DELFIA) or radioactive format\n \nFluorescent (e.g. HTRF or DELFIA) epitope competition assay\n \nCell-based functional assays including STAT6 Phosphorylation of human or cynomolgous PBMCs, proliferation of TF-1 cells, eotaxin release from human or cynomolgous fibroblast cell lines, VCAM-1 upregulation on human endothelial vein cells or proliferation of human T-cells.\n \n \n \n\n\nSome of these assays methods are also described in the Examples.\n\n\nNeutralising potency of a binding member as calculated in an assay using IL-4Rα from a first species (e.g. human) may be compared with neutralising potency of the binding member in the same assay using IL-4Rα from a second species (e.g. cynomolgus monkey), in order to assess the extent of cross-reactivity of the binding member for IL-4Rα of the two species. There are great advantages in having a binding member, e.g. an antibody or antibody fragment, which binds both the human target and the orthologous target from another species. A key advantage arises when the binding-member is being advanced as a therapeutic product and safety studies (e.g. toxicity) need to be conducted in another species. Potency or affinity to another species, which is for example less than 10-fold different than the human activity may be appropriate for such an evaluation.\n\n\nThere are various ways of determining the ratio of binding of the binding members of the present invention to the human and the “other species”′ (e.g. cynomologus monkey) IL-4Rα. One method is the receptor-ligand binding assay, such as that used in Example 4.3.\n\n\nAccording to a particular embodiment of the binding members of the present invention the ratio of binding of the binding member when as a scFv to hIL-4Rα and to cyIL-4Rα measured using the receptor-ligand binding assay is at least 6:1. As used here, “at least” 6:1, includes 8:1, 10:1 etc; rather than 2:1, 1:1.\n\n\nBinding members of the invention bind human IL-4Rα and cynomolgus monkey IL-4Rα, and may have a less than 250-fold, e.g. less than 150-, 100-, 75-, 50-, 25-, 20-, 15-, 10-fold difference in potency for neutralising human and cynomolgus IL-4Rα as determined in the receptor-ligand binding assay, with the binding member being in scFv format, as in Example 4.3.\n\n\nFor example, the data herein indicate that Antibody nos: 2, 4-8, 12, 16, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 32, 33, 34, 37 and 37GL, for example, have a less than or equal to 25-fold difference in potency for neutralising human and cynomolgus IL-4Rα respectively, when in scFv format in the receptor-ligand binding assay described herein. Data are presented in Example 4.3 and Table 1. Thus, in some embodiments, neutralisation potency of binding members of the invention (when in scFv format) for human and cynomolgus IL-4Rα measured using the receptor-ligand binding assay is within 25-fold. Particular examples of antibodies described herein that exhibit less than or equal to 10-fold neutralisation potency for human and cynomolgus IL-4Rα include \n \n \n \n \nAntibody nos\n \n \n \n \n 2, 4, 5, 20 and 22. In one embodiment the neutralisation potency of binding members of the invention for human and cynomolgus IL-4Rα is within 210-fold; i.e binding to human IL-4Rα is no greater than 210-fold that against cynomologous IL-4Rα. In another embodiment, said neutralisation potency is between 5:1 and 210:1, such as between 5:1 and 100:1.\n\n\nFor functional cell-based assays potency is normally expressed as an IC\n50 \nvalue, in nM unless otherwise stated. In functional assays, IC\n50 \nis the molar concentration of a binding member that reduces a biological (or biochemical) response by 50% of its maximum. IC\n50 \nmay be calculated by plotting % of maximal biological response as a function of the log of the binding member concentration, and using a software program such as Prism (GraphPad) or Origin (Origin Labs) to fit a sigmoidal function to the data to generate IC\n50 \nvalues.\n\n\nFor receptor-ligand binding assays, potency is normally expressed as Ki (the inhibition constant), the concentration of binding member that would occupy 50% of receptors if no labelled ligand were present. Whereas IC\n50 \nmay vary between experiments depending on ligand concentration, the Ki is an absolute value calculated from the Cheng Prusoff equation.\n\n\nA binding member of the invention may have a neutralising potency or Ki of up to 5 nM in a human IL-4RαHTRF® assay as described herein. This assay can be used to determine Ki for binding members in scFv format. The Ki may for example be up to 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, or 0.02 nM. Examples of Ki data are presented in Example 4.3 (see Table 1), wherein a final concentration of 0.125 nM human IL-4Rα and 2 nM IL-4 is used in the HTRF® receptor-ligand binding assay and a detailed method is provided.\n\n\nAdditionally, binding kinetics and affinity (expressed as the equilibrium dissociation constant, KD) of IL-4Rα binding members for IL-4Rα may be determined, e.g. using surface plasmon resonance such as BIAcore®, or Kd may be estimated from pA\n2 \nanalysis.\n\n\nSurface plasmon resonance is a well-established technique for determining affinity of a binding member for a target. It involves passing an analyte in fluid phase over a ligand attached to a support, and determining binding between analyte and ligand. Surface plasmon resonance may for example be performed whereby recombinant IL-4Rα is passed in fluid phase over a binding member attached to a support. Surface plasmon resonance data may be fitted to a bivalent analyte data model or a monovalent analyte data model. As shown in the Examples herein, a monovalent analyte data model was found to be particularly appropriate for determining affinity of binding members to IL-4Rα. An affinity constant Kd may be calculated from the ratio of rate constants kd1/ka1 as determined by surface plasmon resonance using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model.\n\n\nExamples of estimated KD values for binding IL-4Rα calculated using surface plasmon resonance are presented in Example 4.7 (see Table 4). These data demonstrate good binding properties of Antibody 37GL for recombinantly produced human and cynomolgus IL-4Rα. Binding to IL-4Rα from HEK-EBNA cells demonstrates that the antibody binds native glycosylated human IL-4Rα. Because Antibody 37GL binds to the native glycosylated human IL-4Rα form allows one to predict that all of antibodies described herein (\ne.g. Antibodies\n 1 to 42) are able to bind native glycosylated human IL-4Rα, given that all these antibodies were derived from a single parent antibody (Antibody 1) and are thus believed to all bind the same or highly similar epitope of IL-4Rα.\n\n\nThus, according to particular embodiments, the binding members of the invention are capable of binding to glycosylated hIL-4Rα.\n\n\nAs illustrated in Example 4.7 and Table 4, a good cross-reactivity in binding human and cynomolgus IL-4Rα was determined by surface plasmon resonance for a representative panel of antibodies derived from \nAntibody\n 1.\n\n\nBinding members of the invention may optionally be specific for IL-4Rα over other structurally related molecules (e.g. other interleukin receptors) and thus bind IL-4Rα selectively. For example, binding members of the invention may not cross-react with any of IL-13Rα1 or IL-13Rα2 and the common gamma chain (γc). This may be determined or demonstrated, for example, in a DELFIA® epitope competition assay as exemplified in Example 4.6.\n\n\nA binding member of the invention may comprise an antibody molecule, e.g. a human antibody molecule. The binding member comprises an antibody VH and/or VL domain. VH domains of binding members are also provided as part of the invention. Within each of the VH and VL domains are complementarity determining regions, (“CDRs”), and framework regions, (“FRs”). A VH domain comprises a set of HCDRs, and a VL domain comprises a set of LCDRs. An antibody molecule may comprise an antibody VH domain comprising a VH CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 and a framework. It may alternatively or also comprise an antibody VL domain comprising a VL CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 and a framework. A VH or VL domain framework comprises four framework regions, FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4, interspersed with CDRs in the following structure:\n\n \n \n \n \nFR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4.\n\n\nExamples of antibody VH and VL domains, FRs and CDRs according to the present invention are as listed in the appended sequence listing that forms part of the present disclosure. All VH and VL sequences, CDR sequences, sets of CDRs and sets of HCDRs and sets of LCDRs disclosed herein represent aspects and embodiments of the invention. As described herein, a “set of CDRs” comprises CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3. Thus, a set of HCDRs refers to HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3, and a set of LCDRs refers to LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3. Unless otherwise stated, a “full set of CDRs” includes HCDRs and LCDRs. Typically, binding members of the invention are monoclonal antibodies.\n\n \n \n \n\n\nA further aspect of the invention is an antibody molecule comprising a VH domain that has at least 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98 or 99% amino acid sequence identity with a VH domain of any of \nAntibodies\n 1 to 42 shown in the appended sequence listing, and/or comprising a VL domain that has at least 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98 or 99% amino acid sequence identity with a VL domain of any of \nAntibodies\n 1 to 42 shown in the appended sequence listing. Accelerys' “MacVector™” program may be used to calculate % identity of two amino acid sequences.\n\n\nA binding member of the invention may comprise an antigen-binding site within a non-antibody molecule, normally provided by one or more CDRs e.g. an HCDR3 and/or LCDR3, or a set of CDRs, in a non-antibody protein scaffold, as discussed further below.\n\n\nAs described in more detail in the Experimental Section, the inventors isolated a parent antibody molecule (Antibody 1) with a set of CDR sequences as shown in \nFIGS. 1\n (VH domain) and \n2\n (VL domain). Through a process of optimisation they generated a panel of antibody clones, including those numbered 2 to 20, with CDR3 sequences derived from the parent CDR3 sequences and having substitutions at the positions indicated in \nFIG. 1\n (VH domain) and \nFIG. 2\n (VL domain). Thus for example, it can be seen from \nFIG. 1\n (A to D), that \nAntibody\n 2 has the parent HCDR1, HCDR2, LCDR1 and LCDR2 sequences, and has the parent LCDR3 sequence in which \nKabat residue\n 95 is replaced by Q, \n \n \nKabat residue\n \n \n 95A, 95B and 96 are each replaced by P and \nKabat residue\n 97 is replaced by L; and has parent HCDR3 sequence in which \nKabat residue\n 101 is replaced by Y and \nKabat residue\n 102 is replaced by N.\n\n\nThe parent antibody molecule, and \nAntibody molecules\n 2 to 20, as described herein refer respectively to antibody molecules with CDRs of the parent antibody molecule and to antibody molecules with CDRs of \nantibody molecules\n 2 to 20. Through a further process of optimisation the inventors generated a panel of antibody clones numbered 21-42, with additional substitutions throughout the VH and VL domains. Thus, for example, \nAntibody\n 21 has the same LCDR1, LCDR2, LCDR3, HCDR1, and HCDR3 as \nAntibody\n 20; it has the parent HCDR2 sequence of \nAntibody\n 20 but with Kabat residue 57 replaced by A; and it has \nKabat residues\n 85 and 87 (in LFW3) replaced by V and F, respectively.\n\n\nDescribed herein is a reference binding member comprising the \nAntibody\n 20 set of CDRs as shown in \nFIGS. 3\n (VH) and \n4\n (VL), in which HCDR1 is SEQ ID NO: 193 (Kabat residues 31-35), HCDR2 is SEQ ID NO: 194 (Kabat residues 50-65), HCDR3 is SEQ ID NO: 195 (Kabat residues 95-102), LCDR1 is SEQ ID NO: 198 (Kabat residues 24-34), LCDR2 is SEQ ID NO: 199 (Kabat residues 50-56) and LCDR3 is SEQ ID NO: 200 (Kabat residues 89-97). Further binding members can be described with reference to the sequence in the reference binding member.\n\n\nA binding member of the invention may comprise one or more CDRs (i.e. at least one, at least 2, at least 3, at least 4 at least 5 and at least 6) as described herein, e.g. a CDR3, and optionally also a CDR1 and CDR2 to form a set of CDRs. The CDR or set of CDRs may be a parent CDR or parent set of CDRs, or may be a CDR or set of CDRs of any of \nAntibodies\n 2 to 42, or may be a variant thereof as described herein.\n\n\nFor example, a binding member or a VL domain according to the invention may comprise the reference LCDR3 with one or more of Kabat residues 92-97 substituted for another amino acid. Exemplary substitutions include:\n\n\n \nKabat residue\n 92 replaced by Phe (F), Val (V) or Ala (A);\n\n\n \nKabat residue\n 93 replaced by Gly (G) or Ser (S);\n\n\n \nKabat residue\n 94 replaced by Thr (T)\n\n\n \nKabat residue\n 95 replaced by Leu (L), GLn (Q), Pro (P) or Ser (S);\n\n\nKabat residue 95a replaced by Ser (S), Prol (P), Ala (A), Thr (T), H is (H) or Gly (G);\n\n\nKabat residue 95b replaced by Ala (A), Pro (P), Ser (S), Tyr (Y), Met (M), Leu (L), Thr (T), Arg (R) or Asp (D);\n\n\nKabat residue 95c replaced by Asn (N), Gln (Q), H is (H), Tyr (Y), Thr (T), Ile (I), Lys (K), Arg (R) or Met (M);\n\n\n \nKabat residue\n 96 replaced by Tyr (Y) or Pro (P);\n\n\n \nKabat residue\n 97 replaced by Val (V), Leu (L) or Ile (I).\n\n\nA binding member or a VH domain may comprise the reference HCDR3 with one or more of Kabat residues 97-102 substituted for another amino acid. Exemplary substitutions include:\n\n\n \nKabat residue\n 97 replaced by Trp (W) or Leu (L);\n\n\n \nKabat residue\n 98 replaced by Leu (L);\n\n\n \nKabat residue\n 99 replaced by Leu (L), Lys (K), Phe (F) or Trp (W);\n\n\n \nKabat residue\n 101 replaced by Asp (D), Asn (N) or Gln (Q);\n\n\n \nKabat residue\n 102 replaced by Tyr (Y), Asn (N), Pro (P) or H is (H).\n\n\nBinding members of the invention may comprise an HCDR1, HCDR2 and/or HCDR3 of any of \nAntibodies\n 1 to 42 and/or an LCDR1, LCDR2 and/or LCDR3 of any of \nAntibodies\n 1 to 42, e.g. a set of CDRs of any of \nAntibodies\n 1 to 42 shown in \nFIG. 1\n or \n2\n. A binding member may comprise a set of VH CDRs of one of these antibodies. Optionally it may also comprise a set of VL CDRs of one of these antibodies, and the VL CDRs may be from the same or a different antibody as the VH CDRs. A VH domain comprising a set of HCDRs of any of \nAntibodies\n 1 to 42, and/or a VL domain comprising a set of LCDRs of any of \nAntibodies\n 1 to 42, are also individual embodiments of the invention.\n\n\nTypically, a VH domain is paired with a VL domain to provide an antibody antigen-binding site, although as discussed further below a VH or VL domain alone may be used to bind antigen. In one embodiment, the \nAntibody\n 1 VH domain is paired with the \nAntibody\n 1 VL domain, so that an antibody antigen-binding site is formed comprising both the \nAntibody\n 1 VH and VL domains. Analogous embodiments are provided for the other VH and VL domains disclosed herein. In other embodiments, the \nAntibody\n 1 VH is paired with a VL domain other than the \nantibody\n 1 VL. Light-chain promiscuity is well established in the art. Again, analogous embodiments are provided by the invention for the other VH and VL domains disclosed herein. Thus, the VH of the parent (Antibody 1) or of any of \nAntibodies\n 2 to 42 may be paired with the VL of the parent or of any of \nAntibodies\n 2 to 42.\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention is an antibody comprising a VH and VL domain wherein the VH domain comprises a sequence disclosed in \nFIG. 1\n or \n3\n.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention is an antibody comprising a VH and VL domain wherein the VL domain comprises a sequence disclosed in \nFIG. 2\n or \n4\n.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention is an isolated antibody molecule comprising a VH domain with the VH domain amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 362, 442, 232, 422 or 432 and a VL domain with the VL domain amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NOs: 367, 237, 447, 437 or 427\n\n\nA binding member may comprise a set of H and/or L CDRs of the parent antibody or any of \nAntibodies\n 2 to 42 with twelve or ten or nine or fewer, e.g. one, two, three, four or five, substitutions within the disclosed set of H and/or L CDRs. For example, a binding member of the invention may comprise the \nAntibody\n 16 or \nAntibody\n 20 set of H and/or L CDRs with 12 or fewer substitutions, e.g. seven or fewer substitutions, e.g. zero, one, two, three, four, five, or six substitutions. Substitutions may potentially be made at any residue within the set of CDRs, and may be within CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3.\n\n\nThus, according to one aspect of the invention there is provided an isolated binding member for human interleukin-4 receptor alpha (hIL-4Rα), comprising a set of CDRs: HCDR1, HCDR2, HCDR3, LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3, wherein the set of CDRs has 12 or fewer amino acid alterations from a reference set of CDRs in which:\n\n\nHCDR1 has amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 153;\n\n\nHCDR2 has amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 154;\n\n\nHCDR3 has amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 155;\n\n\nLCDR1 has amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 158;\n\n\nLCDR2 has amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 159; and\n\n\nLCDR3 has amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 160.\n\n\nThe reference antibody in this instance is \nAntibody\n 16.\n\n\nThe isolated binding member may have 10 or fewer, 8 or fewer, 7 or fewer, e.g. 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 or 0 amino acid alterations from the reference set of CDRs.

Particular alterations are amino acid substitutions. In a particular embodiment, the isolated binding member has 4 or fewer amino acid substitutions from the reference set of CDRs identified above.\n\n\nAccording to another aspect of the invention there is provided an isolated binding member for human interleukin-4 receptor alpha (hIL-4Rα), comprising a set of CDRs: HCDR1, HCDR2, HCDR3, LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3, wherein the set of CDRs has 6 or fewer amino acid alterations from a reference set of CDRs in which:\n\n\nHCDR1 has amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 363;\n\n\nHCDR2 has amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 364;\n\n\nHCDR3 has amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 365;\n\n\nLCDR1 has amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 368;\n\n\nLCDR2 has amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 369; and\n\n\nLCDR3 has amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 370.\n\n\nThe reference antibody in this instance is \nAntibody\n 37.\n\n\nSubstitutions may be within CDR3, e.g. at the positions substituted in any of \nAntibodies\n 2 to 42, as shown in \nFIG. 1\n or \n3\n (VH domain) and 2 or 4 (VL domain).

For example, one or more CDRs or a set of CDRs of an antibody may be grafted into a framework (e.g. human framework) to provide an antibody molecule. Framework regions may comprise human germline gene segment sequences. Thus, the framework may be germlined, whereby one or more residues within the framework are changed to match the residues at the equivalent position in the most similar human germline framework. The skilled person can select a germline segment that is closest in sequence to the framework sequence of the antibody before germlining and test the affinity or activity of the antibodies to confirm that germlining does not significantly reduce antigen binding or potency in assays described herein. Human germline gene segment sequences are known to those skilled in the art and can be accessed for example from the VBase compilation (see Tomlinson. Journal of Molecular Biology. 224. 487-499, 1997).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding member of the invention is an isolated human antibody molecule having a VH domain comprising a set of HCDRs in a human germline framework, e.g. Vh1_DP-7_(1-46). Thus, the VH domain framework regions FR1, FR2 and/or FR3 may comprise framework regions of human germline gene segment Vh1_DP-7_(1-46). FR4 may comprise a framework region of human germline j segment JH1, JH4 or JH5 (these j segments have identical amino acid sequences) or it may comprise a framework region of human germline j segment JH3. The amino acid sequence of VH FR1 may be SEQ ID NO: 442 (residues 1-30). The amino acid sequence of VH FR2 may be SEQ ID NO: 442 (residues 36-49). The amino acid sequence of VH FR3 may be SEQ ID NO: 442 (residues 66-94). The amino acid sequence of VH FR4 may be SEQ ID NO: 442 (103-113). Normally the binding member also has a VL domain comprising a set of LCDRs, e.g. in a human germline framework, e.g. Vλ1_DPL5. Thus, the VL domain framework regions FR1, FR2 and/or FR3 may comprise framework regions of human germline gene segment Vλ1_DPL5. FR4 may comprise a framework region of human germline j segment JL2 or JL3 (these j segments have identical amino acid sequences). The amino acid sequence of VL FR1 may be SEQ ID NO: 447 (residues 1-23). The amino acid sequence of VL FR2 may be SEQ ID NO: 447 (residues 35-49). The amino acid sequence of VL FR3 may be SEQ ID NO: 447 (residues 57-88). The amino acid sequence of VL FR4 may be SEQ ID NO: 447 (residues 98-107). A germlined VH or VL domain may or may not be germlined at one or more Vernier residues, but is normally not.\n\n\nAn antibody molecule or VH domain of the invention may comprise the following set of heavy chain framework regions:\n\n\nFR1 SEQ ID NO: 442 (residues 1-30);\n\n\nFR2 SEQ ID NO: 442 (residues 36-49);\n\n\nFR3 SEQ ID NO: 442 (residues 66-94);\n\n\nFR4 SEQ ID NO: 442 (residues 103-113); or may comprise the said set of heavy chain framework regions with one, two, three, four, five, or six amino acid alterations, e.g. substitutions.\n\n\nAn antibody molecule or VL domain of the invention may comprise the following set of light chain framework regions:\n\n\nFR1 SEQ ID NO: 447 (residues 1-23);\n\n\nFR2 SEQ ID NO: 447 (residues 35-49);\n\n\nFR3 SEQ ID NO: 447 (residues 57-88);\n\n\nFR4 SEQ ID NO: 447 (residues 98-107); or may comprise the said set of heavy chain framework regions with one, two, three, four, five, or six amino acid alterations, e.g. substitutions.\n\n\nAn amino acid alteration may be a substitution, an insertion (addition) or a deletion.\n\n\nThe most common alteration is likely to be a substitution.\n\n\nFor example, an antibody molecule of the invention may comprise a set of heavy and light chain framework regions, wherein:\n\n\nheavy chain FR1 is SEQ ID NO: 192(residues 1-30);\n\n\nheavy chain FR2 is SEQ ID NO: 192 (residues 36-49);\n\n\nheavy chain FR3 is SEQ ID NO: 192 (residues 66-94);\n\n\nheavy chain FR4 is SEQ ID NO: 192 (residues 103-113);\n\n\nlight chain FR1 is SEQ ID NO: 197 (residues 1-23);\n\n\nlight chain FR2 is SEQ ID NO: 197 (residues 35-49);\n\n\nlight chain FR3 is SEQ ID NO: 197 (residues 57-88);\n\n\nlight chain FR4 is SEQ ID NO: 197 (residues 98-107); or may comprise the said set of heavy and light chain framework regions with seven or fewer, e.g. six or fewer, amino acid alterations, e.g. substitutions. For example there may be one or two amino acid substitutions in the said set of heavy and light chain framework regions.\n\n\nAs indicated in Example 4.2, Antibodies 21-42 are based on \nAntibody\n 20, but with certain additional alterations within the CDRs and framework regions. Like \nAntibody\n 20, Antibodies 21-42 bind hIL-4Rα and cyIL-4Rα. Such CDR and/or framework substitutions may therefore be considered as optional or additional substitutions generating binding members with potentially greater binding.\n\n\nThus, in addition to the substitutions within any of the 6 CDR regions of the VH and VL domains, the binding members may also comprise one or more amino acid substitutions at the following residues within the framework regions, using the standard numbering of Kabat:\n\n\n11, 12 in HFW1;\n\n\n37, 48 in HFW2;\n\n\n68, 84, 85 in HFW3;\n\n\n105, 108, 113 in HFW4;\n\n\n1, 2, 3, 9 in LFW1;\n\n\n38, 42 in LFW2; or\n\n\n58, 65, 66, 70, 74, 85, 87 in LFW3.\n\n\nSuitable framework substitutions are shown in \nFIGS. 1 to 4\n. And a binding member of the present invention may comprise one or more of the specific substitutions shown in \nFIGS. 1 to 4\n.\n\n\nAn antibody molecule or VH domain of the invention may comprise a VH FR1 wherein \nKabat residue\n 11 is Val or Glu and/or \nKabat residue\n 12 is Lys or Arg; An antibody molecule or VH domain of the invention may comprise a VH FR2 wherein \nKabat residue\n 37 is Ala or Val and/or Kabat residue 48 is Met or Val; An antibody molecule or VH domain of the invention may comprise a VH FR3 wherein \nKabat residue\n 68 is Ser, Ala or Thr and/or \nKabat residue\n 84 is Ser or Pro and/or \nKabat residue\n 85 is Glu or Gly; An antibody molecule or VH domain of the invention may comprise a VH FR4 wherein \nKabat residue\n 105 is Lys or Asn and/or \nKabat residue\n 108 is Gln, Arg or Leu and/or \nKabat residue\n 113 is Ser or Gly.\n\n\nAn antibody molecule or VL domain of the invention may comprise a VL FR1 wherein \nKabat residue\n 1 is Gln or Leu and/or \nKabat residue\n 2 is Ser or Pro or Ala and/or \nKabat residue\n 3 is Val or Ala and/or \nKabat residue\n 9 is Ser or Leu; An antibody molecule or VL domain of the invention may comprise a VL FR2 wherein \nKabat residue\n 38 is Gln or Arg and/or \nKabat residue\n 42 is Thr or Ala; An antibody molecule or VL domain of the invention may comprise a VL FR3 wherein \nKabat residue\n 58 is Ile or Val and/or \nKabat residue\n 65 is Ser or Phe and/or \nKabat residue\n 66 is Lys or Arg and/or \nKabat residue\n 70 is Ser or Thr and/or \nKabat residue\n 74 is Ala or Gly and/or \nKabat residue\n 85 is Asp or Val and/or \nKabat residue\n 87 is Tyr or Phe.\n\n\nA non-germlined antibody has the same CDRs, but different frameworks, compared with a germlined antibody. Of the antibody sequences shown herein, VH and VL domains of Antibodies 24PGL and 37GL are germlined.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 5\n, \n6\n and \n7\n, depict the composite sequence identity that each of Antibodies 1-42 have with each other. The composite sequence being an artificial alignment of key CDR regions. Thus, for \nFIG. 5\n, the 6 CDR domains (LCDR1, LCDR2, LCDR3, HCDR1, HCDR2, HCDR3; 6xCDR) have been aligned such that the last codon of LCDR1 is adjacent to the first codon of LCDR2, the last codon of LCDR2 is adjacent the first codon of LCDR3 etc. In this manner a sequence that lacks the intervening framework regions is created. The composite sequence can be of all CDR regions, as for \nFIG. 5\n, or just the heavy or light chain CDR sequences (as for \nFIGS. 6 and 7\n respectively). Sequence alignment of each Antibody composite sequence to each other Antibody composite sequence can then be generated and the identity score depicted in the charts of \nFIGS. 5\n, \n6\n and \n7\n. As can be seen from \nFIG. 5\n, with respect to all 6 CDR regions, the lowest degree of sequence identity that any of Antibodies 1-42 has to another is 73% (this being \nAntibody\n 3 compared to \n \n \nAntibodies\n \n \n 23, 25, 37, 37GL and 41); if you exclude \nAntibody\n 3 the degree of sequence identity is 78%. The lowest degree of sequence identity comparing only the three Heavy chain CDR (3×HCDR) regions is 75% and 79% if you exclude \nAntibody\n 3. The lowest degree of sequence identity comparing only the three Light chain CDR (3xLCDR) regions is 65%; and, 75% if you exclude \nAntibody\n 3.\n\n\nIn a particular embodiment the isolated binding member has at least 73% amino acid sequence identity with the 6xCDR composite score of any of Antibodies 1-42.\n\n\nAccording to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an isolated binding member for human interleukin-4 receptor alpha (hIL-4Rα), comprising a set of CDRs: HCDR1, HCDR2, HCDR3, LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3, which binding member has at least 73% amino acid sequence identity with the composite sequence of HCDR1, HCDR2, HCDR3, LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3 in line sequence without any intervening framework sequences, of any of Antibodies 1-42. In a particular embodiment the isolated binding member has at least 78% amino acid sequence identity with the composite score of any of Antibodies 1-42.\n\n\nAccording to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an isolated binding member for human interleukin-4 receptor alpha (hIL-4Rα), comprising a set of CDRs: HCDR1, HCDR2, HCDR3, LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3, which binding member has at least 75% amino acid sequence identity with the composite sequence of HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3 of any of Antibodies 1-42.\n\n\nAccording to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an isolated binding member for human interleukin-4 receptor alpha (hIL-4Rα), comprising a set of CDRs: HCDR1, HCDR2, HCDR3, LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3, which binding member has at least 65% amino acid sequence identity with the composite sequence of LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3 of any of Antibodies 1-42.\n\n\nA binding member of the present invention may be one which competes for binding to IL-4Rα with any binding member which both binds IL-4Rα and comprises a binding member, VH and/or VL domain, CDR e.g. HCDR3, and/or set of CDRs disclosed herein. Competition between binding members may be assayed easily in vitro, for example using ELISA and/or by tagging a specific reporter molecule to one binding member which can be detected in the presence of one or more other untagged binding members, to enable identification of binding members which bind the same epitope or an overlapping epitope. Competition may be determined for example using ELISA in which IL-4Rα is immobilized to a plate and a first tagged binding member along with one or more other untagged binding members is added to the plate. Presence of an untagged binding member that competes with the tagged binding member is observed by a decrease in the signal emitted by the tagged binding member. Such methods are readily known to one of ordinary skill in the art, and are described in more detail herein. In one embodiment, competitive binding is assayed using an epitope competition assay as described herein. A binding member of the present invention may comprise a antibody antigen-binding site that competes with an antibody molecule, for example especially an antibody molecule comprising a VH and/or VL domain, CDR e.g. HCDR3 or set of CDRs of the parent antibody or any of \nAntibodies\n 2 to 42 for binding to IL-4Rα.\n\n\nAspects of the invention provide binding members that compete for binding to IL-4Rα with any binding member defined herein, e.g. compete with the parent antibody or any of \nAntibodies\n 2 to 42, e.g. in scFv or IgG1, IgG2 or IgG4 format. A binding member that competes for binding to IL-4Rα with any binding member defined herein may have any one or more of the structural and/or functional properties disclosed herein for binding members of the invention.\n\n\nIn further aspects, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid which comprises a sequence encoding a binding member, such as a VH domain and/or VL domain according to the present invention, and methods of preparing a binding member, such as a VH domain and/or a VL domain of the invention, which comprise expressing said nucleic acid under conditions to bring about production of said binding member, such as a VH domain and/or VL domain and/or antibody, and recovering it.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention provides nucleic acid, generally isolated, encoding a VH CDR or VL CDR sequence disclosed herein.\n\n\nA further aspect provides a host cell containing or transformed with nucleic acid of the invention.\n\n\nFurther aspects of the present invention provide for compositions containing binding members of the invention, and their use in methods of inhibiting and/or neutralising IL-4Rα, including methods of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy.\n\n\nBinding members according to the invention may be used in a method of treatment or diagnosis of the human or animal body, such as a method of treatment (which may include prophylactic treatment) of a disease or disorder in a human patient which comprises administering to said patient an effective amount of a binding member of the invention. Conditions treatable in accordance with the present invention include any in which IL-4Rα, IL-4 and/or IL-13 plays a role, as discussed in detail elsewhere herein.\n\n\nThese and other aspects of the invention are described in further detail below.\n\n\nTerminology\n\n\nIt is convenient to point out here that “and/or” where used herein is to be taken as specific disclosure of each of the two specified features or components with or without the other. For example “A and/or B” is to be taken as specific disclosure of each of (i) A, (ii) B and (iii) A and B, just as if each is set out individually herein.\n\n\nIL-4Rα\n\n\nIL-4Rα, is interleukin-4 receptor alpha. References to IL-4Rα are normally to human IL-4Rα unless otherwise indicated. A sequence of wild-type mature human IL-4Rα is deposited under Accession number P24394 (Swiss-Prot), which shows the full-length IL-4Rα including the signal peptide.\n\n\nCynomolgus IL-4Rα was sequenced in house, the cDNA sequence of cynomolgus IL-4Rα is shown as SEQ ID NO: 455.\n\n\nAs described elsewhere herein, IL-4Rα may be recombinant, and/or may be either glycosylated or unglycosylated. IL-4Rα is expressed naturally in vivo in N-linked glycosylated form. Glycosylated IL-4Rα may also be expressed in recombinant systems, e.g. in HEK-EBNA cells. IL-4Rα may also be expressed in non-glycosylated form in \nE. coli \ncells.\n\n\nBinding Member\n\n\nThis describes one member of a pair of molecules that bind one another. The members of a binding pair may be naturally derived or wholly or partially synthetically produced. One member of the pair of molecules has an area on its surface, or a cavity, which binds to and is therefore complementary to a particular spatial and polar organization of the other member of the pair of molecules. Examples of types of binding pairs are antigen-antibody, biotin-avidin, hormone-hormone receptor, receptor-ligand, enzyme-substrate. The present invention is concerned with antigen-antibody type reactions.\n\n\nA binding member normally comprises a molecule having an antigen-binding site. For example, a binding member may be an antibody molecule or a non-antibody protein that comprises an antigen-binding site.\n\n\nAn antigen binding site may be provided by means of arrangement of CDRs on non-antibody protein scaffolds such as fibronectin or cytochrome B etc. (Haan & Maggos, BioCentury, 12(5):A1-A6, 2004; Koide, Journal of Molecular Biology, 284:1141-1151, 1998; Nygren et al., Current Opinion in Structural Biology, 7:463-469, 1997), or by randomising or mutating amino acid residues of a loop within a protein scaffold to confer binding specificity for a desired target. Scaffolds for engineering novel binding sites in proteins have been reviewed in detail by Nygren et al. (supra). Protein scaffolds for antibody mimics are disclosed in WO/0034784, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, in which the inventors describe proteins (antibody mimics) that include a fibronectin type III domain having at least one randomised loop. A suitable scaffold into which to graft one or more CDRs, e.g. a set of HCDRs or an HCDR and/or LCDR3, may be provided by any domain member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. The scaffold may be a human or non-human protein. An advantage of a non-antibody protein scaffold is that it may provide an antigen-binding site in a scaffold molecule that is smaller and/or easier to manufacture than at least some antibody molecules. Small size of a binding member may confer useful physiological properties such as an ability to enter cells, penetrate deep into tissues or reach targets within other structures, or to bind within protein cavities of the target antigen. Use of antigen binding sites in non-antibody protein scaffolds is reviewed in Wess, 2004. Typical are proteins having a stable backbone and one or more variable loops, in which the amino acid sequence of the loop or loops is specifically or randomly mutated to create an antigen-binding site that binds the target antigen. Such proteins include the IgG-binding domains of protein A from \nS. aureus\n, transferrin, tetranectin, fibronectin (e.g. 10th fibronectin type III domain) and lipocalins. Other approaches include synthetic “Microbodies” (Selecore GmbH), which are based on cyclotides—small proteins having intra-molecular disulphide bonds.\n\n\nIn addition to antibody sequences and/or an antigen-binding site, a binding member according to the present invention may comprise other amino acids, e.g. forming a peptide or polypeptide, such as a folded domain, or to impart to the molecule another functional characteristic in addition to ability to bind antigen. Binding members of the invention may carry a detectable label, or may be conjugated to a toxin or a targeting moiety or enzyme (e.g. via a peptidyl bond or linker). For example, a binding member may comprise a catalytic site (e.g. in an enzyme domain) as well as an antigen binding site, wherein the antigen binding site binds to the antigen and thus targets the catalytic site to the antigen. The catalytic site may inhibit biological function of the antigen, e.g. by cleavage.\n\n\nAlthough, as noted, CDRs can be carried by non-antibody scaffolds, the structure for carrying a CDR, e.g. CDR3, or a set of CDRs of the invention will generally be an antibody heavy or light chain sequence or substantial portion thereof in which the CDR or set of CDRs is located at a location corresponding to the CDR or set of CDRs of naturally occurring VH and VL antibody variable domains encoded by rearranged immunoglobulin genes. The structures and locations of immunoglobulin variable domains may be determined by reference to Kabat (Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 4\nth \nEdition. US Department of Health and Human Devices, 1987), and updates thereof, such as the 5\nth \nEdition (Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Edition. US Department of Health and Human Services, Public Service, NIH, Washington, 1991).\n\n\nUnless indicated otherwise, the locations of particular residues, as well as CDR and framework regions, referred to herein uses the Kabat numbering system.\n\n\nBy CDR region or CDR, it is intended to indicate the hypervariable regions of the heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulin as defined by Kabat et al., (supra). An antibody typically contains 3 heavy chain CDRs and 3 light chain CDRs. The term CDR or CDRs is used here in order to indicate, according to the case, one of these regions or several, or even the whole, of these regions which contain the majority of the amino acid residues responsible for the binding by affinity of the antibody for the antigen or the epitope which it recognizes.\n\n\nAmong the six short CDR sequences, the third CDR of the heavy chain (HCDR3) has greater size variability (greater diversity essentially due to the mechanisms of arrangement of the genes which give rise to it). It can be as short as 2 amino acids although the longest size known is 26. Functionally, HCDR3 plays a role in part in the determination of the specificity of the antibody (Segal et al. PNAS, 71:4298-4302, 1974; Amit et al., Science, 233:747-753, 1986; Chothia et al. J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917, 1987; Chothia et al. Nature, 342:877-883, 1989; et al. J. Immunol., 144:1965-1968, 1990; Sharon et al. PNAS, 87:4814-4817, 1990(a); Sharon et al. J. Immunol., 144:4863-4869, 1990; Kabat et al., et al., J. Immunol., 147:1709-1719, 1991b).\n\n\nHCDR1 may be 5 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 31-35.\n\n\nHCDR2 may be 17 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 50-65.\n\n\nHCDR3 may be 7 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 95-102.\n\n\nLCDR1 may be 13 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 24-34.\n\n\nLCDR2 may be 7 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 50-56.\n\n\nLCDR3 may be 12 amino acids long, consisting of Kabat residues 89-97.\n\n\nAntibody Molecule\n\n\nThis describes an immunoglobulin whether natural or partly or wholly synthetically produced. The term also covers any polypeptide or protein comprising an antibody antigen-binding site. It must be understood here that the invention does not relate to the antibodies in natural form, that is to say they are not in their natural environment but that they have been able to be isolated or obtained by purification from natural sources, or else obtained by genetic recombination, or by chemical synthesis, and that they can then contain unnatural amino acids as will be described later. Antibody fragments that comprise an antibody antigen-binding site include, but are not limited to molecules such as Fab, Fab′, Fab′-SH, scFv, Fv, dAb, Fd; and diabodies.\n\n\nAntibody molecules of the invention may be IgG, e.g. IgG1, IgG4, IgG2 or aglycosyl IgG2.\n\n\nIt is possible to take monoclonal and other antibodies and use techniques of recombinant DNA technology to produce other antibodies or chimeric molecules that bind the target antigen. Such techniques may involve introducing DNA encoding the immunoglobulin variable region, or the CDRs, of an antibody to the constant regions, or constant regions plus framework regions, of a different immunoglobulin. See, for instance, EP-A-184187, GB 2188638A or EP-A-239400, and a large body of subsequent literature. A hybridoma or other cell producing an antibody may be subject to genetic mutation or other changes, which may or may not alter the binding specificity of antibodies produced.\n\n\nAs antibodies can be modified in a number of ways, the term “antibody molecule” should be construed as covering any binding member or substance having an antibody antigen-binding site with the required specificity and/or binding to antigen. Thus, this term covers antibody fragments and derivatives, including any polypeptide comprising an antibody antigen-binding site, whether natural or wholly or partially synthetic. Chimeric molecules comprising an antibody antigen-binding site, or equivalent, fused to another polypeptide (e.g. derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass) are therefore included. Cloning and expression of chimeric antibodies are described in EP-A-0120694 and EP-A-0125023, and a large body of subsequent literature.\n\n\nFurther techniques available in the art of antibody engineering have made it possible to isolate human and humanised antibodies. For example, human hybridomas can be made as described by Kontermann & Dubel (Antibody Engineering, Springer-Verlag New York, LLC; 2001, ISBN: 3540413545). Phage display, another established technique for generating binding members has been described in detail in many publications such as WO92/01047 (discussed further below) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,969,108, U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332, U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,743, U.S. Pat. No. 5,858,657, U.S. Pat. No. 5,871,907, U.S. Pat. No. 5,872,215, U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,793, U.S. Pat. No. 5,962,255, U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,471, U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,197, U.S. Pat. No. 6,225,447, U.S. Pat. No. 6,291,650, U.S. Pat. No. 6,492,160, U.S. Pat. No. 6,521,404 and Kontermann & Dubel (supra). Transgenic mice in which the mouse antibody genes are inactivated and functionally replaced with human antibody genes while leaving intact other components of the mouse immune system, can be used for isolating human antibodies (Mendez et al. Nature Genet, 15(2): 146-156, 1997).\n\n\nSynthetic antibody molecules may be created by expression from genes generated by means of oligonucleotides synthesized and assembled within suitable expression vectors, for example as described by Knappik et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 296, 57-86, 2000) or Krebs et al. (Journal of Immunological Methods, 254:67-84, 2001).\n\n\nIt has been shown that fragments of a whole antibody can perform the function of binding antigens. Examples of binding fragments are (i) the Fab fragment consisting of VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) the Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iii) the Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single antibody; (iv) the dAb fragment (Ward et al., Nature 341:544-546, 1989; McCafferty et al. Nature, 348:552-554, 1990; Holt et al. Trends in Biotechnology 21, 484-490, 2003), which consists of a VH or a VL domain; (v) isolated CDR regions; (vi) F(ab′)2 fragments, a bivalent fragment comprising two linked Fab fragments (vii) single chain Fv molecules (scFv), wherein a VH domain and a VL domain are linked by a peptide linker which allows the two domains to associate to form an antigen binding site (Bird et al. Science, 242, 423-426, 1988; Huston PNAS USA, 85, 5879-5883, 1988); (viii) bispecific single chain Fv dimers (PCT/US92/09965) and (ix) “diabodies”, multivalent or multispecific fragments constructed by gene fusion (WO94/13804; Holliger et al, PNAS USA 90:6444-6448, 1993a). Fv, scFv or diabody molecules may be stabilized by the incorporation of disulphide bridges linking the VH and VL domains (Reiter et al, Nature Biotech, 14:1239-1245, 1996). Minibodies comprising a scFv joined to a CH3 domain may also be made (Hu et al, Cancer Res., 56, 3055-3061, 1996). Other examples of binding fragments are Fab′, which differs from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxyl terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain, including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region, and Fab′-SH, which is a Fab′ fragment in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group.\n\n\nAntibody fragments of the invention can be obtained starting from any of the antibody molecules described herein, e.g. antibody molecules comprising VH and/or VL domains or CDRs of any of \nAntibodies\n 1 to 42, by methods such as digestion by enzymes, such as pepsin or papain and/or by cleavage of the disulfide bridges by chemical reduction. In another manner, the antibody fragments comprised in the present invention can be obtained by techniques of genetic recombination likewise well known to the person skilled in the art or else by peptide synthesis by means of, for example, automatic peptide synthesizers such as those supplied by the company Applied Biosystems, etc., or by nucleic acid synthesis and expression.\n\n\nFunctional antibody fragments according to the present invention include any functional fragment whose half-life is increased by a chemical modification, especially by PEGylation, or by incorporation in a liposome.\n\n\nA dAb (domain antibody) is a small monomeric antigen-binding fragment of an antibody, namely the variable region of an antibody heavy or light chain (Holt et al. Trends in \nBiotechnology\n 21, 484-490, 2003). VH dAbs occur naturally in camelids (e.g. camel, llama) and may be produced by immunizing a camelid with a target antigen, isolating antigen-specific B cells and directly cloning dAb genes from individual B cells. dAbs are also producible in cell culture. Their small size, good solubility and temperature stability makes them particularly physiologically useful and suitable for selection and affinity maturation. A binding member of the present invention may be a dAb comprising a VH or VL domain substantially as set out herein, or a VH or VL domain comprising a set of CDRs substantially as set out herein.\n\n\nAs used herein, the phrase “substantially as set out” refers to the characteristic(s) of the relevant CDRs of the VH or VL domain of binding members described herein will be either identical or highly similar to the specified regions of which the sequence is set out herein. As described herein, the phrase “highly similar” with respect to specified region(s) of one or more variable domains, it is contemplated that from 1 to about 12, e.g. from 1 to 8, including 1 to 7, 1 to 6, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, or 1 or 2, amino acid substitutions may be made in the CDRs of the VH and/or VL domain.\n\n\nAntibodies of the invention include bispecific antibodies. Bispecific or bifunctional antibodies form a second generation of monoclonal antibodies in which two different variable regions are combined in the same molecule (Holliger, P. & Winter, G. 1999 Cancer and metastasis rev. 18:411-419, 1999). Their use has been demonstrated both in the diagnostic field and in the therapy field from their capacity to recruit new effector functions or to target several molecules on the surface of tumor cells. Where bispecific antibodies are to be used, these may be conventional bispecific antibodies, which can be manufactured in a variety of ways (Holliger et al, PNAS USA 90:6444-6448, 1993), e.g. prepared chemically or from hybrid hybridomas, or may be any of the bispecific antibody fragments mentioned above. These antibodies can be obtained by chemical methods (Glennie et al., 1987 J. Immunol. 139, 2367-2375; Repp et al., J. Hemat. 377-382, 1995) or somatic methods (Staerz U. D. and Bevan M. J. \nPNAS\n 83, 1986; et al., Method Enzymol. 121:210-228, 1986) but likewise by genetic engineering techniques which allow the heterodimerization to be forced and thus facilitate the process of purification of the antibody sought (Merchand et al. Nature Biotech, 16:677-681, 1998). Examples of bispecific antibodies include those of the BiTE™ technology in which the binding domains of two antibodies with different specificity can be used and directly linked via short flexible peptides. This combines two antibodies on a short single polypeptide chain. Diabodies and scFv can be constructed without an Fc region, using only variable domains, potentially reducing the effects of anti-idiotypic reaction.\n\n\nBispecific antibodies can be constructed as entire IgG, as bispecific Fab′2, as Fab′PEG, as diabodies or else as bispecific scFv. Further, two bispecific antibodies can be linked using routine methods known in the art to form tetravalent antibodies.\n\n\nBispecific diabodies, as opposed to bispecific whole antibodies, may also be particularly useful because they can be readily constructed and expressed in \nE. coli\n. Diabodies (and many other polypeptides such as antibody fragments) of appropriate binding specificities can be readily selected using phage display (WO94/13804) from libraries. If one arm of the diabody is to be kept constant, for instance, with a specificity directed against IL-4Rα, then a library can be made where the other arm is varied and an antibody of appropriate specificity selected. Bispecific whole antibodies may be made by alternative engineering methods as described in Ridgeway et al, (Protein Eng., 9:616-621, 1996).\n\n\nVarious methods are available in the art for obtaining antibodies against IL-4Rα. The antibodies may be monoclonal antibodies, especially of human, murine, chimeric or humanized origin, which can be obtained according to the standard methods well known to the person skilled in the art.\n\n\nIn general, for the preparation of monoclonal antibodies or their functional fragments, especially of murine origin, it is possible to refer to techniques which are described in particular in the manual “Antibodies” (Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor N.Y., pp. 726, 1988) or to the technique of preparation from hybridomas described by Kohler and Milstein (Nature, 256:495-497, 1975).\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies can be obtained, for example, from an animal cell immunized against IL-4Rα, or one of their fragments containing the epitope recognized by said monoclonal antibodies. The IL-4Rα, or one of its fragments, can especially be produced according to the usual working methods, by genetic recombination starting with a nucleic acid sequence contained in the cDNA sequence coding for IL-4Rα or fragment thereof, by peptide synthesis starting from a sequence of amino acids comprised in the peptide sequence of the IL-4Rα and/or fragment thereof. The monoclonal antibodies can, for example, be purified on an affinity column on which IL-4Rα or one of its fragments containing the epitope recognized by said monoclonal antibodies, has previously been immobilized. More particularly, the monoclonal antibodies can be purified by chromatography on protein A and/or G, followed or not followed by ion-exchange chromatography aimed at eliminating the residual protein contaminants as well as the DNA and the LPS, in itself, followed or not followed by exclusion chromatography on Sepharose gel in order to eliminate the potential aggregates due to the presence of dimers or of other multimers. In one embodiment, the whole of these techniques can be used simultaneously or successively.\n\n\nAntigen-Binding Site\n\n\nThis describes the part of a molecule that binds to and is complementary to all or part of the target antigen. In an antibody molecule it is referred to as the antibody antigen-binding site, and comprises the part of the antibody that binds to and is complementary to all or part of the target antigen. Where an antigen is large, an antibody may only bind to a particular part of the antigen, which part is termed an epitope. An antibody antigen-binding site may be provided by one or more antibody variable domains. An antibody antigen-binding site may comprise an antibody light chain variable region (VL) and an antibody heavy chain variable region (VH).\n\n\nIsolated\n\n\nThis refers to the state in which binding members of the invention, or nucleic acid encoding such binding members, will generally be in accordance with the present invention. Thus, binding members, including VH and/or VL domains, and encoding nucleic acid molecules and vectors according to the present invention may be provided isolated and/or purified, e.g. from their natural environment, in substantially pure or homogeneous form, or, in the case of nucleic acid, free or substantially free of nucleic acid or genes of origin other than the sequence encoding a polypeptide with the required function. Isolated members and isolated nucleic acid will be free or substantially free of material with which they are naturally associated such as other polypeptides or nucleic acids with which they are found in their natural environment, or the environment in which they are prepared (e.g. cell culture) when such preparation is by recombinant DNA technology practised in vitro or in vivo. Members and nucleic acid may be formulated with diluents or adjuvants and still for practical purposes be isolated—for example the members will normally be mixed with gelatin or other carriers if used to coat microtitre plates for use in immunoassays, or will be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents when used in diagnosis or therapy. Binding members may be glycosylated, either naturally or by systems of heterologous eukaryotic cells (e.g. CHO or NS0 (ECACC 85110503)) cells, or they may be (for example if produced by expression in a prokaryotic cell) unglycosylated.\n\n\nHeterogeneous preparations comprising anti-IL-4Rα antibody molecules also form part of the invention. For example, such preparations may be mixtures of antibodies with full-length heavy chains and heavy chains lacking the C-terminal lysine, with various degrees of glycosylation and/or with derivatized amino acids, such as cyclization of an N-terminal glutamic acid to form a pyroglutamic acid residue.\n\n\nAs noted above, a binding member in accordance with the present invention modulates and may neutralise a biological activity of IL-4Rα. As described herein, IL-4Rα-binding members of the present invention may be optimised for neutralizing potency. Generally, potency optimisation involves mutating the sequence of a selected binding member (normally the variable domain sequence of an antibody) to generate a library of binding members, which are then assayed for potency and the more potent binding members are selected. Thus selected “potency-optimised” binding members tend to have a higher potency than the binding member from which the library was generated. Nevertheless, high potency binding members may also be obtained without optimisation, for example a high potency binding member may be obtained directly from an initial screen e.g. a biochemical neutralization assay. A “potency optimized” binding member refers to a binding member with an optimized potency of binding or neutralization of a particular activity or downstream function of IL-4Rα. Assays and potencies are described in more detail elsewhere herein. The present invention provides both potency-optimized and non-optimized binding members, as well as methods for potency optimization from a selected binding member. The present invention thus allows the skilled person to generate binding members having high potency.\n\n\nAlthough potency optimization may be used to generate higher potency binding members from a given binding member, it is also noted that high potency binding members may be obtained even without potency optimization.\n\n\nIn a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of obtaining one or more binding members able to bind the antigen, the method including bringing into contact a library of binding members according to the invention and said antigen, and selecting one or more binding members of the library able to bind said antigen.\n\n\nThe library may be displayed on particles or molecular complexes, e.g. replicable genetic packages such as yeast, bacterial or bacteriophage (e.g. T7) particles, viruses, cells or covalent, ribosomal or other in vitro display systems, each particle or molecular complex containing nucleic acid encoding the antibody VH variable domain displayed on it, and optionally also a displayed VL domain if present. Phage display is described in WO92/01047 and e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5,969,108, U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332, U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,743, U.S. Pat. No. 5,858,657, U.S. Pat. No. 5,871,907, U.S. Pat. No. 5,872,215, U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,793, U.S. Pat. No. 5,962,255, U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,471, U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,197, U.S. Pat. No. 6,225,447, U.S. Pat. No. 6,291,650, U.S. Pat. No. 6,492,160 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,521,404, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nFollowing selection of binding members able to bind the antigen and displayed on bacteriophage or other library particles or molecular complexes, nucleic acid may be taken from a bacteriophage or other particle or molecular complex displaying a said selected binding member. Such nucleic acid may be used in subsequent production of a binding member or an antibody VH or VL variable domain by expression from nucleic acid with the sequence of nucleic acid taken from a bacteriophage or other particle or molecular complex displaying a said selected binding member.\n\n\nAn antibody VH domain with the amino acid sequence of an antibody VH domain of a said selected binding member may be provided in isolated form, as may a binding member comprising such a VH domain.\n\n\nAbility to bind IL-4Rα and/or ability to compete with e.g. a parent antibody molecule (e.g. Antibody 1) or an optimised antibody molecule, \nAntibodies\n 2 to 42 (e.g. in scFv format and/or IgG format, \ne.g. IgG\n 1, IgG2 or IgG4) for binding to IL-4Rα, may be further tested. Ability to neutralize IL-4Rα may be tested, as discussed further elsewhere herein.\n\n\nA binding member according to the present invention may bind IL-4Rα with the affinity of one of \nAntibodies\n 1 to 42, e.g. in scFv or \nIgG\n 1 or IgG2 or IgG4 format, or with an affinity that is better.\n\n\nA binding member according to the present invention may neutralize a biological activity of IL-4Rα with the potency of one of \nAntibodies\n 1 to 42 e.g. in scFv or \nIgG\n 1 or IgG2 or IgG4 format, or with a potency that is better.\n\n\nBinding affinity and neutralization potency of different binding members can be compared under appropriate conditions.\n\n\nVariants of antibody molecules disclosed herein may be produced and used in the present invention. Following the lead of computational chemistry in applying multivariate data analysis techniques to the structure/property-activity relationships (Wold et al Multivariate data analysis in chemistry. Chemometrics—Mathematics and Statistics in Chemistry (Ed.: B. Kowalski), D. Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht, Holland, 1984 (ISBN 90-277-1846-6)) quantitative activity-property relationships of antibodies can be derived using well-known mathematical techniques such as statistical regression, pattern recognition and classification (Norman et al. Applied Regression Analysis. Wiley-Interscience; 3\nrd \nedition (April 1998) ISBN: 0471170828; Kandel, Abraham & Backer, Computer-Assisted Reasoning in Cluster Analysis. Prentice Hall PTR, (May 11, 1995), ISBN: 0133418847; Principles of Multivariate Analysis: A User's Perspective (Oxford Statistical Science Series, No 22 (Paper)). Oxford University Press; (December 2000), ISBN: 0198507089; Witten & Frank Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations. Morgan Kaufmann; (Oct. 11, 1999), ISBN: 1558605525; Denison DGT. (Editor), Holmes, C C. et al. Bayesian Methods for Nonlinear Classification and Regression (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics). John Wiley & Sons; (July 2002), ISBN: 0471490369; Ghose, A K. & Viswanadhan, V N. Combinatorial Library Design and Evaluation Principles, Software, Tools, and Applications in Drug Discovery. ISBN: 0-8247-0487-8). The properties of antibodies can be derived from empirical and theoretical models (for example, analysis of likely contact residues or calculated physicochemical property) of antibody sequence, functional and three-dimensional structures and these properties can be considered singly and in combination.\n\n\nAn antibody antigen-binding site composed of a VH domain and a VL domain is typically formed by six loops of polypeptide: three from the light chain variable domain (VL) and three from the heavy chain variable domain (VH). Analysis of antibodies of known atomic structure has elucidated relationships between the sequence and three-dimensional structure of antibody combining sites (Chothia et al. Journal Molecular Biology 1992227, 799-817, 1992; Al-Lazikani et al. Journal Molecular Biology 273(4):927-948, 1997). These relationships imply that, except for the third region (loop) in VH domains, binding site loops have one of a small number of main-chain conformations: canonical structures. The canonical structure formed in a particular loop has been shown to be determined by its size and the presence of certain residues at key sites in both the loop and in framework regions (Chothia et al, Journal Molecular Biology 1992227, 799-817, 1992; Al-Lazikani supra).\n\n\nThis study of sequence-structure relationship can be used for prediction of those residues in an antibody of known sequence, but of an unknown three-dimensional structure, which are important in maintaining the three-dimensional structure of its CDR loops and hence maintain binding specificity. These predictions can be backed up by comparison of the predictions to the output from lead optimization experiments. In a structural approach, a model can be created of the antibody molecule (Chothia et al. Science, 223:755-758, 1986) using any freely available or commercial package such as WAM (Whitelegg & Rees, Prot. Eng., 12:815-824, 2000). A protein visualisation and analysis software package such as Insight II (Accelerys, Inc.) or Deep View (Guex & Peitsch, Electrophoresis (1997) 18, 2714-2723) may then be used to evaluate possible substitutions at each position in the CDR. This information may then be used to make substitutions likely to have a minimal or beneficial effect on activity.\n\n\nThe techniques required to make substitutions within amino acid sequences of CDRs, antibody VH or VL domains and binding members generally are available in the art. Variant sequences may be made, with substitutions that may or may not be predicted to have a minimal or beneficial effect on activity, and tested for ability to bind and/or neutralize IL-4Rα and/or for any other desired property.\n\n\nVariable domain amino acid sequence variants of any of the VH and VL domains whose sequences are specifically disclosed herein may be employed in accordance with the present invention, as discussed. Particular variants may include one or more amino acid sequence alterations (addition, deletion, substitution and/or insertion of an amino acid residue), may be less than about 20 alterations, less than about 15 alterations, less than about 12 alterations, less than about 10 alterations, or less than about 6 alterations, maybe 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1. Alterations may be made in one or more framework regions and/or one or more CDRs. The alterations normally do not result in loss of function, so a binding member comprising a thus-altered amino acid sequence may retain an ability to bind and/or neutralize IL-4Rα. For example, it may retain the same quantitative binding and/or neutralizing ability as a binding member in which the alteration is not made, e.g. as measured in an assay described herein. The binding member comprising a thus-altered amino acid sequence may have an improved ability to bind and/or neutralize IL-4Rα. Indeed, \nAntibodies\n 21 to 42, generated from random mutagenesis of \nAntibody\n 20, exhibits substitutions relative to \nAntibody\n 20, mostly within the various framework regions and each of these still bind and/or neutralises IL-4Rα, indeed some show improved ability to bind and/or neutralize IL-4Rα.\n\n\nAlteration may comprise replacing one or more amino acid residue with a non-naturally occurring or non-standard amino acid, modifying one or more amino acid residue into a non-naturally occurring or non-standard form, or inserting one or more non-naturally occurring or non-standard amino acid into the sequence. Example numbers and locations of alterations in sequences of the invention are described elsewhere herein. Naturally occurring amino acids include the 20 “standard” L-amino acids identified as G, A, V, L, I, M, P, F, W, S, T, N, Q, Y, C, K, R, H, D, E by their standard single-letter codes. Non-standard amino acids include any other residue that may be incorporated into a polypeptide backbone or result from modification of an existing amino acid residue. Non-standard amino acids may be naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring. Several naturally occurring non-standard amino acids are known in the art, such as 4-hydroxyproline, 5-hydroxylysine, 3-methylhistidine, N-acetylserine, etc. (Voet & Voet, Biochemistry, 2nd Edition, (Wiley) 1995). Those amino acid residues that are derivatised at their N-alpha position will only be located at the N-terminus of an amino-acid sequence. Normally in the present invention an amino acid is an L-amino acid, but in some embodiments it may be a D-amino acid. Alteration may therefore comprise modifying an L-amino acid into, or replacing it with, a D-amino acid. Methylated, acetylated and/or phosphorylated forms of amino acids are also known, and amino acids in the present invention may be subject to such modification.\n\n\nAmino acid sequences in antibody domains and binding members of the invention may comprise non-natural or non-standard amino acids described above. In some embodiments non-standard amino acids (e.g. D-amino acids) may be incorporated into an amino acid sequence during synthesis, while in other embodiments the non-standard amino acids may be introduced by modification or replacement of the “original” standard amino acids after synthesis of the amino acid sequence.\n\n\nUse of non-standard and/or non-naturally occurring amino acids increases structural and functional diversity, and can thus increase the potential for achieving desired IL-4Rα-binding and neutralizing properties in a binding member of the invention. Additionally, D-amino acids and analogues have been shown to have better pharmacokinetic profiles compared with standard L-amino acids, owing to in vivo degradation of polypeptides having L-amino acids after administration to an animal e.g. a human.\n\n\nNovel VH or VL regions carrying CDR-derived sequences of the invention may be generated using random mutagenesis of one or more selected VH and/or VL genes to generate mutations within the entire variable domain. Such a technique is described by Gram et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 89:3576-3580, 1992), who used error-prone PCR. In some embodiments one or two amino acid substitutions are made within an entire variable domain or set of CDRs. Another method that may be used is to direct mutagenesis to CDR regions of VH or VL genes. Such techniques are disclosed by Barbas et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 91:3809-3813, 1994) and Schier et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 263:551-567, 1996).\n\n\nAll the above-described techniques are known as such in the art and the skilled person will be able to use such techniques to provide binding members of the invention using routine methodology in the art.\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention provides a method for obtaining an antibody antigen-binding site for IL-4Rα, the method comprising providing by way of addition, deletion, substitution or insertion of one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequence of a VH domain set out herein a VH domain which is an amino acid sequence variant of the VH domain, optionally combining the VH domain thus provided with one or more VL domains, and testing the VH domain or VH/VL combination or combinations to identify a binding member or an antibody antigen-binding site for IL-4Rα and optionally with one or more functional properties, e.g. ability to neutralize IL-4Rα activity. Said VL domain may have an amino acid sequence which is substantially as set out herein. An analogous method may be employed in which one or more sequence variants of a VL domain disclosed herein are combined with one or more VH domains.\n\n\nAs noted above, a CDR amino acid sequence substantially as set out herein may be carried as a CDR in a human antibody variable domain or a substantial portion thereof. The HCDR3 sequences substantially as set out herein represent embodiments of the present invention and for example each of these may be carried as a HCDR3 in a human heavy chain variable domain or a substantial portion thereof.\n\n\nVariable domains employed in the invention may be obtained or derived from any germ-line or rearranged human variable domain, or may be a synthetic variable domain based on consensus or actual sequences of known human variable domains. A variable domain can be derived from a non-human antibody. A CDR sequence of the invention (e.g. CDR3) may be introduced into a repertoire of variable domains lacking a CDR (e.g. CDR3), using recombinant DNA technology. For example, Marks et al. (Bio/Technology, 10:779-783, 1992) describe methods of producing repertoires of antibody variable domains in which consensus primers directed at or adjacent to the 5′ end of the variable domain area are used in conjunction with consensus primers to the third framework region of human VH genes to provide a repertoire of VH variable domains lacking a CDR3. Marks et al. further describe how this repertoire may be combined with a CDR3 of a particular antibody. Using analogous techniques, the CDR3-derived sequences of the present invention may be shuffled with repertoires of VH or VL domains lacking a CDR3, and the shuffled complete VH or VL domains combined with a cognate VL or VH domain to provide binding members of the invention. The repertoire may then be displayed in a suitable host system such as the phage display system of WO92/01047, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, or any of a subsequent large body of literature, including Kay, Winter & McCafferty (Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins: A Laboratory Manual, San Diego: Academic Press, 1996), so that suitable binding members may be selected. A repertoire may consist of from anything from 10\n4 \nindividual members upwards, for example at least 10\n5\n, at least 10\n6\n, at least 10\n7\n, at least 10\n8\n, at least 10\n9 \nor at least 10\n10 \nmembers. Other suitable host systems include, but are not limited to, yeast display, bacterial display, T7 display, viral display, cell display, ribosome display and covalent display.\n\n\nAnalogous shuffling or combinatorial techniques are also disclosed by Stemmer (Nature, 370:389-391, 1994), who describes the technique in relation to a β-lactamase gene but observes that the approach may be used for the generation of antibodies.\n\n\nA method of preparing a binding member for IL-4Rα antigen is provided, which method comprises:\n\n\n(a) providing a starting repertoire of nucleic acids encoding a VH domain which either include a CDR3 to be replaced or lack a CDR3 encoding region;\n\n\n(b) combining said repertoire with a donor nucleic acid encoding an amino acid sequence substantially as set out herein for a VH CDR3 such that said donor nucleic acid is inserted into the CDR3 region in the repertoire, so as to provide a product repertoire of nucleic acids encoding a VH domain;\n\n\n(c) expressing the nucleic acids of said product repertoire;\n\n\n(d) selecting a binding member for IL-4Rα; and\n\n\n(e) recovering said binding member or nucleic acid encoding it.\n\n\nAgain, an analogous method may be employed in which a VL CDR3 of the invention is combined with a repertoire of nucleic acids encoding a VL domain that either include a CDR3 to be replaced or lack a CDR3 encoding region.\n\n\nSimilarly, other VH and VL domains, sets of CDRs and sets of HCDRs and/or sets of LCDRs disclosed herein may be employed.\n\n\nSimilarly, one or more, or all three CDRs may be grafted into a repertoire of VH or VL domains that are then screened for a binding member or binding members for IL-4Rα.\n\n\nAlternatively, nucleic acid encoding the VH and/or VL domains of any of a binding member of the present invention, e.g. Antibodies 1-42, can be subjected to mutagenesis (e.g. targeted or random) to generate one or more mutant nucleic acids. Binding members encoded by these sequences can then be generated.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, one or more of \nAntibodies\n 1 to 42 HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3, or an \nAntibody\n 1 to 42 set of HCDRs, may be employed, and/or one or more of \nAntibodies\n 1 to 42 LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3 or an \nAntibody\n 1 to 42 set of LCDRs may be employed.\n\n\nAccording to one aspect of the invention there is provided a method for producing a binding member that binds IL-4Rα, which method comprises:\n\n\nproviding starting nucleic acid encoding a VH domain or a VL domain, or a starting repertoire of nucleic acids each encoding a VH or VL domain, wherein the VH or VL domains either comprise a CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 to be replaced or lack a CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 encoding region;\n\n\ncombining said starting nucleic acid or starting repertoire with donor nucleic acid or donor nucleic acids encoding or produced by mutation of the amino acid sequence of an CDR1, CDR2, and/or CDR3 of any of Antibodies 1-42, such that said donor nucleic acid is or donor nucleic acids are inserted into the CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 region in the starting nucleic acid or starting repertoire, so as to provide a product repertoire of nucleic acids encoding VH or VL domains;\n\n\nexpressing the nucleic acids of said product repertoire to produce product VH or VL domains;\n\n\noptionally combining said product VH or VL domains with one or more companion VL or VH domains;\n\n\nselecting a binding member for IL-4Rα, which binding member comprises a product VH or VL domain and optionally a companion VL or VH domain; and recovering said binding member or nucleic acid encoding it.\n\n\nIn particular embodiments the donor nucleic acid is produced by targeted or random mutagenesis of the VH or VL domains or any CDR region therein.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the product VH or VL domain is attached to an antibody constant region.\n\n\nIn another embodiment the product VH or VL domain and a companion VL or VH domain respectively, is comprised in an IgG, scFV or Fab antibody molecule.\n\n\nIn another embodiment the recovered binding member or antibody molecule is tested for ability to neutralise IL-4Rα.\n\n\nIn another embodiment the antibody molecule is formulated into a composition comprising at least one additional component. Such component could, for example, be an inert pharmaceutical excipient or carrier.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, a substantial portion of an immunoglobulin variable domain will comprise at least the three CDR regions, together with their intervening framework regions. The portion may also include at least about 50% of either or both of the first and fourth framework regions, the 50% being the C-terminal 50% of the first framework region and the N-terminal 50% of the fourth framework region. Additional residues at the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the substantial part of the variable domain may be those not normally associated with naturally occurring variable domain regions. For example, construction of binding members of the present invention made by recombinant DNA techniques may result in the introduction of N- or C-terminal residues encoded by linkers introduced to facilitate cloning or other manipulation steps. Other manipulation steps include the introduction of linkers to join variable domains of the invention to further protein sequences including antibody constant regions, other variable domains (for example in the production of diabodies) or detectable/functional labels as discussed in more detail elsewhere herein.\n\n\nAlthough in some aspects of the invention, binding members comprise a pair of VH and VL domains, single binding domains based on either VH or VL domain sequences form further aspects of the invention. It is known that single immunoglobulin domains, especially VH domains, are capable of binding target antigens in a specific manner. For example, see the discussion of dAbs above.\n\n\nIn the case of either of the single binding domains, these domains may be used to screen for complementary domains capable of forming a two-domain binding member able to bind IL-4Rα. This may be achieved by phage display screening methods using the so-called hierarchical dual combinatorial approach as disclosed in WO92/01047, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, in which an individual colony containing either an H or L chain clone is used to infect a complete library of clones encoding the other chain (L or H) and the resulting two-chain binding member is selected in accordance with phage display techniques such as those described in that reference. This technique is also disclosed in Marks et al. (Bio/Technology, 10:779-783, 1992).\n\n\nBinding members of the present invention may further comprise antibody constant regions or parts thereof, e.g. human antibody constant regions or parts thereof. For example, a VL domain may be attached at its C-terminal end to antibody light chain constant domains including human Cκ or Cλ chains, e.g. Cλ chains. Similarly, a binding member based on a VH domain may be attached at its C-terminal end to all or part (e.g. a CH1 domain) of an immunoglobulin heavy chain derived from any antibody isotype, e.g. IgG, IgA, IgD, IgY, IgE and IgM and any of the isotype sub-classes (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2; particularly IgG1 and IgG4). IgG1 is advantageous, due to its effector function and ease of manufacture. Any synthetic or other constant region variant that has these properties and stabilizes variable regions is also useful in embodiments of the present invention.\n\n\nThe term “isotype” refers to the classification of an antibody's heavy or light chain constant region. The constant domains of antibodies are not involved in binding to antigen, but exhibit various effector functions. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain constant region, a given human antibody or immunoglobulin can be assigned to one of five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. Several of these classes may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1 (gamma 1), IgG2 (gamma 2), IgG3 (gamma 3), and IgG4 (gamma 4), and IgA1 and IgA2. The heavy chain constant regions that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called α, δ, ε, γ, and μ, respectively. The structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well-known. Of the various human immunoglobulin classes, only human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, and IgM are known to activate complement. Human IgG1 and IgG3 are known to mediate ADCC in humans. Human light chain constant regions may be classified into two major classes, kappa and lambda.\n\n\nAntibody Format\n\n\nThe present invention also includes binding members of the invention, and in particular the antibodies of the invention, that have modified IgG constant domains. Antibodies of the human IgG class, which have functional characteristics such a long half-life in serum and the ability to mediate various effector functions are used in certain embodiments of the invention (\nMonoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Applications\n, Wiley-Liss, Inc., Chapter 1 (1995)). The human IgG class antibody is further classified into the following 4 subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. A large number of studies have so far been conducted for ADCC and CDC as effector functions of the IgG class antibody, and it has been reported that among antibodies of the human IgG class, the IgG1 subclass has the highest ADCC activity and CDC activity in humans (\nChemical Immunology, \n65, 88 (1997)).\n\n\n“Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity” and “ADCC” refer to a cell-mediated reaction in which non-specific cytotoxic cells (e.g., Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. In one embodiment, such cells are human cells. While not wishing to be limited to any particular mechanism of action, these cytotoxic cells that mediate ADCC generally express Fc receptors (FcRs). The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcγRIII, whereas monocytes express FcγRI, FcγRII, FcγRIII and/or FcγRIV. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol., 9:457-92 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecules of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 95:652-656 (1998).\n\n\nComplement dependent cytotoxicity” or “CDC” refers to the ability of a molecule to initiate complement activation and lyse a target in the presence of complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (C1q) to a molecule (e.g., an antibody) complexed with a cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g., as described in Gazzano-Santaro et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 202:163 (1996), may be performed.\n\n\nExpression of ADCC activity and CDC activity of the human IgG1 subclass antibodies generally involves binding of the Fc region of the antibody to a receptor for an antibody (hereinafter referred to as “FcγR”) existing on the surface of effector cells such as killer cells, natural killer cells or activated macrophages. Various complement components can be bound. Regarding the binding, it has been suggested that several amino acid residues in the hinge region and the second domain of C region (hereinafter referred to as “Cγ2 domain”) of the antibody are important (\nEur. J. Immunol., \n23, 1098 (1993), \nImmunology, \n86, 319 (1995), \nChemical Immunology, \n65, 88 (1997)) and that a sugar chain in the Cγ2 domain (\nChemical Immunology, \n65, 88 (1997)) is also important.\n\n\n“Effector cells” are leukocytes that express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. The cells express at least FcγRI, FCγRII, FcγRIII and/or FcγRIV and carry out ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils.\n\n\nThe terms “Fc receptor” or “FcR” are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. In one embodiment, the FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, in certain embodiments, the FcR is one that binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcγRI, FcγRII, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. FcγRII receptors include FcγRIIA (an “activating receptor”) and FcγRIIB (an “inhibiting receptor”), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor FcγRIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor FcγRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. (See, Daëron, Annu. Rev. Immunol., 15:203-234 (1997)). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol., 9:457-92 (1991); Capel et al., Immunomethods, 4:25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med., 126:330-41 (1995). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term “FcR” herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., Immunol., 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., J. Immunol., 24:249 (1994)).\n\n\nAnti-IL-4Rα antibodies can be modified with respect to effector function, e.g., so as to enhance ADCC and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in the Fc region of an antibody. Cysteine residue(s) may also be introduced in the Fc region, allowing for interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. In this way a homodimeric antibody can be generated that may have improved internalization capability and or increased complement-mediated cell killing and ADCC (Caron et al., \nJ. Exp. Med., \n176:1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, \nJ. Immunol, \n148:2918-2922 (1992)). Heterobifunctional cross-linkers can also be used to generate homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity (Wolff et al., \nCancer Research, \n53:2560-2565 (1993)). Antibodies can also be engineered to have two or more Fc regions resulting in enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities (Stevenson et al., \nAnti\n-\nCancer Drug Design\n, (3): 219-230 (1989)).\n\n\nOther methods of engineering Fc regions of antibodies so as to alter effector functions are known in the art (e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040185045 and PCT Publication No. WO 2004/016750, both to Koenig et al., which describe altering the Fc region to enhance the binding affinity for FcγRIIB as compared with the binding affinity for FCγRIIA; see also PCT Publication Nos. WO 99/58572 to Armour et al., WO 99/51642 to Idusogie et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 6,395,272 to Deo et al.; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entireties). Methods of modifying the Fc region to decrease binding affinity to FcγRIIB are also known in the art (e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 20010036459 and PCT Publication No. WO 01/79299, both to Ravetch et al., the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entireties). Modified antibodies having variant Fc regions with enhanced binding affinity for FcγRIIIA and/or FcγRIIA as compared with a wildtype Fc region have also been described (e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 2004/063351, to Stavenhagen et al.; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety).\n\n\nAt least four different types of FcγR have been found, which are respectively called FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32), FcγRIII (CD16), and FcγRIV. In human, FcγRII and FcγRIII are further classified into FcγRIIa and FcγRIIb, and FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIIb, respectively. FcγR is a membrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, FcγRII, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV have an α chain having an extracellular region containing two immunoglobulin-like domains, FcγRI has an α chain having an extracellular region containing three immunoglobulin-like domains, as a constituting component, and the α chain is involved in the IgG binding activity. In addition, FcγRI and FcγRIII have a γ chain or ζ chain as a constituting component which has a signal transduction function in association with the α chain (\nAnnu. Rev. Immunol., \n18, 709 (2000), \nAnnu. Rev. Immunol., \n19, 275 (2001)). FcγRIV has been described by Bruhns et al., \nClin. Invest. Med\n., (Canada) 27:3 D (2004).\n\n\nTo assess ADCC activity of an anti-IL-4Rα antibody of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay can be used, such as that described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337. The assay may also be performed using a commercially available kit, \ne.g. CytoTox\n 96 ® (Promega). Useful effector cells for such assays include, but are not limited to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), Natural Killer (NK) cells, and NK cell lines. NK cell lines expressing a transgenic Fc receptor (e.g. CD16) and associated signaling polypeptide (e.g. FCεRI-γ) may also serve as effector cells (see, e.g. WO 2006/023148 A2 to Campbell). For example, the ability of any particular antibody to mediate lysis of the target cell by complement activation and/or ADCC can be assayed. The cells of interest are grown and labeled in vitro; the antibody is added to the cell culture in combination with immune cells which may be activated by the antigen antibody complexes; i.e., effector cells involved in the ADCC response. The antibody can also be tested for complement activation. In either case, cytolysis of the target cells is detected by the release of label from the lysed cells. The extent of target cell lysis may also be determined by detecting the release of cytoplasmic proteins (e.g. LDH) into the supernatant. In fact, antibodies can be screened using the patient's own serum as a source of complement and/or immune cells. The antibodies that are capable of mediating human ADCC in the in vitro test can then be used therapeutically in that particular patient. ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may also be assessed in vivo, e.g., in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci\n. (USA) 95:652-656 (1998). Moreover, techniques for modulating (i.e., increasing or decreasing) the level of ADCC, and optionally CDC activity, of an antibody are well-known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551. Antibodies of the present invention may be capable or may have been modified to have the ability of inducing ADCC and/or CDC. Assays to determine ADCC function can be practiced using human effector cells to assess human ADCC function. Such assays may also include those intended to screen for antibodies that induce, mediate, enhance, block cell death by necrotic and/or apoptotic mechanisms. Such methods including assays utilizing viable dyes, methods of detecting and analyzing caspases, and assays measuring DNA breaks can be used to assess the apoptotic activity of cells cultured in vitro with an anti-IL-4Rα antibody of interest.\n\n\nFor example, Annexin V or TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays can be carried out as described in Decker et al., \nBlood \n(USA) 103:2718-2725 (2004) to detect apoptotic activity. The TUNEL assay involves culturing the cell of interest with fluorescein-labeled dUTP for incorporation into DNA strand breaks. The cells are then processed for analysis by flow cytometry. The Annexin V assay detects the appearance of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outside of the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells using a fluorescein-conjugated Annexin V that specifically recognizes the exposed PS molecules. Concurrently, a viable dye such as propidium iodide can be used to exclude late apoptotic cells. The cells are stained with the labeled Annexin V and are analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\n\nThus according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided binding members, in particular antibodies, which have been modified so as to change, i.e. increase, decrease or eliminate, the biological effector function of the binding members, for example antibodies with modified Fc regions.

Optionally, the Fc region may comprise a non-native amino acid residue at additional and/or alternative positions known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,821; 6,277,375; 6,737,056; PCT Patent Publications WO 01/58957; WO 02/06919; WO 04/016750; WO 04/029207; WO 04/035752; WO 04/074455; WO 04/099249; WO 04/063351; WO 05/070963; WO 05/040217, WO 05/092925 and WO 06/020114).\n\n\nBy “non-native amino acid residue”, we mean an amino acid residue that is not present at the recited position in the naturally occurring protein. Typically, this will mean that the or a native/natural amino acid residue has been substituted for one or more other residues, which may comprise one of the other 20 naturally-occurring (common) amino acids or a non-classical amino acids or a chemical amino acid analog. Non-classical amino acids include, but are not limited to, the D-isomers of the common amino acids, α-amino isobutyric acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, Abu, 2-amino butyric acid, γ-Abu, ε-Ahx, 6-amino hexanoic acid, Aib, 2-amino isobutyric acid, 3-amino propionic acid, ornithine, norleucine, norvaline, hydroxyproline, sarcosine, citrulline, cysteic acid, t-butylglycine, t-butylalanine, phenylglycine, cyclohexylalanine, β-alanine, fluoro-amino acids, designer amino acids such as β-methyl amino acids, Cα-methyl amino acids, Nα-methyl amino acids, and amino acid analogs in general.\n\n\nIn a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a binding member with an variant Fc region or a formulation comprising such binding member with an variant Fc region, wherein the Fc region comprises at least one non-native amino acid residue selected from the group consisting of 234D, 234E, 234N, 234Q, 234T, 234H, 234Y, 2341, 234V, 234F, 235A, 235D, 235R, 235W, 235P, 235S, 235N, 235Q, 235T, 235H, 235Y, 2351, 235V, 235F, 236E, 239D, 239E, 239N, 239Q, 239F, 239T, 239H, 239Y, 2401, 240A, 240T, 240M, 241W, 241 L, 241Y, 241E, 241R. 243W, 243L 243Y, 243R, 243Q, 244H, 245A, 247L, 247V, 247G, 251F, 252Y, 254T, 255L, 256E, 256M, 2621, 262A, 262T, 262E, 2631, 263A, 263T, 263M, 264L, 2641, 264W, 264T, 264R, 264F, 264M, 264Y, 264E, 265G, 265N, 265Q, 265Y, 265F, 265V, 2651, 265L, 265H, 265T, 2661, 266A, 266T, 266M, 267Q, 267L, 268E, 269H, 269Y, 269F, 269R, 270E, 280A, 284M, 292P, 292L, 296E, 296Q, 296D, 296N, 296S, 296T, 296L, 2961, 296H, 269G, 297S, 297D, 297E, 298H, 2981, 298T, 298F, 2991, 299L, 299A, 299S, 299V, 299H, 299F, 299E, 3051, 313F, 316D, 325Q, 325L, 3251, 325D, 325E, 325A, 325T, 325V, 325H, 327G, 327W, 327N, 327L, 328S, 328M, 328D, 328E, 328N, 328Q, 328F, 3281, 328V, 328T, 328H, 328A, 329F, 329H, 329Q, 330K, 330G, 330T, 330C, 330L, 330Y, 330V, 3301, 330F, 330R, 330H, 331G, 331A, 331L, 331M, 331F, 331W, 331K, 331Q, 331E, 331S, 331V, 331I, 331C, 331Y, 331H, 331R, 331N, 331D, 331T, 332D, 332S, 332W, 332F, 332E, 332N, 332Q, 332T, 332H, 332Y, 332A, 339T, 370E, 370N, 378D, 392T, 396L, 416G, 419H, 421K, 440Y and 434W as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat. Optionally, the Fc region may comprise additional and/or alternative non-native amino acid residues known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,821; 6,277,375; 6,737,056; PCT Patent Publications WO 01/58957; WO 02/06919; WO 04/016750; WO 04/029207; WO 04/035752 and WO 05/040217).\n\n\nIt will be understood that Fc region as used herein includes the polypeptides comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA, IgD, and IgG, and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM, and the flexible hinge N-terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM Fc may include the J chain. For IgG, Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains Cgamma2 and Cgamma3 (Cγ2 and Cγ3) and the hinge between Cgamma1 (Cγ1) and Cgamma2 (Cγ2). Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to comprise residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl-terminus, wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat et al. (1991, NIH Publication 91-3242, National Technical Information Service, Springfield, Va.). The “EU index as set forth in Kabat” refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody as described in Kabat et al. supra. Fc may refer to this region in isolation, or this region in the context of an antibody, antibody fragment, or Fc fusion protein. An variant Fc protein may be an antibody, Fc fusion, or any protein or protein domain that comprises an Fc region including, but not limited to, proteins comprising variant Fc regions, which are non naturally occurring variants of an Fc.\n\n\nThe present invention encompasses binding members with variant Fc regions, which have altered binding properties for an Fc ligand (e.g., an Fc receptor, C1q) relative to a comparable molecule (e.g., a protein having the same amino acid sequence except having a wild type Fc region). Examples of binding properties include but are not limited to, binding specificity, equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n), dissociation and association rates (k\noff \nand k\non \nrespectively), binding affinity and/or avidity. It is generally understood that a binding molecule (e.g., a variant Fc protein such as an antibody) with a low K\nD \nmay be preferable to a binding molecule with a high K\nD\n. However, in some instances the value of the k\non \nor k\noff \nmay be more relevant than the value of the K\nD\n. One skilled in the art can determine which kinetic parameter is most important for a given antibody application.\n\n\nThe affinities and binding properties of an Fc domain for its ligand may be determined by a variety of in vitro assay methods (biochemical or immunological based assays) known in the art for determining Fc-FcγR interactions, i.e., specific binding of an Fc region to an FcγR including but not limited to, equilibrium methods (e.g., enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), or radioimmunoassay (RIA)), or kinetics (e.g., BIACORE® analysis), and other methods such as indirect binding assays, competitive inhibition assays, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), gel electrophoresis and chromatography (e.g., gel filtration). These and other methods may utilize a label on one or more of the components being examined and/or employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic, fluorescent, luminescent, or isotopic labels. A detailed description of binding affinities and kinetics can be found in Paul, W. E., ed., Fundamental Immunology, 4th Ed., Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia (1999), which focuses on antibody-immunogen interactions. The serum half-life of proteins comprising Fc regions may be increased by increasing the binding affinity of the Fc region for FcRn. In one embodiment, the Fc variant protein has enhanced serum half-life relative to comparable molecule.\n\n\nThe term “antibody half-life” as used herein means a pharmacokinetic property of an antibody that is a measure of the mean survival time of antibody molecules following their administration. Antibody half-life can be expressed as the time required to eliminate 50 percent of a known quantity of immunoglobulin from the patient's body or a specific compartment thereof, for example, as measured in serum or plasma, i.e., circulating half-life, or in other tissues. Half-life may vary from one immunoglobulin or class of immunoglobulin to another. In general, an increase in antibody half-life results in an increase in mean residence time (MRT) in circulation for the antibody administered.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the half-life of an anti-IL-4Rα antibody or compositions and methods of the invention is at least about 4 to 7 days. In certain embodiments, the mean half-life of an anti-IL-4Rα antibody of compositions and methods of the invention is at least about 2 to 5 days, 3 to 6 days, 4 to 7 days, 5 to 8 days, 6 to 9 days, 7 to 10 days, 8 to 11 days, 8 to 12, 9 to 13, 10 to 14, 11 to 15, 12 to 16, 13 to 17, 14 to 18, 15 to 19, or 16 to 20 days. In other embodiments, the mean half-life of an anti-IL-4Rα antibody of compositions and methods of the invention is at least about 17 to 21 days, 18 to 22 days, 19 to 23 days, 20 to 24 days, 21 to 25, days, 22 to 26 days, 23 to 27 days, 24 to 28 days, 25 to 29 days, or 26 to 30 days. In still further embodiments the half-life of an anti-IL-4Rα antibody of compositions and methods of the invention can be up to about 50 days. In certain embodiments, the half-lives of antibodies of compositions and methods of the invention can be prolonged by methods known in the art. Such prolongation can in turn reduce the amount and/or frequency of dosing of the antibody compositions. Antibodies with improved in vivo half-lives and methods for preparing them are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,375, U.S. Pat. No. 7,083,784; and International Publication Nos. WO 98/23289 and WO 97/3461.\n\n\nThe serum circulation of anti-IL-4Rα antibodies in vivo may also be prolonged by attaching inert polymer molecules such as high molecular weight polyethyleneglycol (PEG) to the antibodies with or without a multifunctional linker either through site-specific conjugation of the PEG to the N- or C-terminus of the antibodies or via epsilon-amino groups present on lysyl residues. Linear or branched polymer derivatization that results in minimal loss of biological activity will be used. The degree of conjugation can be closely monitored by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry to ensure proper conjugation of PEG molecules to the antibodies. Unreacted PEG can be separated from antibody-PEG conjugates by size-exclusion or by ion-exchange chromatography. PEG-derivatized antibodies can be tested for binding activity as well as for in vivo efficacy using methods known to those of skill in the art, for example, by immunoassays described herein.\n\n\nFurther, the antibodies of compositions and methods of the invention can be conjugated to albumin in order to make the antibody more stable in vivo or have a longer half-life in vivo. The techniques are well known in the art, see, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 93/15199, WO 93/15200, and WO 01/77137; and European Patent No. EP 413, 622, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the half-life of a binding member or antibody as disclosed herein and of compositions of the invention is at least about 4 to 7 days.

For example, amino acid substitutions and/or deletions can be generated by mutagenesis methods, including, but not limited to, site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:488-492, 1985), PCR mutagenesis (Higuchi, in “PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications”, Academic Press, San Diego, pp. 177-183, 1990), and cassette mutagenesis (Wells et al., Gene 34:315-323, 1985). Preferably, site-directed mutagenesis is performed by the overlap-extension PCR method (Higuchi, in “PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification”, Stockton Press, New York, pp. 61-70, 1989). The technique of overlap-extension PCR (Higuchi, ibid.) can also be used to introduce any desired mutation(s) into a target sequence (the starting DNA). For example, the first round of PCR in the overlap-extension method involves amplifying the target sequence with an outside primer (primer 1) and an internal mutagenesis primer (primer 3), and separately with a second outside primer (primer 4) and an internal primer (primer 2), yielding two PCR segments (segments A and B). The internal mutagenesis primer (primer 3) is designed to contain mismatches to the target sequence specifying the desired mutation(s). In the second round of PCR, the products of the first round of PCR (segments A and B) are amplified by PCR using the two outside primers (\nprimers\n 1 and 4). The resulting full-length PCR segment (segment C) is digested with restriction enzymes and the resulting restriction fragment is cloned into an appropriate vector. As the first step of mutagenesis, the starting DNA (e.g., encoding an Fc fusion protein, an antibody or simply an Fc region), is operably cloned into a mutagenesis vector. The primers are designed to reflect the desired amino acid substitution. Other methods useful for the generation of variant Fc regions are known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,821; 5,885,573; 5,677,425; 6,165,745; 6,277,375; 5,869,046; 6,121,022; 5,624,821; 5,648,260; 6,528,624; 6,194,551; 6,737,056; 6,821,505; 6,277,375; U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2004/0002587 and PCT Publications WO 94/29351; WO 99/58572; WO 00/42072; WO 02/060919; WO 04/029207; WO 04/099249; WO 04/063351; WO 06/23403).\n\n\nIn some embodiments of the invention, the glycosylation patterns of the binding members provided herein are modified to enhance ADCC and CDC effector function. (See Shields R L et al., (JBC. 277:26733-26740, 2002; Shinkawa T et al., JBC. 278:3466-3473, 2003; and Okazaki A et al., J. Mol. Biol., 336:1239, 2004). In some embodiments, an Fc variant protein comprises one or more engineered glycoforms, i.e., a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to the molecule comprising an Fc region. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to enhancing or reducing effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by any method known to one skilled in the art, for example by using engineered or variant expression strains, by co-expression with one or more enzymes, for example DI N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTI11), by expressing a molecule comprising an Fc region in various organisms or cell lines from various organisms, or by modifying carbohydrate(s) after the molecule comprising Fc region has been expressed. Methods for generating engineered glycoforms are known in the art, and include but are not limited to those described in Umana et al, Nat. Biotechnol 17:176-180, 1999; Davies et al., Biotechnol Bioeng 74:288-294, 2007; Shields et al, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740, 2002; Shinkawa et al., J Biol Chem 278:3466-3473, 2003) U.S. Pat.

A label can be any molecule that produces or can be induced to produce a signal, including but not limited to fluorescers, radiolabels, enzymes, chemiluminescers or photosensitizers. Thus, binding may be detected and/or measured by detecting fluorescence or luminescence, radioactivity, enzyme activity or light absorbance.\n\n\nSuitable labels include, by way of illustration and not limitation, enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (“G6PDH”) and horseradish peroxidase; dyes; fluorescers, such as fluorescein, rhodamine compounds, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaldehyde, fluorescamine, fluorophores such as lanthanide cryptates and chelates (Perkin Elmer and C is Biointernational); chemiluminescers such as isoluminol; sensitizers; coenzymes; enzyme substrates; radiolabels including but not limited to \n125\nI, \n131\nI, \n35\nS, \n32\nP, \n14\nC, \n3\nH, \n57\nCo, \n99\nTc and \n75\nSe and other radiolabels mentioned herein; particles such as latex or carbon particles; metal sol; crystallite; liposomes; cells, etc., which may be further labelled with a dye, catalyst or other detectable group. Suitable enzymes and coenzymes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,318,980, each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. Suitable fluorescers and chemiluminescers are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Labels further include chemical moieties such as biotin that may be detected via binding to a specific cognate detectable moiety, e.g. labelled avidin or streptavidin. Detectable labels may be attached to antibodies of the invention using conventional chemistry known in the art.\n\n\nThere are numerous methods by which the label can produce a signal detectable by external means, for example, by visual examination, electromagnetic radiation, heat, and chemical reagents. The label can also be bound to another binding member that binds the antibody of the invention, or to a support.\n\n\nThe label can directly produce a signal, and therefore, additional components are not required to produce a signal. Numerous organic molecules, for example fluorescers, are able to absorb ultraviolet and visible light, where the light absorption transfers energy to these molecules and elevates them to an excited energy state. This absorbed energy is then dissipated by emission of light at a second wavelength. This second wavelength emission may also transfer energy to a labelled acceptor molecule, and the resultant energy dissipated from the acceptor molecule by emission of light for example fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Other labels that directly produce a signal include radioactive isotopes and dyes.\n\n\nAlternately, the label may need other components to produce a signal, and the signal producing system would then include all the components required to produce a measurable signal, which may include substrates, coenzymes, enhancers, additional enzymes, substances that react with enzymic products, catalysts, activators, cofactors, inhibitors, scavengers, metal ions, and a specific binding substance required for binding of signal generating substances. A detailed discussion of suitable signal producing systems can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,243, which is herein incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nThe binding member, antibody, or one of its functional fragments, can be present in the form of an immunoconjugate so as to obtain a detectable and/or quantifiable signal. The immunoconjugates can be conjugated, for example, with enzymes such as peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, alpha-D-galactosidase, glucose oxydase, glucose amylase, carbonic anhydrase, acetylcholinesterase, lysozyme, malate dehydrogenase or glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase or by a molecule such as biotin, digoxygenin or 5-bromodeoxyuridine. Fluorescent labels can be likewise conjugated to the immunoconjugates or to their functional fragments according to the invention and especially include fluorescein and its derivatives, fluorochrome, rhodamine and its derivatives, GFP (GFP for “Green Fluorescent Protein”), dansyl, umbelliferone, Lanthanide chelates or cryptates eg. Europium etc.\n\n\nThe immunoconjugates or their functional fragments can be prepared by methods known to the person skilled in the art. They can be coupled to the enzymes or to the fluorescent labels directly or by the intermediary of a spacer group or of a linking group such as a polyaldehyde, like glutaraldehyde, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid (DPTA), or in the presence of coupling agents such as those mentioned above for the therapeutic conjugates. The conjugates containing labels of fluorescein type can be prepared by reaction with an isothiocyanate. Other immunoconjugates can likewise include chemoluminescent labels such as luminol and the dioxetanes, bio-luminescent labels such as luciferase and luciferin, or else radioactive labels such as iodine123, iodine125, iodine126, iodine131, iodine133, bromine77, technetium99m, indium111, indium 113m, gallium67, \ngallium\n 68, sulphur35, phosphorus32, carbonl4, tritium (hydrogen3), cobalt57, selenium75, ruthenium95, ruthenium97, ruthenium103, ruthenium105, mercury107, mercury203, rhenium99m, \nrhenium\n 101, rhenium105, scandium47, tellurium121 m, tellurium122m, tellurium125m, thulium165, thulium167, thulium168, fluorine8, yttrium 199. The methods known to the person skilled in the art existing for coupling the therapeutic radioisotopes to the antibodies either directly or via a chelating agent such as EDTA, DTPA mentioned above can be used for the radioelements which can be used in diagnosis. It is likewise possible to mention labelling with Na[I 125] by the chloramine T method (Hunter and Greenwood, Nature, 194:495, 1962) or else with technetium99m by the technique of Crockford et al., (U.S. Pat. No. 4,424,200, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety) or attached via DTPA as described by Hnatowich (U.S. Pat. No. 4,479,930, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Further immunoconjugates can include a toxin moiety such as for example a toxin moiety selected from a group of \nPseudomonas \nexotoxin (PE or a cytotoxic fragment or mutant thereof), Diptheria toxin or a cytotoxic fragment or mutant thereof, a botulinum toxin A through F, ricin or a cytotoxic fragment thereof, abrin or a cytotoxic fragment thereof, saporin or a cytotoxic fragment thereof, pokeweed antiviral toxin or a cytotoxic fragment thereof and \nbryodin\n 1 or a cytotoxic fragment thereof.\n\n\nThe present invention provides a method comprising causing or allowing binding of a binding member as provided herein to IL-4Rα. As noted, such binding may take place in vivo, e.g. following administration of a binding member, or nucleic acid encoding a binding member, or it may take place in vitro, for example in ELISA, Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, immuno-precipitation, affinity chromatography, and biochemical or cell based assays such as are described herein. The invention also provides for measuring levels of antigen directly, by employing a binding member according to the invention for example in a biosensor system.\n\n\nFor instance, the present invention comprises a method of detecting and/or measuring binding to IL-4Rα, comprising, (i) exposing said binding member to IL-4Rα and (ii) detecting binding of said binding member to IL-4Rα, wherein binding is detected using any method or detectable label described herein. This, and any other binding detection method described herein, may be interpreted directly by the person performing the method, for instance, by visually observing a detectable label. Alternatively, this method, or any other binding detection method described herein, may produce a report in the form of an autoradiograph, a photograph, a computer printout, a flow cytometry report, a graph, a chart, a test tube or container or well containing the result, or any other visual or physical representation of a result of the method.\n\n\nThe amount of binding of binding member to IL-4Rα may be determined. Quantification may be related to the amount of the antigen in a test sample, which may be of diagnostic interest. Screening for IL-4Rα binding and/or the quantification thereof may be useful, for instance, in screening patients for diseases or disorders associated with IL-4Rα, such as are referred to elsewhere herein. In one embodiment, among others, a diagnostic method of the invention comprises (i) obtaining a tissue or fluid sample from a subject, (ii) exposing said tissue or fluid sample to one or more binding members of the present invention; and (iii) detecting bound IL-4Rα as compared to a control sample, wherein an increase in the amount of IL-4Rα binding as compared to the control may indicate an aberrant level of IL-4Rα expression or activity. Tissue or fluid samples to be tested include blood, serum, urine, biopsy material, tumours, or any tissue suspected of containing aberrant IL-4Rα levels. Subjects testing positive for aberrant IL-4Rα levels or activity may also benefit from the treatment methods disclosed later herein.\n\n\nThose skilled in the art are able to choose a suitable mode of determining binding of the binding member to an antigen according to their preference and general knowledge, in light of the methods disclosed herein.\n\n\nThe reactivities of binding members in a sample may be determined by any appropriate means. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) is one possibility. Radioactive labelled antigen is mixed with unlabelled antigen (the test sample) and allowed to bind to the binding member. Bound antigen is physically separated from unbound antigen and the amount of radioactive antigen bound to the binding member determined. The more antigen there is in the test sample the less radioactive antigen will bind to the binding member. A competitive binding assay may also be used with non-radioactive antigen, using antigen or an analogue linked to a reporter molecule. The reporter molecule may be a fluorochrome, phosphor or laser dye with spectrally isolated absorption or emission characteristics. Suitable fluorochromes include fluorescein, rhodamine, phycoerythrin, Texas Red, and lanthanide chelates or cryptates. Suitable chromogenic dyes include diaminobenzidine.\n\n\nOther reporters include macromolecular colloidal particles or particulate material such as latex beads that are coloured, magnetic or paramagnetic, and biologically or chemically active agents that can directly or indirectly cause detectable signals to be visually observed, electronically detected or otherwise recorded. These molecules may be enzymes, which catalyze reactions that develop, or change colours or cause changes in electrical properties, for example. They may be molecularly excitable, such that electronic transitions between energy states result in characteristic spectral absorptions or emissions. They may include chemical entities used in conjunction with biosensors. Biotin/avidin or biotin/streptavidin and alkaline phosphatase detection systems may be employed.\n\n\nThe signals generated by individual binding member-reporter conjugates may be used to derive quantifiable absolute or relative data of the relevant binding member binding in samples (normal and test).\n\n\nA kit comprising a binding member according to any aspect or embodiment of the present invention is also provided as an aspect of the present invention. In the kit, the binding member may be labelled to allow its reactivity in a sample to be determined, e.g. as described further below. Further the binding member may or may not be attached to a solid support. Components of a kit are generally sterile and in sealed vials or other containers. Kits may be employed in diagnostic analysis or other methods for which binding members are useful. A kit may contain instructions for use of the components in a method, e.g. a method in accordance with the present invention. Ancillary materials to assist in or to enable performing such a method may be included within a kit of the invention. The ancillary materials include a second, different binding member, which binds to the first binding member and is conjugated to a detectable label (e.g., a fluorescent label, radioactive isotope or enzyme). Antibody-based kits may also comprise beads for conducting an immunoprecipitation. Each component of the kits is generally in its own suitable container. Thus, these kits generally comprise distinct containers suitable for each binding member. Further, the kits may comprise instructions for performing the assay and methods for interpreting and analyzing the data resulting from the performance of the assay.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides the use of a binding member as above for measuring antigen levels in a competition assay, that is to say a method of measuring the level of antigen in a sample by employing a binding member as provided by the present invention in a competition assay. This may be where the physical separation of bound from unbound antigen is not required. Linking a reporter molecule to the binding member so that a physical or optical change occurs on binding is one possibility. The reporter molecule may directly or indirectly generate detectable signals, which may be quantifiable. The linkage of reporter molecules may be directly or indirectly, covalently, e.g. via a peptide bond or non-covalently. Linkage via a peptide bond may be as a result of recombinant expression of a gene fusion encoding antibody and reporter molecule.\n\n\nFor example, the present invention includes a method of identifying an IL-4Rα binding compound, comprising (i) immobilizing IL-4Rα to a support, (ii) contacting said immobilized IL-4Rα simultaneously or in a step-wise manner with at least one tagged or labelled binding member according to the invention and one or more untagged or unlabelled test binding compounds, and (iii) identifying a new IL-4Rα binding compound by observing a decrease in the amount of bound tag from the tagged binding member.\n\n\nAn alternative method of identifying an IL-4Rα binding compound may comprise (i) immobilizing binding member to a support, (ii) contacting said immobilized binding member simultaneously or in a step-wise manner with tagged IL-4Rα and one or more untagged or unlabelled test binding members or binding compounds, (iii) identifying a new IL-4Rα binding compound by observing a decrease in the amount of bound tag from the tagged IL-4Rα.\n\n\nSuch methods can be performed in a high-throughput manner using a multiwell or array format. Such assays may also be performed in solution for example as an HTRF® assay as described in Example 4.3. See, for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,814,468, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. As described above, detection of binding may be interpreted directly by the person performing the method, for instance, by visually observing a detectable label, or a decrease in the presence thereof. Alternatively, the binding methods of the invention may produce a report in the form of an autoradiograph, a photograph, a computer printout, a flow cytometry report, a graph, a chart, a test tube or container or well containing the result, or any other visual or physical representation of a result of the method.\n\n\nCompetition assays can also be used in epitope mapping. In one instance epitope mapping may be used to identify the epitope bound by an IL-4Rα binding member, which optionally may have optimized neutralizing and/or modulating characteristics. Such an epitope can be linear or conformational. A conformational epitope can comprise at least two different fragments of IL-4Rα, wherein said fragments are positioned in proximity to each other when IL-4Rα is folded in its tertiary or quaternary structure to form a conformational epitope which is recognized by an inhibitor of IL-4Rα, such as an IL-4Rα binding member. In testing for competition a peptide fragment of the antigen may be employed, especially a peptide including or consisting essentially of an epitope of interest. A peptide having the epitope sequence plus one or more amino acids at either end may be used. Binding members according to the present invention may be such that their binding for antigen is inhibited by a peptide with or including the sequence given.\n\n\nThe present invention further provides an isolated nucleic acid encoding a binding member of the present invention. Nucleic acid may include DNA and/or RNA. In one aspect, the present invention provides a nucleic acid that codes for a CDR or set of CDRs or VH domain or VL domain or antibody antigen-binding site or antibody molecule, e.g. scFv or IgG, e.g. IgG1, IgG2 or IgG4, of the invention as defined above.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides constructs in the form of plasmids, vectors, transcription or expression cassettes which comprise at least one polynucleotide as above.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides a recombinant host cell that comprises one or more constructs as above. A nucleic acid encoding any CDR or set of CDRs or VH domain or VL domain or antibody antigen-binding site or antibody molecule, e.g. scFv or IgG1, IgG2 or IgG4 as provided, itself forms an aspect of the present invention, as does a method of production of the encoded product, which method comprises expression from encoding nucleic acid. Expression may conveniently be achieved by culturing under appropriate conditions recombinant host cells containing the nucleic acid. Following production by expression a VH or VL domain, or binding member may be isolated and/or purified using any suitable technique, then used as appropriate.\n\n\nNucleic acid according to the present invention may comprise DNA or RNA and may be wholly or partially synthetic. Reference to a nucleotide sequence as set out herein encompasses a DNA molecule with the specified sequence, and encompasses a RNA molecule with the specified sequence in which U is substituted for T, unless context requires otherwise.\n\n\nA yet further aspect provides a method of production of an antibody VH variable domain, the method including causing expression from encoding nucleic acid. Such a method may comprise culturing host cells under conditions for production of said antibody VH variable domain.\n\n\nAnalogous methods for production of VL variable domains and binding members comprising a VH and/or VL domain are provided as further aspects of the present invention.\n\n\nA method of production may comprise a step of isolation and/or purification of the product. A method of production may comprise formulating the product into a composition including at least one additional component, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\n\n\nSystems for cloning and expression of a polypeptide in a variety of different host cells are well known. Suitable host cells include bacteria, mammalian cells, plant cells, filamentous fungi, yeast and baculovirus systems and transgenic plants and animals. The expression of antibodies and antibody fragments in prokaryotic cells is well established in the art. For a review, see for example Plückthun 1991. A common bacterial host is \nE. coli. \n \n\n\nExpression in eukaryotic cells in culture is also available to those skilled in the art as an option for production of a binding member for example Chadd & Chamow (Current Opinion in Biotechnology 12:188-194, 2001), Andersen & Krummen (Current Opinion in Biotechnology 13:117, 2002) and Larrick & Thomas (Current Opinion in Biotechnology 12:411-418, 2001). Mammalian cell lines available in the art for expression of a heterologous polypeptide include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney cells, NS0 mouse melanoma cells, YB2/0 rat myeloma cells, human embryonic kidney cells, human embryonic retina cells and many others.\n\n\nSuitable vectors can be chosen or constructed, containing appropriate regulatory sequences, including promoter sequences, terminator sequences, polyadenylation sequences, enhancer sequences, marker genes and other sequences as appropriate. Vectors may be plasmids e.g. phagemid, or viral e.g. ‘phage, as appropriate. For further details see, for example, Sambrook & Russell (Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual: 3rd edition, 2001, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press). Many known techniques and protocols for manipulation of nucleic acid, for example in preparation of nucleic acid constructs, mutagenesis, sequencing, introduction of DNA into cells and gene expression, and analysis of proteins, are described in detail in Ausubel et al. eds., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology: A Compendium of Methods from Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, 4\nth \nedition 1999.\n\n\nA further aspect of the present invention provides a host cell containing nucleic acid as disclosed herein. Such a host cell may be in vitro and may be in culture. Such a host cell may be in vivo. In vivo presence of the host cell may allow intracellular expression of the binding members of the present invention as “intrabodies” or intracellular antibodies. Intrabodies may be used for gene therapy.\n\n\nA still further aspect provides a method comprising introducing nucleic acid of the invention into a host cell. The introduction may employ any available technique. For eukaryotic cells, suitable techniques may include calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-Dextran, electroporation, liposome-mediated transfection and transduction using retrovirus or other virus, e.g. vaccinia or, for insect cells, baculovirus. Introducing nucleic acid in the host cell, in particular a eukaryotic cell may use a viral or a plasmid based system. The plasmid system may be maintained episomally or may incorporated into the host cell or into an artificial chromosome. Incorporation may be either by random or targeted integration of one or more copies at single or multiple loci. For bacterial cells, suitable techniques may include calcium chloride transformation, electroporation and transfection using bacteriophage.\n\n\nThe introduction may be followed by causing or allowing expression from the nucleic acid, e.g. by culturing host cells under conditions for expression of the gene. The purification of the expressed product may be achieved by methods known to one of skill in the art.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the nucleic acid of the invention is integrated into the genome (e.g. chromosome) of the host cell. Integration may be promoted by inclusion of sequences that promote recombination with the genome, in accordance with standard techniques.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides a method that comprises using a construct as stated above in an expression system in order to express a binding member or polypeptide as above.\n\n\nBinding members of the present invention may be used in methods of diagnosis or treatment in human or animal subjects, e.g. human. For instance, binding members may be used in diagnosis or treatment of IL-4Rα-associated diseases or disorders, examples of which are referred to elsewhere herein.\n\n\nParticular conditions for which a binding member of the invention may be used in treatment or diagnosis include: asthma, COPD (including chronic bronchitis, small airway disease and emphysema), inflammatory bowel disease, fibrotic conditions (including systemic sclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, parasite-induced liver fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis, allergy (including for example atopic dermatitis and food allergy), transplation therapy to prevent transplant rejection, as well as suppression of delayed-type hypersensitivity or contact hypersensitivity reactions, as adjuvants to allergy immunotherapy and as vaccine adjuvants.\n\n\nThus, binding members of the invention are useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of conditions involving IL-4, IL-13 or IL-4Rα expression and/or activity. One embodiment, among others, is a method of treatment comprising administering an effective amount of a binding member of the invention to a patient in need thereof, wherein functional consequences of IL-4Rα activation are decreased. Another embodiment, among others, is a method of treatment comprising (i) identifying a patient demonstrating IL-4, IL-13 or IL-4Rα expression or activity, for instance using the diagnostic methods described above, and (ii) administering an effective amount of a binding member of the invention to the patient, wherein the functional consequences of IL-4Rα activation are attenuated. An effective amount according to the invention is an amount that modulates (e.g. decreases) the functional consequences of IL-4Rα activation so as to modulate (e.g. decrease or lessen) the severity of at least one symptom of the particular disease or disorder being treated, but not necessarily cure the disease or disorder. Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention is a method of treating or reducing the severity of at least one symptom of any of the disorders referred to herein, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of one or more binding members of the present invention alone or in a combined therapeutic regimen with another appropriate medicament known in the art or described herein such that the severity of at least one symptom of any of the disorders is reduced. Another embodiment of the invention, among others, is a method of antagonizing at least one effect of IL-4Rα comprising contacting with or administering an effective amount of one or more binding members of the present invention such that said at least one effect of IL-4Rα is antagonized, e.g. the ability of IL-4Rα to form a complex (the precursor to active signalling) with IL-4.\n\n\nAccordingly, further aspects of the invention provide methods of treatment comprising administration of a binding member as provided, or pharmaceutical compositions comprising such a binding member, and/or use of such a binding member in the manufacture of a medicament for administration, for example in a method of making a medicament or pharmaceutical composition comprising formulating the binding member with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. A pharmaceutically acceptable excipient may be a compound or a combination of compounds entering into a pharmaceutical composition not provoking secondary reactions and which allows, for example, facilitation of the administration of the active compound(s), an increase in its lifespan and/or in its efficacy in the body, an increase in its solubility in solution or else an improvement in its conservation. These pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles are well known and will be adapted by the person skilled in the art as a function of the nature and of the mode of administration of the active compound(s) chosen.\n\n\nBinding members of the present invention will usually be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, which may comprise at least one component in addition to the binding member. Thus pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, and for use in accordance with the present invention, may comprise, in addition to active ingredient, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer, stabilizer or other materials well known to those skilled in the art. Such materials should be non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. The precise nature of the carrier or other material will depend on the route of administration, which may be oral, inhaled or by injection, e.g. intravenous. In on embodiment the composition is sterile.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration such as for example nanobodies etc are also envisaged in the present invention. Such oral formulations may be in tablet, capsule, powder, liquid or semi-solid form. A tablet may comprise a solid carrier such as gelatin or an adjuvant. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally comprise a liquid carrier such as water, petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or synthetic oil. Physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol may be included.\n\n\nFor intravenous injection, or injection at the site of affliction, the active ingredient will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous solution which is pyrogen-free and has suitable pH, isotonicity and stability. Those of relevant skill in the art are well able to prepare suitable solutions using, for example, isotonic vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Lactated Ringer's Injection. Preservatives, stabilizers, buffers, antioxidants and/or other additives may be employed, as required, including buffers such as phosphate, citrate, histidine and other organic acids; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3′-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight polypeptides; proteins such as serum albumin, gelatin or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagines, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\nBinding members of the present invention may be formulated in liquid, semi-solid or solid forms depending on the physicochemical properties of the molecule and the route of delivery. Formulations may include excipients, or combinations of excipients, for example: sugars, amino acids and surfactants. Liquid formulations may include a wide range of antibody concentrations and pH. Solid formulations may be produced by lyophilisation, spray drying, or drying by supercritical fluid technology, for example. Formulations of anti-IL-4Rα will depend upon the intended route of delivery: for example, formulations for pulmonary delivery may consist of particles with physical properties that ensure penetration into the deep lung upon inhalation; topical formulations may include viscosity modifying agents, which prolong the time that the drug is resident at the site of action. In certain embodiments, the binding member may be prepared with a carrier that will protect the binding member against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Robinson, 1978.\n\n\nAnti-IL-4Rα treatment with a binding member of the invention may be given orally (for example nanobodies) by injection (for example, subcutaneously, intra-articular, intravenously, intraperitoneal, intra-arterial or intramuscularly), by inhalation, by the intravesicular route (instillation into the urinary bladder), or topically (for example intraocular, intranasal, rectal, into wounds, on skin). The treatment may be administered by pulse infusion, particularly with declining doses of the binding member. The route of administration can be determined by the physicochemical characteristics of the treatment, by special considerations for the disease or by the requirement to optimize efficacy or to minimize side-effects. One particular route of administration is intravenous. Another route of administering pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention is subcutaneously. It is envisaged that anti-IL-4Rα treatment will not be restricted to use in hospitals or doctor's offices but rather may include homes and places of work. Therefore, subcutaneous injection using a needle-free device is advantageous.\n\n\nA composition may be administered alone or in combination with other treatments, concurrently or sequentially or as a combined preparation with another therapeutic agent or agents, dependent upon the condition to be treated.\n\n\nA binding member for IL-4Rα may be used as part of a combination therapy in conjunction with an additional medicinal component. Combination treatments may be used to provide significant synergistic effects, particularly the combination of an anti-IL-4Rα binding member with one or more other drugs. A binding member for IL-4Rα may be administered concurrently or sequentially or as a combined preparation with another therapeutic agent or agents, for the treatment of one or more of the conditions listed herein.\n\n\nA binding member according to the present invention may be provided in combination or addition with one or more of the following agents:\n\n \n \n \n \na cytokine or agonist or antagonist of cytokine function (e.g. an agent which acts on cytokine signalling pathways, such as a modulator of the SOCS system), such as an alpha-, beta- and/or gamma-interferon;

The actual amount administered, and rate and time-course of administration, will depend on the nature and severity of what is being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the composition, the type of binding member, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration and other factors known to medical practitioners. Prescription of treatment, e.g. decisions on dosage etc, is within the responsibility of general practitioners and other medical doctors, and may depend on the severity of the symptoms and/or progression of a disease being treated. Appropriate doses of antibody are well known in the art (Ledermann et al. Int. J. Cancer 47:659-664, 1991; Bagshawe et al. Antibody, Immunoconjugates and Radiopharmaceuticals 4:915-922, 1991). Specific dosages indicated herein, or in the Physician's Desk Reference (2003) as appropriate for the type of medicament being administered, may be used. A therapeutically effective amount or suitable dose of a binding member of the invention can be determined by comparing its in vitro activity and in vivo activity in an animal model. Methods for extrapolation of effective dosages in mice and other test animals to humans are known. The precise dose will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the antibody is for diagnosis, prevention or for treatment, the size and location of the area to be treated, the precise nature of the antibody (e.g. whole antibody, fragment or diabody), and the nature of any detectable label or other molecule attached to the antibody. A typical antibody dose will be in the \nrange\n 100 μg to 1 g for systemic applications, and 1 μg to 1 mg for topical applications. An initial higher loading dose, followed by one or more lower doses, may be administered. Typically, the antibody will be a whole antibody, e.g. the IgG1 isotype. This is a dose for a single treatment of an adult patient, which may be proportionally adjusted for children and infants, and also adjusted for other antibody formats in proportion to molecular weight. Treatments may be repeated at daily, twice-weekly, weekly or monthly intervals, at the discretion of the physician. Treatments may be every two to four weeks for subcutaneous administration and every four to eight weeks for intravenous administration. In some embodiments of the present invention, treatment is periodic, and the period between administrations is about two weeks or more, e.g. about three weeks or more, about four weeks or more, or about once a month. In other embodiments of the invention, treatment may be given before, and/or after surgery, and may be administered or applied directly at the anatomical site of surgical treatment.\n\n\n\n\nThe invention will be further described by following non-limiting Examples and Figures in which:\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n shows alignment of the VH domains of Antibodies 2-42 against Antibody 1 (split into sheets A, B, C, and D).\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n shows alignment of the VL domains of Antibodies 2-42 against Antibody 1 (split into sheets A, B, C, and D).\n\n\n \nFIG. 3\n shows alignment of VH domains of Antibodies 1-19 and 21-42 against Antibody 20 (split into sheets A, B, C, and D).\n\n\n \nFIG. 4\n shows alignment of VL domains of Antibodies 1-19 and 21-42 against Antibody 20 (split into sheets A, B, C, and D).\n\n\n \nFIG. 5\n is sequence identity tables for 6xCDRs (split into A, B, and C).\n\n\n \nFIG. 6\n is sequence identity tables for 3xVH CDRs (split into A, B, and C).\n\n\n \nFIG. 7\n is sequence identity tables for 3xVL CDRs (split into A, B, and C).\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n1.1 Cloning of Human IL-4Rα Extracellular Domain\n\n\nA cDNA encoding the sequence of human IL-4Rα extracellular domain (amino acid residues 1-229 Swiss-Prot Accession number P24394) was amplified from HUVEC cDNA library via PCR using primers based on the human IL-4Rα cDNA sequence (RefSeq NM\n—\n000418). The resulting cDNA was sub-cloned following the manufacture's instructions into pDONR201 (Invitrogen).\n\n\nThe cDNA fragments coding the IL-4Rα extracellular domains were then transferred to mammalian expression vector pDEST12.2 (Invitrogen) using LR Gateway® reaction (Invitrogen). The pDEST12.2 vector had been modified to contain the human IgG1 Fc coding region, polyhistidine (His6) tag in-frame with the inserted gene of interest, and also by insertion of the oriP origin of replication from the pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen) allowing episomal plasmid replication upon transfection into cell lines expressing the EBNA-1 gene product (such as HEK293-EBNA cells).\n\n\nThe public database accession number for human IL-4Rα mRNA is NM-000418; the key region of interest with this database sequence is 243-929. The predicted amino acid sequence for the resultant human IL-4Rα/Fc is shown in SEQ ID NO: 454.\n\n\n1.1.1 Expression and Purification\n\n\nHEK-EBNA cells were transfected using PEI. Protein was purified from conditioned media using Protein G chromatography followed by Size Exclusion chromatography.\n\n\n1.2 Cloning of Recombinant Cynomolgus Monkey IL-4Rα and Human IL-4Rα 175V Mutant\n\n\nThe cynomolgus monkey IL-4Rα subunit was amplified from cynomolgous monkey thymus and lymph node (BioCat GmbH) via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following oligonucleotides as primers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 451)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5′ ggggacaagt ttgtacaaaa aagcaggctt ctttaacttt\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\naagaaggaga tataaccatg gggtggcttt gctctgggct\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncctgttgcct gtgagc-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 452)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5′-ggggaccact ttgtacaaga aagctgggtc ctgctcgaag\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nggctccctgt aggagttgta cca-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting cDNA was sub-cloned following the manufacturer's instructions into pDONR201 (Invitrogen). The sequence of the cynomolgus monkey IL-4Rα extracellular domain is shown in SEQ ID NO: 455.\n\n\n1.3 Cloning Human IL-4Rα 175V Variant\n\n\nThe polymorphism of the human IL-4Rα, 175V was generated using the pDONR201 vector containing the coding sequence for the human IL-4Rα (amino acid residues 1-229 NP\n—\n000409). The isoleucine at \namino acid position\n 75 was mutated to valine using the QuikChange Multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the following oligonucleotide as mutation primer: 5′-gaagcccacacgtgtgccctgagaacaacgga-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 453)\n\n\n1.4 Generation of Recombinant Baculovirus for Cynomolgus and 175V Variant IL-4Rα/Fc\n\n\nCynomolgus monkey IL-4Rα and human IL-4Rα 175V variant, were then inserted into a Gateway adapted pFastBac vector (in-house) containing a human IgG1 Fc coding region. Nucleotide and protein sequences for cynomolgus IL4Rα/Fc are shown in SEQ ID NO: 456 and SEQ ID NO: 457, respectively. Nucleotide and protein sequences for 175V IL4Rα/Fc are shown in SEQ ID NO: 458 and SEQ ID NO: 459, respectively. Generation of recombinant Bacmid was done by transformation of DH10Bac \nE. coli \n(Invitrogen) and plated on LB agar with selection medium. Sf9 cells were transfected with recombinant bacmids, and high titre recombinant baculovirus were produced.\n\n\n1.5 Expression and Purification of Human 175V and Cynomolgus Fc Tagged IL-4Rα Protein Variants\n\n\nProteins were expressed in Sf21 cells (400 ml) infected with \nvirus MOI\n 1 at cell density of 3×10\n6 \ncells/ml in SF-900 II SFM media (Invitrogen). Media containing the secreted IL-4Rα-Fc fusion proteins were harvested after 72 and 96 hours, respectively. The growth medium from the Sf21 cells (400 ml) was adjusted to pH 8.0. Protein was purified using Protein G chromatography followed by Size Exclusion chromatography.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nLead Isolation\n\n\n2.1 Selections\n\n\nNaïve human single chain Fv (scFv) phage display libraries cloned in to a phagemid vector based on the filamentous phage M13 were used for selections (Vaughan et al. Nature Biotechnology 14(3):309-314, 1996; Hutchings, \nC. Generation of Naïve Human Antibody Libraries\n, in Antibody Engineering, R. Kontermann and S. Dubel, Editors. 2001, Springer Laboratory Manuals, Berlin. p. 93). Anti-IL-4Rα specific scFv antibodies were isolated from the phage display libraries using a series of selection cycles on recombinant human IL-4Rα Fc (R & D Systems) essentially as previously described by Vaughan et al (Vaughan, T J. et al. Nature Biotechnology 14(3):309-14, 1996) and Hawkins et al. Journal of Molecular Biology 226:889-896, 1992). In brief, for panning selections, human IL-4Rα Fc in PBS (Dulbecco's PBS, pH7.4) was adsorbed onto wells of an Immobilizer™ microtitre plate (Nunc) overnight at 4° C. Wells were washed with PBS then blocked for 1 h with PBS-Marvel (3% w/v). Purified phage in PBS-Marvel (3% w/v), containing a 10 fold excess of irrelevant Fc tagged protein, were added to the wells and allowed to bind coated antigen for 1 h. Unbound phage was removed by a series of wash cycles using PBS-Tween (0.1% v/v) and PBS. Bound phage particles were eluted, infected into \nE. coli \nTG1 bacteria and rescued for the next round of selection (Vaughan et al. Nature Biotechnology 14(3):309-314, 1996).\n\n\n2.2 Inhibition of IL4 Binding to IL-4 Receptor by Unpurified scFv\n\n\nUnpurified scFv from periplasmic preparations were screened in two homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF®) receptor-ligand binding assays, run in parallel to measure inhibitory activity against both human and cynomolgus IL4Rα. In the human assay, unpurified scFv samples competed with human biotinylated IL4 (Peprotec with in-house biotinylation) for binding to human IL4Rα-Fc receptor (R and D Systems, 604-4R). In the cynomolgus assay, unpurified scFv samples competed with cynomolgus biotinylated IL4 (in-house \nE. coli \nexpressed with biotinylation in-house) for binding to cynomolgus IL4Rα-Fc-HIS6 (in-house HEK expressed). The detailed assay methods are provided in the Materials and Methods section (2.4).\n\n\nScFv which showed an inhibitory effect as unpurified periplasmic extracts, on the binding of IL4 to IL4Rα in both human and cynomolgus receptor-ligand assays, were subjected to DNA sequencing (see: Osbourn et al. Immunotechnology. 2:181-196, 1996). ScFvs with unique sequences were expressed in bacteria and purified by affinity chromatography (as described by Bannister et al. Biotechnology and bioengineering, 94. 931-937, 2006).\n\n\n2.3 Inhibition of IL-4 Binding to IL-4 Receptor by Purified scFv\n\n\nPotency of scFv samples was determined by competing a dilution series of the purified scFv preparation against IL4 for binding to IL4Rα. Both human and cynomolgus receptor-ligand assays were performed in parallel as described in the Materials and Methods section 2.4 Purified scFv preparations of \nAntibody\n 1 inhibited binding of human IL4 to the IL4Rα with a K\ni \nvalue of 12 nM (95% Cl 8.7, 16.6). Inhibition of cynomolgus IL4 binding to IL4Rα by \nAntibody\n 1 was incomplete with 10% inhibition of assay signal observed. It was therefore not possible to calculate accurate K\ni \npotency data from the results obtained.\n\n\n2.4 Materials and Methods\n\n\nReceptor-Ligand HTRF® Assay for Inhibition of IL4 Binding to IL4Rα\n\n\nHigh-Throughput Screening\n\n\nSelection outputs were screened in screened in two homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF®) receptor-ligand binding assays, run in parallel to measure inhibitory activity against both human and cynomolgus IL4Rα.\n\n\nFor both assays selection outputs were screened as undiluted or diluted, unpurified bacterial periplasmic extracts containing scFv, prepared in; 50 mM MOPS buffer pH7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.5 M sucrose. All dilutions were performed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.4 M potassium fluoride and 0.1% BSA (assay buffer).\n\n\nEuropium cryptate labelled goat-anti-human Fc antibody, at 3.2 nM (CIS Bio International 61HFCKLB) was pre-mixed with human IL4Rα/Fc (R and D Systems 604-4R) at 0.5 nM (Premix “A”). XL665-conjugated streptavidin at 10 nM (CIS Bio International 611 SAXLB) was pre-mixed with human biotinylated IL4 (Peprotec with in-house biotinylation) at 4 nM (Pre-Mix “B”).\n\n\nIn parallel, for the cynomolgus assay, europium cryptate labelled goat-anti-human Fc antibody, at 3.2 nM (CIS Bio International 61HFCKLB) was pre-mixed with cynomolgus IL4RαFc (Isolation/Sf21 expressed) or cynomolgus IL4Rα/Fc HIS6 (Optimisation/HEK-expressed) at 0.5 nM (Premix “A”). XL665-conjugated streptavidin at 10 nM (CIS Bio International 611SAXLB) was pre-mixed with cynomolgus biotinylated IL4 (in-house \nE. coli \nexpressed with biotinylation in-house) at 3 nM (Pre-Mix “B”).\n\n\nFor each assay, 5 μl of Premix “A” was added to a 384 well low volume assay plate (Costar 3676). 5 μl of unpurified scFv sample was then added. This was followed by the addition of 10 μl of Premix “B”.\n\n\nNon-specific binding was defined using monoclonal mouse IgG2a clone 25463 (R and D Systems) at 10 nM final or cynomolgus IL4 at 50 nM final (in-house \nE. coli \nexpressed) for the human and cynomolgus IL4Rα receptor-ligand binding assays respectively.\n\n\nAssay plates were incubated for 4 h at room temperature, prior to reading time resolved fluorescence at 620 nm and 665 nm emission wavelengths using an EnVision plate reader (Perkin Elmer).\n\n\nData was analysed by calculating % Delta F values for each sample.

The V\nH \ndomain was cloned into a vector (pEU9.2) containing the human heavy chain constant domains and regulatory elements to express whole IgG heavy chain in mammalian cells. Similarly, the V\nL \ndomain was cloned into a vector (pEU4.4) for the expression of the human lambda light chain constant domains, with regulatory elements to express whole IgG light chain in mammalian cells. Vectors for the expression of heavy chains and light chains were originally described in Peric et al., (Gene 187:9-18, 1997). These vectors have been engineered simply by introducing an OriP element. To obtain IgGs, the heavy and light chain IgG expressing vectors were transfected into EBNA-HEK293 mammalian cells (Invitrogen R620-07-). IgGs were expressed and secreted into the medium. Harvests were pooled and filtered prior to purification. The IgG was purified using Protein A chromatography. Culture supernatants are loaded on a column of appropriate size of Ceramic Protein A (BioSepra) and washed with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl. Bound IgG was eluted from the column using 0.1 M Sodium Citrate (pH 3.0) and neutralised by the addition of Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The eluted material was buffer exchanged into PBS using Nap10 columns (Amersham, #17-0854-2) and the concentration of IgG was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient based on the amino acid sequence of the IgG (Mach et al., Anal Biochem. 200 (1):20-26, 1992). The purified IgG were analysed for aggregation or degradation using SEC-HPLC and by SDS-PAGE.\n\n\n3.2 Inhibition of IL-13 and IL-4 Induced Proliferation of TF-1 Cells by IgG\n\n\nThe neutralisation potency of purified IgG preparations against human IL-13 and IL-4 bioactivity was assessed using TF-1 cell proliferation assay. TF-1 is a human premyeloid cell line established from a patient with erythroleukemia (Kitamura et al. J. Cell Physiol. 140(2):323-34, 1989). The TF-1 cell line is factor dependent for survival and proliferation. TF-1 cells were shown to respond to both human IL-13 and IL-4 (Peprotech, \nE. coli \nderived). Inhibition of IL-4 and IL-13 dependent proliferation was determined by measuring the reduction in incorporation of tritiated thymidine into the newly synthesized DNA of dividing cells. A detailed description of the protocol is provided in materials and Methods section 3.2.1.\n\n\nRe-formatted IgG preparations of \nAntibody\n 1 inhibited the IL-13 and IL-4 induced proliferation of the TF-1 cells in a concentration dependent manner. The IC\n50 \ngeomean for \nAntibody\n 1 against IL-13 and IL-4 was calculated as being 18 nM and 38 nM respectively.\n\n\n3.2.1 Materials and Methods—Inhibition of IL-4 and IL-13 Induced Proliferation of TF-1 Cells by Purified IgG\n\n\nTF-1 cells (R&D Systems) were maintained according to supplied protocols. Assay media comprised RPMI-1640 with GLUTAMAX I (Invitrogen) containing 5% foetal bovine serum (JRH), 1% sodium pyruvate (Sigma), Penicillin/streptomycin (1-2%). Prior to each assay, TF-1 cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300×g for 5 mins, the media removed by aspiration and the cells re-suspended in assay media. This process was repeated twice with cells re-suspended at a final concentration of 2×10\n5 \ncells/ml in assay media. The cells were plated out using 100 μl/well in a 96 well assay plate. Test solutions of IgG (in duplicate) were titrated to the desired concentration range in assay media. An irrelevant antibody not directed at IL-4Rα was used as negative control. The assay was set up in a competition format, with 50 uL of each recombinant bacterially derived human IL-4 or IL-13 (Peprotech) and appropriate test antibody titrations added sequentially to 100 uL of cells. A final assay volume of 200 uL/well and a concentration of 18 pM (IL-4) or 400 pM (IL-13) was used in the assay. The concentration of IL-4 and IL-13 was selected as the dose that at gave approximately 50% of maximal proliferative response. Plates were incubated for 72 hours at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. 20 μl of tritiated thymidine (5 μCi/ml) was added to each assay point and the plates were returned to the incubator for further 4 to 5 hours. Cells were harvested on glass fibre filter plates (Perkin Elmer) using a cell harvester. Thymidine incorporation was determined using Packard TopCount microplate liquid scintillation counter. Data was then analysed using Graphpad Prism software.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nAntibody Optimisation\n\n\n4.1 Optimisation of Parent Clone by Targeted Mutagenesis\n\n\nThere are advantages and benefits in the discovery and development of an antibody to human IL4Rα that also exhibits cross-reactivity to the orthologous protein from another species, for example cynomolgus monkey. Such an antibody would facilitate the characterization of such antibodies with respect to pharmacology and safety in vivo. Potency and affinity to another species, which is for example less than 10-fold different than the human activity may be appropriate for such and evaluation.\n\n\nTo achieve the required species cross-reactivity, the parent antibody (Antibody 1) was optimised for improved affinity to both human and cynomolgus IL4Rα. This was achieved using a targeted mutagenesis approach with affinity-based phage display selections. For the targeted mutagenesis approach, large scFv-phage libraries derived from the \nAntibody\n 1 were created by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the variable heavy (V\nH\n) and light (V\nL\n) chain complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3) using standard molecular biology techniques as described by Clackson and Lowman (2004) A Practical Approach, 2004. Oxford University Press.\n\n\nThe libraries were subjected to affinity-based phage display selections in order to select variants with higher affinity for human and cynomolgus forms of IL-4Rα. The selections were performed essentially as described previously (Thompson. Journal of Molecular Biology. 256:77-88, 1996). In brief, the scFv phage particles were incubated with either recombinant biotinylated human or cynomolgus IL-4Rα in solution (bio-huIL-4Rα FLAG HIS or bio-cyno-IL-4RαFc HIS, both in house HEK-EBNA derived). The species of antigen used was alternated at each round of selection. ScFv-phage bound to antigen were then captured on streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads® M280) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The selected scFv-phage particles were then rescued as described previously (Osbourn, J K. et al. Immunotechnology, 2(3):181-96, 1996), and the selection process was repeated in the presence of decreasing concentrations of either bio-huIL-4Rα or bio-cyno-IL-4Rα, alternating the species between rounds of selection (500 nM to 250 pM over 6 rounds).\n\n\nUpon completion of 6 rounds of selection, the VH and VL randomised libraries were recombined to form a single library in which clones contained randomly paired individually randomised VH and VL sequences. Selections were then continued as previously described in the presence of decreasing concentrations of either bio-huIL-4Rα or bio-cyno-IL-4Rα (2.5 nM to 0.5 pM over a further 5 rounds), alternating the species of antigen where appropriate.\n\n\n4.2 Optimisation of the Antibody by Random Mutagenesis\n\n\nOne of the antibodies (Antibody 20) was further optimised using a random mutagenesis approach to identify key residues within the antibody sequence that may improve binding to human and cynomolgus IL4Rα. Large scFv-phage libraries were generated by the introduction of random mutations throughout the variable regions of the \nAntibody\n 20 scFv sequence. This was achieved by two rounds of mutagenesis using a Diversify™ PCR random mutagenesis kit (BD biosciences), following the manufacturers instructions to incorporate on average, 8.1 mutations per kilobase in the nucleic acid sequence per round of mutagenesis. The protocol for the strategy is in accordance with International Patent Application Publication Number WO2006/072801 (Cambridge Antibody Technology). The libraries were subjected to affinity-based phage display selections to select for variants with higher affinity for human and cynomolgus forms of IL-4Rα.\n\n\nThe selections were performed essentially as described previously (Thompson, Journal of Molecular Biology. 256:77-88, 1996). In brief, the scFv phage particles were incubated with recombinant biotinylated human or cynomologous IL-4Rα in solution (bio-huIL-4Rα FLAG HIS or bio-cyno-IL-4Rα Fc HIS, both in house HEK-EBNA derived). The species of antigen was alternated between human and cynomolgus in order to improve affinity for the particular species of IL-4Rα accordingly. ScFv-phage bound to antigen were then captured on streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads® M280) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The selected scFv-phage particles were then rescued as described previously (Osbourn et al. Immunotechnology, 2(3):181-96, 1996), and the selection process was repeated in the presence of decreasing concentrations of either bio-huIL-4Rα or bio-cyno-IL-4Rα (20 nM to 1 pM over 4 rounds).\n\n\n4.3 Identification of Improved Clones from Random Mutagenesis Using a Receptor-Ligand Binding Assay\n\n\nScFv from the targeted and random mutagenesis selections were expressed in the bacterial periplasm and screened in two homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF®) receptor-ligand binding assays, run in parallel to measure inhibitory activity against both human and cynomolgus IL4Rα. The detailed assay method is provided in the Materials and Methods section. 2.4. ScFv that showed a significant inhibitory effect in both assays, were subjected to DNA sequencing and scFv with unique sequences were prepared as purified preparations.\n\n\nPurified scFv antibody potencies were determined by competing a dilution series of the purified scFv preparation against IL4 for binding to IL4Rα. Both human and cynomolgus receptor-ligand assays were performed in parallel as described in the Materials and Methods section 2.4.\n\n\nExample potency data for scFv for each sample is provided in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKi (nM) Geomean\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith 95% confidence\n \n \n \n \n \nlimit in parentheses\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHuman\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nscFv\n \nIL4R\n \nCyno IL4R\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 1\n \n12.0 (8.7, 16.6)\n \nIncomplete\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 2\n \n0.6 (0.5, 0.7)\n \n4.3 (2.1, 8.9)\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 3\n \n0.5\n \n48.0 \n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 4\n \n0.8 (0.4, 1.8)\n \n 6.8 (3.4, 13.6)\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 5\n \n0.6 (0.1, 2.8)\n \n3.8 (1.8, 8.2)\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 6\n \n0.3\n \n3.5\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 7\n \n1.1\n \n16.5 \n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 8\n \n0.4\n \n9.4\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 9\n \n0.1 (0.1, 0.3)\n \n12.9 (9.0, 19)  \n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 10\n \n0.5\n \n19.6\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 11\n \n0.7\n \n26.1\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 12\n \n0.3\n \n 7.2\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 13\n \n0.3\n \n22.2\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 14\n \n0.6 (0.4, 0.9)\n \n27.7\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 15\n \n1.0 (0.8, 1.2)\n \n32.3\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 16\n \n0.4 (0.2, 1.0)\n \n 8.7\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 17\n \n0.9\n \n43.5\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 18\n \n0.7\n \n56.5\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 19\n \n0.8 (0.4, 1.6)\n \n18.5\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 20\n \n0.7 (0.6, 0.8)\n \n4.2 (3.4, 5.3)\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 21\n \n31 pM (13, 76)\n \n1.0 (0.5, 1.9)\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 22\n \n0.3\n \n 2.6\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 23\n \n0.2\n \n 4.8\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 24\n \n49 pM (25, 94)\n \n0.8 (0.5, 1.0)\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 24PGL\n \n65 pM\n \n0.7\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 25\n \n39 pM (20, 79)\n \n1.3 (0.7, 2.7)\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 26\n \n0.1\n \n 1.2\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 27\n \n63 pM\n \n 2.8\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 28\n \n94 pM\n \n 1.8\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 29\n \n61 pM\n \n 2.4\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 30\n \n69 pM\n \n 3.6\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 31\n \n44 pM (26, 76)\n \n2.2 (1.4, 3.4)\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 32\n \n75 pM\n \n 1.3\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 33\n \n92 pM\n \n 1.4\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 34\n \n56 pM\n \n 1.2\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 35\n \n71 pM\n \n 2.6\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 36\n \n0.1\n \n 5.3\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 37\n \n40 pM (30, 51)\n \n0.8 (0.7, 1.0)\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 37 GL\n \n61 pM (40, 92)\n \n0.7 (0.5, 1.1)\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 38\n \n66 pM\n \n 2.7\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 39\n \n27 pM\n \n 1.6\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 40\n \n31 pM\n \n 6.5\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 41\n \n53 pM\n \n 2.7\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody 42\n \n27 pM (16, 49)\n \n2.5 (1.4, 4.5)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4.4 Inhibition of IL-13 and IL-4 Induced Proliferation of TF1 Cells by Optimised Clones\n\n\n\nPurified scFv antibody potencies were also determined in the TF1 proliferation assay.\n\n\nThe most potent clones in the TF-1 proliferation assay were converted to IgG as described previously, and were re-tested in the TF-1 proliferation assay.

Germlining\n\n\n\nThe amino acid sequences of the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of the optimised anti-IL-4Rα antibodies were aligned to the known human germline sequences in the VBASE database (MRC Centre For Protein Engineering) and the closest germline was identified by sequence similarity. For the V\nH \ndomains of the optimised antibody lineage this was Vh1_DP-7_(1-46). For the VL domains it was Vλ1_DPL5.\n\n\nWithout considering the Vernier residues (Foote & Winter, J Mol. Biol. Mar 20:224(2):487-99, 1992), which were left unchanged, there were 3 changes in the frameworks of the V\nH \ndomains and 2 changes in the V\nL \ndomains of \nAntibody\n 37, all of which were reverted to the closest germline sequence to identically match human antibodies. \nAntibody\n 24 had one change in the V\nH \ndomains and 2 changes in the V\nL \ndomains away from the closest human germline match. Changes at \nKabat number\n 37 in the V\nH \ndomain and \nKabat number\n 73 in the V\nL \ndomain were reverted to that of the closest human germline match. The amino acid change at \nposition\n 87 in the V\nL \ndomain was left unchanged, to retain potency (Antibody 24PGL). Germlining of these amino acid residues was carried out using standard site directed mutagenesis techniques with the appropriate mutagenic primers.\n\n\nThe Antibody 37GL scFv sequence was cloned into a cloning vector, transformed into \nE. coli \nTop10 cells (F-mcrA Δ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) Φ80lacZΔM15 ΔlacX74 recA1 araD139 Δ(araleu) 7697 galU galK rpsL (StrR) endA1 nupG) and deposited under the Budapest Treaty at NCIMB (Aberdeen, Scotland) on 9 Dec. 2008. The Applicant's clone reference is “\nAntibody\n 37 GL” and the NCIMB accession number is NCIMB 41600.\n\n\nGermlined IgG were then re-evaluated in the IL-4 and IL-13 induced TF-1 proliferation assay to confirm there had not been a reduction in potency.

The assay determines relative cross reactivity by measuring inhibition of biotinylated IL-4Rα HIS FLAG (in house HEK-EBNA derived), binding each immobilised anti-IL-4Rα antibody.\n\n\nTitrations of purified, IL13Rα1 Fc, IL13Rα2 Fc and the common gamma chain (IL-2Rγ) (all R & D Systems) were tested in each assay to establish the specificity profile for each structurally related protein, as measured by IC\n50 \nvalues in the assay.\n\n\nTitrations of IL-4Rα species including cynomolgus IL-4Rα HIS Fc (in house HEK-EBNA derived), human IL-4Rα 175V Fc (AstraZeneca), human IL-4Rα Fc and murine IL-4Rα (both R & D Systems) were tested in each assay to establish the species cross-reactivity of the antibodies. Unbiotinylated human IL-4Rα HIS FLAG was used as a positive control. Human and cynomolgus IL-4Rα HIS Fc, along with Human IL-4Rα 175V Fc, produced overlapping inhibition curves with equivocal IC\n50 \nvalues. No inhibition was observed for murine IL-4Rα or any of the related human proteins tested. The results demonstrate that Antibody 37GL is cross reactive to cynomolgus Il-4Rα and human IL-4Rα 175V but does not bind to murine IL-4Rα or any of the most related human proteins to human IL-4Rα. Details of the protocol are provided in the Materials and Methods section 4.6.1.\n\n\n4.6.1 Materials and Methods—DELFIA® Epitope Competition Assays\n\n\nPurified IgG were adsorbed onto 96-well Maxisorp microtitre plates (Nunc) in PBS at a concentration which gave a significant signal when biotinylated human IL-4Rα HIS FLAG was added at approximately its estimated KD for that particular IgG. Excess IgG was washed away with PBS-Tween (0.1% v/v) and the wells were blocked with PBS-Marvel (3% w/v) for 1 h. A dilution series of each of the following competitors was prepared in PBS, starting at a concentration of approximately 400-fold the KD value of the interaction between biotinylated human IL-4Rα and the respective IgG; human IL-4Rα Fc (R & D Systems, 604-4R-050), human IL-4Rα 175V Fc (AstraZeneca), cynomolgus IL-4Rα HIS Fc (In house), murine IL4Rα Fc (R & D Systems 530-MR-100), Human common gamma chain (sIL-2Rγ) (R & D Systems 384-RG-050-CF), human IL-13Rα1 Fc (R & D Systems, 146-IR-100), human IL-13Rα2 Fc (R & D Systems, 614-IR-100). Unbiotinylated human IL-4Rα HIS FLAG was used as a positive control. To this series, an equal volume of biotinylated recombinant human IL-4Rα at a concentration of approximately 2-fold the KD was added (resulting in a series starting at a ratio of competitor antigen:biotinylated human IL-Rα of approximately 200:1). These mixtures were then transferred onto the blocked IgG and allowed to equilibrate for 1.5 h. Unbound antigen was removed by washing with PBS-Tween (0.1% v/v), while the remaining biotinylated human IL-4Rα was detected by streptavidin-Europium3+ conjugate (DELFIA® detection, PerkinElmer). Time-resolved fluorescence was measured at 620 nm on an EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer). Fluorescence data was converted to % specific binding (100% was determined from control wells containing biotinylated human IL-4Rα but no competitor, 0% was from wells containing biotinylated human IL-4Rα and a 1000-fold excess of unbiotinylated human IL-4Rα). Resultant data were analysed using Prism curve fitting software (Graphpad) to determine IC\n50 \nvalues.\n\n\n4.7 Calculation of Affinity Data for Optimised Clones Using BIAcore\n\n\nThe binding affinity of purified IgG samples of representative panel of antibodies to human and cynomolgus IL-4Rα was determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 2000 biosensor (BIAcore AB) essentially as described by Karlsson et al. (J. Immunol. Methods, 145(1-2):229-240, 1991). In brief, Protein G′ (Sigma Aldrich, P4689) was covalently coupled to the surface of a CM5 sensor chip using standard amine coupling reagents according to manufacturer's instructions (BIAcore). This Protein G′ surface was used to capture a constant amount of purified anti-IL4Rα antibodies or isotype control via the Fc domain. Human or cynomolgus IL-4Rα HIS FLAG prepared in HBS-EP buffer (BIAcore AB), at a range of concentrations, between 100 nM and 0.2 nM, were passed over the sensor chip surface. The surface was regenerated using 10 mM Glycine, pH 1.75 between each injection of antibody. The resulting sensorgrams were evaluated using BIA evaluation 4.1 software and fitted to 1:1 Langmuir binding model, to provide the relative binding data. The experiments were performed over the course of at least three separate days to calculate an average monovalent affinity. From the data fits obtained, the affinity of Antibody 37GL to human and cynomolgus IL-4Rα was determined to be approx 504 pM and 4.4 nM respectively, as reported in Table 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Kinetic Analysis of a representative panel of antibodies for binding to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhuman and cyno IL4Rα\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman IL4Rα HIS FLAG\n\n\nCyno IL4Rα HIS FLAG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKa\n\n\nKd\n\n\nKD\n\n\nKa\n\n\nKd\n\n\nKD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)\n\n\n(s\n−1\n)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)\n\n\n(s\n−1\n)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAntibody\n 2\n\n\n6.51 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n2.94 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n4.51\n\n\n9.67 × 10\n4\n \n\n\n4.59 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n47.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAntibody\n 9\n\n\n5.43 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n2.29 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n0.422\n\n\n1.31 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n1.63 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n124\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAntibody\n 20\n\n\n6.98 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n8.73 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n1.25\n\n\n1.63 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n4.52 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n27.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAntibody\n 37\n\n\n6.40 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n1.62 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n0.255\n\n\n2.43 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n6.88 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n2.97\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(0.313,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2.59,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.250,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.36, 3.96)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.203)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n6.88 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n3.46 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n0.504\n\n\n2.44 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n1.08 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n4.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37GL\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(0.533,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(4.67,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.531,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.34, 4.41)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.459)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nEpitope Mapping of IL-4Rα:Antibody Interaction Using Chimeric Human/Mouse IL4Ra Extracellular Domains\n\n\n5.1 Generation of Whole Domain Swap Chimetic IL-4Rα Molecules.\n\n\nThe binding members of the invention bind strongly to human IL-4Rα but extremely poorly, almost indiscernibly, to mouse IL-4Rα. Using this property, chimeric IL-4Rα molecules were generated for epitope mapping. Whole domain-swap chimeras were created by replacing domain 1 (D1) (M1-E119) or domain 2 (D2) (H120-F229) of human IL-4Rα ectodomain with corresponding mouse IL-4Rα sequence. Loop swap chimeras were generated by replacing loop regions known to interact with IL4 (Hage et al, \nCell \n97:271-281, 1999) from human IL-4Rα with corresponding regions from mouse IL-4Rα. An HTRF (homogeneous time resolved fluorescence) competition assay was used to determine chimeras binding to antibody. In the assay antibody labelled with Eu\n3+\n cryptate interacted with Human IL-4Rα labelled with biotin. The interaction was detected by a FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) signal between Eu\n3+\n cryptate and XL665 labelled streptavidin (Mathis et al., \nClin Chem \n41: 1391-1397, 1995).\n\n\n5.1.1 Materials and Methods—Cloning, Expression and Purification of Chimeras\n\n\ncDNA molecules encoding chimeras of human IL-4Rα extracellular domain (amino acid residues 1-229 NP\n—\n000409) and mouse IL-4Rα extracellular domain (amino acid residues 1-230 NP\n—\n001008700) were synthesised by primer extension PCR cloning and cloned into pDONR221 (Invitrogen Cat. No. 12536-017). The cDNA fragments coding for the IL-4Rα extracellular domain chimeras were then transferred to mammalian expression vector pDEST12.2 (Invitrogen) using LR Gateway Clonase II enzyme according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen Cat. No. 12538-120). The pDEST12.2 vector had been modified to contain a FLAG 10xhis tag (DYKDDDDKAAHHHHHHHHHH; e.g. see SEQ ID NO: 460, positions 252-261) in-frame with the inserted gene of interest, and also by insertion of the oriP origin of replication from the pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen cat. no. V044-50) allowing episomal plasmid replication upon transfection into cell lines expressing the EBNA-1 gene product (such as HEK293-EBNA cells). Expressed protein in HEK293-EBNA supernatant was purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Histrap HP column (GE Healthcare Cat. No. 17-5248-02)) followed by Size Exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare Cat. No. 17-1069-01)).\n\n\nThe sequence of human IL-4Rα extracellular domain (positions 1-229; and same in NP\n—\n000409), vector encoded sequence (positions 230-241), FLAG tag (positions 242-249) and 10xhis tag (positions 252-261) is disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 460. The sequence of murine IL-4Rα extracellular domain (positions 1-230; and same in NP\n—\n001008700), vector encoded sequence (positions 233-242), FLAG tag (positions 243-250) and 10xhis tag (positions 253-262) is disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 461.\n\n\n5.1.2 Binding of Antibody to IL-4Rα Chimeras\n\n\nAntibody was cryptate labelled with Eu\n3+\n Cryptate labelling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (CisBio International Cat No. 62EUSPEA) and IL-4Rα/Fc (R&D systems Cat. No. 604-4R-050) was Biotin labelled with EZ Link NHS-Biotin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Perbio Cat No. 20217). Assay conditions were 0.4 nM Cryptate labelled antibody, 0.25 nM biotin labelled IL-4Rα/Fc, 2.5 nM streptavidin XL665 (CisBio International Cat. No. 611SAXLB) in 1×DPBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.4M potassium fluoride in a total volume of 20 μl in a 384 well microtitre plate (Greiner). To the assay a dilution series (from 1000 nM to 0.017 nM) of test proteins was added and the assay incubated overnight at 4° C. FRET signal was detected using a PerkinElmer EnVision plate reader using a 320 nm excitation filter and 620 nm and 665 nm emission filters. Results were calculated from the 665/620 ratio as a percentage of specific binding (signal with no competitor antigen). Results were analysed with Prism (GraphPad Software) using the sigmoidal dose response model.\n\n\n5.2 Results\n\n\nAntibody binding of chimeric molecules was tested in an HTRF (Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence) competition assay. Molecules which bound antibody at the same paratope as human IL-4Rα inhibited the binding interaction, leading to a reduction in signal. From inhibition curves IC\n50 \nvalues for human IL-4Rα, mouse IL-4Rα and chimeric molecules were calculated (Table 5). If a molecule did not fully inhibit binding the percentage inhibition seen at the highest concentration was calculated. Chimeras that gave similar IC\n50 \nvalues to native human IL-4Rα still contained the epitope. Chimeras, which did not fully inhibit IL-4Rα binding to antibody, or showed an increased IC\n50 \nvalue, did not contain the full epitope. These data enabled the localisation of the antibody epitope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(in nM) of chimeric IL-4Rα molecules competing against human IL-4Rα\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbinding to antibody.

Whole domain swap chimeras localised the epitope to D1 of human IL-4Rα (residues M1-E119) as a human D1-mouse D2 chimera was able to compete with human IL-4Rα whereas a mouse D1-human D2 chimera failed to completely inhibit Human IL-4Rα binding (Table 5). The epitope is almost entirely composed of loop regions since the AllMoLoops chimera and MoIL-4Rα show very similar percentage inhibition (Table 5).\n\n\nHuman IL-4Rα contains five loop regions, which are in close proximity to IL4 in a crystal structure (Hage et al., Cell 97:271-281, 1999). Loop swap chimeras enabled the localisation of the human IL-4Rα epitope to a major component in loop 3 (residues L89-N98) and a minor component in loop 2 (residues V65-H72). Chimeras without \nhuman loop\n 3 failed to inhibit human IL-4Rα binding to antibody and chimeras without \nloop\n 2 gave a 100 fold higher IC\n50 \nthan human IL-4Rα (Table 5). Consistent with the domain swap data both loop2 and loop3 are located in D1 (Hage et al., \nCell \n97:271-281, 1999).\n\n\nFrom these data the antibody epitope was located to a discontinuous epitope of 18 amino acids in two loop regions of human IL-4Rα; V65-H72 and L89-N98.\n\n\n5.3 Further Localisation of the IL-4Rα Epitope of Antibody Using Mutants of MoLoop2Hu IL-4Rα and MoLoop3HuIL-4Rα\n\n\nTo localise important residues of the antibody epitope of human IL-4Rα mutants of MoLoop2HuIL-4Rα and MoLoop3HuIL-4Rα were generated and tested for activity in an HTRF competition assay.\n\n\nMoLoop2HuIL-4Rα (Table 5) was mutated to convert mouse residues back to human. When epitope-important residues were mutated, the IC\n50 \nvalues were lower than that of MoLoop2HuIL-4Rα (Table 6). Three mutants (constructs EM18, EM22 and EM23) gave similar IC\n50 \nvalues to MoLoop2HuIL-4Rα (Table 6). In addition when mouse residues N72 and L73 are placed to human IL-4Rα the resultant chimeric molecule is able to strongly inhibit the human IL-4Rα/antibody interaction (Table 6). These data suggest that human IL-4Rα residues V65, A71 and H72 are not important parts of the antibody epitope. The remaining three mouse residues of loop 2 (F67, E68, F69) correspond to two human residues (L67, L68). In MoLoop2HuIL-4Rα mutants where any of the two mouse phenylalanine residues is replaced with a human lysine residue the IC\n50 \nis reduced (Table 6). When mouse E68 is removed from MoLoop2HuIL-4Rα the IC\n50 \nis also reduced suggesting that acidic glutamic acid residue of mouse loop2 is blocking part of the antibody epitope. In addition when all three mouse residues (F67, E68, F69) are placed into human IL-4Rα the chimera only weakly inhibits human IL-4Rα/antibody interaction (Table 6). These data show human residues L67 and L68 are part of the antibody binding epitope of human IL-4Rα.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(in nM) of chimeric IL-4Rα molecules competing against\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhuman IL-4Rα binding to antibody.

A lower IC\n50 \nthan human IL-4Rα is seen when epitope-important residues are mutated.\n\n\nTwo mutants had drastically reduced ability to block the human IL-4Rα/antibody interaction showing that they are part of the epitope. When human IL-4Rα D92 is mutated to R (in mutant EM03) the mutant protein is unable to block the IL-4Rα/antibody interaction at 1000 nM. When human IL-4Rα V93 is mutated to P (in mutant EM04) the IC\n50 \nvalue is 20 fold higher than human IL-4Rα (Table 7). In comparison the human IL-4Rα mutants L89E, D91N, S95Q, A96V and N98R (chimeras EM01, EM02, EM05, EM06 and EM07) all gave similar IC\n50 \nvalues to human IL-4Rα (Table 3).
