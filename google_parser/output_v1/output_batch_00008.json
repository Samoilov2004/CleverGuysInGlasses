Description\n\n\n\n\n QUINAZOLINE COMPOUNDS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF \n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\n [0001] This application claims the benefit of the priority of U.S. Provisional\n\n\nApplication No. 61/379,309, filed September 1, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n\n\n FIELD \n\n\n [0002] Provided herein are compounds that are modulators of JAK kinases, compositions comprising the compounds and methods of use thereof. The compounds provided are useful in the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of a disease or disorder related to JAK, including JAK2, JAK3 or TYK2 kinases, or one or more symptoms associated with such diseases or disorders. Further provided are methods for treatment of cancer, including blood borne and solid tumors. \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\n [0003] The JAK kinase family is a cytoplasmic protein kinase family comprising the members JAKl, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Growth factor or cytokine receptors that recruit JAK kinases include the interferon receptors, interleukin receptors (receptors for the cytokines IL-2 to IL-7, IL-9 to IL-13, IL-15, IL-23), various hormone receptors (erythropoietin (Epo) receptor, the thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor, the leptin receptor, the insulin receptor, the prolactin (PRL) receptor, the Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) receptor and the growth hormone receptor, receptor protein tyrosine kinases (such as EGFR and PDGFR), and receptors for other growth factors such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), Oncostatin M (OSM), IFNa/β/γ, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) (See, Rane, S.G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679). \n\n\n [0004] Phosphorylated receptors serve as docking sites for other SH-2 domain containing signaling molecules that interact with JAKs such as the STAT family of transcription factors, Src family of kinases, MAP kinases, PI3 kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatases (Rane S.G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679). The family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors, STATs, is the most well characterized downstream substrates for JAKs. The STAT proteins bind to \n\n phosphorylated cytokine receptors through their SH2 domains to become \n\n\nphosphorylated by JAKs, which leads to their dimerization and release and eventual translocation to the nucleus where they activate gene transcription. The various members of STAT which have been identified thus far, are STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5 (including STAT5a and STAT5b) and STAT6. \n\n\n[0005] Since the JAK kinases may play an important signaling role via such receptors, disorders of fat metabolism, growth disorders and disorders of the immune system are all potential therapeutic targets. \n\n\n [0006] The JAK kinases and JAK2 mutations are implicated in \n\n\nmyeloproliferative disorders, cancers, including blood borne and solid tumors. \n\n\nExemplary disorders include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and systemic mastocytosis (SM). Myeloproliferative disorders are believed to arise from either gain-of-function mutations to JAK itself or from activation by the oncoprotein BCR-ABL, which specifically activates the JAK2 pathway. Several literature reports describe role of JAK2 mutations in various disorders. See, Samanta et al. Cancer Res 2006, 66(13), 6468-6472, Sawyers et al. Cell, 1992, 76», 901-910, Tefferi N. Eng. J.

JAK as a prominent mediator of the cytokine signaling pathway, is considered to be a therapeutic target for inflammation and transplant rejections. \n\n See, Borie et al, Transplantation (2005) 79(7):791-801 and Milici et al, Arthritis Research (2008) 10(R14):l-9 \n\n\n [0008] Given the multitude of diseases attributed to the dysregulation of JAK signaling, many small molecule inhibitors of JAK are currently being developed. Examples of compounds in preclinical development include TGI 01209 (TargeGen). Examples of compounds being investigated in clinical studies include INCBO 18424 (Incyte), XL019 (Exelixis) and TG101348 (TargeGen). See, Pardanani et al. \n\n\nLeukemia 2007, 21 : 1658-1668; and Pardanai, A. Leukemia 2008 22:23-20. \n\n\n[0009] There is, however, an ever-existing need to provide novel classes of compounds that are useful as inhibitors of enzymes in the JAK signaling pathway.

\n\n\nor pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or hydrates thereof. \n\n\n[00140] Also provided herein are isotopically enriched analogs of the compounds provided herein. Isotopic enrichment (for example, deuteration) of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics (\"PK\"), pharmacodynamics (\"PD\"), and toxicity profiles, has been demonstrated previously with some classes of drugs. See, for example, Lijinsky et. al, Food Cosmet. Toxicol, 20: 393 (1982); Lijinsky et. al, J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 69: 1127 (1982); Mangold et. al, Mutation Res. 308: 33 (1994); Gordon et. al, Drug Metab. Dispos., 15: 589 (1987); Zello et. al, \n\n\nMetabolism, 43: 487 (1994); Gately et. al, J. Nucl. Med., 27: 388 (1986); and Wade D, Chem. Biol. Interact. I ll: 191 (1999). \n\n\n [00141] Isotopic enrichment of a drug can be used, for example, to (1) reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites, (2) increase the half-life of the parent drug, (3) \n\n decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect, (4) decrease the amount of a dose necessary to achieve a desired effect, (5) increase the formation of active metabolites, if any are formed, and/or (6) decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues and/or create a more effective drug and/or a safer drug for combination therapy, whether the combination therapy is intentional or not. \n\n\n[00142] Replacement of an atom for one of its isotopes often will result in a change in the reaction rate of a chemical reaction. This phenomenon is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"KIE\"). For example, if a C-H bond is broken during a rate- determining step in a chemical reaction (i.e. the step with the highest transition state energy), substitution of a deuterium for that hydrogen will cause a decrease in the reaction rate and the process will slow down. This phenomenon is known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"DKIE\"). (See, e.g, Foster et al, Adv. Drug Res., vol. 14, pp. 1-36 (1985); Kushner et al, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., vol. 77, pp. 79- 88 (1999)). \n\n\n [00143] Tritium (\"T\") is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, used in research, fusion reactors, neutron generators and radiopharmaceuticals. Tritium is a hydrogen atom that has 2 neutrons in the nucleus and has an atomic weight close to 3. It occurs naturally in the environment in very low concentrations, most commonly found as\n\n\nT\n2\n0. Tritium decays slowly (half-life = 12.3 years) and emits a low energy beta particle that cannot penetrate the outer layer of human skin. Internal exposure is the main hazard associated with this isotope, yet it must be ingested in large amounts to pose a significant health risk. As compared with deuterium, a lesser amount of tritium must be consumed before it reaches a hazardous level. Substitution of tritium (\"T\") for hydrogen results in yet a stronger bond than deuterium and gives numerically larger isotope effects. Similarly, substitution of isotopes for other elements, including, but not limited to, \n13\nC or \n14\nC for carbon, \n33\nS, \n34\nS, or \n36\nS for sulfur, \n15\nN for nitrogen, and \n17\n0 or \n18\n0 for oxygen, will provide a similar kinetic isotope effects. \n\n\n C.

A unit-dosage form, as used herein, refers to physically discrete a unit suitable for administration to a human and animal subject, and packaged individually as is known in the art. Each unit-dose contains a \n\n predetermined quantity of an active ingredient(s) sufficient to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carriers or excipients. Examples of a unit-dosage form include an ampoule, syringe, and individually packaged tablet and capsule. A unit-dosage form may be administered in fractions or multiples thereof. A multiple-dosage form is a plurality of identical unit- dosage forms packaged in a single container to be administered in segregated unit- dosage form. Examples of a multiple-dosage form include a vial, bottle of tablets or capsules, or bottle of pints or gallons. \n\n\n The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can be administered at once, or multiple times at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment may vary with the age, weight, and condition of the patient being treated, and may be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test or diagnostic data. It is further understood that for any particular individual, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the formulations. \n\n\n[00150] In one embodiment, the therapeutically effective dose is from about 0.1 mg to about 2,000 mg per day of a compound provided herein. The pharmaceutical compositions therefore should provide a dosage of from about 0.1 mg to about 2000 mg of the compound. In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical dosage unit forms are prepared to provide from about 1 mg to about 2000 mg, from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg, from about 20 mg to about 500 mg or from about 25 mg to about 250 mg of the essential active ingredient or a combination of essential ingredients per dosage unit form. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical dosage unit forms are prepared to provide about 10 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg or 2000 mg of the essential active ingredient. \n\n\nOral Administration \n\n\n[00151] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can be provided in solid, semisolid, or liquid dosage forms for oral administration. As used herein, oral administration also includes buccal, lingual, and sublingual administration.

In general, such devices have at least two components: (a) the core which contains the active ingredient(s); and (b) a semipermeable membrane with at least one delivery port, which encapsulates the core. The semipermeable membrane controls the influx of water to the core from an aqueous environment of use so as to cause drug release by extrusion through the delivery port(s). \n\n\n [00203] In addition to the active ingredient(s), the core of the osmotic device optionally includes an osmotic agent, which creates a driving force for transport of water from the environment of use into the core of the device. One class of osmotic agents water-swellable hydrophilic polymers, which are also referred to as \n\n\n\"osmopolymers\" and \"hydrogels,\" including, but not limited to, hydrophilic vinyl and acrylic polymers, polysaccharides such as calcium alginate, polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic) acid, poly(methacrylic) acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), crosslinked PVP, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA/PVP copolymers, PVA/PVP copolymers with hydrophobic monomers such as methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, hydrophilic polyurethanes containing large PEO blocks, sodium \n\n\ncroscarmellose, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carboxyethyl, cellulose (CEC), sodium alginate, polycarbophil, gelatin, xanthan gum, and sodium starch glycolate. \n\n\n [00204] The other class of osmotic agents is osmogens, which are capable of imbibing water to affect an osmotic pressure gradient across the barrier of the surrounding coating. Suitable osmogens include, but are not limited to, inorganic salts, such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium phosphates, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, lithium sulfate, potassium chloride, and sodium sulfate; sugars, such as dextrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, lactose, maltose, mannitol, raffmose, sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and xylitol; organic acids, such as ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, sebacic acid, sorbic acid, adipic \n\n acid, edetic acid, glutamic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid; urea; and mixtures thereof. \n\n\n [00205] Osmotic agents of different dissolution rates can be employed to influence how rapidly the active ingredient(s) is initially delivered from the dosage form. For example, amorphous sugars, such as MANNOGEM\n™\n EZ (SPI Pharma, Lewes, DE) can be used to provide faster delivery during the first couple of hours to promptly produce the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of the remaining amount to maintain the desired level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In this case, the active ingredient(s) is released at such a rate to replace the amount of the active ingredient metabolized and excreted. \n\n\n [00206] The core can also include a wide variety of other excipients and carriers as described herein to enhance the performance of the dosage form or to promote stability or processing. \n\n\n [00207] Materials useful in forming the semipermeable membrane include various grades of acrylics, vinyls, ethers, polyamides, polyesters, and cellulosic derivatives that are water-permeable and water-insoluble at physiologically relevant pHs, or are susceptible to being rendered water-insoluble by chemical alteration, such as crosslinking. Examples of suitable polymers useful in forming the coating, include plasticized, unplasticized, and reinforced cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, CA propionate, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CA ethyl carbamate, CAP, CA methyl carbamate, CA succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), CA dimethylaminoacetate, CA ethyl carbonate, CA chloroacetate, CA ethyl oxalate, CA methyl sulfonate, CA butyl sulfonate, CA p-toluene sulfonate, agar acetate, amylose triacetate, beta glucan acetate, beta glucan triacetate, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetate, triacetate of locust bean gum, hydroxylated ethylene- vinylacetate, EC, PEG, PPG, PEG/PPG copolymers, PVP, HEC, HPC, CMC, CMEC, HPMC, HPMCP, HPMCAS, HPMCAT, poly(acrylic) acids and esters and poly- (methacrylic) acids and esters and copolymers thereof, starch, dextran, dextrin, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, polyalkenes, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. \n\n [00208] Semipermeable membrane can also be a hydrophobic microporous membrane, wherein the pores are substantially filled with a gas and are not wetted by the aqueous medium but are permeable to water vapor, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,119. Such hydrophobic but water-vapor permeable membrane are typically composed of hydrophobic polymers such as polyalkenes, polyethylene, \n\n\npolypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyacrylic acid derivatives, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. \n\n\n[00209] The delivery port(s) on the semipermeable membrane can be formed post-coating by mechanical or laser drilling. Delivery port(s) can also be formed in situ by erosion of a plug of water-soluble material or by rupture of a thinner portion of the membrane over an indentation in the core. In addition, delivery ports can be formed during coating process, as in the case of asymmetric membrane coatings of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,612,059 and 5,698,220. \n\n\n [00210] The total amount of the active ingredient(s) released and the release rate can substantially by modulated via the thickness and porosity of the \n\n\nsemipermeable membrane, the composition of the core, and the number, size, and position of the delivery ports. \n\n\n [00211] The pharmaceutical compositions in an osmotic controlled-release dosage form can further comprise additional conventional excipients or carriers as described herein to promote performance or processing of the formulation. \n\n\n[00212] The osmotic controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art (see, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, supra; Santus and Baker, J Controlled Release 1995, 35, 1-21; Verma et al., Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy 2000, 26, 695-708; Verma et al., J Controlled Release 2002, 79, 7-27). \n\n\n[00213] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are formulated as AMT controlled-release dosage form, which comprises an asymmetric osmotic membrane that coats a core comprising the active ingredient(s) and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. See, U.S. Pat. No. \n\n\n5,612,059 and WO 2002/17918. The AMT controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in \n\n the art, including direct compression, dry granulation, wet granulation, and a dip- coating method. \n\n\n [00214] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are formulated as ESC controlled-release dosage form, which comprises an osmotic membrane that coats a core comprising the active ingredient(s), a \n\n\nhydroxylethyl cellulose, and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. \n\n\n3. Multiparticulate Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n [00215] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated as a multiparticulate controlled release device, which comprises a multiplicity of particles, granules, or pellets, ranging from about 10 μιη to about 3 mm, about 50 μιη to about 2.5 mm, or from about 100 μιη to about 1 mm in diameter. Such multiparticulates can be made by the processes known to those skilled in the art, including wet-and dry-granulation, extrusion/spheronization, roller-compaction, melt-congealing, and by spray-coating seed cores. See, for example, Multiparticulate Oral Drug Delivery; Marcel Dekker: 1994; and \n\n\nPharmaceutical Pelletization Technology; Marcel Dekker: 1989. \n\n\n[00216] Other excipients or carriers as described herein can be blended with the pharmaceutical compositions to aid in processing and forming the multiparticulates. The resulting particles can themselves constitute the multiparticulate device or can be coated by various film-forming materials, such as enteric polymers, water-swellable, and water-soluble polymers. The multiparticulates can be further processed as a capsule or a tablet. \n\n\n4. Targeted Delivery \n\n\n [00217] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can also be formulated to be targeted to a particular tissue, receptor, or other area of the body of the subject to be treated, including liposome-, resealed erythrocyte-, and antibody- based delivery systems.

PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS \n\n\n[00234] Starting materials in the synthesis examples provided herein are either available from commercial sources or via literature procedures (e.g. , March Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, (1992) 4th Ed.; Wiley Interscience, New York). All commercially available compounds were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Proton ^H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were typically recorded at 300 MHz on a Bruker Avance 300 NMR spectrometer unless otherwise noted. Significant peaks are tabulated and typically include: number of protons, and multiplicity (s, singlet; d, double; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br s, broad singlet). Chemical shifts are reported as parts per million (δ) relative to tetramethylsilane. Unless otherwise noted, low resolution mass spectra (MS) were obtained as electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra, which were typically recorded on a Shimadzu HPLC/MS instrument using reverse-phase conditions using a mobile phase gradients of either acetonitrile/water containing \n\n 0.05% acetic acid or MeOH/water containing 0.2% formic acid. Preparative reverse phase HPLC was typically performed using a Varian HPLC system equipped with a Phenomenex phenylhexyl, a Phenomenex Luna CI 8, or a Varian Pursuit diphenyl reverse phase column; typical elution conditions utilized a gradient of \n\n\nacetonitrile/water containing 0.05% acetic acid. Silica gel chromatography was either performed manually, typically following the published procedure for flash \n\n\nchromatography (Still et al. (1978) J Org. Chem. 43:2923), or on an automated system (for example, on a Biotage SP instrument) using pre-packed silica gel columns. \n\n\n [00235] It is understood that in the following description, combinations of substituents and/or variables of the depicted formulae are permissible only if such contributions result in stable compounds under standard conditions. \n\n\n[00236] It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the process described below the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups. Such functional groups include hydroxy, amino, mercapto and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl or diarylalkylsilyl {e.g., t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for amino, amidino and guanidino include t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for mercapto include -C(0)-R (where R is alkyl, aryl or aralkyl), 7-methoxybenzyl, trityl and the like. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include alkyl, aryl or aralkyl esters. \n\n\n [00237] Protecting groups may be added or removed in accordance with standard techniques, which are well-known to those skilled in the art and as described herein. The use of protecting groups is described in detail in Green, T.W. and P.G.M. Wutz, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (1991), 2nd Ed., Wiley-Interscience. \n\n\n[00238] One of ordinary skill in the art could readily ascertain which choices for each substituent are possible for the reaction conditions of each Scheme. Moreover, the substituents are selected from components as indicated in the specification heretofore, and may be attached to starting materials, intermediates, and/or final products according to schemes known to those of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n [00239] Also it will be apparent that the compounds provided herein could exist as one or more isomers, that is E/Z isomers, enantiomers and/or diastereomers. \n\n\n[00240] Compounds of formula (I) may be generally prepared as depicted in the following schemes, and unless otherwise noted, the various substituents are as defined elsewhere herein. \n\n\n [00241] Standard abbreviations and acronyms as defined in J Org. Chem. 2007 72(1): 23A-24A are used herein. Other abbreviations and acronyms used herein are as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00242] Compounds provided herein are synthesized according to the following schemes and descriptions. \n\n\n [00243] As illustrated in Scheme 1, an appropriate anthranilamide derivative 1 can be transformed to a 2-carboxylate substituted quinazoline 2 by treatement with an activated oxalic acid derivative such as a dialkyl oxalate either neat or in a suitable solvent such as EtOH or HOAc with heating as required. Alternatively, 1 is treated with an oxalic acid monoalkyl ester chloride in a suitable solvent such as DCM in the presence of a base such as TEA and optionally in the presence of a catalyst such as DMAP; or 1 is treated with a cyano oxoacetate monoalkyl ester with heating in a \n\n suitable solvent such as acetonitrile or DMF in the presence of a base such as TEA. Subsequent treatment under dehydrating conditions, for example, heating with or without TMSCl in the presence of a suitable base such as DIEA in a suitable solvent such as DCE affords the quinazoline 2. Treatment of 2 with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide reagent, for example phosphoryl chloride, forms the 4-halo derivative 3. Alternatively, 2 may be treated with a sulfonyl halide to form 3 (X = O-sulfonyl). As a further alternative, 2 may also be transformed into 3 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)\n2\n-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent or P\n2\nS\n5\n, followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. Treatment of 3 with a metalloarene or metalloheteroarene, for example an aryl or heteroaryl lithium or an aryl or heteroaryl Grignard reagent in a suitable solvent such diethyl ether, THF, or other ether solvent, produces ketone 4. Subsequent conversion of 4 to 5 is accomplished by treatment of 4 with an aminoazole with heating as required in the presence of acid or base or in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands as required. \n\n\nScheme 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00244] As illustrated in Scheme 2, anthranilamides 1 may be condensed with a suitably activated carboxylic acid derivative 6 followed by dehydrative cyclization, promoted for example, with heat or with TMSCl in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as TEA, DIEA, or pyridine to form 4-hydroxyquinazoline derivatives 7. Alternatively, heating of 1 with a carboxylic acid (6, Y = OH), or its salt, in the presence of trimethylsilyl polyphosphate affords 7. Treatment of 7 with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide reagent, for example phosphoryl \n\n chloride, forms the 4-halo derivative 8. Alternatively, 7 may be treated with a sulfonyl halide in the presence of base to form 8 (X = O-sulfonyl). As a further alternative, 7 may also be transformed into 8 (X = S(0)-alkyl or S(0)\n2\n-alkyl) by treatment with Lawesson's reagent or P\n2\nS\n5\n followed by alkylation and subsequent oxidation. Subsequent conversion of 8 to 9 is accomplished under conditions analogous to those described in Scheme 1 for conversion of 4 to 5. \n\n\nScheme 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9 \n\n\n [00245] In Scheme 3 are illustrated representative examples by which the keto group in 5 can be further modified to afford additional compounds of the invention. Treatment of 5 with Lawesson's reagent affords thioketones 10. Treatment of 5with an amine, hydroxylamine, or alkoxylamine under dehydrating conditions optionally in the presence of acid with heating affords, respectively, imines, oximes, or O-alkyl oximes 11. Treatment of 5 with a Wittig reagent or Horner-Emmons reagent affords olefins 12. Treatment of 5 with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride or lithium borohydride affords secondary alcohols 13. Treatment of 5 with an organometallic reagent such as a Grignard reagent or an organolithium compound affords tertiary alcohols 14. Heating 5 with an alcohol in the presence of acid with removal of water affords ketals 15. Heating 5 with a 1,2- 1,3- or 1,4-diol in the presence of acid with removal of water affords cyclic ketals 16. \n\n Scheme 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scheme 3 (continued) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00246] In Scheme 4 is illustrated a useful method for preparing acids 6 used in\n\n\nScheme 2. A carboxylic acid derivative 17, where Y' is for example alkoxy or a subsequently removable chiral auxiliary, is deprotonated at the alpha position with a strong base and treated with an alkylating agent to afford 18. The sequence is repeated with the same or a different alkylating agent to form 19. The Y' group of 19 is then converted by procedures well known in the art to the Y group of 6 that is suitable for use in Scheme 2. \n\n\nScheme 4 \n\n\n\n\n\n 17 18 19 \n\n\n 6 \n\n\n[00247] In Scheme 5 is illustrated an alternative method for preparing acids 6 used in Scheme 2. A suitable carboxylic acid derivative, following conversion with base to an enolate 20 or its equivalent is treated with an aryl halide, or more suitably with a heteroaryl halide to form 22. The Y' group of 22 is then converted by \n\n procedures well known in the art to the Y group of 6 that is suitable for use in Scheme 2. \n\n\nScheme 5 \n\n\n\n\n\n 20 21 22 \n\n\n [00248] It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that standard functional group manipulations may be used to prepare additional compounds of the invention from products or intermediates prepared as described by the foregoing methods. In Scheme 6 are shown representative examples that are intended to illustrate, but in no way to limit the scope of, such standard functional group manipulations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\namine displacement \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00249] Scheme 7 illustrates further representative methods by which the compounds of the invention may be synthesized with various R\n6\n groups for example, when R\n6\n is a cyano, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocyclyl, \n\n\nR\nx\nC(0)OR\n18\n, R\nx\nS(0)\nq\nR\nv\n, R\nx\nNR\n19\nC(0)R\n18\n, and R\nx\nNR\n19\nS(0)\nq\nR\nv\n (where R\nx\n is a direct bond). For example, anthranilamide 34 (X\n4\n = Br or I) may be converted to the corresponding 4-hydroxyquinazoline derivative 35 via methods described for the conversion of 1 to 7 (Scheme 2).

For the binding assays, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated affinity ligands for\n\n\n30 min at rt to generate affinity resins. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween\n\n\n20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce non-specific binding. \n\n\n Binding reactions were assembled by combining kinase, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1 x binding buffer (20 % SeaBlock, 0.17x PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20,\n\n\n6 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 100 x stocks in DMSO and rapidly diluted into the aqueous environment. DMSO was added to control assays lacking a test compound. Primary screen interactions were performed in polypropylene 384- \n\n well plates in a final volume of 34 μί, while IQ determinations were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 135 μί. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour, long enough for binding reactions to reach equilibrium, and the affinity beads were washed extensively with wash buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20) to remove unbound protein. The beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 2 μΜ non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 min. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by quantitative PCR. Each kinase was tested individually against each compound. Kds were determined using eleven serial threefold dilutions. A selectivity score, which is a quantitative measure of selectivity of a compound against a panel of enzymes, may be calculated for a compound by dividing the number of enzymes for which a compound meets a set criteria, (for example, a binding constant of 100 nM or less), by the total number of enzymes tested. A kinase selectivity score, S10, for example, is calculated for each compound by dividing the number of kinases for which a compound at a certain concentration (for example, 10 μΜ) displayed inhibition of 90% or greater compared to negative control lacking inhibitors (DMSO only), divided by the number of distinct kinases tested excluding mutant variants, typically 359 or 386 kinases. \n\n\n[00398] In one embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of less than about 20 μΜ against JAK2. In another embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of less than about 10 μΜ against JAK2.

The cell line contains stably integrated beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of the regulatory factor 1 (irf 1) response element recognized by the activated transcription factor STAT5. csTF-1 cells (Invitrogen K1219) were washed with assay media (97%OPTIMEM/ 0.5%dialyzed FBS/ O. lmM NEAA/ ImM Na pyr/ P/S) and seeded in the same media at 5xl0\n5\n cell/mL in T150 flask. After 16 hour incubation, cells were seeded at 2xl0\n5\n cell/well in 50 μΐ volume, into Costar, clear bottom, 96-well assay plates. Serial dilutions of compounds were added to the plates with final DMSO concentration at 0.5% and GM-CSF at 2ng/mL and the plates were then incubated at 30°C and 5% C0\n2\n for 4 hours. The plates were brought to room temperature before adding Substrate Mixture according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Catalog # K1085). The assay plates containing the substrate mixture were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2 hours.

One of the compounds of Formula I provided herein was assayed in an antagonist mode using cell lines specifically expressing human \n\n\nADORA\n3\n in an assay utilizing enzyme fragment complementation with β- galactosidase (β-Gal) as the functional reporter (PathHunter β-Arrestin assay, DiscoveRx Corporation). \n\n\n [00404] For this assay, a human ADORA\n3\n-expressing PathHunter cell line was grown according to standard procedures and maintained in selective growth media prior to assay. Cells were seeded in 384-well microplates at a density of 5000 cells per well in a total volume of 20 and were allowed to adhere and recover overnight prior to compound addition. 2-Cl-IB-MECA agonist dose curves were performed the morning of profiling to determine the EC80 value that was used for the following antagonist compound testing. For antagonist determination, cells were preincubated with one of the compound of Formula I (5 of 5X compound added to cells for 30 minutes at 37°C) followed by 2-Cl-IB-MECA agonist challenge at the EC80 concentration (5 of 6X EC80 agonist incubated at 37 °C for 90 minutes). Assay signal was generated by addition of 15 μΐ\n^\n of PathHunter Detection reagent cocktail for 1 hour at room temperature. Microplates were read with a Perkin Elmer Envision instrument for chemiluminescent signal detection. Percentage inhibition was calculated using the following formula: % Inhibition =100% x (1 - (Mean RLU of test sample - mean RLU of vehicle control) / (mean RLU of EC80 control - mean RLU of vehicle control)).

Description\n\n\n\n\n QUINOLINE AND ISOQUINOLINE COMPOUNDS AND METHODS OF USE \n\n\n THEREOF\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\n [0001] This application claims the benefit of the priority of U.S. Provisional\n\n\nApplication No. 61/379,324, filed September 1, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n\n\n FIELD \n\n\n [0002] Provided herein are compounds that are modulators of JAK kinases, compositions comprising the compounds and methods of use thereof. The compounds provided are useful in the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of a disease or disorder related to JAK, including JAK2, JAK3 or TYK2 kinases, or one or more symptoms associated with such diseases or disorders. Further provided are methods for treatment of cancer, including blood borne and solid tumors. \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\n [0003] The JAK kinase family is a cytoplasmic protein kinase family comprising the members JAKl, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Growth factor or cytokine receptors that recruit JAK kinases include the interferon receptors, interleukin receptors (receptors for the cytokines IL-2 to IL-7, IL-9 to IL-13, IL-15, IL-23), various hormone receptors (erythropoietin (Epo) receptor, the thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor, the leptin receptor, the insulin receptor, the prolactin (PRL) receptor, the Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) receptor and the growth hormone receptor, receptor protein tyrosine kinases (such as EGFR and PDGFR), and receptors for other growth factors such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), Oncostatin M (OSM), IFNa/β/γ, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) (See, Rane, S.G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679). \n\n\n [0004] Phosphorylated receptors serve as docking sites for other SH-2 domain containing signaling molecules that interact with JAKs such as the STAT family of transcription factors, Src family of kinases, MAP kinases, PI3 kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatases (Rane S.G. and Reddy E.P., Oncogene 2000 19, 5662-5679).\n\n\nThe family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors, STATs, is the most well characterized downstream substrates for JAKs. The STAT proteins bind to phosphorylated cytokine receptors through their SH2 domains to become \n\n phosphorylated by JAKs, which leads to their dimerization and release and eventual translocation to the nucleus where they activate gene transcription. The various members of STAT which have been identified thus far, are STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5 (including STAT5a and STAT5b) and STAT6. \n\n\n[0005] Since the JAK kinases may play an important signaling role via such receptors, disorders of fat metabolism, growth disorders and disorders of the immune system are all potential therapeutic targets. \n\n\n [0006] The JAK kinases and JAK2 mutations are implicated in \n\n\nmyeloproliferative disorders, cancers, including blood borne and solid tumors. \n\n\nExemplary disorders include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and systemic mastocytosis (SM). Myeloproliferative disorders are believed to arise from either gain-of-function mutations to JAK itself or from activation by the oncoprotein BCR-ABL, which specifically activates the JAK2 pathway. Several literature reports describe role of JAK2 mutations in various disorders. See, Samanta et al. Cancer Res 2006, 66(13), 6468-6472, Sawyers et al. Cell, 1992, 76», 901-910, Tefferi N. Eng. J.

EMBO 2002 21(9), 2159-2167. \n\n\n [0007] Literature indicates that JAK may also serve as a target for prostate cancer, including androgen-resistant prostate cancer. See, Barton et al. Mol. Cane. Ther. 2004 3(1), 11-20, Blume- Jensen et al. Nature (2001) 411(6835):355-356 and Bromberg J Clin Invest. (2002) 109(9): 1139-1142 and Rane Oncogene (2000) 19(49):5662-5679. JAK as a prominent mediator of the cytokine signaling pathway, is considered to be a therapeutic target for inflammation and transplant rejections. \n\n See, Borie et al., Transplantation (2005) 79(7):791-801 and Milici et al., Arthritis Research (2008) 10(R14):l-9 \n\n\n [0008] Given the multitude of diseases attributed to the dysregulation of JAK signaling, many small molecule inhibitors of JAK are currently being developed. Examples of compounds in preclinical development include TGI 01209 (TargeGen). Examples of compounds being investigated in clinical studies include INCBO 18424 (Incyte), XL019 (Exelixis) and TG101348 (TargeGen). See, Pardanani et al. \n\n\nLeukemia 2007, 21 : 1658-1668; and Pardanai, A. Leukemia 2008 22:23-20. \n\n\n[0009] There is, however, an ever-existing need to provide novel classes of compounds that are useful as inhibtors of enzymes in the JAK signaling pathway.\n\n\nSUMMARY \n\n\n [0010] Provided herein are compounds of formula (I) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or hydrates thereof, wherein \n\n\n Z\n1\n and Z\n2\n are each independently N or CR°, such that one of Z\n1\n or Z\n2\n is N and the other is CR°;

Isotopic enrichment (for example, deuteration) of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics (\"PK\"), pharmacodynamics (\"PD\"), and toxicity profiles, has been demonstrated previously with some classes of drugs. See, for example, Lijinsky et. al, Food Cosmet. Toxicol, 20: 393 (1982); Lijinsky et. al, J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 69: 1127 (1982); Mangold et. al, Mutation Res. 308: 33 \n\n (1994); Gordon et. al, Drug Metab. Dispos., 15: 589 (1987); Zello et. al, \n\n\nMetabolism, 43: 487 (1994); Gately et. al, J. Nucl. Med., 27: 388 (1986); Wade D, Chem. Biol. Interact. I ll: 191 (1999). \n\n\n [00114] Isotopic enrichment of a drug can be used, for example, to (1) reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites, (2) increase the half-life of the parent drug, (3) decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect, (4) decrease the amount of a dose necessary to achieve a desired effect, (5) increase the formation of active metabolites, if any are formed, and/or (6) decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues and/or create a more effective drug and/or a safer drug for combination therapy, whether the combination therapy is intentional or not. \n\n\n[00115] Replacement of an atom for one of its isotopes often will result in a change in the reaction rate of a chemical reaction. This phenomenon is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"KIE\"). For example, if a C-H bond is broken during a rate- determining step in a chemical reaction (i.e. the step with the highest transition state energy), substitution of a deuterium for that hydrogen will cause a decrease in the reaction rate and the process will slow down. This phenomenon is known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"DKIE\"). (See, e.g, Foster et al, Adv. Drug Res., vol. 14, pp. 1-36 (1985); Kushner et al, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., vol. 77, pp. 79- 88 (1999)). \n\n\n [00116] Tritium (\"T\") is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, used in research, fusion reactors, neutron generators and radiopharmaceuticals. Tritium is a hydrogen atom that has 2 neutrons in the nucleus and has an atomic weight close to 3. It occurs naturally in the environment in very low concentrations, most commonly found as T\n2\n0. Tritium decays slowly (half-life = 12.3 years) and emits a low energy beta particle that cannot penetrate the outer layer of human skin. Internal exposure is the main hazard associated with this isotope, yet it must be ingested in large amounts to pose a significant health risk. As compared with deuterium, a lesser amount of tritium must be consumed before it reaches a hazardous level. Substitution of tritium (\"T\") for hydrogen results in yet a stronger bond than deuterium and gives numerically larger isotope effects. Similarly, substitution of isotopes for other elements, including, but not limited to, \n13\nC or \n14\nC for carbon, \n33\nS, \n34\nS, or \n36\nS for sulfur, \n15\nN for nitrogen, and \n17\n0 or \n18\n0 for oxygen, will provide a similar kinetic isotope effects. \n\n C.

The \n\n\npharmaceutical compositions provided herein for inhaled/intranasal administration can further comprise a suitable flavor, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium. \n\n\n [00166] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein for topical administration can be formulated to be immediate release or modified release, including delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted, and programmed release. \n\n\nModified Release \n\n\n [00167] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can be formulated as a modified release dosage form. As used herein, the term \"modified release\" refers to a dosage form in which the rate or place of release of the active ingredient(s) is different from that of an immediate dosage form when administered by the same route. Modified release dosage forms include delayed-, extended-, prolonged-, sustained-, pulsatile-, controlled-, accelerated- and fast-, targeted-, programmed- release, and gastric retention dosage forms.

The release rate of the active ingredient(s) can also be modified by varying the particle sizes and \n\n\npolymorphorism of the active ingredient(s). \n\n\n [00168] Examples of modified release include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos.: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; \n\n 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; \n\n\n5,639,480; 5,733,566; 5,739,108; 5,891,474; 5,922,356; 5,972,891; 5,980,945; \n\n\n5,993,855; 6,045,830; 6,087,324; 6,113,943; 6,197,350; 6,248,363; 6,264,970; \n\n\n6,267,981; 6,376,461; 6,419,961; 6,589,548; 6,613,358; and 6,699,500. \n\n\n1. Matrix Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n[00169] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using a matrix controlled release device known to those skilled in the art (see, Takada et al in \"Encyclopedia of Controlled Drug Delivery,\" Vol. 2, Mathiowitz Ed., Wiley, 1999). \n\n\n [00170] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form is formulated using an erodible matrix device, which is water-swellable, erodible, or soluble polymers, including synthetic polymers, and naturally occurring polymers and derivatives, such as polysaccharides and proteins. \n\n\n [00171] Materials useful in forming an erodible matrix include, but are not limited to, chitin, chitosan, dextran, and pullulan; gum agar, gum arabic, gum karaya, locust bean gum, gum tragacanth, carrageenans, gum ghatti, guar gum, xanthan gum, and scleroglucan; starches, such as dextrin and maltodextrin; hydrophilic colloids, such as pectin; phosphatides, such as lecithin; alginates; propylene glycol alginate; gelatin; collagen; and cellulosics, such as ethyl cellulose (EC), methylethyl cellulose (MEC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), CMEC, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose propionate (CP), cellulose butyrate (CB), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CAP, CAT, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), HPMCP, HPMCAS, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate trimellitate (HPMCAT), and ethylhydroxy ethylcellulose (EHEC); polyvinyl pyrrolidone; polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinyl acetate; glycerol fatty acid esters; \n\n\npolyacrylamide; polyacrylic acid; copolymers of ethacrylic acid or methacrylic acid (EUDRAGIT\n®\n, Rohm America, Inc., Piscataway, NJ); poly(2-hydroxyethyl- methacrylate); polylactides; copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate; degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers; poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid; and other acrylic acid derivatives, such as homopolymers and copolymers of \n\n butylmethacrylate, methylmethacrylate, ethylmethacrylate, ethylacrylate, (2- dimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate, and (trimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate chloride. \n\n\n[00172] In further embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are formulated with a non-erodible matrix device. The active ingredient(s) is dissolved or dispersed in an inert matrix and is released primarily by diffusion through the inert matrix once administered. Materials suitable for use as a non-erodible matrix device included, but are not limited to, insoluble plastics, such as polyethylene, \n\n\npolypropylene, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, \n\n\npolymethylmethacrylate, polybutylmethacrylate, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, methyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate copolymers, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, vinyl chloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubber \n\n\nepichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, and ethylene/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, polyvinyl chloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized polyethylene terephthalate, natural rubber, silicone rubbers, polydimethylsiloxanes, silicone carbonate copolymers, and ; \n\n\nhydrophilic polymers, such as ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, crospovidone, and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate; and fatty compounds, such as carnauba wax, microcrystalline wax, and triglycerides. \n\n\n [00173] In a matrix controlled release system, the desired release kinetics can be controlled, for example, via the polymer type employed, the polymer viscosity, the particle sizes of the polymer and/or the active ingredient(s), the ratio of the active ingredient(s) versus the polymer, and other excipients or carriers in the compositions. \n\n\n[00174] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art, including direct compression, dry or wet granulation followed by compression, melt- granulation followed by compression. \n\n\n2. Osmotic Controlled Release Devices \n\n [00175] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using an osmotic controlled release device, including one-chamber system, two-chamber system, asymmetric membrane technology (AMT), and extruding core system (ECS). In general, such devices have at least two components: (a) the core which contains the active ingredient(s); and (b) a semipermeable membrane with at least one delivery port, which encapsulates the core. The semipermeable membrane controls the influx of water to the core from an aqueous environment of use so as to cause drug release by extrusion through the delivery port(s). \n\n\n [00176] In addition to the active ingredient(s), the core of the osmotic device optionally includes an osmotic agent, which creates a driving force for transport of water from the environment of use into the core of the device. One class of osmotic agents water-swellable hydrophilic polymers, which are also referred to as \n\n\n\"osmopolymers\" and \"hydrogels,\" including, but not limited to, hydrophilic vinyl and acrylic polymers, polysaccharides such as calcium alginate, polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic) acid, poly(methacrylic) acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), crosslinked PVP, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA/PVP copolymers, PVA/PVP copolymers with hydrophobic monomers such as methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, hydrophilic polyurethanes containing large PEO blocks, sodium \n\n\ncroscarmellose, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carboxyethyl, cellulose (CEC), sodium alginate, polycarbophil, gelatin, xanthan gum, and sodium starch glycolate. \n\n\n [00177] The other class of osmotic agents is osmogens, which are capable of imbibing water to affect an osmotic pressure gradient across the barrier of the surrounding coating. Suitable osmogens include, but are not limited to, inorganic salts, such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium phosphates, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, lithium sulfate, potassium chloride, and sodium sulfate; sugars, such as dextrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, lactose, maltose, mannitol, raffmose, sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and xylitol; organic acids, such as ascorbic acid, \n\n benzoic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, sebacic acid, sorbic acid, adipic acid, edetic acid, glutamic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid; urea; and mixtures thereof. \n\n\n [00178] Osmotic agents of different dissolution rates can be employed to influence how rapidly the active ingredient(s) is initially delivered from the dosage form. For example, amorphous sugars, such as MANNOGEM\n™\n EZ (SPI Pharma, Lewes, DE) can be used to provide faster delivery during the first couple of hours to promptly produce the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of the remaining amount to maintain the desired level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In this case, the active ingredient(s) is released at such a rate to replace the amount of the active ingredient metabolized and excreted. \n\n\n [00179] The core can also include a wide variety of other excipients and carriers as described herein to enhance the performance of the dosage form or to promote stability or processing. \n\n\n [00180] Materials useful in forming the semipermeable membrane include various grades of acrylics, vinyls, ethers, polyamides, polyesters, and cellulosic derivatives that are water-permeable and water-insoluble at physiologically relevant pHs, or are susceptible to being rendered water-insoluble by chemical alteration, such as crosslinking. Examples of suitable polymers useful in forming the coating, include plasticized, unplasticized, and reinforced cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, CA propionate, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CA ethyl carbamate, CAP, CA methyl carbamate, CA succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), CA dimethylaminoacetate, CA ethyl carbonate, CA chloroacetate, CA ethyl oxalate, CA methyl sulfonate, CA butyl sulfonate, CA p-toluene sulfonate, agar acetate, amylose triacetate, beta glucan acetate, beta glucan triacetate, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetate, triacetate of locust bean gum, hydroxylated ethylene- vinylacetate, EC, PEG, PPG, PEG/PPG copolymers, PVP, HEC, HPC, CMC, CMEC, HPMC, HPMCP, HPMCAS, HPMCAT, poly(acrylic) acids and esters and poly- (methacrylic) acids and esters and copolymers thereof, starch, dextran, dextrin, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, polyalkenes, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, \n\n polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. \n\n\n [00181] Semipermeable membrane can also be a hydrophobic microporous membrane, wherein the pores are substantially filled with a gas and are not wetted by the aqueous medium but are permeable to water vapor, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,119. Such hydrophobic but water-vapor permeable membrane are typically composed of hydrophobic polymers such as polyalkenes, polyethylene, \n\n\npolypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyacrylic acid derivatives, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. \n\n\n[00182] The delivery port(s) on the semipermeable membrane can be formed post-coating by mechanical or laser drilling. Delivery port(s) can also be formed in situ by erosion of a plug of water-soluble material or by rupture of a thinner portion of the membrane over an indentation in the core. In addition, delivery ports can be formed during coating process, as in the case of asymmetric membrane coatings of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,612,059 and 5,698,220. \n\n\n [00183] The total amount of the active ingredient(s) released and the release rate can substantially by modulated via the thickness and porosity of the \n\n\nsemipermeable membrane, the composition of the core, and the number, size, and position of the delivery ports. \n\n\n [00184] The pharmaceutical compositions in an osmotic controlled-release dosage form can further comprise additional conventional excipients or carriers as described herein to promote performance or processing of the formulation. \n\n\n[00185] The osmotic controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art (see, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, supra; Santus and Baker, J Controlled Release 1995, 35, 1-21; Verma et al., Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy 2000, 26, 695-708; Verma et al., J Controlled Release 2002, 79, 7-27). \n\n\n[00186] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are formulated as AMT controlled-release dosage form, which comprises an asymmetric osmotic membrane that coats a core comprising the active ingredient(s) and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. See, U.S. Pat. No. \n\n5,612,059 and WO 2002/17918. The AMT controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art, including direct compression, dry granulation, wet granulation, and a dip- coating method. \n\n\n [00187] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are formulated as ESC controlled-release dosage form, which comprises an osmotic membrane that coats a core comprising the active ingredient(s), a \n\n\nhydroxylethyl cellulose, and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. \n\n\n3. Multiparticulate Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n [00188] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated as a multiparticulate controlled release device, which comprises a multiplicity of particles, granules, or pellets, ranging from about 10 μιη to about 3 mm, about 50 μιη to about 2.5 mm, or from about 100 μιη to about 1 mm in diameter. Such multiparticulates can be made by the processes known to those skilled in the art, including wet-and dry-granulation, extrusion/spheronization, roller-compaction, melt-congealing, and by spray-coating seed cores. See, for example, Multiparticulate Oral Drug Delivery; Marcel Dekker: 1994; and \n\n\nPharmaceutical Pelletization Technology; Marcel Dekker: 1989. \n\n\n[00189] Other excipients or carriers as described herein can be blended with the pharmaceutical compositions to aid in processing and forming the multiparticulates. The resulting particles can themselves constitute the multiparticulate device or can be coated by various film-forming materials, such as enteric polymers, water-swellable, and water-soluble polymers. The multiparticulates can be further processed as a capsule or a tablet. \n\n\n4. Targeted Delivery \n\n\n [00190] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can also be formulated to be targeted to a particular tissue, receptor, or other area of the body of the subject to be treated, including liposome-, resealed erythrocyte-, and antibody- based delivery systems.

Such assays include, for example, biochemical assays such as binding assays, see, Fabian et al, Nature Biotechnology 2005, 23,329-336, radioactivity incorporation assays, as well as a variety of cell based assays. \n\n\n [00192] Exemplary cell based assay methodologies include measurement of\n\n\nSTAT5A phosphorylation, for example, by ELISA or the measurement of proliferation in leukemic cell lines such as TF-1 or HEL-2, for example, by BrdU incorporation, by fluorescent staining or by a reporter assay activated by the transcription factor STAT5. Cells useful in the assays include cells with wildtype JAK such as TF-1 or mutated JAK such as the cell line HEL-2 which express a constitutively active JAK2 carrying the V617F mutation. Suitable cells include those derived through cell culture from patient samples as well as cells derived using routine molecular biology techniques, e.g., retroviral transduction, transfection, mutagenesis, etc. \n\n\n E.

PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS \n\n\n[00203] Starting materials in the synthesis examples provided herein are either available from commercial sources or via literature procedures (e.g. , March Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, (1992) 4th Ed.; Wiley Interscience, New York). All commercially available compounds were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Proton ^H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were typically recorded at 300 MHz on a Bruker Avance 300 NMR spectrometer unless otherwise noted. Significant peaks are tabulated and typically include: number of protons, and multiplicity (s, singlet; d, double; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br s, broad singlet). Chemical shifts are reported as parts per million (δ) relative to tetramethylsilane. Unless otherwise noted, low resolution mass \n\n spectra (MS) were obtained as electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra, which were typically recorded on a Shimadzu HPLC/MS instrument using reverse-phase conditions using a mobile phase gradients of either acetonitrile/water containing 0.05% acetic acid or MeOH/water containing 0.2% formic acid. Preparative reverse phase HPLC was typically performed using a Varian HPLC system equipped with a Phenomenex phenylhexyl, a Phenomenex Luna CI 8, or a Varian Pursuit diphenyl reverse phase column; typical elution conditions utilized a gradient of \n\n\nacetonitrile/water containing 0.05% acetic acid. Silica gel chromatography was either performed manually, typically following the published procedure for flash \n\n\nchromatography (Still et al. (1978) J Org. Chem. 43:2923), or on an automated system (for example, on a Biotage SP instrument) using pre-packed silica gel columns. \n\n\n [00204] It is understood that in the following description, combinations of substituents and/or variables of the depicted formulae are permissible only if such contributions result in stable compounds under standard conditions. \n\n\n[00205] It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the process described below the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups. Such functional groups include hydroxy, amino, mercapto and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl or diarylalkylsilyl {e.g., t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for amino, amidino and guanidino include t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for mercapto include -C(0)-R (where R is alkyl, aryl or aralkyl), 7-methoxybenzyl, trityl and the like. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include alkyl, aryl or aralkyl esters. \n\n\n [00206] Protecting groups may be added or removed in accordance with standard techniques, which are well-known to those skilled in the art and as described herein. The use of protecting groups is described in detail in Green, T.W. and P.G.M. Wutz, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (1991), 2nd Ed., Wiley-Interscience. \n\n\n[00207] One of ordinary skill in the art could readily ascertain which choices for each substituent are possible for the reaction conditions of each Scheme. Moreover, the substituents are selected from components as indicated in the specification \n\n heretofore, and may be attached to starting materials, intermediates, and/or final products according to schemes known to those of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n\n[00208] Also it will be apparent that the compounds provided herein could exist as one or more isomers, that is E/Z isomers, enantiomers and/or diastereomers. \n\n\n[00209] Compounds of formula (I) may be generally prepared as depicted in the following schemes, and unless otherwise noted, the various substituents are as defined elsewhere herein. \n\n\n [00210] Standard abbreviations and acronyms as defined in J Org. Chem. 2007 72(1): 23A-24A are used herein. Other abbreviations and acronyms used herein are as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00211] Compounds provided herein are synthesized according to the following schemes and descriptions. \n\n\n [00212] In Scheme 1 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of isoquinolines 6. As described in the literature (see Hurtley, J. Chem. Soc. 1929, 1872) treatment of an appropriate ortho-halobenzoic acid 1 with dialkyl malonate and subsequent processing under conditions described affords diacid 2. Condensation of 2 with ammonia with heating or other dehydrating conditions produces \n\n\ndihydroxyisoquinoline 3 (see Bailey, J. Chem. Soc. 1956, 2477; US2351391). The \n\n hydroxyl groups of 3 are converted to leaving groups X by treating with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide reagent, for example phosphoryl chloride, to form 2,4-dihalo derivatives 4 (X = halo). Alternatively, X can be a different leaving group moiety, for example sulfonate, via treatment of 3 with an appropriate sulfonyl halide in the presence of base such as a tertiary amine. \n\n\nTreatment of 4 with an aminoazole with heating as required in the presence of base or in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands as required affords 5. Treatment of 5 with a suitable thiolate reagent with heating as required forms an intermediate sulfide, which is oxidized by treatment at 0 °C to rt with a stoichiometric or slight excess quantity of an oxidant such as a percarboxylic acid to give sulfoxide 6 (n = 1). Sulfone 6 (n = 2) is formed either from further oxidation of the sulfoxide using additional equivalents of oxidant at rt to elevated temperature as required, or can be formed directly from the sulfide by treatment with two to four equivalents of oxidant at rt to elevated temperature as required to drive the reaction to substantial completion. In some cases it may be advantageous to displace one of the X groups of 4 with a group \"Prot\" followed by reaction with a thiolate reagent to form 7. \"Prot\" is intended to be a group, for example alkoxy, which can be subsequently conveniently reverted to a leaving group X, for example, to afford 8. Conversion of 8 to 9 is effected under conditions analogous to, or if needed, more forcing than, those that used to effect conversion of 4 to 5. Conversion of 9 to 6 is carried out under conditions analogous to those described above for the conversion of 5 to 6. \n\n\nAlternatively, conversion of 8 to 6 may be achieved via treatment first with a stoichiometric or slight excess quantity of an oxidant such as a percarboxylic acid to give a sulfoxide intermediate (n = 1), or further oxidation of the sulfoxide using additional equivalents of oxidant at rt to elevated temperature as required to afford the sulfone intermediate (n = 2). Subsequent treatment of such sulfoxide or sulfone intermediates with an aminoazole with heating as required in the presence of base or in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands as required affords 6. \n\n\nScheme 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 7 8 9 \n\n\n [00213] In Scheme 2 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of isoquinolines 15. A suitable ortho-halobenzoate ester 10 is treated with 2-acetamidoacrylate ester in the presence of a Pd catalyst, for example palladium acetate, with heating in a suitable solvent such as DMF to form intermediate 11, which upon further heating is transformed to 12. The hydroxyl group of 12 is converted to a leaving group X by treating with an appropriate phosphorous or phosphoryl halide reagent, for example phosphoryl chloride, to form 13 (X = halo). Alternatively, X can be a different leaving group moiety, for example sulfonate, via treatment of 12 with an appropriate sulfonyl halide in the presence of base such as a tertiary amine. Treatment of 13 with a metalloarene or metalloheteroarene, for example an aryl or heteroaryl lithium or an aryl or heteroaryl Grignard reagent in a suitable solvent such diethyl ether, THF, or other ether solvent, produces ketone 14. Treatment of 14 with an aminoazole with heating as required in the presence of acid or base or in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands as required affords 15. \n\n Scheme 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00214] In Scheme 3 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of isoquinoliness 21. In a manner analogous to procedures described in WO2003/ 106421, a suitable ortho-methybenzonitrile 16 is deprotonated with strong base and then treated with a suitably activated carboxylic acid 17, wherein Y may be alkoxy or -N(Me)OMe, to form ketone 18. Treatment of 18 under acidic conditions effects ring closure to the hydroxyisoquinoline derivative 19. The hydroxyl group of 19 is converted to a leaving group X to form 20 in a manner analogous to that described in Scheme 2 for conversion of 12 to 13. Treatment of 20 with an aminoazole with heating as required in the presence of acid or base or in the presence of a suitable Pd catalyst with added Pd ligands as required affords 21. \n\n\nScheme 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00215] In Scheme 4 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of quinolines 27. As described by Lutz, et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1946, 68, 1285), treatment of a suitable anthranilic ester 22 with a dialkyl malonate such as 23 affords amide 24. Treatment of 24 with a base such as an alkoxide with heating effects ring closure, which is followed by ester hydrolysis and decarboxylation to \n\n afford 25. Conversion of 25 to 27 via 26 is effected using methodology analogous to that described in Scheme 1 for conversion of 3 to 6. \n\n\nScheme 4 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00216] In Scheme 5 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of quinolines 32. As described in US5026700, treatment of a suitable aniline 28 with dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate in refluxing alcohol solvent affords hydroxy quinoline 29. Alternatively, dialkyl 2-oxosuccinate may be substituted for dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate following a procedure reported by Riegel, et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1946, 68, 2685. Conversion of 29 to 32 via 30 and 31 may be effected using methodology analogous to that described in Scheme 2 for converting 12 to 15. Scheme 5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00217] In Scheme 6 is illustrated synthetic methodology suitable for preparation of quinolines 36. A suitable aniline 28 is acetylated under Friedel-Crafts conditions and then the amino group is acylated with a suitably activated carboxylic acid derivative 17 to afford amide 33. Ring closure to 34 is effected by treatment with a base such as hydroxide or alkoxide with heating as required. Conversion of 34 \n\n to 36 via 35 is effected using methodology analogous to that described in Scheme 3 for conversion of 19 to 21. \n\n\nScheme 6 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 35 36 \n\n\n [00218] In Scheme 7 are illustrated representative examples by which the keto group in any of 15 (Scheme 2) or 32 (Scheme 5) can be further modified to afford additional compounds of the invention. Treatment of ketone with Lawesson's reagent affords thioketones 37. Treatment of ketone with an amine, hydroxylamine, or alkoxylamine under dehydrating conditions optionally in the presence of acid with heating affords, respectively, imines, oximes, or O-alkyl oximes 38. Treatment of ketone with a Wittig reagent or Horner-Emmons reagent affords olefins 39. \n\n\nTreatment of ketone with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride or lithium borohydride affords secondary alcohols 40. Treatment of ketone with an \n\n\norganometallic reagent such as a Grignard reagent or an organolithium compound affords tertiary alcohols 41. Heating ketone with an alcohol in the presence of acid with removal of water affords ketals 42. Heating ketone with a 1,2- 1,3- or 1, 4 diol in the presence of acid with removal of water affords cyclic ketals 43. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 7 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scheme 7 (continued) \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n[00219] In Scheme 8 is illustrated a useful method for preparing acids 17 used in Schemes 3 and 6. A carboxylic acid derivative 44, where Y' is for example alkoxy or a subsequently removable chiral auxiliary, is deprotonated at the alpha position with a strong base and treated with an alkylating agent to afford 45. The sequence is repeated with the same or a different alkylating agent to form 46. The Y' group of 46 is then converted by procedures well known in the art to the Y group of 17 that is suitable for use in Scheme 3 or 6. \n\n\n Scheme 8 \n\n\n\n\n\n 44 45 46 \n\n\n ► 17 \n\n\n [00220] In Scheme 9 is illustrated an alternative method for preparing acids 17 used in Schemes 3 and 6. A suitable carboxylic acid derivative, following conversion with base to an enolate 47 or its equivalent is treated with an aryl halide, or more suitably with a heteroaryl halide to form 49. The Y' group of 49 is then converted by procedures well known in the art to the Y group of 17 that is suitable for use in Scheme 3 or 6. \n\n Scheme 9 \n\n\n\n\n\n[00221] It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that standard functional group manipulations may be used to prepare additional compounds of the invention from products or intermediates prepared as described by the foregoing methods. In Scheme 10 are shown representative examples that are intended to illustrate, but in no way to limit the scope of, such standard functional group manipulations. \n\n\n\n\nScheme 10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n R\n13\n = heteroaryl, -C(0)-R\nv\n' C(0)OR\nw\n, etc. \n\n\n 55 \n\n\nScheme 10 (continued) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00222] Aminoazole or azolyl amine intermediates employed herein may be obtained either via commercial sources or prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. Scheme 11 illustrates representative methods that may be employed for the preparation of additional aminoazoles or azolyl amines. For example, nitroazoles 61 may be converted to aminoazoles 62 via treatment with a suitable reducing agent such as SnCl\n2\n in a suitable solvent such as DCE or EtOH optionally in the presence of HC1, with heating. Alternatively, treatment of 61 with activated iron or zinc metal in HO Ac with heating will afford 62. Alternatively, treatment of 61 with palladium metal on activated carbon in the presence of > 1 atmosphere pressure of hydrogen gas, in a suitable solvent such as MeOH, EtOH, or EtOAc or mixtures of these, at rt or with heating as required, will afford 62. Alternatively treatment of 61 with sodium hydrosulfite in a suitable solvent mixture such as THF and water at rt or with heating as required, will afford 62. Alternatively, aminoazoles 62 may also be obtained from azole carboxylic acids 63 via initial treatment with diphenylphosphoryl azide in the presence of an organic base such as TEA, and in a suitable solvent such as \n\n toluene or THF, and with heating from 50 °C to 150 °C as required, followed by hydrolysis. Alternatively, treatment of 63 with diphenylphosphoryl azide in the presence of an organic base such as TEA, and in the presence of excess tert-butanol, and in a suitable solvent such as toluene or THF, and with heating from 50 °C to 150 °C as required, will afford a tert-butylcarbamoyl azole intermediate, which upon treatment with an acid such as TFA or HC1 in a suitable solvent, will afford 62. \n\n\nAminoazoles 62 may also be obtained from azolyl bromides or iodides 64, bearing (as required) suitable protecting groups on any azole ring N-H position, via initial treatment with a suitable amino containing reagent (where P = protecting group), such as benzophenone imine, 2,4-dimethoxybenzylamine, or tert-butyl carbamate, and in the presence of a catalytic amount of a suitable organopalladium-complex, and optionally in the presence of a suitable phosphine-ligand, and optionally in the presence of a suitable base, and in a suitable solvent at elevated temperature or under microwave conditions, to afford intermediate 65. Subsequent N-deprotection of intermediate 65 (including azole ring N-deprotection, where required), employing appropriate methods known to those skilled in the art will afford 62. Conversion of aminoazoles 62 to alkylated aminoazoles 66 may be achieved via treatment of 62 with an appropriate aldehyde or ketone substrate, in the presence of a suitable Lewis acid such as TMSC1 or TiCl\n4\n and a suitable reducing agent such as sodium \n\n\n(triacetoxy)borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride, in a suitable organic solvent such as DCM, DCE, THF, or MeOH, optionally in the presence of HO Ac, at rt or with heating as required. Alternatively, 66 may be obtained via treatment of 62 with an alkyl halide in the presence of a suitable organic base such as pyridine or DIEA, and sodium or potassium iodide, and in a suitable solvent such as DMF or THF, at rt or with heating as required. Nitroazoles 61, azole carboxylic acids 63, and azole bromides or iodides 64 may be obtained from commercial sources or prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\nScheme 11 \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n 61 62 \n\n\n \n\n 64 \n62\n \n\n\n P = protecting group \n\n\n\n\n\n 62 66 \n\n\n[00223] The subject matter has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of description rather than of limitation.

For the binding assays, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated affinity ligands for\n\n\n30 min at rt to generate affinity resins. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween \n\n 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce non-specific binding. \n\n\nBinding reactions were assembled by combining kinase, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1 x binding buffer (20 % SeaBlock, 0.17x PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 6 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 100 x stocks in DMSO and rapidly diluted into the aqueous environment. DMSO was added to control assays lacking a test compound. Primary screen interactions were performed in polypropylene 384- well plates in a final volume of 34 μί, while Kd determinations were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 135 μί. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour, long enough for binding reactions to reach equilibrium, and the affinity beads were washed extensively with wash buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20) to remove unbound protein. The beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 2 μΜ non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 min. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by quantitative PCR. Each kinase was tested individually against each compound. Kds were determined using eleven serial threefold dilutions. A selectivity score, which is a quantitative measure of selectivity of a compound against a panel of enzymes, may be calculated for a compound by dividing the number of enzymes for which a compound meets a set criteria, (for example, a binding constant of 100 nM or less), by the total number of enzymes tested. A kinase selectivity score, S10, for example, is calculated for each compound by dividing the number of kinases for which a compound at a certain concentration (for example, 10 μΜ) displayed inhibition of 90% or greater compared to negative control lacking inhibitors (DMSO only), divided by the number of distinct kinases tested excluding mutant variants, typically 359 or 386 kinases. \n\n\n[00300] In one embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of less than about 20 μΜ against JAK2.

The cell line contains stably integrated beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of the regulatory factor 1 (irf 1) response element recognized by the activated transcription factor STAT5. csTF-1 cells (Invitrogen K1219) were washed with assay media (97%OPTIMEM/ 0.5%dialyzed FBS/ O. lmM NEAA/ ImM Na pyr/ P/S) and seeded in the same media at 5xl0\n5\n cell/mL in T150 flask. After 16 hour incubation, cells were seeded at 2xl0\n5\n cell/well in 50 μΐ volume, into Costar, clear bottom, 96-well assay plates. Serial dilutions of compounds were added to the plates with final DMSO concentration at 0.5% and GM-CSF at 2ng/mL and the plates were then incubated at 30°C and 5% C0\n2\n for 4 hours. The plates were brought to room temperature before adding Substrate Mixture according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Catalog # K1085). The assay plates containing the substrate mixture were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2 hours. Blue and green fluorescence was measured with excitation at 409nm and emission at 460nm (for blue) and excitation at 409nm and emission at 530nm (for green) using Spectra Max Gemini EM. The compounds provided herein were found to have IC\n50\n of less than about 5 μΜ. In another embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have activity IC\n50\n of less than about 500 nM. \n\n\n [00303] The compounds provided herein were found to have the following activity shown in Table 1 : \n\n\n Table 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n xamp e \n\n\nIn Table 1 , \n\n\n CSTF-1 reporter assay IC\n50\n (nM): A <100, 100<B<500, O500; \n\n\n JAK2 Kd (nM): A <5, 5<B<50, O50; JAK3 Kd (nM): A <10, 10<B<100, O100;\n\n\nTYK2 Kd (nM) A <10, 10<B<100, O100; \n\n\n S score: A <0.3, 0.3<B<0.4, 0.4<C<0.5, D > 0.5; and ND= no data. \n\n\n [00304] In certain embodiments, the compounds provided herein bind to JAK2 kinase with higher specificity as compared to non-mutant and non-JAK family kinases. For certain compounds provided herein, binding constants for less than 10 non-mutant and non-JAK family kinases are within 100-fold of the binding constant for JAK2 kinase for compounds provided herein. For certain compounds provided herein, binding constants for less than 8 non-mutant and non-JAK family kinases are within 100-fold of the binding constant for JAK2 kinase for compounds provided herein. For certain compounds provided herein, binding constants for 6 non-mutant and non-JAK family kinases are within 100-fold of the binding constant for JAK2 kinase. \n\n\n [00305] Since modifications will be apparent to those of skill in the art, it is intended that the claimed subject matter be limited only by the scope of the appended claims."
