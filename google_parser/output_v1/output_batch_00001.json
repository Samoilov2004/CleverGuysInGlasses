Description\n\n\n\n\n METHOD OF REDUCING INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE IN HUMANS\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/174,655, filed May 1, 2009. This application also claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/219,990, filed June 24, 2009. The contents of any patents, patent applications, and references cited throughout this specification are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nProvided herein are methods of reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) in humans. Also provided herein are uses of certain compounds in human subjects for reducing and/or controlling elevated or abnormally fluctuating IOPs in the treatment of glaucoma or ocular hypertension (OHT).\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nGlaucoma refers to a group of optic neuropathies that are characterized by loss of retinal ganglion cells and atrophy of the optic nerve with resultant visual field loss. The disease is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and the second leading cause of blindness, behind cataracts. Clinical trials have demonstrated that elevated IOP is a major risk factor for glaucoma and have validated the role of lowering IOP in the management of glaucoma.\n\n\nGlaucoma is classified according to three parameters: 1) the underlying cause, i.e., primary (idiopathic) or secondary (associated with some other ocular or systemic conditions); 2) the state of the anterior chamber angle, i.e., open angle (open access of the outflowing aqueous humor to trabecular meshwork) or closed angle (narrow angle; the trabecular meshwork is blocked by apposition of the peripheral iris and the cornea); and 3) chronicity, i.e., acute or chronic. Although secondary forms of glaucoma with clear etiologies do exist (e.g., pseudoexfoliation and pigmentary dispersion), the most common form of glaucoma is primary open angle glaucoma (POAG).\n\n\nOHT is a condition in which IOP is elevated but no glaucomatous findings have been observed (Bell, 2005). The Ocular Hypertension Study demonstrated that patients \n\n with OHT have an overall risk of 10% over 5 years of developing glaucoma and that this risk can be cut in half by the institution of medical treatment that reduces IOP.\n\n\nDrug therapies that have proven to be effective for the reduction of intraocular pressure include both agents that decrease aqueous humor production and agents that increase the outflow facility. Such therapies are in general administered by one of two possible routes: topically (direct application to the eye) or orally. However, pharmaceutical ocular anti-hypertension approaches have exhibited various undesirable side effects. For example, miotics such as pilocarpine can cause blurring of vision, headaches, and other negative visual side effects. Systemically administered carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can also cause nausea, dyspepsia, fatigue, and metabolic acidosis. Certain prostaglandins cause hyperemia, ocular itching, and darkening of eyelashes and periorbital tissues. Further, certain beta-blockers have increasingly become associated with serious pulmonary side-effects attributable to their effects on beta-2 receptors in pulmonary tissue. Sympathomimetics cause tachycardia, arrhythmia and hypertension. Such negative side-effects may lead to decreased patient compliance or to termination of therapy such that normal vision continues to deteriorate. Additionally, there are individuals who simply do not respond well when treated with certain existing glaucoma therapies.\n\n\nThere is, therefore, a need for other therapeutic agents that control IOP.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nProvided herein are compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of using such compounds to treat or prevent diseases or disorders associated with elevated intraocular pressure. In one embodiment the diseases and conditions caused by elevated IOP in a human are selected from the group consisting of normal-tension glaucoma, OHT, and POAG.\n\n\nThus, in a first aspect there is provided a method of reducing intraocular pressure comprising the step of: applying an effective amount of an ophthalmic pharmaceutical composition to an affected eye of a human, the composition comprising an effective amount of a compound according to Formula I, \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n(D or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein\n\n\nA is -CH\n2\nONO\n2\n-CH\n2\nOSO\n3\nH; B and C are -OH; and D is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one embodiment the method comprises applying from about 0.05 mg/ml to about 7.0 mg/ml of a compound according to Formula I from 1 to 4 times daily. In another embodiment the method comprises applying from about 20-700μg of a compound according to Formula I froml to 2 times daily. In another embodiment the method comprises applying about 350 μg of a compound according to Formula I from 1 to 2 times daily.\n\n\nWhen practicing the method, the compound can be administered in drops, e.g., 1 to 2 drops. In one embodiment the IOP of the affected eye is reduced by at least 10%, e.g., at least 10-20%, e.g., by 20% or more.

Cellular signaling by adenosine occurs through four adenosine receptor subtypes: A\n1\n, A\n2A\n, A\n2B\n, and A\n3\n as reported by Ralevic and Burnstock (Pharmacol Rev. 50:413-492, 1988) and Fredholm BB et al. (Pharmacol Rev. 53:527-552, 2001). In the eye, adenosine Ai receptor agonists lower IOP in mice, rabbits and monkeys (Tian B et al. Exp Eye Res. 64:979-989, 1997; Crosson CE. J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 273: 320-326, 1995; and Avila MY et al. Br J Pharmacol. 134:241-245, 2001). While other publications have noted that adenosine Al receptor agonists in the eye target the conventional outflow pathway via the trabecular meshwork (Husain S et al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 320: 258-265, 2007), reduction of IOP via other pathways has not been excluded. \n\n It should be noted that the highly robust, adenosine Ai receptor-mediated drop in IOP reported in preclinical studies is often preceded by an immediate, yet transient elevation in IOP following instillation of the Al receptor ligand (Crosson CE and Grey T. Inv Ophthal Visual Sci. 37, [9] 1833-1839, 1996). Transient elevations in IOP of ~ 3- 9 mmHg have been observed in a -30 min \"window\" after dosing. This phenomenon may arise from cross -reactivity between adenosine receptor sub-types within the eye. Pharmacological studies indicate that this transient elevation in IOP might be due, at least in part, to the activation of adenosine A\n2B\n receptors (Crosson, 1996). Therefore, development of a highly- selective Al agonist that only reduce IOP would appear to be more tenable than the development of adenosine A2-receptor-based drugs for treating IOP, as A2A agonists may increase, decrease or exert mixed effects on IOP (Konno, 2004; Konno, J Pharmacol Sci., 2005; Konno, Eur J Pharmacol. 2005).\n\n\nCompounds that act as selective adenosine Al agonists are known and have shown a variety of utilities. U.S. Patent No. 7,423,144 to Jagtap et al. describes such selective adenosine Al agonists compounds for the prevention or treatment of tachyarrhythmias (elevated heart rate), pain disorders, and ischemia-reperfusion injury.\n\n\nSelective adenosine Al agonists have been discovered to reduce IOP in humans in clinical studies.

The \"study eye\" was defined as the eye with the higher mean IOP, recorded between 7:00 and 8:00 AM on the day prior to dosing (Day 0). Subject enrollment criteria included males and females with no childbearing potential, aged 18 to 75 years (inclusive), who signed informed consent, have been diagnosed with OHT or POAG, and had a low risk for acute exacerbation of their eye disease while enrolled. The adult subjects were sequentially assigned to 1 of 7 treatment groups. Each treatment group included twelve subjects: 8 subjects randomized to receive 2.5, 7.5, 20, 60, 180, 350 or 700 micrograms of Compound A in the study eye and 4 randomized to receive matched placebo (see Table 1) on Day 1. \n\n Table 1. Randomization Scheme in the Clinical Trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasked-intraocular pressures were determined in duplicate with a Goldmann tonometer following traditional corneal anesthesia. Following determination of the bilateral baseline (predose) IOP measurements on the morning of Day 1, the assigned study drug (Compound A or matched placebo) was instilled as a single 50 μL drop to the one study eye only. Subsequent bilateral external eye examinations and masked-IOP determinations were performed at 9:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 12:00 noon, and 2:00 PM (each ±5 minutes), corresponding to 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post study drug application. In addition in the 700 meg cohort an IOP determination was performed at 6:00 PM (18:00), corresponding to 10 hours post study drug application.\n\n\nDOSAGE / DOSAGE FORM, ROUTE, & DOSE REGIMEN\n\n\nSubjects had the study drug applied via eyedropper to the inferior conjunctival sac of the study eye. The study drug was only administered to one eye per subject (the study eye). Dosages ranged from 2.5 micrograms to 350 micrograms per 50 microliter drop, per respective treatment group. A board-certified ophthalmologist (or comparably trained designee) administered the study drug. Randomized enrollment of subjects into each successive treatment groups was predicated upon the review and approval of the safety data from the completed treatment groups by the Safety Research Committee, consisting of three qualified physicians (i.e., an internist, cardiologist, and ophthalmologist) .\n\n\nFORMULATION EXAMPLE Formulation is 1 mg of Compound A for every 20 mg of Hydroxypropyl β-\n\n\nCyclodextrin (HPβCD) (i.e., 1:20 wt/wt) reconstituted with 0.9% Saline for Injection, USP, at concentrations indicated below. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRESULTS OF THE CLINICAL TRIAL\n\n\nThe results of the clinical trial are presented in the figures and further as described below. The dose escalation scheme over the 7 treatment groups of the multi-center, randomized, double-blinded clinical study is shown in Figure 1. Twelve subjects were randomly assigned to each treatment group: 8 subjects received Compound A and 4 subjects received placebo. Escalation to each successive treatment group was predicated upon the approval of the Safety Review Committee of the safety data from the most recently completed cohort.\n\n\nThe mean and median IOP (mmHg) in the study eye at each time point across all treatment groups is shown in Figures 2a and 2b, respectively. The mean absolute and median absolute IOP change from predose IOP (mmHg) in the study eye across all treatment groups at each time point is shown in Figures 3a and 3b. Figure 4a presents a summary chart of the responder analysis in the 7 treatment groups at 10:00 AM. In human subjects treated with topical ocular doses of Compound A, at approximately 2 hours post-dose (approximately 10:00 AM), the largest portion of the difference in IOP between drug-treated and placebo-treated eyes is apparent. The 2 hours post-dose clinical IOP assessment is especially relevant for detecting the presence of an effect in human glaucoma/OHT patients with statistical significance.\n\n\nFigure 4b presents a summary chart of the responder analysis in the 7 treatment groups using the mean responder rate over a 6hr postdose observation period. To obtain the response rate, the percent decrease in IOP for each subject at each of the 3 postdose \n\n time points were averaged. The mean of this percentage was used to determine the responder rate.\n\n\nFigure 5 presents the mean and median % decrease from baseline (BL; predose) and the categorical responder analysis of the 350 meg cohort over the entire postdose observation period.\n\n\nThe figures presented in Figures 6 and 8 demonstrate the statistically significant decrease in the mean and median IOPs (from the predose baseline IOP determinations) observed in the 350 and 700 meg cohorts relative to the placebo response.\n\n\nFigure 7 presents the mean and median % decrease from baseline (BL; predose) and the categorical responder analysis of the 700 meg cohort over the postdose observation period.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF COMPOUND A EFFICACY\n\n\nCompound A was found to induce a decrement in IOP from the Day 1 pre-dose baseline that was:\n\n\n1. Dose-related decrement in IOP a. A trend in the mean and median decrease in IOP and percent change from baseline was observed, especially at the 2 hours postdose time point. The largest mean and median decreases in IOP were found at the 350 meg dose. b. The responder analysis showed a dose-response to Compound A in the numbers of subjects that achieved categorical mean decreases from baseline in IOP of >10%, >15% or >20%, throughout the observation period (~6hrs). The % of subjects achieving greatest IOP decrement (responder analysis) was in the 350 meg treatment group.\n\n\n2. Statistically significant from placebo a. Statistically significant differences from the placebo response were observed in the 350 meg and 700 meg treatment groups at the 2 hours postdose time point. 3. In the 350 meg treatment group, the decrease in IOP was found to last for the entire observation period (~6 hrs). \n\n SYNTHESIS EXAMPLES\n\n\n2', S'-Isopropylidene-N^cyclohexyladenosine: A solution of 6- chloroadenosine (2.58 g) and cyclohexylamine (5 g) in ethanol (20 ml) was heated at reflux for 6 hours then cooled to room temperature.
