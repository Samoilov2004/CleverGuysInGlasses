Description\n\n\n\n\n HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS AND USES THEREOF\n\n\n[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/176,449, filed on May 7, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0002] The activity of cells can be regulated by external signals that stimulate or inhibit intracellular events. The process by which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response is referred to as signal transduction. Over the past decades, cascades of signal transduction events have been elucidated and found to play a central role in a variety of biological responses. Defects in various components of signal transduction pathways have been found to account for a vast number of diseases, including numerous forms of cancer, inflammatory disorders, metabolic disorders, vascular and neuronal diseases (Gaestel et al. Current Medicinal Chemistry (2007) 14:2214-2234).\n\n\n[0003] Kinases represent a class of important signaling molecules. Kinases can generally be classified into protein kinases and lipid kinases, and certain kinases exhibit dual specificities. Protein kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins and/or themselves (i.e., autophosphorylation). Protein kinases can be generally classified into three major groups based upon their substrate utilization: tyrosine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine residues (e.g., erb2, PDGF receptor, EGF receptor, VEGF receptor, src, abl), serine/threonine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on serine and/or threonine residues (e.g., mTorCl, mTorC2, ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Akt), and dual-specificity kinases which phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine, serine and/or threonine residues.\n\n\n[0004] Lipid kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids within cells. These enzymes, and the resulting phosphorylated lipids and lipid-derived biologically active organic molecules, play a role in many different physiological processes, including cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and differentiation. A particular group of lipid kinases comprises membrane lipid kinases, i.e., kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids contained in or associated with cell membranes. Examples of such enzymes include phosphinositide(s) kinases (such as PI3-kinases, PI4-Kinases), diacylglycerol kinases, and sphingosine kinases\n\n\n[0005] The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PBKs) signaling pathway is one of the most highly mutated systems in human cancers. PI3K signaling is involved in many other disease states including allergic contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, disorders related to diabetic complications, and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome.\n\n\n[0006] PDKs are members of a unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3'- OH group on phosphatidylinositols or phosphoinositides. The PI3K family comprises 15 kinases with distinct substrate specificities, expression patterns, and modes of regulation (Katso et al., 2001). The class I PI3Ks (pi 10a, pi lOβ, pi lOδ, and pi lOγ) are typically activated by tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors to generate PIP3, which engages downstream effectors such as those in the pathways of Akt/PDKl, mTOR, the Tec family kinases, and the Rho family GTPases. The class II and III PB-Ks play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P\n2\n. \n\n [0007] The delta (δ) isoform of class I PI3K has been implicated, in particular, in a number of diseases and biological processes. PDK δ is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells including leukocytes such as T-cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, mast cells, B-cells, and macrophages. PI3K δ is integrally involved in mammalian immune system functions such as T-cell function, B-cell activation, mast cell activation, dendritic cell function, and neutrophil activity. Due to its integral role in immune system function, PB K δ is also involved in a number of diseases related to undesirable immune response such as allergic reactions, inflammatory diseases, inflammation mediated angiogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis, auto-immune diseases such as lupus, asthma, emphysema and other respiratory diseases. Other class I PB K involved in immune system function includes PBK γ, which plays a role in leukocyte signaling and has been implicated in inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune diseases such as lupus. [0008] Downstream mediators of the PBK signal transduction pathway include Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Akt possesses a plckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds PIP3, leading to Akt kinase activation. Akt phosphorylates many substrates and is a central downstream effector of PBK for diverse cellular responses. One important function of Akt is to augment the activity of mTOR, through phosphorylation of TSC2 and other mechanisms. mTOR is a serine-threonine kinase related to the lipid kinases of the PBK family. mTOR has been implicated in a wide range of biological processes including cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility and survival. Disregulation of the mTOR pathway has been reported in various types of cancer. mTOR is a multifunctional kinase that integrates growth factor and nutrient signals to regulate protein translation, nutrient uptake, autophagy, and mitochondrial function.\n\n\n[0009] Dysregulation of signaling pathways mediated by many other kinases is a key factor in the development of human diseases. Aberrant or excessive protein kinase activity or expression has been observed in many disease states including benign and malignant proliferative diseases, disorders such as allergic contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, disorders related to diabetic complications, and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome.\n\n\n[0010] As such, kinases particularly lipid kinases such as PBKs and protein kinases such as mTor are prime targets for drug development. The present invention addresses a need in the art by providing a new class of kinase inhibitors.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0011] The present invention provides a compound of Formula I:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula I or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein:\n\n\nW\n1\n is N or CR\n5\n, W\n2\n is N or CR\n6\n, W\n3\n is N or CR\n7\n, W\n4\n is N or CR\n8\n, wherein no more than two N are adjacent; W\n5\n is N or CR\n4\n; R\n1\n Is -(L)\nn\n-R\n1'\n; L is -S-, -N(R\n2\n)-, -C(R\n3\n)\n2\n-, or -O-;\n\n\n-?- \n\n n is 0 or 1 ;\n\n\nR\n1\n is hydrogen, alkyl, heteroalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, alkoxy, heterocycloalkyloxy, amido, amino, acyl, acyloxy, alkoxycarbonyl, sulfonamido, halo, cyano, hydroxy, nitro, phosphate, urea, carbonate, or NR'R\" wherein R' and R\" are taken together with nitrogen to form a cyclic moiety;\n\n\nR\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n and R\n8\n are independently hydrogen, alkyl, heteroalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, alkoxy, heterocycloalkyloxy, amido, amino, acyl, acyloxy, alkoxycarbonyl, sulfonamido, halo, cyano, hydroxy, nitro, phosphate, urea, carbonate, or NR'R\" wherein R' and R\" are taken together with nitrogen to form a cyclic moiety;\n\n\nX is absent or is -(CH(R\n1O\n))\nZ\n and z is an integer of 1, 2, 3, or 4;\n\n\nY is absent, -O-, -S-, -S(=O)-, -S(O)\n2\n-, -N(R\n9\n)-, -C(=O)-(CHR\n10\n)\nz\n-, -C(=O)-, -N(R\n9\n)-C(=O)-, or -N(R\n9\n)-C(O)NH-,-\n\n\nN(R\n9\n)C(R\n10\n)\n2\n-, or -C(O)-(CHR\n1\nV; each instance of R\n2\n and R\n9\n is independently hydrogen, Ci-Cioalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n7\ncycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, C\n2\n-\n\n\nC\n10\nheteroalkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl; each instance of R\n3\n and R\n10\n is independently hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl or halo; and\n\n\nW\nd\n is heterocycloalkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, or heteroaryl.\n\n\n[0012] In a first aspect, the invention provides a compound of Formula I-A:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula I-A or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein W\n1\n is N or CR\n5\n, W\n2\n is N or CR\n6\n, W\n3\n is N or CR\n7\n, W\n4\n is N or CR\n8\n, wherein no more than two N atoms are adjacentjR\n1\n is -(L)\nn\n-R\n1'\n; L is -S-, -N(R\n2\n)-, -C(R\n3\n)\n2\n-, or -O-; n is O or 1; R\n1 '\n is hydrogen, alkyl, heteroalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, alkoxy, heterocycloalkyloxy, amido, amino, acyl, acyloxy, alkoxycarbonyl, sulfonamido, halo, cyano, hydroxy, nitro, phosphate, urea, carbonate, or NR'R\" wherein R' and R\" are taken together with nitrogen to form a cyclic moiety; R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n and R\n8\n are independently hydrogen, alkyl, heteroalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, alkoxy, heterocycloalkyloxy, amido, amino, acyl, acyloxy, alkoxycarbonyl, sulfonamido, halo, cyano, hydroxy, nitro, phosphate, urea, carbonate, or NR'R\" wherein R' and R\" are taken together with nitrogen to form a cyclic moiety; X is absent or is -(CH(R\n1O\n))\nZ\n and z is an integer of 1, 2, 3, or 4; Y is absent, -O-, -S-, -S(O)-, -S(O)\n2\n-, -N(R\n9\n)-, -C(O)-(CHR\n10\n)\nz\n-, -C(O)-, -N(R\n9\n)-C(O)-, or -N(R\n9\n)-C(O)NH-,- N(R\n9\n)C(R\n10\n)\n2\n-, or -C(O)-(CHR\n10\n),-; each instance of R\n2\n and R\n9\n is independently hydrogen, C\nr\nC\n10\nalkyl, C\n3\n- Cvcycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, C\n2\n-Cioheteroalkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl; each instance of R\n3\n and R\n10\n is independently hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl or halo; and W\nd\n is heterocycloalkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, or heteroaryl.

In addition, various natural sources can provide compounds for screening, such as plant or animal extracts, and the like. A skilled artisan can readily recognize that there is no limit as to the structural nature of the agents of the present invention.\n\n\n[0032] The term \"agonist\" as used herein refers to a compound having the ability to initiate or enhance a biological function of a target protein, whether by inhibiting the activity or expression of the target protein. Accordingly, the term \"agonist\" is defined in the context of the biological role of the target polypeptide. While preferred agonists herein specifically interact with (e.g. bind to) the target, compounds that initiate or enhance a biological activity of the target polypeptide by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target polypeptide is a member are also specifically included within this definition.\n\n\n[0033] The terms \"antagonist\" and \"inhibitor\" are used interchangeably, and they refer to a compound having the ability to inhibit a biological function of a target protein, whether by inhibiting the activity or expression of the target protein. Accordingly, the terms \"antagonist\" and \"inhibitors\" are defined in the context of the biological role of the target protein. While preferred antagonists herein specifically interact with (e.g. bind to) the target, compounds that inhibit a biological activity of the target protein by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target protein is a member are also specifically included within this definition. A preferred biological activity inhibited by an antagonist is associated with the development, growth, or spread of a tumor, or an undesired immune response as manifested in autoimmune disease.\n\n\n[0034] An \"anti-cancer agent\", \"anti-tumor agent\" or \"chemotherapeutic agent\" refers to any agent useful in the treatment of a neoplastic condition.

Co-administration includes simultaneous administration in separate compositions, administration at different times in separate compositions, or administration in a composition in which both agents are present.\n\n\n[0037] The term \"effective amount\" or \"therapeutically effective amount\" refers to that amount of a compound described herein that is sufficient to effect the intended application including but not limited to disease treatment, as defined below. The therapeutically effective amount may vary depending upon the intended application (in vitro or in vivo), or the subject and disease condition being treated, e.g., the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the disease condition, the manner of administration and the like, which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The term also applies to a dose that will induce a particular response in target cells, e.g. reduction of platelet adhesion and/or cell migration. The specific dose will vary depending on the particular compounds chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, whether it is administered in combination with other compounds, timing of administration, the tissue to which it is administered, and the physical delivery system in which it is carried.\n\n\n[0038] \"Treatment\", \"treating\", \"palliating\" and \"ameliorating\", as used herein, are used interchangeably. These terms refer to an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including but not limited to therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated. Also, a therapeutic benefit is achieved with the eradication or amelioration of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that an improvement is observed in the patient, notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For prophylactic benefit, the compositions may be administered to a patient at risk of developing a particular disease, or to a patient reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though a diagnosis of this disease may not have been made. [0039] A \"therapeutic effect,\" as used herein, encompasses a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit as described above. A prophylactic effect includes delaying or eliminating the appearance of a disease or condition, delaying or eliminating the onset of symptoms of a disease or condition, slowing, halting, or reversing the progression of a disease or condition, or any combination thereof.\n\n\n[0040] The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" refers to salts derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids and organic acids. Inorganic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Organic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like.

The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions of the invention is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. [0042] \"Signal transduction\" is a process during which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response. A modulator of a signal transduction pathway refers to a compound which modulates the activity of one or more cellular proteins mapped to the same specific signal transduction pathway. A modulator may augment (agonist) or suppress (antagonist) the activity of a signaling molecule. [0043] The term \"selective inhibition\" or \"selectively inhibit\" as applied to a biologically active agent refers to the agent's ability to selectively reduce the target signaling activity as compared to off-target signaling activity, via direct or interact interaction with the target.\n\n\n[0044] The term \"B-ALL\" as used herein refers to B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.\n\n\n[0045] \"Subject\" refers to an animal, such as a mammal, for example a human.

In some embodiments, the patient is a mammal, and in some embodiments, the patient is human.\n\n\n[0046] \"Radiation therapy\" means exposing a patient, using routine methods and compositions known to the practitioner, to radiation emitters such as alpha-particle emitting radionucleotides (e.g., actinium and thorium radionuclides), low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation emitters (i.e. beta emitters), conversion electron emitters (e.g. strontium-89 and samarium- 153-EDTMP, or high-energy radiation, including without limitation x-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons.\n\n\n[0047] \"Prodrug\" is meant to indicate a compound that may be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to a biologically active compound described herein. Thus, the term \"prodrug\" refers to a precursor of a biologically active compound that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, e.g., Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs (1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam). A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al., \"Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\" A.C.S. Symposium Series, Vol. 14, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated in full by reference herein. The term \"prodrug\" is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of an active compound, as described herein, may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent active compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, \n\n formate and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol or acetamide, formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like.\n\n\n[0048] The term \"in vivo\" refers to an event that takes place in a subject's body.\n\n\n[0049] The term \"in vitro\" refers to an event that takes places outside of a subject's body. For example, an in vitro assay encompasses any assay run outside of a subject assay. In vitro assays encompass cell-based assays in which cells alive or dead are employed. In vitro assays also encompass a cell-free assay in which no intact cells are employed. [0050] Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures wherein hydrogen is replaced by deuterium or tritium, or wherein carbon atom is replaced by \n13\nC- or \n14\nC-enriched carbon, are within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n[0051] The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (\n3\nH), iodine-125 (\n125\nI) or carbon-14 (\n14\nC). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n[0052] When ranges are used herein for physical properties, such as molecular weight, or chemical properties, such as chemical formulae, all combinations and subcombinations of ranges and specific embodiments therein are intended to be included. The term \"about\" when referring to a number or a numerical range means that the number or numerical range referred to is an approximation within experimental variability (or within statistical experimental error), and thus the number or numerical range may vary from, for example, between 1% and 15% of the stated number or numerical range. The term \"comprising\" (and related terms such as \"comprise\" or \"comprises\" or \"having\" or \"including\") includes those embodiments, for example, an embodiment of any composition of matter, composition, method, or process, or the like, that \"consist of or \"consist essentially of the described features. [0053] The following abbreviations and terms have the indicated meanings throughout\n\n\nPI3-K = Phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PI = phosphatidylinositol; PDK = Phosphoinositide Dependent Kinase; DNA-PK = Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid Dependent Protein Kinase; PIKK = Phosphoinositide Kinase Like Kinase; AIDS = Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome; TLC = Thin Layer Chromatography; MeOH = Methanol; and CHCI\n3\n = Chloroform. [0054] Abbreviations used herein have their conventional meaning within the chemical and biological arts.

The heterocycloalkyl is as described herein and is optionally substituted by one or more substituents described herein as suitable for heterocycloalkyl.\n\n\n[0085] \"Isomers\" are different compounds that have the same molecular formula. \"Stereoisomers\" are isomers that differ only in the way the atoms are arranged in space. \"Enantiomers\" are a pair of stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. A 1 : 1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers is a \"racemic\" mixture. The term \"(.±.)\" is used to designate a racemic mixture where appropriate. \"Diastereoisomers\" are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms, but which are not mirror-images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog R-S system. When a compound is a pure enantiomer the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon can be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated (+) or (-) depending on the direction (dextro- or levorotatory) which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that can be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-. The present chemical entities, pharmaceutical compositions and methods are meant to include all such possible isomers, including racemic mixtures, optically pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active (R)- and (S)- isomers can be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. The optical activity of a compound can be analyzed via any suitable method, including but not limited to chiral chromatography and polarimetry, and the degree of predominance of one stereoisomer over the other isomer can be determined. [0086] When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. \n\n [0087] \"Moiety\" refers to a specific segment or functional group of a molecule. Chemical moieties are often recognized chemical entities embedded in or appended to a molecule.\n\n\n[0088] \"Nitro\" refers to the -NO\n2\n radical.\n\n\n[0089] \"Oxa\" refers to the -O- radical.\n\n\n[0090] \"Oxo\" refers to the =O radical.\n\n\n[0091] \"Tautomers\" are structurally distinct isomers that interconvert by tautomerization. \"Tautomerization\" is a form of isomerization and includes prototropic or proton-shift tautomerization, which is considered a subset of acid-base chemistry. \"Prototropic tautomerization\" or \"proton-shift tautomerization\" involves the migration of a proton accompanied by changes in bond order, often the interchange of a single bond with an adjacent double bond. Where tautomerization is possible (e.g. in solution), a chemical equilibrium of tautomers can be reached. An example of tautomerization is keto-enol tautomerization. A specific example of keto-enol tautomerization is the interconversion of pentane-2,4-dione and 4-hydroxypent-3-en-2-one tautomers. Another example of tautomerization is phenol-keto tautomerization. A specific example of phenol-keto tautomerization is the interconversion of pyridin-4-ol and pyridin-4(lH)-one tautomers.\n\n\n[0092] The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (\n3\nH), iodine-125 (\n125\nI) or carbon-14 (\n14\nC). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n[0093] A \"leaving group or atom\" is any group or atom that will, under the reaction conditions, cleave from the starting material, thus promoting reaction at a specified site. Suitable examples of such groups unless otherwise specified are halogen atoms, mesyloxy, p-nitrobenzensulphonyloxy and tosyloxy groups.\n\n\n[0094] \"Protecting group\" has the meaning conventionally associated with it in organic synthesis, i.e. a group that selectively blocks one or more reactive sites in a multifunctional compound such that a chemical reaction can be carried out selectively on another unprotected reactive site and such that the group can readily be removed after the selective reaction is complete. A variety of protecting groups are disclosed, for example, in T.H. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts,\n\n\nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1999). For example, a hydroxy protected form is where at least one of the hydroxy groups present in a compound is protected with a hydroxy protecting group. Likewise, amines and other reactive groups may similarly be protected.\n\n\n[0095] \"Solvate\" refers to a compound (e.g., a compound selected from Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) in physical association with one or more molecules of a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent.

Di-substituted amino groups encompass those which form a ring together with the nitrogen of the amino group, such as for instance, morpholino. The substituents themselves may be substituted, for example, a cycloakyl substituent may have a halide substituted at one or more ring carbons, and the like.The protecting \n\n groups that may form the protective derivatives of the above substituents are known to those of skill in the art and may be found in references such as Greene and Wuts, above.\n\n\n[0097] \"Sulfonyl\" refers to the groups: -S(O\n2\n)-H, -S(O\n2\n)-(optionally substituted alkyl), -S (O\n2\n) -(optionally substituted amino), -S(O\n2\n)-(optionally substituted aryl), -S(O\n2\n)-(optionally substituted heteroaryl), and -S(O\n2\n)-(optionally substituted heterocycloalkyl).\n\n\n[0098] \"Sulfonamidyl\" or \"sulfonamido\" refers to a -S(=O)\n2\n-NRR radical, where each R is selected independently from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl (bonded through a ring carbon) and heteroalicyclic (bonded through a ring carbon). The R groups in -NRR of the -S(=O)\n2\n-NRR radical may be taken together with the nitrogen to which it is attached to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. In some embodiments, it is a\n\n\nCi-Cio sulfonamido, wherein each R in sulfonamido contains 1 carbon, 2 carbons, 3 carbons, or 4 carbons total.

[00211] The compounds according to the invention are effective over a wide dosage range. For example, in the treatment of adult humans, dosages from 0.01 to 1000 mg, from 0.5 to 100 mg, from 1 to 50 mg per day, and from 5 to 40 mg per day are examples of dosages that may be used. An exemplary dosage is 10 to 30 mg per day. The exact dosage will depend upon the route of administration, the form in which the compound is administered, the subject to be treated, the body weight of the subject to be treated, and the preference and experience of the attending physician. [00212] A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention typically contains an active ingredient (e.g., a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or coordination complex thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers, including but not limited inert solid diluents and fillers, diluents, sterile aqueous solution and various organic solvents, permeation enhancers, solubilizers and adjuvants. [00213] Described below are non-limiting exemplary pharmaceutical compositions and methods for preparing the same. [00214] Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration In some embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration containing a compound of the present invention, and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration.\n\n\n[00215] In some embodiments, the invention provides a solid pharmaceutical composition for oral administration containing: (i) an effective amount of a compound of the present invention; optionally (ii) an effective amount of a second agent; and (iii) a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments, the composition further contains: (iv) an effective amount of a third agent.\n\n\n[00216] In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may be a liquid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral consumption. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined \n\n amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules, a solution, or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in- water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier, which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient such as, but not limited to, a binder, a lubricant, an inert diluent, and/or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.\n\n\n[00217] This invention further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, water may be added (e.g., 5%) in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and/or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition may be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions may be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs. [00218] An active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the compositions for an oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations (such as suspensions, solutions, and elixirs) or aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations, in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example, suitable carriers include powders, capsules, and tablets, with the solid oral preparations. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. [00219] Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre- gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof. [00220] Examples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof. [00221] Disintegrants may be used in the compositions of the invention to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant may produce tablets which may disintegrate in the \n\n bottle. Too little may be insufficient for disintegration to occur and may thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient(s) from the dosage form. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient(s) may be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used may vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration, and may be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant, may be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre- gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums or mixtures thereof.\n\n\n[00222] Lubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethylaureate, agar, or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel, a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica, or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added, in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition.\n\n\n[00223] When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the essential active ingredient therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various combinations thereof.\n\n\n[00224] The tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.\n\n\n[00225] Surfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, hydrophilic surfactants, lipophilic surfactants, and mixtures thereof. That is, a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants may be employed, a mixture of lipophilic surfactants may be employed, or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant may be employed.\n\n\n[00226] A suitable hydrophilic surfactant may generally have an HLB value of at least 10, while suitable lipophilic surfactants may generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non-ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic -lipophilic balance (\" HLB\" value). Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic, and have greater solubility in oils, while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic, and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10, as well as anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly, lipophilic (i.e., hydrophobic) surfactants are compounds having an HLB value equal to or less than about 10. However, HLB value of a surfactant is merely a rough guide generally used to enable formulation of industrial, pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions. \n\n [00227] Hydrophilic surfactants may be either ionic or non-ionic.

[00233] In one embodiment, the composition may include a solubilizer to ensure good solubilization and/or dissolution of the compound of the present invention and to minimize precipitation of the compound of the present invention. This can be especially important for compositions for non-oral use, e.g., compositions for injection. A solubilizer may also be added to increase the solubility of the hydrophilic drug and/or other components, such as surfactants, or to maintain the composition as a stable or homogeneous solution or dispersion.\n\n\n[00234] Examples of suitable solubilizers include, but are not limited to, the following: alcohols and polyols, such as ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, benzyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butanediols and isomers thereof, glycerol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, transcutol, dimethyl isosorbide, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyvinylalcohol, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and other cellulose derivatives, cyclodextrins and cyclodextrin derivatives; ethers of polyethylene glycols having an average molecular weight of about 200 to about 6000, such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol PEG ether (glycofurol) or methoxy PEG ; amides and other nitrogen- containing compounds such as 2-pyrrolidone, 2-piperidone, .epsilon.-caprolactam, N-alkylpyrrolidone, N-hydroxyalkylpyrrolidone, N- alkylpiperidone, N-alkylcaprolactam, dimethylacetamide and polyvinylpyrrolidone; esters such as ethyl propionate, tributylcitrate, acetyl triethylcitrate, acetyl tributyl citrate, triethylcitrate, ethyl oleate, ethyl caprylate, ethyl butyrate, triacetin, propylene glycol monoacetate, propylene glycol diacetate, ε-caprolactone and isomers thereof, δ-valerolactone and isomers thereof, β-butyrolactone and isomers thereof; and other solubilizers known in the art, such as dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl isosorbide, N-methyl pyrrolidones, monooctanoin, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and water.

The amount of a given solubilizer may be limited to a bioacceptable amount, which may be readily determined by one of skill in the art. In some circumstances, it may be advantageous to include amounts of solubilizers far in excess of bioacceptable amounts, for example to maximize the concentration of the drug, with excess solubilizer removed prior to providing the composition to a patient using conventional techniques, such as distillation or evaporation. Thus, if present, the solubilizer can be in a weight ratio of 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%, or up to about 200% by weight, based on the combined weight of the drug, and other excipients. If desired, very small amounts of solubilizer may also be used, such as 5%, 2%, 1% or even less. \n\n Typically, the solubilizer may be present in an amount of about 1% to about 100%, more typically about 5% to about 25% by weight.\n\n\n[00237] The composition can further include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable additives and excipients. Such additives and excipients include, without limitation, detackifiers, anti-foaming agents, buffering agents, polymers, antioxidants, preservatives, chelating agents, viscomodulators, tonicifiers, flavorants, colorants, odorants, opacifiers, suspending agents, binders, fillers, plasticizers, lubricants, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n[00238] In addition, an acid or a base may be incorporated into the composition to facilitate processing, to enhance stability, or for other reasons. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable bases include amino acids, amino acid esters, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium aluminum silicate, synthetic aluminum silicate, synthetic hydrocalcite, magnesium aluminum hydroxide, diisopropylethylamine, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, triethanolamine, triethylamine, triisopropanolamine, trimethylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) and the like.

Salts of polyprotic acids, such as sodium phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, and sodium dihydrogen phosphate can also be used. When the base is a salt, the cation can be any convenient and pharmaceutically acceptable cation, such as ammonium, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and the like. Example may include, but not limited to, sodium, potassium, lithium, magnesium, calcium and ammonium.\n\n\n[00239] Suitable acids are pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic acids. Examples of suitable inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.

[00240] Pharmaceutical compositions for injection. In some embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for injection containing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for injection. Components and amounts of agents in the compositions are as described herein.\n\n\n[00241] The forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration by injection include aqueous or oil suspensions, or emulsions, with sesame oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs, mannitol, dextrose, or a sterile aqueous solution, and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. [00242] Aqueous solutions in saline are also conventionally used for injection. Ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like (and suitable mixtures thereof), cyclodextrin derivatives, and vegetable oils may also be employed. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, for the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. \n\n [00243] Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the compound of the present invention in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients as enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, certain desirable methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.\n\n\n[00244] Pharmaceutical compositions for topical (e.g., transdermal) delivery. In some embodiments, the inventio provides a pharmaceutical composition for transdermal delivery containing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for transdermal delivery.\n\n\n[00245] Compositions of the present invention can be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, or liquid forms suitable for local or topical administration, such as gels, water soluble jellies, creams, lotions, suspensions, foams, powders, slurries, ointments, solutions, oils, pastes, suppositories, sprays, emulsions, saline solutions, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-based solutions. In general, carriers with higher densities are capable of providing an area with a prolonged exposure to the active ingredients. In contrast, a solution formulation may provide more immediate exposure of the active ingredient to the chosen area.\n\n\n[00246] The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients, which are compounds that allow increased penetration of, or assist in the delivery of, therapeutic molecules across the stratum corneum permeability barrier of the skin. There are many of these penetration-enhancing molecules known to those trained in the art of topical formulation. Examples of such carriers and excipients include, but are not limited to, humectants (e.g., urea), glycols (e.g., propylene glycol), alcohols (e.g., ethanol), fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid), surfactants (e.g., isopropyl myristate and sodium lauryl sulfate), pyrrolidones, glycerol monolaurate, sulfoxides, terpenes (e.g., menthol), amines, amides, alkanes, alkanols, water, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n[00247] Another exemplary formulation for use in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices (\"patches\"). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of a compound of the present invention in controlled amounts, either with or without another agent.\n\n\n[00248] The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,023,252, 4,992,445 and 5,001,139. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.\n\n\n[00249] Pharmaceutical compositions for inhalation. Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a face mask tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices that deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.\n\n\n[00250] Other pharmaceutical compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions may also be prepared from compositions described herein and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients suitable for sublingual, buccal, rectal, intraosseous, intraocular, intranasal, epidural, or intraspinal administration. Preparations for such pharmaceutical \n\n compositions are well-known in the art. See, e.g., See, e.g., Anderson, Philip O.; Knoben, James E.; Troutman, William G, eds., Handbook of Clinical Drug Data, Tenth Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2002; Pratt and Taylor, eds., Principles of Drug Action, Third Edition, Churchill Livingston, New York, 1990; Katzung, ed., Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, Ninth Edition, McGraw Hill, 20037ybg; Goodman and Gilman, eds., The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Tenth Edition, McGraw Hill, 2001; Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins., 2000; Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, Thirty-Second Edition (The Pharmaceutical Press, London, 1999); all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.\n\n\n[00251] Administration of the compounds or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular, intraperitoneal or infusion), topical (e.g. transdermal application), rectal administration, via local delivery by catheter or stent or through inhalation. Compounds can also abe administered intraadiposally or intrathecally. [00252] The amount of the compound administered will be dependent on the mammal being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to 7 g/day, preferably about 0.05 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, e.g. bydividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day. [00253] In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in a single dose. Typically, such administration will be by injection, e.g., intravenous injection, in order to introduce the agent quickly. However, other routes may be used as appropriate. A single dose of a compound of the invention may also be used for treatment of an acute condition.\n\n\n[00254] In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in multiple doses. Dosing may be about once, twice, three times, four times, five times, six times, or more than six times per day. Dosing may be about once a month, once every two weeks, once a week, or once every other day. In another embodiment a compound of the invention and another agent are administered together about once per day to about 6 times per day. In another embodiment the administration of a compound of the invention and an agent continues for less than about 7 days. In yet another embodiment the administration continues for more than about 6, 10, 14, 28 days, two months, six months, or one year. In some cases, continuous dosing is achieved and maintained as long as necessary.\n\n\n[00255] Administration of the agents of the invention may continue as long as necessary. In some embodiments, an agent of the invention is administered for more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, or 28 days. In some embodiments, an agent of the invention is administered for less than 28, 14, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 day. In some embodiments, an agent of the invention is administered chronically on an ongoing basis, e.g., for the treatment of chronic effects. [00256] An effective amount of a compound of the invention may be administered in either single or multiple doses by any of the accepted modes of administration of agents having similar utilities, including rectal, buccal, intranasal and transdermal routes, by intra-arterial injection, intravenously, intraperitoneally, parenterally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, orally, topically, or as an inhalant.\n\n\n[00257] The compositions of the invention may also be delivered via an impregnated or coated device such as a stent, for example, or an artery-inserted cylindrical polymer. Such a method of administration may, for example, aid in the prevention or amelioration of restenosis following procedures such as balloon angioplasty. Without being bound by \n\n theory, compounds of the invention may slow or inhibit the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall which contribute to restenosis. A compound of the invention may be administered, for example, by local delivery from the struts of a stent, from a stent graft, from grafts, or from the cover or sheath of a stent. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is admixed with a matrix. Such a matrix may be a polymeric matrix, and may serve to bond the compound to the stent. Polymeric matrices suitable for such use, include, for eample, lactone - based polyesters or copolyesters such as polylactide, polycaprolactonglycolide, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides, polyaminoacids, polysaccharides, polyphosphazenes, poly (ether-ester) copolymers (e.g. PEO-PLLA); polydimethylsiloxane, poly(ethylene-vinylacetate), acrylate-based polymers or copolymers (e.g. polyhydroxyethyl methylmethacrylate, polyvinyl pyrrolidinone), fluorinated polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene and cellulose esters. Suitable matrices may be nondegrading or may degrade with time, releasing the compound or compounds. Compounds of the invention may be applied to the surface of the stent by various methods such as dip/spin coating, spray coating, dip-coating, and/or brush-coating. The compounds may be applied in a solvent and the solvent may be allowed to evaporate, thus forming a layer of compound onto the stent. Alternatively, the compound may be located in the body of the stent or graft, for example in microchannels or micropores. When implanted, the compound diffuses out of the body of the stent to contact the arterial wall. Such stents may be prepared by dipping a stent manufactured to contain such micropores or microchannels into a solution of the compound of the invention in a suitable solvent, followed by evaporation of the solvent. Excess drug on the surface of the stent may be removed via an additional brief solvent wash. In yet other embodiments, compounds of the invention may be covalently linked to a stent or graft. A covalent linker may be used which degrades in vivo, leading to the release of the compound of the invention. Any bio- labile linkage may be used for such a purpose, such as ester, amide or anhydride linkages. Compounds of the invention may additionally be administered intravascularly from a balloon used during angioplasty. Extravascular administration of the compounds via the pericard or via advential application of formulations of the invention may also be performed to decrease restenosis.\n\n\n[00258] A variety of stent devices which may be used as described are disclosed, for example, in the following references, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference: U.S. Pat. No. 5451233; U.S. Pat. No. 5040548; U.S. Pat. No. 5061273; U.S. Pat. No. 5496346; U.S. Pat. No. 5292331; U.S. Pat. No. 5674278; U.S. Pat. No. 3657744; U.S. Pat. No. 4739762; U.S. Pat.

It is known in the art that due to intersubject variability in compound pharmacokinetics, individualization of dosing regimen is necessary for optimal therapy. Dosing for a compound of the invention may be found by routine experimentation in light of the instant disclosure. [00260] When a compound of the invention, is administered in a composition that comprises one or more agents, and the agent has a shorter half-life than the compound of the invention unit dose forms of the agent and the compound of the invention may be adjusted accordingly.\n\n\n[00261] The subject pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral administration as a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, sustained release formulations, solution, suspension, for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. The pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical composition will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound according to the invention as an active ingredient. In addition, it may include other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc. \n\n [00262] Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compound in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose solutions. Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered, if desired.\n\n\n[00263] The invention also provides kits.

Such information may be based on the results of various studies, for example, studies using experimental animals involving in vivo models and studies based on human clinical trials. The kit may further contain another agent. In some embodiments, the compound of the present invention and the agent are provided as separate compositions in separate containers within the kit. In some embodiments, the compound of the present invention and the agent are provided as a single composition within a container in the kit. Suitable packaging and additional articles for use (e.g., measuring cup for liquid preparations, foil wrapping to minimize exposure to air, and the like) are known in the art and may be included in the kit. Kits described herein can be provided, marketed and/or promoted to health providers, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, formulary officials, and the like. Kits may also, in some embodiments, be marketed directly to the consumer. [00264] The invention also provides methods of using the compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention to treat disease conditions, including but not limited to diseases associated with malfunctioning of one or more types of PB kinase and/or mTOR. A detailed description of conditions and disorders mediated by pi lOδ kinase activity is set forth in Sadu et al., WO 01/81346, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.\n\n\n[00265] The invention also relates to a method of treating a hyperproliferative disorder in a mammal that comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug, solvate, hydrate or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, said method relates to the treatment of cancer such as acute myeloid leukemia, thymus, brain, lung, squamous cell, skin, eye, retinoblastoma, intraocular melanoma, oral cavity and oropharyngeal, bladder, gastric, stomach, pancreatic, bladder, breast, cervical, head, neck, renal, kidney, liver, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, esophageal, testicular, gynecological, thyroid, CNS, PNS, AIDS-related (e.g. Lymphoma and Kaposi's Sarcoma) or viral-induced cancer. In some embodiments, said method relates to the treatment of a non-cancerous hyperproliferative disorder such as benign hyperplasia of the skin (e. g., psoriasis), restenosis, or prostate (e. g., benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH)). [00266] The treatment methods provided herein comprise administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating an inflammation disorder, including autoimmune diseases in a mammal. The method comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug, solvate, hydrate or derivative thereof. Examples of autoimmune diseases includes but is not limited to acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Addison's disease, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS), aplastic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, coeliac disease, Crohn's disease, Diabetes mellitus (type 1), Goodpasture's syndrome, Graves' disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), Hashimoto's disease, lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome (OMS), optic neuritis, Ord's thyroiditis, oemphigus, polyarthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, Takayasu's arteritis, temporal \n\n arteritis (also known as \"giant cell arteritis\"), warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Wegener's granulomatosis, alopecia universalis, Chagas' disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, dysautonomia, endometriosis, hidradenitis suppurativa, interstitial cystitis, neuromyotonia, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, ulcerative colitis, vitiligo, and vulvodynia. Other disorders include bone -re sorption disorders and thromobsis.\n\n\n[00267] In some embodiments, the method of treating inflammatory or autoimmune diseases comprises administering to a subject (e.g. a mammal) a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of the present invention that selectively inhibit PI3K-6 and/or PI3K-γ as compared to all other type I PB kinases. Such selective inhibition of PI3K- δ and/or PI3K-γ may be advantageous for treating any of the diseases or conditions described herein. For example, selective inhibition of PDK-δ may inhibit inflammatory responses associated with inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disease, or diseases related to an undesirable immune response including but not limited to asthma, emphysema, allergy, dermatitis, rhuematoid arthritis, psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, or graft versus host disease. Selective inhibition of PI3K-6 may further provide for a reduction in the inflammatory or undesirable immune response without a concomittant reduction in the ability to reduce a bacterial, viral, and/or fungal infection.

IC50 values are measured using either a standard TLC assay for lipid kinase activity (described below) or a high-throughput membrane capture assay. Kinase reactions are performed by preparing a reaction mixture containing kinase, inhibitor (2% DMSO final concentration), buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgC12), and freshly sonicated phosphatidylinositol (100 μg/ml). Reactions are initiated by the addition of ATP containing 10 μCi of γ-32P-ATP to a final concentration 10 or 100 μM and allowed to proceed for 5 minutes at room temperature. For TLC analysis, reactions are then terminated by the addition of 105 μl IN HCl \n\n followed by 160 μl CHCl\n3\n:MeOH (1: 1). The triphasic mixture is vortexed, briefly centrifuged, and the organic phase is transferred to a new tube using a gel loading pipette tip precoated with CHCl\n3\n. This extract is spotted on TLC plates and developed for 3 - 4 hours in a 65:35 solution of n-propanol: IM acetic acid. The TLC plates are then dried, exposed to a phosphorimager screen (Storm, Amersham), and quantitated. For each compound, kinase activity is measured at 10 - 12 inhibitor concentrations representing two-fold dilutions from the highest concentration tested (typically, 200 μM). For compounds showing significant activity, IC50 determinations are repeated two to four times, and the reported value is the average of these independent measurements.\n\n\n[00322] Other commercial kits or systems for assaying PI3-K activities are avaiable. The commercially available kits or systems can be used to screen for inhibitors and/or agonists of PB-Ks including but not limited to PI 3 -Kinase α, β, δ, and γ. Anr exemplary system is PI 3-Kinase (human) HTRF™ Assay from Upstate. The assay can be carried out according to the procedures suggested by the manufacturer. Briefly, the assay is a time resolved FRET assay that indirectly measures PIP3 product formed by the activity of a PI3-K. The kinase reaction is performed in a microtitre plate (e.g., a 384 well microtitre plate). The total reaction volume is approximately 20ul per well. In the first step, each well receives 2ul of test compound in 20% dimethylsulphoxide resulting in a 2% DMSO final concentration. Next, approximately 14.5ul of a kinase/PIP2 mixture (diluted in IX reaction buffer) is added per well for a final concentration of 0.25-0.3ug/ml kinase and lOuM PIP2. The plate is sealed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. To start the reaction, 3.5ul of ATP (diluted in IX reaction buffer) is added per well for a final concentration of lOuM ATP. The plate is sealed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction is stopped by adding 5ul of Stop Solution per well and then 5ul of Detection Mix is added per well. The plate is sealed, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, and then read on an appropriate plate reader.

Plates are incubated for 72 hours at 37\n0\nC and 5% CO\n2\n. A volume of 15uL of Alamar Blue reagent is added to each well and plates are incubated for 5 hours at\n\n\n37C and 5% CO\n2\n. Alamar Blue fluoresce is read at 560Ex/590Em, and IC50 or EC50 values are calculated using\n\n\nGraphPad Prism 5.\n\n\nExample 21: Tumor Cell Line Proliferation Assay\n\n\n[00339] The ability of one or more subject compounds to inhibit tumor cell line proliferation is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. For instance, an in vitro cellular proliferation assay can be performed to measure \n\n the metabolic activity of live cells. The assay is performed in a 96 well microtiter plate using Alamar Blue reduction.\n\n\nHuman tumor cell lines are obtained from ATCC (e.g., MCF7, U-87 MG, MDA-MB-468, PC-3), grown to confluency in T75 flasks, trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin, washed one time with Tumor Cell Media (DMEM + 10%FBS), and plated in 90ul at 5,000 cells/well in Tumor Cell Media. A compound disclosed herein is diluted in Tumor Cell Media and added in a lOul volume. Plates are incubated for 72 hours at 37C and 5% CO\n2\n. A volume of lOuL of Alamar Blue reagent is added to each well and plates are incubated for 3 hours at 37C and 5% CO\n2\n. Alamar Blue fluoresce is read at\n\n\n560Ex/590Em, and IC50 values are calculated using GraphPad Prism 5. The results are expected to show that some of the compounds of the present invention are potent inhibitors of tumor cell line proliferation under the conditions tested.\n\n\nExample 22: Antitumor Activity in Vivo\n\n\n[00340] The compounds described herein can be evaluated in a panel of human and murine tumor models.\n\n\n[00341] Paclitaxel-refractory Tumor Models\n\n\n[00342] 1. Clinically-derived Ovarian Carcinoma Model.\n\n\n[00343] This tumor model is established from a tumor biopsy of an ovarian cancer patient. Tumor biopsy is taken from the patient.\n\n\n[00344] The compounds described herein are administered to nude mice bearing staged tumors using an every 2 days x\n\n\n5 schedule.\n\n\n[00345] 2. A2780Tax Human Ovarian Carcinoma Xenograft (Mutated Tubulin).\n\n\n[00346] A2780Tax is a paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian carcinoma model. It is derived from the sensitive parent\n\n\nA2780 line by co-incubation of cells with paclitaxel and verapamil, an MDR-reversal agent. Its resistance mechanism has been shown to be non-MDR related and is attributed to a mutation in the gene encoding the beta-tubulin protein.\n\n\n[00347] The compounds described herein can be administered to mice bearing staged tumors on an every 2 days x 5 schedule.\n\n\n[00348] 3. HCTl 16/VM46 Human Colon Carcinoma Xenograft (Multi-Drug Resistant).\n\n\n[00349] HCTl 16/VM46 is an MDR-resistant colon carcinoma developed from the sensitive HCTl 16 parent line. In vivo, grown in nude mice, HCTl 16/VM46 has consistently demonstrated high resistance to paclitaxel.\n\n\n[00350] The compounds described herein can be administered to mice bearing staged tumors on an every 2 days x 5 schedule.\n\n\n[00351] 5. M5076 Murine Sarcoma Model\n\n\n[00352] M5076 is a mouse fibrosarcoma that is inherently refractory to paclitaxel in vivo.\n\n\n[00353] The compounds described herein can be administered to mice bearing staged tumors on an every 2 days x 5 schedule.\n\n\n[00354] One or more compounds of the invention can be used in combination other therapeutic agents in vivo in the multidrug resistant human colon carcinoma xenografts HCT/VM46 or any other model known in the art including those described herein.\n\n\n[00355] The results are expected to show that one or more compounds of the present invention are potent inhibitors of tumor growth in vivo under the conditions tested\n\n\nExample 23: Microsome stability assay\n\n\n[00356] The stability of one or more subject compounds is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. For example, stability of one or more subject compounds is established by an in vitro assay. In particular, an in vitro microsome stability assay is established that measures stability of one or more subject compounds when reacting with mouse, rat or human microsomes from liver. The microsome reaction with compounds is performed in 1.5 mL \n\n Eppendorf tube. Each tube contains 0.1 μL of 10.0 mg/ml NADPH; 75 μL of 20.0 mg/ml mouse, rat or human liver microsome; 0.4 μL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer, and 425 μL of ddH\n2\nO. Negative control (without NADPH) tube contains 75 μL of 20.0 mg/ml mouse, rat or human liver microsome; 0.4 μL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer, and 525 μL of ddH\n2\nO. The reaction is started by adding 1.0 μL of 10.0 mM tested compound. The reaction tubes are incubated at 37°C. 100 μL sample is collected into new Eppendorf tube containing 300 μL cold Methanol at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes of reaction. Samples are centrifuged at 15,000 rpm to remove protein. Supernatant of centrifuged sample is transferred to new tube. Concentration of stable compound after reaction with microsome in the supernatant is measured by Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Example 24: Plasma stability assay\n\n\n[00357] The stability of one or more subject compounds in plasma is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. See, e.g., Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom., 10: 1019-1026. The following procedure is an HPLC- MS/MS assay using human plasma; other species including monkey, dog, rat, and mouse are also available. Frozen, heparinized human plasma is thawed in a cold water bath and spun for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm at 4 \n0\nC prior to use. A subject compound is added from a 400 μM stock solution to an aliquot of pre -warmed plasma to give a final assay volume of 400 μL (or 800 μL for half- life determination), containing 5 μM test compound and 0.5 % DMSO. Reactions are incubated, with shaking, for 0 minutes and 60 minutes at 37 \n0\nC, or for 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes at 37 C for half life determination. Reactions are stopped by transferring 50 μL of the incubation mixture to 200 μL of ice-cold acetonitrile and mixed by shaking for 5 minutes. The samples are centrifuged at 6000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C and 120 μL of supernatant removed into clean tubes. The samples are then evaporated to dryness and submitted for analysis by HPLC-MS/MS.\n\n\n[00358] Where desired, one or more control or reference compounds (5 μM) are tested simultaneously with the test compounds: one compound, propoxycaine, with low plasma stability and another compound, propantheline, with intermediate plasma stability.\n\n\n[00359] Samples are reconstituted in acetonitrile/methanol/water (1/1/2, v/v/v) and analyzed via (RP)HPLC-MS/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The HPLC conditions consist of a binary LC pump with autosampler, a mixed-mode, C 12, 2 x 20 mm column, and a gradient program. Peak areas corresponding to the analytes are recorded by HPLC-MS/MS. The ratio of the parent compound remaining after 60 minutes relative to the amount remaining at time zero, expressed as percent, is reported as plasma stability. In case of half- life determination, the half-life is estimated from the slope of the initial linear range of the logarithmic curve of compound remaining (%) vs. time, assuming first order kinetics. Example 25: Chemical Stability\n\n\n[00360] The chemical stability of one or more subject compounds is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. The following details an exemplary procedure for ascertaining chemical stability of a subject compound. The default buffer used for the chemical stability assay is phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4; other suitable buffers can be used. A subject compound is added from a 100 μM stock solution to an aliquot of PBS (in duplicate) to give a final assay volume of 400 μL, containing 5 μM test compound and 1% DMSO (for half-life determination a total sample volume of 700 μL is prepared). Reactions are incubated, with shaking, for 0 minutes and 24 hours at 37°C; for half-life determination samples are incubated for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours. Reactions are stopped by adding immediately 100 μL of the incubation mixture to 100 μL of acetonitrile and vortexing for 5 minutes. The samples are then stored at -2O\n0\nC until analysis by HPLC-MS/MS. Where desired, a control compound or a reference compound such as chlorambucil (5 μM) is tested simultaneously with a subject compound of interest, as this compound \n\n is largely hydrolyzed over the course of 24 hours. Samples are analyzed via (RP)HPLC-MS/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The HPLC conditions consist of a binary LC pump with autosampler, a mixed-mode, C12, 2 x 20 mm column, and a gradient program. Peak areas corresponding to the analytes are recorded by HPLC -MS/MS. The ratio of the parent compound remaining after 24 hours relative to the amount remaining at time zero, expressed as percent, is reported as chemical stability. In case of half-life determination, the half- life is estimated from the slope of the initial linear range of the logarithmic curve of compound remaining (%) vs. time, assuming first order kinetics. Example 26: Akt Kinase Assay\n\n\n[00361] Cells comprising components of the Akt/mTOR pathway, including but not limited to L6 myoblasts, B-ALL cells, B-cells, T-cells, leukemia cells, bone marrow cells, pl90 transduced cells, philladelphia chromosome positive cells (Ph+), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, are typically grown in cell growth media such as DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum and/or antibiotics, and grown to confluency.\n\n\n[00362] In order to compare the effect of one or more compounds disclosed herein on Akt activation, said cells are serum starved overnight and incubated with one or more compounds disclosed herein or about 0.1% DMSO for approximately 1 minute to about 1 hour prior to stimulation with insulin (e.g. 100 nM) for about 1 minutes to about 1 hour. Cells are lysed by scraping into ice cold lysis buffer containing detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and protease inhibitors (e.g., PMSF). After contacting cells with lysis buffer, the solution is briefly sonicated, cleared by centrifugation, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF and immunoblotted using antibodies to phospho- Akt S473, phospho- Akt T308, Akt, and β-actin (Cell Signaling Technologies). Example 27: Kinase Signaling in Blood\n\n\n[00363] PDK/ Akt /mTor signaling is measured in blood cells using the phosflow method (Methods Enzymol. 2007;434: 131 -54). The advantage of this method is that it is by nature a single cell assay so that cellular heterogeneity can be detected rather than population averages. This allows concurrent dinstinction of signaling states in different populations defined by other markers. Phosflow is also highly quantitative. To test the effects of one or more compounds disclosed herein, unfractionated splenocytes, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated with anti-CD3 to initiate T-cell receptor signaling. The cells are then fixed and stained for surface markers and intracellular phosphoproteins. It is expected that inhibitors disclosed herein inhibit anti-CD3 mediated phosphorylation of Akt -S473 and S6, whereas rapamycin inhibits S6 phosphorylation and enhances Akt phosphorylation under the conditions tested. [00364] Similarly, aliquots of whole blood are incubated for 15 minutes with vehicle (e.g. 0.1%DMSO) or kinase inhibitors at various concentrations, before addition of stimuli to crosslink the T cell receptor (TCR) (anti-CD3 with secondary antibody) or the B cell receptor (BCR) using anti-kappa light chain antibody (Fab'2 fragments). After approximately 5 and 15 minutes, samples are fixed (e.g. with cold 4% paraformaldehyde) and used for phosflow. Surface staining is used to distinguish T and B cells using antibodies directed to cell surface markers that are known to the art. The level of phosphrylation of kinase substrates such as Akt and S6 are then measured by incubating the fixed cells with labeled antibodies specific to the phosphorylated isoforms of these proteins. The population of cells is then analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\n\n[00365] The results are expected to show that one or more of the compounds of the present invention are potent and selective inhibitors of one or more members of one or more of PI3K, mTOR, and Akt signaling in blood cells under the conditions tested.\n\n\nExample 28: Colony Formation Assay [00366] Murine bone marrow cells freshly transformed with a pi 90 BCR-AbI retrovirus (herein referred to as pi 90 transduced cells) are plated in the presence of various drug combinations in M3630 methylcellulose media for about 7 \n\n days with recombinant human IL-7 in about 30% serum, and the number of colonies formed is counted by visual examination under a microscope.\n\n\n[00367] Alternatively, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are obtained from Philadelphia chromosome positive\n\n\n(Ph+) and negative (Ph-) patients upon initial diagnosis or relapse. Live cells are isolated and enriched for CD 19+\n\n\nCD34+ B cell progenitors. After overnight liquid culture, cells are plated in methocult GF+ H4435, Stem Cell\n\n\nTehcnologies) suplemented with cytokines (IL-3, IL-6, IL-7, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CF, Flt3 ligand, and erythropoietin) and various concentrations of known chemotherapeutic agents in combination with either compounds of the present disclosure. Colonies are counted by microscopy 12-14 days later. This method can be used to test for evidence of additive or synergistic activity.\n\n\n[00368] The results are expected to show that one or more the compounds of the present invention are potent and selective inhibitors of pi 90 transduced cell colony formation under the conditions tested.\n\n\nExample 29: In Vivo Effect of Kinase Inhibitors on Leukemic Cells\n\n\n[00369] Female recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a γ source in two doses about 4 hr apart, with approximately\n\n\n5Gy each. About lhr after the second radiation dose, mice are injected i.v. with about IxIO\n6\n leukemic cells (e.g. Ph+ human or murine cells, or pi 90 transduced bone marrow cells). These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of about 5xlO\n6\n normal bone marrow cells from 3-5 week old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs are harvested for analysis. Kinase inhibitor treatment begins about ten days after leukemic cell injection and continues daily until the mice become sick or a maximum of approximately 35 days post- transplant. Inhibitors are given by oral lavage.\n\n\n[00370] Peripheral blood cells are collected approximately on day 10 (pre-treatment) and upon euthanization (post treatment), contacted with labled anti-hCD4 antibodies and counted by flow cytometry. This method can be used to demonstrate that the synergistic effect of one or more compounds disclosed herein in combination with known chemotherapeutic agents significantly reduce leukemic blood cell counts as compared to treatment with known chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. Gleevec) alone under the conditions tested.\n\n\nExample 30: Treatment of Lupus Disease Model Mice\n\n\n[00371] Mice lacking the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb that opposes PI3K signaling in B cells develop lupus with high penetrance. FcγRIIb knockout mice (R2KO, Jackson Labs) are considered a valid model of the human disease as some lupus patients show decreased expression or function of FcγRIIb (S. Bolland and J.V. Ravtech 2000. Immunity 12:277-\n\n\n285).\n\n\n[00372] The R2KO mice develop lupus-like disease with anti-nuclear antibodies, glomerulonephritis and proteinurea within about 4-6 months of age. For these experiments, the rapamycin analogue RADOOl (available from LC\n\n\nLaboratories) is used as a benchmark compound, and administered orally. This compound has been shown to ameliorate lupus symptoms in the B6.Slelz.Sle3z model (T. Wu et al. J. Clin Invest. 117:2186-2196).\n\n\n[00373] Lupus disease model mice such as R2KO, BXSB or MLR/lpr are treated at about 2 months old, approximately for about two months. Mice are given doses of: vehicle, RADOOl at about 10mg/kg, or compounds disclosed herein at approximately 1 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg. Blood and urine samples are obtained at approximately throughout the testing period, and tested for antinuclear antibodies (in dilutions of serum) or protein concentration (in urine). Serum is also tested for anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA antibodies by ELISA. Animals are euthanized at day 60 and tissues harvested for measuring spleen weight and kidney disease. Glomerulonephritis is assessed in kidney sections stained with H&E. Other animals are studied for about two months after cessation of treatment, using the same endpoints. \n\n [00374] This model established in the art can be employed to test that the kinase inhibitors disclosed herein can suppress or delay the onset of lupus symptoms in lupus disease model mice. Example 31: Murine Bone Marrow Transplant Assay\n\n\n[00375] Female recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a γ ray source. About lhr after the radiation dose, mice are injected with about 1x106 leukemic cells from early passage pl90 transduced cultures (e.g. as described in Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2005 Aug;161(l):51-6) . These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of approximately 5x106 normal bone marrow cells from 3-5wk old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs harvested for flow cytometry and/or magnetic enrichment. Treatment begins on approximately day 10 and continues daily until mice become sick, or after a maximum of about 35 days post-transplant. Drugs are given by oral gavage (p.o.). In a pilot experiment a dose of chemotherapeutic that is not curative but delays leukemia onset by about one week or less is identified; controls are vehicle-treated or treated with chemotherapeutic agent, previously shown to delay but not cure leukemogenesis in this model (e.g. imatinib at about 70mg/kg twice daily). For the first phase pl90 cells that express eGFP are used, and postmortem analysis is limited to enumeration of the percentage of leukemic cells in bone marrow, spleen and lymph node (LN) by flow cytometry. In the second phase, pl90 cells that express a tailless form of human CD4 are used and the postmortem analysis includes magnetic sorting of hCD4+ cells from spleen followed by immunoblot analysis of key signaling endpoints: p Akt -T308 and S473; pS6 and p4EBP-l. As controls for immunoblot detection, sorted cells are incubated in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitors of the present disclosure inhibitors before lysis. Optionally, \"phosflow\" is used to detect p Akt -S473 and pS6-S235/236 in hCD4-gated cells without prior sorting. These signaling studies are particularly useful if, for example, drug-treated mice have not developed clinical leukemia at the 35 day time point. Kaplan-Meier plots of survival are generated and statistical analysis done according to methods known in the art. Results from pi 90 cells are analyzed separated as well as cumulatively. [00376] Samples of peripheral blood (100-200μl) are obtained weekly from all mice, starting on day 10 immediately prior to commencing treatment. Plasma is used for measuring drug concentrations, and cells are analyzed for leukemia markers (eGFP or hCD4) and signaling biomarkers as described herein.\n\n\n[00377] This general assay known in the art may be used to test that effective therapeutic doses of the compounds disclosed herein can be used for inhibiting the proliferation of leukemic cells. Example 32: TNP-Ficoll T-cell Independent B-cell Activation Assay\n\n\n[00378] To test the effects of the compounds of the present invention in suppressing T cell independent antibody production, the TNP-Ficoll B-cell activation assay is used as described herein. Compounds of the present invention are dissolved in an appropriate vehicle (e.g. 5% l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, 85% polyethylene glycol 400, 10% Solutor). Compounds are administered orally approximately lhr before TNP-Ficoll treatment to 4-10 week old mice. To study the effects of the compounds on B-cell activation, one set of mice are grouped according to the following table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00379] Four animals in group 1, and eight animals in groups 2 to 7 are euthanized in CO\n2\n 2 hours after the last compound administration on day 7. Blood is immediately collected by cadio-puncture and kept at 37°C for lhr to clot followed by overnight incubation at 4°C to allow the clot to contract. The following day, serum is collected by decanting and centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The collected serum is then frozen at -8O\n0\nC for future analysis. [00380] Serum samples are analyzed for anti-TNP antibody titers by ELISA as described herein. TNP-BSA is coated onto a Nunc Maxisorb microtiter plate with lOOμl/well at a concentration of lOμg/ml in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The Maxisorb plate is incubated for 1.5 hours at room temperature and the solution is removed. 200 μl/well of blocking buffer (e.g. 1% BSA in PBS) is added to each well and incubated lhr at room temperature. The plate is washed once with 200 μl/well of PBS 0.05% Tween-20 (wash buffer). A 1 :2 dilution of serum from each mouse in blocking buffer is added to each well in the first column (1) of the microtiter plate. The serum in each well of column 1 is then diluted 3-fold in blocking buffer and added to column 2. The serum in each well of column 2 is diluted 3-fold in blocking buffer and added to column 3. The procedure is repeated across the twelve columns of the microtiter plate. The microtiter plate is incubated 1 hr at room temperature. Serum is removed from the plate and the plate is washed three times with wash buffer. 100 μl/well of goat anti-mouse IgG3-HRP diluted 1:250 in blocking buffer is added to each well and incubated lhr at room temperature. The anti-mouse IgG3-HRP is removed from the microtiter plate and the plate is washed six times with wash buffer. HRP substrate (200 μl ABTS solution + 30% H\n2\nO\n2\n + 10ml citrate buffer) is added to each well at 100 μl/well, incubated 2-20 minutes in the dark and the amount of anti-TNP IgG3 is determined spectrophotometrically at 405nm. Similarly, anti-TNP IgM and total anti-TNP Ab are determined using anti-mouse IgM-HRP and anti-mouse Ig-HRP respectively.\n\n\nExample 33: Rat Developing Type II Collagen Induced Arthritis Assay\n\n\n[00381] In order to study the effects of the compounds of the present invention on the autoimmune disease arthritis, a collagen induced developing arthritis model is used. Female Lewis rats are given collagen injections at day 0. Bovine type II collagen is prepared as a 4mg/ml solution in 0.01N acetic acid. Equal volumes of collagen and Freund's incomplete adjuvant are emulsified by hand mixing until a bead of the emulsified material holds its form in water. Each rodent receives a 300 μl injection of the mixture at each injection time spread over three subcutaneous sites on the back. [00382] Oral compound administration begins on day 0 and continues through day 16 with vehicle (5% NMP, 85% PEG 400, 10% Solutol) or compounds of the present invention in vehicle or control (e.g. methotrexate) at 12 hour intervals daily. Rats are weighed on days 0, 3, 6, 9-17 and caliper measurements of ankles are taken on days 9-17. Final body weights are taken, and then the animals are euthanized on day 17. After euthanization, blood is drawn and hind paws and knees are removed. Blood is further processed for pharmacokinetics experiments as well as an anti-type II collagen antibody ELISA assay. Hind paws are weighed and then, with the knees, preserved in 10% formalin. The paws and knees are subsequently processed for microscopy. Livers, spleen and thymus are weighed. Sciatic nerves are prepared for histopathology. \n\n [00383] Knee and ankle joints are fixed for 1 -2 days and decalcified for 4-5 days. Ankle joints are cut in half longitudinally, and knees are cut in half along the frontal plane. Joints are processed, embedded, sectioned and stained with toluidine blue. Scoring of the joints is done according to the following criteria:\n\n\nKnee and Ankle Inflammation\n\n\n0=Normal l=Minimal infiltration of inflammatory cells in synovium/periarticular

post-test) with significance set at the 5% significance level.\n\n\nPercent inhibition of paw weight and AUC was calculated using the following formula:\n\n\n% Inhibition=A - B/A X 100\n\n\nA=Mean Disease Control - Mean Normal\n\n\nB=Mean Treated - Mean Normal\n\n\n[00385] The results are expected to show, relative to vehicle only control or to methotrexate control, that the compounds of the present invention exhibit a siginificant reduction in arthritis induced ankle diameter increase over time, and reduction of ankle histopathology in at least one or more of the categories of inflammation, pannus, cartilage damage, and bone resporption as described above. The results are expected to demonstrate a dose dependent reduction in knee histopathology. The results are expected to show that one or more compounds of the present invention may be useful for the treatment and reduction of arthritis disease symptoms.\n\n\n[00386] The results further are expected to show a reduction at 10, 20, and 60mg/kg dosage levels of serum anti-type II collagen levels for selected test compounds, suggesting that one or more compounds of the present invention may not \n\n only be useful for the treatment and reduction of arthritis disease symptoms, but may also be useful for the inhibition of the autoimmune reaction itself.\n\n\nExample 34: Rat Established Type II Collagen Induced Arthritis Assay\n\n\n[00387] In order to examine the dose responsive efficacy of the compounds of the present invention in inhibiting the inflammation, cartilage destruction and bone resorption of 10 day established type II collagen induced arthritis in rats, compounds are administered orally daily or twice daily for 6 days.\n\n\n[00388] Female Lewis rats are anesthetized and given collagen injections prepared and administered as described previously on day 0. On day 6, animals are anesthetized and given a second collagen injection. Caliper measurements of normal (pre-disease) right and left ankle joints are performed on day 9. On days 10-11, arthritis typically occurs and rats arerandomized into treatment groups. Randomization is performed after ankle joint swelling is obviously established and there is evidence of bilateral disease.\n\n\n[00389] After an animal is selected for enrollment in the study, treatment is initiated by the oral route. Animals are given vehicle, control (Enbrel) or compound doses, twice daily or once daily (BID or QD respectively). Administration is performed on days 1-6 using a volume of 2.5ml/kg (BID) or 5ml/kg (QD) for oral solutions. Rats are weighed on days 1-7 following establishment of arthritis and caliper measurements of ankles taken every day. Final body weights are taken on day 7 and animals are euthanized.\n\n\n[00390] The results are expected to show reduction in mean ankle diamter increase over time for selected test compounds with a once daily administration or twice daily administration under the conditions tested. This suggests that the compounds of the present invention may be useful for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as arthritis.\n\n\nExample 35: Adjuvant Induced Arthritis Assay\n\n\nIntrathecal Catheterization of Rats\n\n\n[00391] Isoflurane-anesthetized Lewis rats (200-250 g) are implanted with an intrathecal (IT) catheter. After a 6 d recovery period, all animals except those that appeared to have sensory or motor abnormalities (generally fewer than\n\n\n5% of the total number) are used for experiments. For IT administration, 10 μl of drug or saline followed by 10 μl of isotonic saline is injected through the catheter.\n\n\nAdjuvant Arthritis and Drug Treatment\n\n\n[00392] Lewis rats are immunized at the base of the tail with 0.1 ml of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) on day 0 several days after catheter implantation (n=6/group). Drug (e.g. one or more compounds of the present invention or or vehicle) treatment is generally started on day 8 and is continued daily until day 20. Clinical signs of arthritis generally begin on day 10, and paw swelling is determined every second day by water displacement plethysmometry.\n\n\n[00393] The results are expected to show that one or more compounds of the present invention demonstrates a dose dependent reduction in the average paw volume increase as measured in this adjuvant induced arthritis model system.\n\n\nThese results suggest that one or more of the compounds of the present invention may be useful for the treatment of one or more of the diseases or conditions described herein.\n\n\nExample 36: Rodent Pharmacokinetic Assay\n\n\n[00394] In order to study the pharmacokinetics of the compounds of the present invention a set of 4-10 week old mice are grouped according to the following table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00395] Compounds of the present invention are dissolved in an appropriate vehicle (e.g. 5% l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, 85% polyethylene glycol 400, 10% Solutor) and administered orally at 12 hour intervals daily. All animals are euthanized in CO\n2\n 2 hours after the final compound is administered. Blood is collected immediately and kept on ice for plasma isolation. Plasma is isolated by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes. Harvested plasma is frozen for pharmacokinetic detection.\n\n\n[00396] The results are expected to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic parameters such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity for the compounds of the present invention. Example 37: Basotest assay\n\n\n[00397] The basotest assay is performed using Orpegen Pharma Basotest reagent kit. Heparinized whole blood is pre- incubated with test compound or solvent at 37C for 20min. Blood is then incubated with assay kit stimulation buffer (to prime cells for response) followed by allergen (dust mite extract or grass extract) for 20min. The degranulation process is stopped by incubating the blood samples on ice. The cells are then labeled with anti-IgE-PE to detect basophilic granulocytes, and anti-gp53-FITC to detect gp53 (a glycoprotein expressed on activated basophils). After staining red blood cells are lysed by addition of Lysing Solution. Cells are washed, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Test compounds, when evaluated in this assay inhibit allergen induced activation of basophilic granulocytes at sub micromolar range. The results are expected to demonstrate that under the conditions tested one or more compounds of the present invention are capable of inhbiting allergen induced activation of basophils. Example 38: Combination use of PI3K6 inhibitors and agents that inhibit IgE production or activity [00398] The compounds of the present invention may present synergistic or additive efficacy when administered in combination with agents that inhibit IgE production or activity. Agents that inhibit IgE production include, for example, one or more of TEI-9874, 2-(4-(6-cyclohexyloxy-2-naphtyloxy)phenylacetamide)benzoic acid, rapamycin, rapamycin analogs (i.e. rapalogs), TORCl inhibitors, TORC2 inhibitors, and any other compounds that inhibit mTORCl and mTORC2. Agents that inhibit IgE activity include, for example, anti-IgE antibodies such as Omalizumab and TNX-901.\n\n\n[00399] One or more of the subject compounds capable of inhibiting PI3Kδ are efficacious in treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders (AIID) for example rheumatoid arthritis. If any of the compounds causes an undesired level of IgE production, one may choose to administer it in combination with an agent that inhibits IgE production or IgE activity. Additionally, the administration of PI3Kδ or PI3Kδ/γ inhibitors of the present invention in combination with inhibitors of mTOR may also exhibit synergy through enhanced inhibition of the PI3K pathway. Various in vivo and in vitro models may be used to establish the effect of such combination treatment on AIID including but not limited to (a) in vitro B-cell antibody production assay, (b) in vivo TNP assay, and (c) rodent collagen induced arthritis model.\n\n\n(a) B-cell Assay\n\n\n[00400] Mice are euthanized, and the spleens are removed and dispersed through a nylon mesh to generate a single-cell suspension. The splenocytes are washed (following removal of erythrocytes by osmotic shock) and incubated with anti- \n\n CD43 and anti-Mac- 1 antibody-conjugated microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). The bead-bound cells are separated from unbound cells using a magnetic cell sorter. The magnetized column retains the unwanted cells and the resting B cells are collected in the flow-through. Purified B-cells are stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or an anti-CD40 antibody and interleukin 4. Stimulated B-cells are treated with vehicle alone or with PBKδ inhibitors of the present invention such as compound 53 with and without mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin, rapalogs, or mTORCl/C2 inhibitors. The results are expected to show that in the presence of mTOR inhibitors (e.g., rapamycin) alone, there is little to no substantial effect on IgG and IgE response. However, in the presence of PBKδ and mTOR inhibitors, the B-cells are expected to exhibit a decreased IgG response as compared to the B-cells treated with vehicle alone, and the B-cells are expected to exhibit a decreased IgE response as compared to the response from B-cells treated with PBKδ inhibitors alone.\n\n\n(b) TNP Assay\n\n\n[00401] Mice are immunized with TNP-Ficoll or TNP-KHL and treated with: vehicle, a PBKδ inhibitor, for example, compound 53 of the present invention, an mTOR inhibitor, for example rapamycin, or a PBKδ inhibitor in combination with an mTOR inhibitor such as rapamycin. Antigen-specific serum IgE is measured by ELISA using TNP-BSA coated plates and isotype specific labeled antibodies. This assay can be used to test that mice treated with an mTOR inhibitor alone exhibit little or no substantial effect on antigen specific IgG3 response and no statistically significant elevation in IgE response as compared to the vehicle control. This assay can also be used to test that mice treated with both PBKδ inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor exhibit a reduction in antigen specific IgG3 response as compared to the mice treated with vehicle alone. Additionally, this assay can be employed to test that the mice treated with both PBKδ inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor exhibit a decrease in IgE response as compared to the mice treated with PBKδ inhibitor alone.\n\n\n(c) Rat Collagen Induced Arthritis Model\n\n\n[00402] Female Lewis rats are anesthetized and given collagen injections prepared and administered as described previously on day 0. On day 6, animals are anesthetized and given a second collagen injection. Caliper measurements of normal (pre-disease) right and left ankle joints are performed on day 9. On days 10-11, arthritis typically occurs and rats are randomized into treatment groups. Randomization is performed after ankle joint swelling is obviously established and there is good evidence of bilateral disease.\n\n\n[00403] After an animal is selected for enrollment in the study, treatment is initiated. Animals are given vehicle, PBKδ inhibitor, or PBKδ inhibitor in combination with rapamycin. Dosing is administered on days 1-6. Rats are weighed on days 1-7 following establishment of arthritis and caliper measurements of ankles taken every day. Final body weights are taken on day 7 and animals are euthanized.\n\n\n[00404] This assay can be uesed to test that the combination treatment using PBKδ inhibitor and rapamycin provides greater efficacy than treatment with PBKδ inhibitor alone.\n\n\nExample 39: Use of the compounds of the present invention for inhibition of tumor growth\n\n\nCell Lines\n\n\n[00405] Cell lines of interest (A549, U87, ZR-75-1 and 786-O) are obtained from American Type Culture Collection\n\n\n(ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells are proliferated and preserved cryogenically at early passage (e.g. passage 3). One aliquot is used for further proliferation to get enough cells for one TGI study (at about passage 9).\n\n\nAnimals\n\n\n[00406] Female athymic nude mice are supplied by Harlan. Mice are received at 4 to 6 weeks of age. All mice are acclimated for about one day to two weeks prior to handling. The mice are housed in microisolator cages and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. The mice are fed with irradiated mouse chow and freely available autoclaved water is provided.\n\n\n-I l l- \n\n Tumor Xenograft Model\n\n\n[00407] Mice are inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with 0.01 to 0.5 ml of tumor cells (approximately 1.0 x 10\n5\n to 1.0 x 10\n8\n cells/mouse). Five to 10 days following inoculation, tumors are measured using calipers and tumor weight is calculated, for example using the animal study management software, such as Study Director V.1.6.70 (Study Log). Mice with tumor sizes of about 120 mg are pair-matched into desired groups using Study Director (Day 1). Body weights are recorded when the mice are pair-matched. Tumor volume and bodyweight measurements are taken one to four times weekly and gross observations are made at least once daily. On Day 1, compounds of the present invention and reference compounds as well as vehicle control are administered by oral gavage or iv as indicated. At the last day of the experiment, mice are sacrificed and their tumors are collected 1-4 hours after the final dose. The tumors are excised and cut into two sections. One third of the tumor is fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin blocks and the remaining two thirds of tumor is snap frozen and stored at -80\n0\nC. Data and Statistical Analysis [00408] Mean tumor growth inhibition (TGI) is calculated utilizing the following formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00409] Tumors that regress from the Day 1 starting size are removed from the calculations. Individual tumor shrinkage (TS) is calculated using the formula below for tumors that show regression relative to Day 1 tumor weight. The mean tumor shrinkage of each group is calculated and reported.\n\n\nTS = [1 _ (Tumor Wei»t ,\nM\n,)\n] χ m%\n (Tumor Weight (Day I))\n\n\n[00410] The model can be employed to show whether the compounds of the present invention can inhibit tumor cell growth such as renal carcinomoa cell growth, breast cancer cell growth, lung cancer cell growth, or glioblastoma cell growth under the conditions tested."

In this empiric test system, dopamine which was used as a control drug suppressed the quantity of cyclic AMP to about 10% as the maximum activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was confirmed that test compounds had partial agonistic activity for dopamine D\n2\n receptor in the above-described test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the test compounds has partial agonistic activity for dopamine D\n2\n receptor, they can stabilize dopamine neurotransmission to a normal condition in a schizophrenia patient and as a result, exhibit, for example, positive and negative condition improving effect, cognitive impairment improving effect and the other symptom improving effects without causing side effects.\n\n\n \nPharmacological Test 3\n\n\nInhibitory effect on apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior in rats\n\n\n \n \n \nWistar rats (male, six-seven weeks old, Japan SLC, Inc.) were used as test animals. A test compound was suspended in 5% gum arabic/(physiological saline or water) using an agate mortar and was diluted with the same solvent if necessary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest animals were fasted overnight from the day before. Apomorphine (0.7 mg/kg) was subcutaneously administered (1 ml/kg) 1 hour after each test compound was orally administered (5 ml/kg). Stereotyped behavior was observed for 1 minute respectively 20, 30 and 40 minutes after apomorphine injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stereotyped behavior of each animal was quantified according to the following condition and score made at three points were summed up and the anti-apomorphine effect was evaluated. Six test animals were used for each group.\n\n \n \n \n0: The appearance of the animals is the same as saline treated rats;\n \n1: Discontinuous sniffing, constant exploratory activity;\n \n2: Continuous sniffing, periodic exploratory activity;\n \n3: Continuous sniffing, discontinuous biting, gnawing or licking. Very brief periods of locomotor activity;\n \n4: Continuous biting, gnawing or licking; no exploratory activity.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nNon-clinical statistical analysis system was used for all statistical processing. When the significance probability value was lower than 0.05, it was judged that a significant difference existed. The difference of the score between the solvent administration group and each test compound administration group was analyzed using Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Steel test. In addition, linear regression analysis was used for calculating 50% effective dose (95 % confidence interval).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the test compounds showed inhibitory effect for apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior, it was confirmed that the test compounds have D\n2\n receptor antagonistic effect.\n\n\n \nPharmacological Test 4\n\n\nInhibitory effect on (±)D-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) induced head twitch in rats\n\n\n \n \n \nWistar rats (male, six-seven weeks old, Japan SLC, Inc.) were used as test animals. A test compound was suspended in 5% gum arabic/(physiological saline or water) using an agate mortar and was diluted with the same solvent if necessary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest animals were fasted overnight from the day before. DOI (5.0 mg/kg) was subcutaneously administered (1 ml/kg) 1 hour after each test compound was orally administered (5 ml/kg). The number of head twitches was counted for 10 minutes immediately after DOI injection. Six test animals were used for each group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-clinical statistical analysis was used for all statistical processing. When the significance probability value was lower than 0.05, it was judged that a significant difference existed. The difference of the number of head twitches between the solvent administration group and each test compound administration group was analyzed using t-test or Dunnett's test. In addition, linear regression analysis was used for calculating 50% effective dose (95 % confidence interval).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the test compounds showed inhibitory effect for DOI-induced head twitch, it was confirmed that the test compounds have serotonin 5HT\n2A\n receptor antagonistic effect.\n\n\n \nPharmacological Test 5\n\n\nCatalepsy inducing effect in rats\n\n\n \n \n \nWistar rats (male, six-seven weeks old, Japan SLC, Inc.) were used as test animals. A test compound was suspended in 5% gum arabic/(physiological saline or water) using an agate mortar and was diluted with the same solvent if necessary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest animals were fasted overnight from the day before observation on catalepsy and ptosis was performed 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after each test compound was orally administered (5 ml/kg). Six test animals were used for each group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne forepaw of a rat was placed on an edge of a steel small box (width: 6.5 cm, depth: 4.0 cm, height: 7.2 cm) (an unnatural pose) and when the rat maintained the pose for more than 30 seconds, it was judged that the case was catalepsy positive. This observation was performed three times at each point, and if there was at least one positive case, it was judged that catalepsy occurred in the individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result, catalepsy induction effect of a test compound was dissociated from inhibitory effect on apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior, therefore it was suggested that apprehension for extrapyramidal side effect in clinic would be low.\n\n\n \nPharmacological Test 6\n\n\nMeasurement of serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibitory activity of a test compound by rat brain synaptosome\n\n\n \n \n \nWistar male rats were decapitated, the brain was retrieved and frontal cortex was dissected out, and it was homogenized in 0.32 M sucrose solution of a weight 20 times of the weight of the tissue using a Potter type homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4°C, 1,000 × g for 10 minutes, the obtained supernatant was further centrifuged at 4°C, 20,000 x g for 20 minutes, and the pellet was suspended in an incubation buffer (20 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mM glucose, 145 mM sodium chloride, 4.5 mM potassium chloride, 1.2 mM magnesium chloride, 1.5 mM calcium chloride), which was used as crude synaptosome fraction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5-HT uptake reaction was performed in a volume of 200 µl using a 96-well round bottom plate and pargyline (final concentration 10 µM) and sodium ascorbate (final concentration 0.2 mg/ml) were contained in the incubation buffer upon reaction and used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncubation buffer (total counting), non-labeled 5-HT(final concentration 10µM, non-specific counting) and the diluted test compound (final concentration 300nM) were added to each well. One-tenth quantity of the final volume of the synaptosome fraction was added and after preincubated at 37°C for 10 minutes, tritium labeled 5-HT solution (final concentration 8 nM) was added and uptake reaction was started at 37°C. The uptake time was 10 minutes and the reaction was terminated by vacuum filtration through a 96-well fiber glass filter paper plate, and after the filter paper was washed with cold normal saline, it was dried enough and Microscint0 (Perkin-Elmer) was added to the filter and remaining radioactivity on the filter was measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerotonin uptake inhibitory activity (%) was calculated from the radioactivity of total counting as 100%, of non-specific counting as 0%, and of counting obtained with test compound. \n \n \n%\n \n \n \nof inhibition of\n \n \n \n5\n \n-\n \nHT\n \n \n%\n \n \n=\n \n100\n \n-\n \n \n \nCount obtained with test compound\n \n-\n \nNonspecific count\n \n \n \n \n0\n \n%\n \n \n \nUptake\n \n \n \n/\n \n \nTotal count\n \n \n100\n \n%\n \n \n \nUptake\n \n \n-\n \nNonspecific count\n \n \n0\n \n%\n \n \n \nUptake\n \n \n \n \n×\n \n100\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nPreparation Examples\n\n\n \n \n \n100 g of a compound of the present invention, 40 g of Avicel (trade name, product of Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), 30 g of corn starch, and 2 g of magnesium stearate was mixed and polished and tableted with a pestle for glycocalyx R10 mm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe obtained tablet was coated with a film using a film coating agent made up of 10 g of TC-5 (trade name, product of Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd., hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), 3 g of polyethylene glycol 6000, 40 g of castor oil and an appropriate amount of ethanol to produce a film coated tablet, of the above composition."

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to 7,8-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-5(6H)-ones and related bicyclic compounds which are inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4), and to a method for treating diabetes and related diseases or disorders by employing such compounds alone, or in combination with another type of therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) is a membrane bound non-classical serine aminodipeptidase which is located in a variety of tissues (intestine, liver, lung, kidney) as well as on circulating T-lymphocytes (where the enzyme is known as CD-26). It is responsible for the metabolic cleavage of certain endogenous peptides (GLP-1(7-36), glucagon) \nin vivo\n and has demonstrated proteolytic activity against a variety of other peptides (GHRH, NPY, GLP-2, VIP) \nin vitro.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nGLP-1(7-36) is a 30 amino-acid peptide derived by post-translational processing of proglucagon in the small intestine. GLP-1(7-36) has multiple actions \nin vivo\n including the stimulation of insulin secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, the promotion of satiety, and the slowing of gastric emptying. Based on its physiological profile, the actions of GLP-1(7-36) are expected to be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of Type II diabetes and potentially obesity. To support this claim, exogenous administration of GLP-1(7-36) (continuous infusion) in diabetic patients has demonstrated efficacy in this patient population. Unfortunately GLP-1(7-36) is degraded rapidly \nin vivo\n and has been shown to have a short half-life \nin vivo\n (t1/2≈1.5 min). Based on a study of genetically bred DPP-4 KO mice and on \nin vivo\n/\nin vitro\n studies with selective DPP-4 inhibitors, DPP-4 has been shown to be the primary degrading enzyme of GLP-1(7-36) \nin vivo.\n GLP-1(7-36) is degraded by DPP-4 efficiently to GLP-1(9-36), which has been speculated to act as a physiological antagonist to GLP-1(7-36). Thus, inhibition of DPP-4 \nin vivo\n should potentiate endogenous levels of GLP-1(7-36) and attenuate formation of its antagonist GLP-1(9-36) and thus serve to ameliorate the diabetic condition.\n\n\n \nWO 2006/019965\n \n relates to 1,3-dimethylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2,4-diones as DPP-4 inhibitors.\n\npotentiate endogenous levels of GLP-1(7-36) and attenuate formation of its antagonist GLP-1(9-36) and thus serve to ameliorate the diabetic condition.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, compounds of formula (I) are provided\n\n \n \n\nwherein\n\n \n \n \nb is a single or double bond;\n \nn is 1 or 2;\n \nR\n1\n is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen (H), halogen, CF\n3\n, cyano (CN), amino, substituted amino, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, bicycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, heteroaryl, and cycloheteroalkyl, wherein any such functional group may optionally be substituted with 1 to 3 or more substituents selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halo, alkyl, polyhaloalkyl, alkoxy, aryl, haloalkoxy, polyhaloalkoxy, alkoxycarbonyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, bicycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, polycycloalkyl, heteroarylamino, arylamino, cycloheteroalkyl, heteroaryl, cycloheteroalkylalkyl, hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, nitro, cyano, amino, substituted amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, thiol, alkylthio, alkylcarbonyl, acyl, alkoxycarbonyl, arylalkylthio, aminocarbonyl, alkynylaminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, alkenylaminocarbonyl, alkylcarbonyloxy, alkylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino, alkylsulfonylamino, alkylaminocarbonylamino, alkoxycarbonylamino, alkylsulfonyl, alkylsulfinyl, \nand\n sulfonamido ;\n \nX is selected from the group consisting of C=O, C=S, CHR\n3\n, or CR\n3\n;\n \nR\n2\n and R\n3\n are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl and aryl;\n \nZ is selected from the group consisting of C=O, C=S, and CHR\n4\n;\n \nR\n4\n is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl and aryl;\n \n\n\n \n \n \nA is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen (H), alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, bicycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloheteroalkyl, O-R\n1\n, cyano, amino, -C(O)-OH, -C(O)-NR\n6\nR\n7\n, -C(O)-OR\n6\n, S(O)\nm\n-R\n6\n, -S(O)\n2\nNR\n6\nR\n7\n, -NR\n6\nR\n7\n,-NR\n6\n-C(O)R\n7\n and -NR\n6\n-SO\n2\nR\n7\n, wherein any such functional group may optionally be substituted with one to three or more substituents selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halo, alkyl, polyhaloalkyl, alkoxy, aryl, haloalkoxy, polyhaloalkoxy, alkoxycarbonyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, bicycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, polycycloalkyl, heteroarylamino, arylamino, cycloheteroalkyl, heteroaryl, cycloheteroalkylalkyl, hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, nitro, cyano, amino, substituted amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, thiol, alkylthio, alkylcarbonyl, acyl, alkoxycarbonyl, arylalkylthio, aminocarbonyl, alkynylaminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, alkenylaminocarbonyl, alkylcarbonyloxy, alkylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino, alkylsulfonylamino, alkylaminocarbonylamino, alkoxycarbonylamino, alkylsulfonyl, aminosulfonyl, alkylsulfinyl, sulfonamido and sulfonyl;\n\nm is 0, 1 or 2;\n\nR\n1\n is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and aryl;\n\nR\n6\n and R\n7\n are\n\n \n \n \n(i) each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen (H), alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, bicycloalkyl, alkylthioalkyl, arylalkylthioalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, and cycloheteroalkyl, wherein either functional group may optionally be substituted with one to three or more substituents selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halo, alkyl, polyhaloalkyl, alkoxy, aryl, haloalkoxy, polyhaloalkoxy, alkoxycarbonyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, bicycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, polycycloalkyl, heteroarylamino, arylamino, cycloheteroalkyl, heteroaryl, cycloheteroalkylalkyl, hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, nitro, cyano, amino, substituted amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, thiol, alkylthio, arylalkylthio, alkylcarbonyl, acyl, alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, alkynylaminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, alkenylaminocarbonyl, alkylcarbonyloxy, alkylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino, alkylsulfonylamino, alkylaminocarbonylamino, alkoxycarbonylamino, alkylsulfonyl, aminosulfonyl, alkylsulfinyl, sulfonamido and sulfonyl;

The compounds of the present invention can be synthesized using the methods described below, together with synthetic methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, those described below. All references cited herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe novel compounds of formula I may be prepared using the reactions and techniques described in this section. The reactions are performed in solvents appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and are suitable for the transformations being effected. Also, in the description of the synthetic methods described below, it is to be understood that all proposed reaction conditions, including solvent, reaction atmosphere, reaction temperature, duration of the experiment and workup procedures, are chosen to be the conditions standard for that reaction, which should be readily recognized by one skilled in the art. One skilled in the art of organic synthesis understands that the functionality present on various portions of the edict molecule must be compatible with the reagents and reactions proposed. Not all compounds of formula I falling into a given class may be compatible with some of the reaction conditions required in some of the methods described. Such restrictions to the substituents, which are compatible with the reaction conditions, will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art and alternate methods must be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 1 provides a general route to prepare aminomethyl 7,8-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-5(6H)-ones of formula IA of the invention, where n is 1, Z is -C=O, X is CH\n2\n and b is a single bond. A chloroketone of formula (1) (where R\na\n is alkyl), obtained from commercial sources, is condensed with aldehyde (2) under a variety of conditions, such as under mild acidic catalysis, to form the conjugated ester (3). One preferred set of conditions involves reacting (1) and (2) in an alcoholic solvent, such as isopropanol, at ambient or elevated temperature, in the presence of benzylamine and acetic acid. Condensation of (3) with enamine (4) (where R\nb\n is alkyl) in an alcoholic solvent such as isopropanol, yields a dihydropyridine of formula (5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnamines of formula (4) can be obtained from commercial sources or can be prepared by reaction of the corresponding acetoacetate with ammonia. In some cases, the dihydropyridines (5) can be conveniently prepared in one pot by addition of enamine (4) directly to the reaction mixture in which (1) and (2) are condensed to give (3). Oxidation of dihydropyridine (5) to pyridine (6) can be performed by a variety of reagents, such as with MnO\n2\n, HNO\n3\n, DDQ, or other methods known in the art. A preferred method involves treating (5) with 70% aqueous nitric acid in acetic acid as solvent to afford pyridine (6). Reaction of chloromethylpyridine (6) with potassium cyanide or sodium cyanide, in a solvent such as ethanol or N,N-dimethylformamide, at elevated temperature, can produce the nitrile (7), in which an additional carbon atom has been introduced. Reduction of the nitrile (7) can be accomplished by a variety of procedures known to those skilled in the art. A preferred procedure is catalytic hydrogenation using a catalyst such as Pd/C, in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol, which gives a primary amine. This primary amine can then undergo intramolecular ring closure, which can be spontaneous or can be facilitated by heating in a suitable solvent, such as methanol or ethanol, to afford the lactam (8). If R\nb\n is benzyl, catalytic hydrogenation will afford a carboxylic acid (where R\nb\n is H). Transformation of ester or acid (8) to the primary alcohol (9) can be performed using any of the methods known in the art. For example, when R\nb\n = Me, the ester (8) can be reduced with a suitable hydride reducing agent such as LiBH\n4\n. When R\nb\n = H, the acid (8) can be converted to an activated ester such as a mixed anhydride, using a base such as triethylamine and then ethyl chloroformate, and then reduced with a reagent such as NaBH\n4\n. Alternatively, the acid (8) can be converted to the acid chloride with oxalyl chloride or thionyl chloride and then reduced with a suitable reducing agent, such as NaNH\n4\n, LiAlH\n4\n or lithium tri-\ntert\n-butoxy aluminum hydride. The resulting alcohol (9) can then be converted to a mesylate or chloride using reagents such as CH\n3\nSO\n2\nCl, in solvents such methylene chloride or tetrahydrofuran, and in the presence of a base such as triethylamine. The desired primary amines (10) can then be obtained by reaction of the precursor chloride or mesylate with NH\n3\n/MeOH under thermal or microwave heating conditions.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 2 provides an alternative route to prepare aminomethyl 7,8-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-5(6H)-ones of formula (IA'). A ketoester of formula (11), obtained from commercial sources or prepared by procedures known to those skilled in the art, can be condensed with aldehyde (2) under mild acidic catalysis, as described in Scheme 1, to form the conjugated ester (12). Also following Scheme 1, reaction of enamine (13) with ester (12) affords the dihydropyridine of formula (14). Enamines of formula (13) can be obtained from commercial sources or can be prepared by reaction of the corresponding ketoester or ketonitrile with ammonia. Oxidation of dihydropyridine (14) to pyridine (15) can be performed with MnO\n2\n, HNO\n3\n, or other methods known in the art. A preferred method involves treating (14) with 70% aqueous nitric acid in acetic acid as solvent to afford pyridine (15). Demethylation of the methyl ether can be accomplished with BBr\n3\n under standard literature conditions to afford the alcohol (16). Heating alcohol (16) directly with an ammonia source, such as with ammonium hydroxide, in a sealed tube at elevated temperature or under microwave conditions, can afford the 7,8-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-5(6H)-ones (17). When W is CN, direct reduction, such as by hydrogenation using Raney nickel as a catalyst, affords the desired aminomethyl 7,8-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-5(6H)-ones of formula (IA'). When W is CO\n2\nR\nb\n, the procedures described in Scheme 1 can be used to prepare the desired aminomethyl 7,8-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-5(6H)-ones of formula IA'.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alcohol (16) can be used in a variety of ways to prepare additional compounds of this invention, as shown in Scheme 3. Under certain conditions, such as acidic conditions, for example by direct concentration of the reaction mixture of the BBr\n3\n-mediated methoxy demethylation in Scheme 2, the alcohol (16) can close onto the ester to form the lactone (19). The alcohol (16) can also be activated by converting it into a leaving group, such as the mesylate (20). Under certain conditions, such as by exposure to basic conditions, an elimination can occur to afford the olefins (21). Each of these materials, compounds (19), (20), and (21) can be used to prepare additional compounds of this invention.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Scheme 4, the lactone (19), mesylate (20) and olefin (21) can each be treated with an appropriate primary amine A-NH\n2\n, for example glycine derivatives or alkylamines, typically under heating or microwave conditions and also typically in the presence of a suitable base, such as triethylamine, to afford 7,8-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-5(6H)-ones (22). These compounds (22) can be converted into the desired aminomethyl 7,8-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-5(6H)-ones IB of the invention by procedures that have been described in Schemes 1 and 2.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 7,8-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-5(6H)-ones (17) can also be further functionalized by methods described in Scheme 5. Treatment of (17) with an appropriate aryl halide in the presence of CuI, a diamine ligand, such as N, N'-dimethylethylenediamine, and a base , such as K\n2\nCO\n3\n or Cs\n2\nCO\n3\n, at elevated temperature can afford compounds (24), where A = aryl (see, for example, \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc., 124:7421 (2002\n)). Conversion of W to the aminomethyl 7,8-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-5(6H)-ones (IB') follows procedures described in earlier Schemes. Additionally, deprotonation of (17) with a suitable base, such as sodium hydride, followed by treatment with suitable electrophiles, such as alkyl halides, aryl and alkyl sulfonyl chlorides, alkoxycarbonylmethyl halides, etc., can afford substituted lactams (26), which can be elaborated to the aminomethyl 7,8-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-5(6H)-ones (IB\") as described in earlier Schemes.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 6 describes an additional strategy for functionalizing the lactam. Compound (IA'), readily available as described in earlier schemes, can be protected by a wide variety ofN-protecting groups which are well known to those skilled in the art, such as BOC, bis-BOC, CBZ, etc., to afford N-protected compounds (29). Lactam functionalization as described in Scheme 5 can afford compounds (30), which upon N-deprotection will then afford the desired aminomethyl 7,8-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-5(6H)-ones (IB).\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 7 provides a route to prepare aminomethyl 1,6-naphthyridine-5,7(6H,8H)-diones (IC) of the present invention, where X and Z are C=O, n is 1 and b is a single bond. A ketoester of formula (32) (where R\nc\n is alkyl), obtained from commercial sources or prepared by procedures known to those skilled in the art, can be reacted with aldehyde (2) as described previously to form the conjugated ester (33), which after reacting with enamine (13) can yield a dihydropyridine of formula (34).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnamines of formula (13) can be obtained from commercial sources or can be prepared by reaction of the corresponding ketoester or ketonitrile with ammonia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOxidation of dihydropyridine (34) to pyridine (35) can be performed with MnO\n2\n, HNO\n3\n, or other methods known in the art, as described previously. Heating (35) directly with an appropriate amine A-NH\n2\n, such as with ammonium hydroxide or an alkylamine or arylamine, in a sealed tube at elevated temperature or under microwave conditions, can afford the 1,6-naphthyridine-5,7(6H,8H)-diones (36). The desired aminomethyl 1,6-naphthyridine-5,7(6H,8H)-diones (IC) of the present invention can be obtained following the procedures described in Schemes 1 and 2.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 8 provides a route to 5,6-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-7(8H)-ones (ID), where Z is CH\n2\n, X is C=O, and n is 1. Selective de-esterification of the diester (35) to give the monocarboxylic acid (38) can be readily accomplished when R\na\n and R\nc\n are different, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art. For example, if R\na\n is methyl and R\nc\n is \ntert\n-butyl, saponification with a base such as lithium hydroxide will provide (38). Conversely, if R\na\n is \ntert\n-butyl and R\nc\n is methyl, treatment of (35) with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid will provide (38). Using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art, the acid functionality of (38) can be readily reduced to an alcohol, such as by treatment with borane in a solvent such as THF, or by formation of a mixed anhydride with ethyl chloroformate and a base such as triethylamine, followed by reduction of the mixed anhydride with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride. The resulting alcohol can be oxidized to the aldehyde (39) by a variety of procedures, such as by treatment with MnO\n2\n or by Swern oxidation. Treatment of (39) with an appropriate amine A-NH\n2\n under reductive amination conditions, such as by using a reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride under mildly acidic conditions in solvent such as methanol or methylene chloride, will afford a pyridinylmethylamine. This pyridinylmethylamine can add in an intramolecular fashion to the ester functionality CO\n2\nR\nc\n to form the lactam (40), the ring-closure either occurring spontaneously, or under conditions such as heating in an appropriate solvent. The desired aminomethyl 5,6-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-7(8H)-ones (ID) of the present invention can be obtained following the procedures described in Schemes 1 and 2.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 9 provides a route to 5,6-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-7(8H)-ones ID', where Z is CHR\n4\n, X is C=O, and n is 1. The aldehyde (39) from Scheme 8 can be treated with a variety of organometallic agents R\n4\n-M, such as alkyl or aryl Grignard reagents and the like, usually at low temperatures such as -78 °C to 0 °C and in solvents such as THF and ether, to afford secondary alcohols. These secondary alcohols can be oxidized to the ketone (42) by a variety of procedures known to those skilled in the art, such as by treatment with MnO\n2\n or by Swern oxidation. As described in Scheme 8, treatment of (42) with an appropriate amine A-NH\n2\n under reductive amination conditions, such as by using a reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride under mildly acidic conditions in solvents such as methanol or methylene chloride, will afford a \npyridinylmethylamine\n. This \npyridinylmethylamine\n can add in an intramolecular fashion to the ester functionality CO\n2\nR\nc\n to form the lactam (43), the ring-closure either occurring spontaneously, or under conditions such as heating in an appropriate solvent. The desired aminomethyl 5,6-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-7(8H)-ones (ID') of the present invention, where X is C=O, Z is CHR\n4\n and n is 1, can be obtained following the procedures described in Schemes 1 and 2.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 10 provides a route to 7-8-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin 5(6H)-ones IE, where Z is C=O, X is CR\n3\n, and n is 1. Selective de-esterification of the diester (35) to give the monocarboxylic acid (45) can be readily accomplished when R\na\n and R\nc\n are different, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art (see \nGreene, T: and Wuts, P.G.M., Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, NY (1991\n) and references therein). For example, if R\nc\n is methyl and R\na\n is \ntert\n-butyl, saponification with a base such as lithium hydroxide will provide (45). Conversely, if R\nc\n is \ntert\n-butyl and R\na\n is methyl, treatment of (35) with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid will provide (45). Using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art, the acid functionality of (45) can be readily reduced to an alcohol, such as by treatment with borane in a solvent such as THF, or by formation of a mixed anhydride with ethyl chloroformate and a base such as triethylamine, followed by reduction of the mixed anhydride with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride. The resulting alcohol can be oxidized to the aldehyde (46) by a variety of procedures, as described previously, such as by treatment with MnO\n2\n or by Swern oxidation. Treatment of (46) with a variety of organometallic agents R\n3\n-M, such as alkyl or aryl Grignard reagents and the like, usually at low temperatures such as -78 °C to 0 °C and in solvents such as THF and ether, affords secondary alcohols. These secondary alcohols can be oxidized to the ketone (47) by a variety of procedures known to those skilled in the art, such as by treatment with MnO\n2\n or by Swern oxidation. Treatment of (47) with an appropriate amine A-NH\n2\n under reductive amination conditions, as described previously, such as by using a reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride under mildly acidic conditions in solvent such as methanol or methylene chloride, will afford a pyridinylmethylamine. This pyridinylmethylamine can add in an intramolecular fashion to the ester functionality CO\n2\nR\na\n to form the lactam (48), the ring-closure either occurring spontaneously, or under conditions such as heating in an appropriate solvent. The desired aminomethyl 7,8-dihydro-1,6-naphthyridin-5(6H)-ones (IE) of the present invention, where Z is C=O, X is CHR\n3\n and n is 1, can be obtained following the procedures described in Schemes 1 and 2.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 11 provides a route to compounds of the present invention where n is 2. Ester (50) represents intermediates useful for preparation of compounds of the present invention as described in Schemes 1 to 10. For example, where Z is C=O, A is H, X is CH\n2\n, R\n2\n is H, and the bond b is single, compound (50) represents compound (8) which can be prepared as described in Scheme 1. De-esterification of ester (50) can be readily accomplished in a variety of ways depending on the nature of R\nb\n to provide a carboxylic acid. These methods are well known to those skilled in the art (see \nGreene, T. and Wuts, P.G.M., Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, NY (1991\n) and references therein). Using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art, the acid functionality can be readily reduced to the alcohol (51), such as by treatment with borane in a solvent such as THF, or by formation of a mixed anhydride with ethyl chloroformate and a base such as triethylamine, followed by reduction of the mixed anhydride with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride. The alcohol (51) can then be converted to a mesylate or chloride using reagents such as CH\n3\nSO\n2\nCl or SOCl\n2\n in solvents such methylene chloride or tetrahydrofuran, and with or without a base such as triethylamine. Treatment of the chloride or mesylate with sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide, in solvents such as acetonitrile or DMF, affords the nitrile (52). The nitrile (52) can be reduced by a variety of procedures, such as by catalytic hydrogenation using catalysts such as Raney nickel or Pd/C, or by treating the nitrile with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride in the presence of a catalyst such as NiCl\n2\n or CoCl\n2\n, to afford compounds of the present invention (IF), where n is 2.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 12 provides a route to additional compounds of the present invention. Treatment of (54), where X is CHR\n3\n and Z is C=O, with Lawesson's reagent provides the thioamide compound (55), which can be used to prepare compounds of the present invention (as described in Schemes 1 and 2) where Z is C=S. Reduction of the amide functionality of (54), such as by treating with borane in a solvent such as THF, provides (56), which can be used to prepare compounds of the present invention (as described in Schemes 1 and 2) where Z is CH\n2\n. In the same manner, treatment of (57), where Z is CHR\n4\n and X is C=O, with Lawesson's reagent provides the thioamide compound (58), which can be used to prepare compounds of the present invention (as described in Schemes 1 and 2) where X is C=S. Reduction of the amide functionality of (57), such as by treating with borane in a solvent such as THF, provides (59), which can be used to prepare compounds of the present invention (as described in Schemes 1 and 2) where X is CH\n2\n.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 13 provides a route to compounds of the present invention where bond b is double. Compound (60) (which can be converted to a compound of the invention where Z is C=O and bond b is single (employing Schemes 1 and 2)), can be oxidized to compound (61), where bond b is double, by various oxidizing agents such as DDQ and MnO\n2\n. Alternatively, compound (47) from Scheme 10 can be treated with an appropriate amine A-NH\n2\n, which can form an imine/enamine intermediate, which upon heating can condense onto the ester functionality CO\n2\nR\n3\n to provide compound (61), where bond b is double. Compound (61) can be used to prepare compounds of the invention employing the procedures of Schemes 1 and 2.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll product amines that exist as atropisomers can be separated into individual enantiomers using methods known in the art. For example, resolution by crystallization of diastereomeric salts (tartaric acid, N-protected amino acids, etc; see for example, \nEliel, Ernest L.; Wilen, Samuel H.; Doyle, Michael P., Basic Organic Stereochemistry, Wiley, (2001\n)), chiral preparative HPLC, use of enzymes, use of chiral derivatizing agents (see for example, \nJ.

For use, the contents of the vial are mixed with 2 mL of physiological saline, to produce an injectable preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular subject can be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the species, age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the subject, the mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and severity of the particular condition.\n\n\n \n\n\nBIOLOGICAL EVALUATION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDPP-4 inhibitory activity of the compounds of the present invention may be determined by use of an \nin vitro\n assay system which measures the degree in inhibition of DPP-4-mediated cleavage of an appropriate substrate or pseudosubstrate. Inhibition constants (Ki values) for the DPP-4 inhibitors of the invention may be determined by the method described in the experimental section below.\n\n\n \n\n\nCloning, Expression and Purification of Human DPP-4\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo generate human DPP-4, PCR (Red-tag polymerase, Sigma) was performed on Human cDNA from placenta (Clontech) using two primers, ACGCCGACGATGAAGACA and AGGTAAAGAGAAACATTGTT, based on the nucleotide sequence of the human clone (accession number M74777). PCR products were cloned into the pcDN4/HisMax TOPO vector (Invitrogene). For stable transfection of CHO-DG44 cells, DPP4 was rePCRed using primers GGTACCAGCGCAGAGGCTT and CTCGAGCTAAGGTAAAGAGAAACATTG to generate KpnI and XhoI sites. The KpnI and XhoI sites were used to extract the N-terminal His tagged gene. The His tag, which could be cleaved and removed by Enterokinase, was included to allow purification using the TALON affinity column. The gene was then ligated into the KpnI and XhoI sites of the pD16 vector for stable transfection. Stable cell lines were generated by transfecting the expression vector into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-DG44) cells using electroporation. The CHO-DG44 cell line was grown in PFCHO media supplemented with HT (glycine, hypoxanthine and thymidine, Invitrogene), glutamine and Recombulin (ICN). Then 1x10\n7\n cells/ml were collected, transfected with 60 µg of DNA using electroporation at 300V, and then transferred to a T75 flask. On the third day following transfection, the HT supplement was removed and selection was initiated with methotrexate (MTX, 10 nM, ICN). After a further 10 days the cells were plated into individual wells of 96 well plates. Every 10 days the concentration of MTX was increased two to three fold, up to a maximum of 400 nM. Final stable cell line selection was based on yield and activity of the expressed protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn attempt to purify recombinant DPP-4 using Talon resin was not efficient, resulting in small yields, with most of the DPP activity passing through the column. Therefore, protein was further purified using conventional anion exchange (Sepharose Q), gel filtration (S-200) and high resolution MonoQ columns. The final protein yielded a single band on SDS-PAGE gels. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated two populations of DPP-4 in the sample. One portion of the protein had 27 amino acids truncated from the N-terminus, while the other was lacking the N-terminal 37 amino acids. This suggests that during isolation the entire transmembrane domain (including His tag) is removed by proteases present in the CHO cells. Total protein concentration was measured using the Bradford dye method and the amount of the active DPP-4 was determined by titrating the enzyme with a previously characterized inhibitor (Ki = 0.4 nM). No biphasic behavior was observed during inhibition or catalysis, suggesting that both protein populations are functionally identical.\n\n\n \n\n\nDPP-4 Inhibition Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition of human DPP-4 activity was measured under steady-state conditions by following the absorbance increase at 405 nm upon the cleavage of the pseudosubstrate, Gly-Pro-pNA. Assays were performed in 96-well plates using a Thermomax plate reader. Typically reactions contained 100 µl of ATE buffer (100 mM Aces, 52 mM Tris, 52 mM ethanolamine, pH 7.4), 0.45 nM enzyme, either 120 or 1000 µM of substrate (S<Km and S>Km, Km = 180 µM) and variable concentration of the inhibitor. To ensure steady-state conditions for slow-binding inhibitors, enzyme was preincubated with the compound for 40 minutes prior to substrate addition, to initiate the reaction. All serial inhibitor dilutions were in DMSO and final solvent concentration did not exceed 1 %.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibitor potency was evaluated by fitting inhibition data to the binding isotherm: \n \n \n \nvi\n \nv\n \n \n=\n \n \nRange\n \n \n1\n \n+\n \n \n \n \nI\n \n \nIC\n \n50\n \n \n \n \nn\n \n \n \n \n+\n \nBackground\n \n \n \n \n\nwhere \nvi\n is the initial reaction velocity at different concentrations of inhibitor \nI\n; \nv\n is the control velocity in the absence of inhibitor, range is the difference between the uninhibited velocity and background; background is the rate of spontaneous substrate hydrolysis in the absent of enzyme, \nn\n is the Hill coefficient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalculated IC\n50\ns at each substrate concentration were converted to Ki assuming competitive inhibition according to: \n \n \nKi\n \n=\n \n \n \nIC\n \n50\n \n \n \n1\n \n+\n \n \nS\n \nKm\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll inhibitors were competitive as judged by a very good agreement of Ki values obtained from the assays at high and low substrate concentrations.

According to recent studies on obesity, for example, more than 50 % of the U.S. population is considered overweight, with more than 25 % diagnosed as clinically obese and at considerable risk for heart disease, \ntype\n 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. This epidemic presents a significant burden on the health care system as projected obesity treatment costs of more than $70 billion annually are expected in the U.S. alone. Strategies for treating obesity include reduction of food intake and enhancing the expenditure of energy,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeuropeptide Y (NPY), a 36 amino acid peptide neurotransmitter, is a member of the pancreatic polypeptide class of neurotransmitters/neurohormones which has been shown to be present in both the periphery and central nervous system. NPY is one of the most potent orexigenic agents known and has been shown to play a major role in the regulation of food intake in animals, including humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSix neuropeptide Y receptors (NPY), the Y1-, Y2-, Y3-, Y4, and Y5- and Y6-subtypes, have been cloned, which belong to the rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled 7-transmembrane spanning receptors (GPCR). The NPY Y2 receptor (Y2R) is a 381 amino-acid receptor which inhibits the activation of adenyl cyclase via G\ni\n while displaying low homology with other known NPY receptors. There is a high degree of conservation between rat and human Y2 receptors with 98 % amino acid identity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Y2R receptor is widely distributed within the central nervous system in both rodents and humans, In the hypothalamus, Y2 mRNA is localized in the arcuate nucleus, preoptic nucleus, and dorsomedial nucleus. In the human brain, Y2R is the predominant Y receptor subtype. Within the arcuate nucleus, over 80 % of the NPY neurons co-express Y2R mRNA. Application of a Y2-selective agonist has been shown to reduce the release of NPY from hypothalamic slices in vitro, whereas the Y2 non-peptide antagonist BIIE0246 increases NPY release. These findings support the role of Y2R as a presynaptic autoreceptor that regulates the NPY release and hence may be involved in the regulation of feeding. (\nKaga T et al., Peptides 22: 501-506 (2001\n) and \nKing PJ et al., Eur J Pharmacol 396: R1-3 (2000\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide YY \n3-36\n (PYY \n3-36\n) is a 34 amino acid linear peptide having neuropeptide Y2 (NPY2R) agonist activity. It has been demonstrated that Intra-arcuate (IC) or Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of PYY \n3-36\n reduced feeding in rats and, as a chronic treatment, reduced body weight gain. Intra-venous (IV) infusion (0.8 pmol/kg/min) for 90 min of PYY \n3-36\n reduced food intake in obese and normal human subjects over 24 hours. These finding suggest that the PYY system may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity. (\nBatterham RL et al., Nature 418: 650-654 (2002\n); \nBatterham RL et al., New Engl J Med 349: 941-948 (2003\n)). Further, a Cys\n2\n-(D)Cys\n27\n-cyclized version of PYY, in which residues 5-24 were replaced by a methylene-chain of 5 to 8 carbons in length, showed activation of the intestinal PYY receptor, as evidenced by reduced current across voltage-clamped mucosal preparations of rat jejunum. (Krstenansky, et al. in Peptides, Proceedings of the Twelfth American Peptide Symposium. J. Smith and J. Rivier Editors, ESCOM. Leiden Page 136-137).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, covalent modification of proteins with poly (ethylene glycol) or poly (ethylene oxide) (both referred to as PEG), was demonstrated with superoxide dismutase (\nSomack, R, et al., (1991) Free Rad Res Commun 12-13:553-562\n; \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 5,283,317\n \n and \n \n5,468,478\n \n) and for other types of proteins, e.g., cytokines (\nSaifer, M G P, et al., (1997) Polym Preprints 38:576-577\n; \nSherman, M R, et al., (1997) in J M Harris, et al., (Eds.), Poly(ethylene glycol) Chemistry and Biological Applications. ACS Symposium Series 680 (pp. 155-169) Washington, D.C.: American Chemical Society\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, recent data have shown that gastric bypass patients have an early and exaggerated increase in PYY levels that may be partly responsible for the early glycemic control and long term weight maintenance demonstrating the importance of this peptide in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases. Other known actions of PYY include: reduced gastric emptying and delayed gastrointestinal transit that is responsible for improved postprandial glycemic control. Indices of hyperglycaemia such as HbA\n1C\n and fructosamine show a dose-dependent reduction after peripheral administration of PYY\n3-36\n in animal models of \ntype\n 2 diabetes. Thus, these results indicate that PYY\n3-36\n, or pharmaceutically related agonists, may offer a long term therapeutic approach to glycemic and weight control. (\nKorner et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metabol 90: 359-365 (2005\n); \nChan JL et al., Obesity 14: 194-198 (2006\n); \nStratis C et al., Obes Surg 16: 752-758 (2006\n); \nBorg CM et al., Br J Surg 93: 210-215 (2006\n); and \nPittner RA et al., Int J Obes 28: 963-971 (2004\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA need exists, however, for novel engineered analogs of PYY having lower molecular weight, while possessing equal or better potency and selectivity against Y1, Y4 and Y5 receptors, pharmacokinetic properties and pharmacological properties. Preferably, a need exists for compounds having greater duration of activity than those previously available. A need also exists for pegylated analogs of PYY in order to, for example, increase protein half-life and reduce immunogenicity in subjects in need of such agonists.\n\n \n \n \n \nFigure 1\n shows an HPLC chromatogram of a reaction mixture containing a compound (example 34) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 2\n shows an HPLC chromatogram of a purified compound (example 34) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 3\n shows a MALDI-TOF spectrum of a compound (example 34) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 4\n shows an HPLC chromatogram of a reaction mixture of another compound (example 35) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 5\n shows an HPLC chromatogram of a purified a compound (example 35) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 6\n shows a MALDI-TOF spectrum of a compound (example 35) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 7\n shows an HPLC chromatogram of a reaction mixture of a compound (example 36) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 8\n shows an HPLC chromatogram of a purified compound (example 36) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 9\n shows a MALDI-TOF spectrum of yet another compound (example 36) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 10\n shows an HPLC chromatogram of a reaction mixture of a compound (example 37) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 11\n shows an HPLC chromatogram of a purified compound (example 37) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 12\n shows a MALDI-TOF spectrum of a compound (example 37) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 13\n shows an HPLC chromatogram of a reaction mixture of another compound (example 38) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 14\n shows HPLC chromatogram of a purified compound (example 38) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 15\n shows a MALDI-TOF spectrum of a compound (example 38) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 16\n shows an HPLC chromatogram of a reaction mixture of a compound (example 39) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 17\n shows an HPLC chromatogram of a purified compound (example 39) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 18\n shows a MALDI-TOF spectrum of yet another compound (example 39) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 19\n shows an HPLC chromatogram of a reaction mixture containing a compound (example 41) of the present invention before deprotection.\n \n \nFigure 20\n shows an HPLC chromatogram of a deprotected reaction mixture containing a compound (example 41) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 21\n shows an HPLC chromatogram of a purified compound (example 41) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 22\n shows a MALDI-TOF spectrum of a compound (example 41) of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 23\n shows the effect of sub-chronic dosing of a compound (example 41) on body weight in male diet-induced obese (DIO) rats.\n \n \nFigure 24\n shows the acute effect of a compound (example 41) on an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in female \ndbldb\n mice.\n \n \nFigure 25\n show the effect of sub-chronic dosing of a compound (example 41) on basal blood glucose (A) and oral glucose tolerance test (B) in female \ndb\n/\ndb\n mice.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAlthough any methods, devices and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, the preferred methods, devices and materials are now described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll peptide sequences mentioned herein are written according to the usual convention whereby the N-terminal amino acid is on the left and the C-terminal amino acid is on the right, unless noted otherwise.

In such a method the synthesis of the novel compounds can be carried out by sequentially incorporating the desired amino acid residues one at a time into the growing peptide chain according to the general principles of solid phase methods. Such methods are disclosed in, for example, \nMenifield, R. B., J. Amer. Chem.

Usually also common is the protection of the alpha amino group on an amino acid or fragment while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the alpha amino protecting group at allow a subsequent reaction to take place at that site. While specific protecting groups have been disclosed in regard to the solid phase synthesis method, it should be noted that each amino acid can be protected by a protective group conventionally used for the respective amino acid in solution phase synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlpha amino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group selected from aromatic urethane-type protecting groups, such as allyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, such as p-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-biphenyl-isopropyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Moz); aliphatic urethane-type protecting groups, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), diisopropylmethyloxycarbonyl, isopropyloxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl.

Trifluoroacetic acid was purchased from Halocarbon or Fluka and used without further purification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) and diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) was purchased from Fluka or Aldrich and used without further purification. Hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) dimethylsulfide (DMS) and 1, 2-ethanedithiol (EDT) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. and used without further purification. Protected amino acids were generally of the L configuration and were obtained commercially from Bachem, or Neosystem. Purity of these reagents was confirmed by thin layer chromatography, NMR and melting point prior to use. Benzhydrylamine resin (BHA) was a copolymer of styrene - 1% divinylbenzene (100-200 or 200-400 mesh) obtained from Bachem or Advanced Chemtech. Total nitrogen content of these resins were generally between 0.3 - 1.2 meq/g.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, peptides were prepared using solid phase synthesis by the method generally described by \nMerrifield, (J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 85, 2149 (1963\n)), although other equivalent chemical synthesis known in the art could be used as previously mentioned. Solid phase synthesis is commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha-amino acid to a suitable resin. Such a starting material can be prepared by attaching an alpha-amino-protected amino acid by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin, or by an amide bond between an Fmoc-Linker, such as p- ((R, S)-α-(1-(9H-fluoren-9-yl)-methoxyformamido)-2,4-dimethyloxybenzyl)-phenoxyacetic acid (Rink linker) to a benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin. Preparation of the hydroxymethyl resin is well known in the art. Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin supports are commercially available and generally used when the desired peptide being synthesized has an unsubstituted amide at the C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, the amino acids or mimetic are coupled onto the Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin using the Fmoc protected form of amino acid or mimetic, with 2 - 5 equivalents of amino acid and a suitable coupling reagent. After couplings, the resin may be washed and dried under vacuum. Loading of the amino acid onto the resin may be determined by amino acid analysis of an aliquot of Fmoc-amino acid resin or by determination of Fmoc groups by UV analysis. Any unreacted amino groups may be capped by reacting the resin with acetic anhydride and diispropylethylamine in methylene chloride.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resins are carried through several repetitive cycles to add amino acids sequentially. The alpha amino Fmoc protecting groups are removed under basic conditions. Piperidine, piperazine or morpholine (20-40% v/v) in DMF may be used for this purpose. Preferably 40% piperidine in DMF is utilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing the removal of the alpha amino protecting group, the subsequent protected amino acids are coupled stepwise in the desired order to obtain an intermediate, protected peptide-resin. The activating reagents used for coupling of the amino acids in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the art. For example, appropriate reagents for such syntheses are benzotriazol-1-yloxy-tri- (dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), Bromo-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBroP) 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), and diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC). Preferred here are HBTU and DIC. Other activating agents are described by \nBarany and Merrifield (in The Peptides, Vol. 2, J. Meienhofer, ed., Academic Press, 1979, pp 1-284\n) and may be utilized. Various reagents such as 1 hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), N-hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) and 3, 4-dihydro-3-hydroxy-4-oxo-1, 2, 3-benzotriazine (HOOBT) may be added to the coupling mixtures in order to optimize the synthetic cycles. Preferred here is HOBT.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor preparation of N-terminal acetyl derivatives, acetylation was carried out by treating the resin bound peptide with 20% acetic anhydride in DMF with 5% DIEA. For other N-terminal acylations, acylation was carried out using the corresponding carboxylic acid activated in-situ with DIC/HOBT for 30 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protocol for a typical synthetic cycle is as follows:\n\n\n \n \nProtocol\n 1\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nStep\n \n \nReagent\n\n\nTime\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nDMF\n\n\n2 x 30 sec.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n20 % piperidine/\nDMF\n \n\n\n1 min.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n20 % piperidine/\nDMF\n \n\n\n15 min.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nDMF\n\n\n2 x 30 sec.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\niPrOH\n\n\n2 x 30 sec.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nDMF\n\n\n3 x 30 sec.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nCoupling\n\n\n60 min - 18 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nDMF\n\n\n2 x 30 sec.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\niPrOH\n\n\n1 x 30 sec.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nDMF\n\n\n1 x 30 sec.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nCH\n2\nCl\n2\n \n\n\n2 x 30 sec.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolvents for all washings and couplings were measured to volumes of 10 - 20 ml/g resins. Coupling reactions throughout the synthesis were monitored by the Kaiser Ninhydrin test to determine extent of completion (\nKaiser et at. Anal.Biochem.34, 595-598 (1970\n)). Slow reaction kinetics was observed for Fmoc-Arg (Pmc) and for couplings to secondary amines by sterically hindered acids. Any incomplete coupling reactions were either recoupled with freshly prepared activated amino acid or capped by treating the peptide resin with acetic anhydride as described above. The fully assembled peptide-resins were dried in vacuum for several hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor most compounds, the blocking groups were removed and the peptide cleaved from the resin. For example, the peptide-resins were treated with 100 µL ethanedithiol, 100 µl dimethylsulfide, 300 µL anisole, and 9.5 mL trifluoroacetic acid, per gram of resin, at room temperature for 180 min. Or alternately the peptide-resins were treated with 1.0 mL triisopropyl silane and 9.5 mL trifluoroacetic acid, per gram of resin, at room temperature for 180 min. The resin was filtered off and the filtrates were precipitated in chilled ethyl ether. The precipitates were centrifuged and the ether layer was decanted. The residue was washed with two or three volumes of Et\n2\nO and recentrifuged. The crude products were dried under vacuum. Purification of the crude peptides was preferably performed on Shimadzu LC-8A system by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a reverse phase C-18 Column (50x250 mm. 300 A, 10-15 µm). The peptides were injected to the columns in a minimum volume of either 0.1 AcOH/H\n2\nO or CH3CH/H\n2\nO. Gradient elution was generally started at 2% B buffer, 2% -70% B over 70 minutes, (buffer A: 0.1% TFA/H\n2\nO, buffer B: 0.1% TFA/CH\n3\nCN) at a flow rate of 50 ml/min. UV detection was made at 220/280 nm. The fractions containing the products were separated and their purity was judged on Shimadzu LC-10AT analytical system using reverse phase Ace C18 column (4.6 x50mm) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min., gradient (2-70 %) over 10 min.(buffer A: 0.1% TFA/H\n2\nO, buffer B: 0.1% TFA/CH\n3\nCN)). Fractions judged to be of high purity were pooled and lyophilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurity of the final products was checked by analytical HPLC on a reversed phase column as stated above. Purity of all products was judged to be approximately 95 - 99%. All final products were also subjected to fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) or electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS). All products yielded the expected parent M+H ions within acceptable limits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be provided in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of preferred salts are those formed with pharmaceutically acceptable organic acids, e.g., acetic, lactic, maleic, citric, malic, ascorbic, succinic, benzoic, salicylic, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, trifluoroacetic, or pamoic acid, as well as polymeric acids such as tannic acid or carboxymethyl cellulose, and salts with inorganic acids, such as hydrohalic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid), sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid and the like. Any procedure for obtaining a pharmaceutically acceptable salt known to a skilled artisan can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the practice of the method of the present invention, an effective amount of any one of the peptides of this invention or a combination of any of the peptides of this invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is administered via any of the usual and acceptable methods known in the art, either singly or in combination. Administration can be, for example, once a day, once every three days or once a week. The compounds or compositions can thus be administered orally (e.g., buccal cavity), sublingually, parenterally (e.g., intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously), rectally (e.g., by suppositories or washings), transdermally (e.g., skin electroporation) or by inhalation (e.g., by aerosol), and in the form or solid, liquid or gaseous dosages, including tablets and suspensions. The administration can be conducted in a single unit dosage form with continuous therapy or in a single dose therapy ad libitum. The therapeutic composition can also be in the form of an oil emulsion or dispersion in conjunction with a lipophilic salt such as pamoic acid, or in the form of a biodegradable sustained-release composition for subcutaneous or intramuscular administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the method of the present invention is practiced when relief of symptoms is specifically required or perhaps imminent. Alternatively, the method of the present invention is effectively practiced as continuous or prophylactic treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful pharmaceutical carriers for the preparation of the compositions hereof, can be solids, liquids or gases; thus, the compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, suppositories, powders, enterically coated or other protected formulations (e.g. binding on ion-exchange resins or packaging in lipid-protein vesicles), sustained release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, and the like. The carrier can be selected from the various oils including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. Water, saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols are preferred liquid carriers, particularly (when isotonic with the blood) for injectable solutions. For example, formulations for intravenous administration comprise sterile aqueous solutions of the active ingredient(s) which are prepared by dissolving solid active ingredient(s) in water to produce an aqueous solution, and rendering the solution sterile. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, talc, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The compositions may be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical additives such as preservatives, stabilizing agents, wetting or emulsifying agents, salts for adjusting osmotic pressure, buffers and the like. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulation are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will, in any event, contain an effective amount of the active compound together with a suitable carrier so as to prepare the proper dosage form for proper administration to the recipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose of a compound of the present invention depends on a number of factors, such as, for example, the manner of administration, the age and the body weight of the subject, and the condition of the subject to be treated, and ultimately will be decided by the attending physician or veterinarian. Such an amount of the active compound as determined by the attending physician or veterinarian is referred to herein, and in the claims, as an \"effective amount\". For example, the dose for intranasal administration is typically in the range of about 0.001 to about 0.1 mg/kg body weight. In humans, the preferred subcutaneous dose based on peptide content is from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg; preferably from about 0.1 mg to about 15 mg. For the API, it would range from about 0.015 mg to about 100 mg; preferably from about 1 mg to about 100 mg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention will now be further described in the Examples which follow, which are intended as an illustration only and do not limit the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPREPARATION OF REAGENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmPEG\n\n\n\n\n30k\n\n\n\n\n-Mesylate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA I L round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, dean-stark trap, reflux condenser and argon (or nitrogen) inlet bubbler was charged with 100 g (3.34 mmol) of mPEG 30 kDa (obtained from Nippon Oil and Fat) and 500 mL of toluene.

The resin was treated with p- ((R, S)-α-(1-(9H-fluoren-9-yl)-methoxyformamido)-2, 4-dimethoxybenzyl)-phenoxyacetic acid (Fmoc-Linker) (7.01 g, 13.0 mmole), N-hydroxybenzotriazole (2.16g, 16.0 mmole), and diisopropyl-carbodiimide (2.04 ml, 13.0 mmol) in 100 mL 25% DMF/CH\n2\nCl\n2\n for 24 hours at room temperature. The resin was filtered and washed successively with 100 ml each of CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (two times), isopropanol (two times), DMF, and CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (three times). A Kaiser Ninhydrin analysis was negative. The resin was dried under vacuum to yield 16.12 g of Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin. A portion of this resin (3.5 mg) was subjected to Fmoc deprotection and quantitative UV analysis which indicated a loading of 0.56 mmol/g.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtocol for the synthesis of peptides by Applied Biosystem 433A synthesizer using Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor a 0.25 mmol scale peptide synthesis by Applied Biosystem 433A synthesizer (Foster City, CA), the FastMoc 0.25 mmole cycles were used with either the resin sampling or non resin sampling, 41 mL reaction vessel. The Fmoc-amino acid resin was dissolved with 2.1 g NMP, 2g of 0.45M HOBT/HBTU in DMF and 2M DIEA, then transferred to the reaction vessel. The basic FastMoc coupling cycle was represented by \"BADEIFD,\" wherein each letter represents a module (as defined by Applied Biosystems). For example:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB represents the module for Fmoc deprotection using 20% Piperidine/NMP and related washes and readings for 30 min (either UV monitoring or conductivity); A represents the module for activation of amino acid in cartridges with 0.45 M HBTU/HOBt and 2.0 M DIEA and mixing with N\n2\n bubbling; D represents the module for NMP washing of resin in the reaction vessel; E represents the module for transfer of the activated amino acid to the reaction vessel for coupling; I represents the module for a 10 minute waiting period with vortexing on and off of the reaction vessel; and F represents the module for cleaning cartridge, coupling for approximately 10 minutes and draining the reaction vessel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCouplings were typically extended by addition of module \"I\" once or multiple times. For example, double couplings were run by performing the procedure \"BADEIIADEIFD.\" Other modules were available such as c for methylene chloride washes and \"C\" for capping with acetic anhydride. Individual modules were also modifiable by, for example, changing the timing of various functions, such as transfer time, in order to alter the amount of solvent or reagents transferred. The cycles above were typically used for coupling one amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor synthesizing tetra peptides, however, the cycles were repeated and strung together. For example, BADEIIADEIFD was used to couple the first amino acid, followed by BADEIIADEIFD to couple the second amino acid, followed by BADEIIADEIFD to couple the third amino acid, followed by BADEIIADEIFD to couple the fourth amino acid, followed by BIDDcc for final deprotection and washing.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation of H-Ile-Lys-Pro-Glu-Ala-Pro-Gly-Glu-Asp-Ala-Ser-Pro-Glu-Glu-Leu-Asn-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Ala-Ser-Leu-Arg-His-Tyr-Leu-Asn-Leu-Val-The-Arg-Gln-Arg-Tyr-NH\n2\n (PYY \n3-36\n)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above peptide was synthesized using Fmoc chemistry on an Applied Biosystem 433A synthesizer. The synthesizer was programmed for double coupling using the modules described in Example 2. The synthesis was carried out on a 0.25 mmol scale using the Fmoc- Linker-BHA resin (450 mg, 0.25 mmol) from Example 1. At the end of the synthesis, the resin was transferred to a reaction vessel on a shaker for cleavage. The peptide was cleaved from the resin using 13.5 mL 97% TFA/ 3%H2O and 1.5mL triisopropylsilane for 180 minutes at room temperature. The deprotection solution was added to 100 mL cold ET\n2\nO, and washed with 1 mL TFA and 30 mL cold ET\n2\nO to precipitate the peptide. The peptide was centrifuged 2x50 mL polypropylene tubes. The precipitates from the individual tubes were combined in a single tube and washed 3 times with cold ET\n2\nO and dried in a desiccator under house vacuum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crude material was purified by preparative HPLC on a Pursuit C18-Column (250x50mm, 10µm particle size) and eluted with a linear gradient of 2-70%B (buffer A: 0.1 %TFA/H2O; buffer B: 0.1 % TFA/CH3CN) in 90 min., flow rate 60mL/min,and detection 220/280 nm.

The rats were given \nad libitum\n access to a high fat chow diet (HFD; 60% of dietary kcal as fat. Research Diets D12492) and water throughout the study. Following 7 weeks on the HFD, rats were sorted by body weight and caged singly. The rats were dosed prior to onset of dark cycle with vehicle (s.c.) or compound of Example 41 (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg, s.c.) once every two days for 3 weeks (N = 6-8 rats/group). Body weight was recorded on days indicated in \nFigure 23\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nData Analysis:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAll data shown are the mean ± standard error (s.e.m.). Statistical evaluation of the data was carried out using one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's test to determine where statistically significant differences existed between vehicle and drug treated groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferences were considered statistically significant at \nP\n<0.05.

The mice were housed in a temperature and humidity controlled environment with a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle, and given access to food (Purina rodent chow 5008) and water \nad libitum\n. The mice (12-weeks old) were pre-bled 4 days prior to study, and those within a narrow range of fasted blood glucose levels were selected for the study in order to minimize variability between vehicle control and drug-treated groups. The mice were administered vehicle (s.c.) or the compound of Example 41 (0.3, 1 and 1.6 mg/kg, s.c.) 28 hr prior to the oral glucose tolerance test (N = 10 mice/group). Blood samples were collected from tail clips following a 6 hr fast, for determination of baseline values (\nt\n = 0 min). The mice were then gavaged with an oral bolus of glucose (1 g/kg), and additional blood samples were collected at regular intervals (\nt\n = 30, 60 and 120 min) for glucose measurement. To analyze the effects of the compound of Example 41 on oral glucose tolerance the absolute difference in blood glucose from baseline (fasting blood glucose) was calculated for each time point.
