The invention as hereinbefore described. Description\n\n\n\n\n ISOXAZOLE / O-PYRIDINE DERIVATIVES WITH ETHYL AND ETHENYL LINKER\n\n\nThe present invention is concerned with isoxazole-pyridine derivatives having affinity and selectivity for GABA A α5 receptor, their manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as medicaments.\n\n\nIn particular, the present invention is concerned with isoxazole-pyridine derivatives of formula I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n , R\n3\n and L are as described below and in the claims.\n\n\nReceptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA A receptors, which are members of the ligand- gated ion channel superfamily and (2) GABA B receptors, which are members of the G-protein linked receptor family. The GABA A receptor complex which is a membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer is composed principally of α, β and γ subunits.\n\n\nPresently a total number of 21 subunits of the GABA A receptor have been cloned and sequenced. Three types of subunits (α, β and γ) are required for the construction of recombinant GABA A receptors which most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological functions of native GABA A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepine binding site lies between the α and γ subunits. Among the recombinant GABA A receptors, αlβ2γ2 mimics many effects of the classical type-I BzR subtypes, whereas α2β2γ2, α3β2γ2 and α5β2γ2 ion channels are termed type-II BzR.\n\n\nIt has been shown by McNamara and Skelton in Psychobiology, 1993, 21 :101-108 that the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist β-CCM enhance spatial learning in the Morris \n\n watermaze. However, β-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists are proconvulsant or convulsant which prevents their use as cognition enhancing agents in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective within the GABA A receptor subunits, whereas a GABA A α5 receptor partial or full inverse agonist which is relatively free of activity at GABA A αl and/or α2 and/or α3 receptor binding sites can be used to provide a medicament which is useful for enhancing cognition with reduced or without proconvulsant activity. It is also possible to use GABA A α5 inverse agonists which are not free of activity at GABA A αl and/or α2 and/or α3 receptor binding sites but which are functionally selective for α5 containing subunits. However, inverse agonists which are selective for GABA A α5 subunits and are relatively free of activity at GABA A αl, α2 and α3 receptor binding sites are preferred.\n\n\nLiterature has been published to establish the link between GABA A α5 subunits and the treatment of various diseases of the Central Nervous System, like Neuroscience Letts., 2005, 381, 108-13, Neuropsychobiology, 2001, 43(3), 141-44, Amer.

The cell pellets were resuspended in Krebs-tris buffer and homogenized by polytron for ca. 15 sec on ice. Protein was measured (Bradford method, Bio-Rad) and aliquots of 1 mL were prepared and stored at -80 \n0\nC.\n\n\nRadioligand binding assays were carried out in a volume of 200 mL (96-well plates) which contained 100 mL of cell membranes, [3H]flumazenil at a concentration of 1 nM for αl, α2, α3 subunits and 0.5 nM for α5 subunits and the test compound in the range of 10-10 \n3\n x 10\n\"6\n M.

Assays were incubated to equilibrium for 1 hour at 4 \n0\nC and harvested onto GF/C uni-filters (Packard) by filtration using a Packard harvester and washing with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris; pH 7.5). After drying, filter-retained radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting.
