Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to neuropeptide Y receptor antagonists which contain a heteroarylthiomethylpyridine derivative as an active ingredient. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a novel heteroarylthiomethylpyridine derivative.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nNeuropeptide Y (hereinafter referred to as NPY), which is a peptide containing 36 amino acids, was first isolated in 1982 from porcine brain by Tatemoto et al. [for example, non-patent document 1]. NPY is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems and has a variety of in vivo actions as one of the peptides most abundantly present in the nervous system. That is, in the central nervous system, NPY acts as an aperitive and significantly promotes a fat accumulation via secretion of various hormones or actions of the nervous system. A continuous intracerebroventricular administration of NPY has been known to induce obesity and insulin resistance based on the above actions. NPY is also associated with emotional control and the actions of the central autonomic nervous system. In addition, in the peripheral nervous system, NPY is present together with norepinephrine in the sympathetic nerve ending and associated with the tonicity of the sympathetic nervous system. A peripheral administration of NPY has been known to cause vasoconstriction and enhance actions of other vasoconstrictors including norepinephrine (for example, non-patent document 2, non-patent document 3, non-patent document 4, non-patent document 5). The action of NPY is expressed when it is bound to an NPY receptor present in the central or peripheral nervous system. Therefore, inhibition of the binding of NPY to the NPY receptor allows prevention of the expression of the action of NPY. Consequently, compounds antagonizing the binding of NPY to the NPY receptor can be expected to be useful in the prevention or treatment of various diseases associated with NPY, for example, cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis, nephropathy, cardiac diseases and angiospasm; diseases of central nervous system such as bulimia, depression, epilepsy, anxiety, alcoholism and dementia; metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and hormone abnormality, or glaucoma (for example, non-patent document 6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, derivatives structurally similar to NPY are described to be bound to an NPY receptor and antagonize the activity of NPY (for example, patent document 1, patent document 2, non-patent document 7).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, certain peptides have been recently found to inhibit binding of NPY to an NPY receptor (patent document 3, patent document 4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, such peptidic compounds have big problems in developing the compounds as medicaments. That is, such high-molecular-weight peptides generally have in vivo instability and are also short-acting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, such compounds are included in a compound group that can be hardly expected to have oral absorbability and intracerebral transferability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast, certain nonpeptidic compounds have been recently found to inhibit binding of NPY to an NPY receptor and antagonize the activity of NPY (for example, patent document 5, patent document 6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, such nonpeptidic NPY antagonists are structurally different from a compound according to the present invention and give no clue to the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, as a compound having an antagonistic action to NPY Y1, for example, the following compound (A):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nis disclosed (patent document 7).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, a compound according to the present invention contains neither an allyloxycarbonylaminophenyl nor a thiadiazolyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound according to the present invention is also more useful as a medicament because of having a high NPY Y1 antagonist activity and/or having a low human P-glycoprotein substrate specificity and being inhibited from elimination from the brain, compared to the compound (A).\n\n \n \n \nnon-patent document 1: Nature, vol. 296, p. 659 (1982)\n \nnon-patent document 2: International Journal of Obesity, vol. 19, p. 517 (1995)\n \nnon-patent document 3: Endocrinology, vol. 133, p. 1753 (1993)\n \nnon-patent document 4: British Journal of Pharmacology, vol. 95, p. 419 (1988)\n \nnon-patent document 5: Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology, vol. 27, p. 308 (2006)\n \nnon-patent document 6: Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, vol. 15, p. 153 (1994)\n \nnon-patent document 7: J.

In accordance with the present invention, it is also desirable to provide a compound which is a candidate compound for a PET ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result of extensive research, the present inventors found a novel heteroarylthiomethyl pyridine compound having a high NPY Y1 antagonist activity and/or a low human P-glycoprotein substrate specificity and the invention was thus accomplished.

(I) according to the present invention has an antagonistic action to NPY, it is useful for treatment and/or prevention of various diseases associated with NPY, for example, cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis, nephropathy, cardiac diseases and angiospasm; diseases of central nervous system such as bulimia, depression, epilepsy, anxiety, alcoholism and dementia; metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and hormone abnormality, or glaucoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound (I) according to the present invention also has a low human P-glycoprotein substrate specificity and thus is useful as a medicament.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound (I) according to the present invention containing \n11\nC-labeled C or \n18\nF-labeled F is useful as a PET ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA heteroarylthiomethylpyridine derivative according to the present invention represented by the formula (I), or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, has a potent antagonistic action to NPY, and it is thus useful for treatment and/or prevention of various diseases associated with NPY, for example, cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, nephropathy, cardiac diseases and angiospasm; cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis, nephropathy, cardiac diseases and angiospasm; diseases of central nervous system such as bulimia,

After about 1 hour, the basolateral and apical solutions were replaced by an assay buffer solution (0.5 mL) and a 1 μM test compound-containing assay buffer solution (0.5 mL), respectively, and the transport experiment was started for transportation from Apical to Basolateral (from A to B). After 3 hours, each 50 μL was collected as a measuring sample from both of the apical and basolateral sides. The reverse operation thereof was carried out for transportation from Basolateral to Apical (from B to A). A test compound addition side was “donor”, and the other side was “receiver.” The formation of the cell single layer film was confirmed by previously adding 0.5 μM Dextran Texas Red (3000 MW) together with the test compound to the donor side and terminating incubation, followed by measuring a leakage level to the receiver side with a fluorescence plate reader (Ex 590 nm to Em 635 nm). After termination of the transport experiment, an equal amount of acetonitrile containing the internal standard was added to each measuring sample. The measuring samples were measured using LC-MS/MS to calculate the concentrations of the test compounds by a relative calibration curve method. The permeability coefficients of the test compounds transported in each of from A to B and from B to A were calculated (Papp: Expression 1). The ratios of the permeability coefficients between A to B and B to A were also determined (BA/AB: Expression 2). BA/AB was considered to be an index of P-glycoprotein (p-gp) substrate specificity [see Drug Metabolism and Disposition, vol. 31, p. 1251, (2003)].

When a compound of the present invention is clinically used, a pharmaceutically acceptable additive may be also added, depending on its dosage form, to produce various preparations, followed by administering the preparations. Such additives, for which various additives that are used typically in the field of preparation can be used, include, for example, gelatin, lactose, saccharose, titanium oxide, starch, crystalline cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, corn starch, microcrystalline wax, white petrolatum, magnesium aluminometasilicate, anhydrous calcium phosphate, citric acid, trisodium citrate, hydroxypropylcellulose, sorbitol, sorbitan fatty acid ester, polysorbates, sucrose fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene, hydrogenated castor oil, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, magnesium stearate, light anhydrous silicic acid, talc, vegetable oil, benzyl alcohol, gum arabic, propylene glycol, polyalkylene glycol, cyclodextrin and hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of dosage forms as formulated mixtures with such additives include solid preparations such as tablets, capsules, granules, powder and suppositories; and liquid preparations such as syrups, elixirs and injectables. Such preparations may be formulated according to the techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation. Liquid preparations may be in the form of preparations which are dissolved or suspended in water or other appropriate media just before use. In the case of injectable preparations in particular, they may be dissolved or suspended in physiological saline or glucose solution if necessary, optionally together with a buffer and a preservative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen compounds of the present invention are used clinically, for example, a daily dose for an adult is 0.01-100 mg/kg, preferably 0.03-1 mg/kg in a single dose or in divided doses when administered orally, or 0.001-10 mg/kg, preferably 0.001-0.1 mg/kg, more preferably 0.01-0.1 mg/kg, in a single dose or in divided doses when administered parenterally, though the dose and the frequency of dosage may vary depending upon the sex, age, body weight, the severity of condition of a patient, and the type and range of the desired therapeutic effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn ordinarily skilled physician, veterinarian or clinician can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, suppress or arrest the progress of diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch preparations may contain a compound of the present invention at a rate of 1.0-100%, preferably 1.0-60%, by weight of the total drug. Such preparations may also contain other therapeutically-effective compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with other agents useful for treating metabolic and/or eating disorders. The individual components of such combinations can be administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single preparations. The present invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term “administering” herein is to be interpreted accordingly. It will be understood that the scope of combinations of the compounds of this invention with other agents useful for treating metabolic and/or eating disorders includes in principle any combination with any pharmaceutical composition useful for treating metabolic and/or eating disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabetes mellitus is caused by multiple factors and is characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose (hyperglycemia) in the fasting state. There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes mellitus: type 1 diabetes mellitus, or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) caused by hyposecretion of insulin which is a hormone regulating glucose utilization, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), wherein patients exhibit hyperinsulinemia (plasma insulin levels that are similar or even elevated in comparison with non-diabetic subjects), while at the same time demonstrating hyperglycemia. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is typically treated with exogenous insulin administered via injection. However, type 2 diabetes mellitus often exhibits the phenomena of aggravating insulin resistance, such that the effect of insulin in stimulating glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, namely, muscle, liver and adipose tissues, is diminished. In patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the plasma insulin levels, even when they are elevated, are insufficient to overcome the pronounced insulin resistance, resulting in hyperglycemia. Therefore, the treatment with single administration of exogenous insulin becomes difficult.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsulin resistance is not yet completely understood. Resistance to insulin results in insufficient activation of glucose uptake, diminished oxidation of glucose and storage of glycogen in muscle, inadequate repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and inadequate glucose production and secretion by the liver. The persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia that occurs in diabetes mellitus is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is at increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications, for example, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-insulin dependent diabetes is also associated with cardiac hypertrophy, in particular left ventricular hypertrophy (Devereux, R. B., Circulation, 101:2271-2276 (2000)). Cardiac hypertrophy, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, is due to the response of the heart to chronic pressure or intravascular volume overload. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is characterized by thickening of the left ventricular wall, including increased left ventricular mass and increased left ventricular wall thickness, and is defined as a left ventricular mass index exceeding 131 g/m\n2 \nof the body surface area in men, and 100 g/m\n2 \nin women (Savage et al., The Framingham Study, Circulation, 75 (1 Pt 2): 26-33 (1987)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLeft ventricular hypertrophy is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases, such as congestive heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, sudden death and stroke. Therefore, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular risk. The incidence of morbid events in patients with progression of left ventricular hypertrophy has been reported to be greater than that in patients with regression of left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCurrent treatments for hypertrophy include non-pharmacological interventions, such as weight reduction, sodium restriction and aerobic physical exercise, can reduce left ventricular mass (Ghali, J. K. et al., American Journal of Geriatric Cardiology, 6:38-49 (1997)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany patients who have insulin resistance but have not yet developed type 2 diabetes mellitus are also at a risk of developing metabolic syndrome, also referred to as syndrome X or pluri-metabolic syndrome. The period of 5 to 10 years preceding the development of impaired glucose tolerance is associated with a number of hormonal imbalances, which give rise to an enlargement of visceral fat mass, hypertension, insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia (Bjornstop, P., Current Topics in Diabetes Research, eds. Belfore, F., Bergman, R. N., and Molinath, G. M., Front Diabetes, Basel, Karger, 12:182-192 (1993)). Similarly, metabolic syndrome is characterized by insulin resistance, along with enlargement of visceral fat mass, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, syndrome X, low HDL and high VLDL. Although the causal relationship between the various components of metabolic syndrome remains to be confirmed, insulin resistance is likely to play an important role (Requen, G M., et al., N. Eng. J. Med. 334:374-381 (1996); Despres, J-P., et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 334:952-957 (1996); Wajchenberg, B. L., et al., Diabetes/Metabolism Rev. 10:19-29 (1994)). Metabolic syndrome patients, whether or not they develop diabetes mellitus, are at increased risk of developing the cardiovascular complications listed above. Associations have been recently reported to be also found between left ventricular hypertrophy and metabolic syndrome (Marcus, R. et al. Circulation, 90:928-936 (1994); Lind, L. et al., J Hypertens. 13:433-38 (1995); Paolisso, G et al., Am J Hypertens., 10:1250-1256 (1997)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nType 2 diabetes mellitus is treated with a variety of therapeutic agents including PPAR agonists such as glitazones; biguanides; protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B inhibitors; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors; insulin; insulin mimetics; sulfonylureas; meglitinides; α-glucoside hydrolase inhibitors; and α-amylase inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreasing the plasma level of insulin by administration of sulfonylureas (for example tolbutamide and glipizide) or meglitinides, which stimulate the pancreatic β-cells to secrete more insulin, and by injection of insulin when sulfonylureas or meglitinides become ineffective, can result in insulin concentrations high enough to stimulate insulin-resistant tissues. However, hypoglycemia, dangerously low levels of plasma glucose, can result, and increasing insulin resistance due to the even higher plasma insulin levels can occur. The biguanides increase insulin sensitivity resulting in some correction of hyperglycemia. Alpha-amylase inhibitors inhibit the enzymatic degradation of starch or glycogen into maltose, have the action of delaying absorption of glucose in the intestine, and also reduces the amounts of bioavailable sugars. Metformin monotherapy is often used for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus patients who also develop obesity and/or dyslipidemia. Lack of appropriate response to metformin will be followed by treatment with sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, insulin or alpha glucosidase inhibitors. However, the two biguanides, phenformin and metformin, can also induce lactic acidosis and nausea/diarrhea, respectively. Alpha glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose, causes intestinal functional disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glitazones, also known as thiazolidinediones (such as 5-benzylthiazolidine-2,4-diones), are a more recently described class of compounds with potential for a novel mode of action in ameliorating many symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These agents, which are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) gamma subtype, substantially increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of type 2 diabetes mellitus, resulting in partial or complete correction of the elevated plasma levels of glucose without inducing hypoglycemia. Newer PPAR agonists that are being developed for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or dyslipidemia are agonists of one or more of the PPAR alpha, gamma and delta subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, treatment of diabetes mellitus with PPARγ agonists sometimes results in cardiac hypertrophy, or an increase in heart weight. Recent labeling revisions for Avandia (rosiglitazone maleate), a PPARγ agonist, suggest that patients may experience fluid retention and volume-related events, such as edema and congestive heart failure. Cardiac hypertrophy related to PPARγ agonist treatment is likely to be typically treated by withdrawing PPAR treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus also typically includes physical exercise, weight control and dieting. While physical exercise and reductions in dietary intake of calories will dramatically improve the diabetic condition, compliance with this treatment is very poor because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption, especially of foods containing high amounts of saturated fat. Furthermore, weight reduction by increased exercise is difficult for most patients with diabetes mellitus because the patients may also develop related symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbnormal glucose homeostasis is also associated directly or indirectly with obesity, hypertension and lipidosis. Obesity also increases the likelihood of insulin resistance, and increases the likelihood that the resulting insulin resistance will increase with increasing body weight. Therefore, therapeutic control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, obesity and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObesity, which can be defined as a body weight more than 20% above the ideal body weight, is a major health concern in Western societies. It is estimated that one out of three adults in the United States is overweight or obese. Obesity is the result of a positive energy balance, as a consequence of increased ratio of caloric intake to energy expenditure. [B. Staels et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270 (27), 15958 (1995); F. Lonnquist et al., Nature Medicine 1 (9), 950 (1995)]. Although the molecular factors regulating food intake and body weight balance are incompletely understood, several genetic factors have been identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEpidemiological studies have shown that increasing degrees of overweight and obesity are important predictors of decreased life expectancy. Obesity causes or exacerbates many health problems, both independently and in association with other diseases. The medical problems associated with obesity, which can be serious and life-threatening, include: type 2 diabetes mellitus; hypertension; hyperinsulinism; insulin resistance; lipidosis; hyperlipidemia; endometrial, breast, prostate, kidney and large intestine cancers; degenerative arthritis; respiratory complications, such as non-obstructive sleep apnea syndrome; gallstone disease; arteriosclerosis; cardiac disease; abnormal heart rhythms; and arrhythmia (Kopelman, P. G., Nature 404, 635-643 (2000)). Obesity is also associated with metabolic syndrome, circulatory disorder such as cardiac hypertrophy, in particular left ventricular hypertrophy, premature death, a significant increase in mortality and morbidity from stroke, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease and sudden death.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbdominal obesity has been linked with a high risk of coronary artery disease, and with three of its major risk factors: high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus that starts in adulthood, and hyperlipidemia. Losing weight dramatically reduces these risks. Abdominal obesity is further closely associated with abnormal glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and other disorders associated with metabolic syndrome (syndrome X), such as decreased levels of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and increased levels of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (Montague et al., Diabetes, 2000, 49:883-888).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObesity and obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, are often treated by encouraging patients to lose weight by reducing their food intake or by increasing their exercise level, thereby increasing their energy output. A sustained weight loss of 5% to 10% of body weight can lead to improvement of obesity-related diseases such as diabetes mellitus, left ventricular hypertrophy, degenerative arthritis and cardiorespiratory dysfunction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWeight loss drugs used for the treatment of obesity include orlistat (Davidson, M. H. et al. (1999) JAMA 281:235-42), dexfenfluramine (Guy Grand, B. et al. (1989) Lancet 2:1142-5), sibutramine (Bray, G. A. et al. (1999) Obes. Res. &:189-98] and phentermine (Douglas, A. et al. (1983) Int. J. Obes. 7:591-5). However, the side effects of such anti-obesity agents may limit their use. Dexfenfluramine was withdrawn from the market because of suspected valvular heart disease; orlistat is limited by gastrointestinal side effects; and the use of sibutramine is limited by its cardiovascular side effects which have led to reports of deaths and its withdrawal from the market in Italy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “diabetes mellitus,” as used herein, includes both insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (i.e., IDDM, also known as type 1 diabetes mellitus) and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (i.e., NIDDM, also known as type 2 diabetes mellitus). The compositions of the present invention are useful for treating both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The compositions are especially effective for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. The compositions of the present invention are also useful especially for treating and/or preventing gestational diabetes mellitus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds or combination compositions of the present invention are efficacious for treatment of diabetes mellitus. One outcome of the treatment may be decreasing the glucose level in a subject with elevated glucose levels. Another outcome of the treatment may be decreasing insulin levels in a subject with elevated insulin levels. Another outcome of the treatment is decreasing plasma triglycerides in a subject with elevated plasma triglycerides. Another outcome of the treatment is decreasing LDL cholesterol in a subject with high LDL cholesterol levels. Another outcome of the treatment is increasing HDL cholesterol in a subject with low HDL cholesterol levels. Another outcome of the treatment is increasing insulin sensitivity. Another outcome of the treatment may be enhancing glucose tolerance in a subject with abnormal glucose tolerance. Another outcome of the treatment may be decreasing insulin resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds or combination compositions of the present invention are efficacious for prevention of diabetes mellitus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “hypertension” as used herein includes essential hypertension wherein the cause is not known or where hypertension is due to at least one cause, such as changes in both the heart and blood vessels; and secondary hypertension wherein the cause is known. Causes of secondary hypertension include, but are not limited to, obesity; kidney disease; hormonal disorders; use of certain drugs, such as oral contraceptives, adrenocorticosteroids, cyclosporines, and the like. The term “hypertension” encompasses high blood pressure, in which both the systolic and diastolic pressure levels are elevated, and isolated systolic hypertension, in which only the systolic pressure is elevated to greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg, while the diastolic pressure is less than 90 mm Hg. One outcome of treatment is decreasing blood pressure in a subject with high blood pressure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLipidosis or disorders of lipid metabolism, include various conditions characterized by abnormal concentrations of one or more lipids (for example, cholesterol and triglycerides), and/or apolipoproteins (for example, apolipoproteins A, B, C and E), and/or lipoproteins (for example, macromolecular complexes formed by the lipid and the apolipoprotein that allow lipids to circulate in blood, such as LDL, VLDL and IDL). Hyperlipidemia is associated with abnormally high levels of lipids, LDL and VLDL cholesterol, and/or triglycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “metabolic syndrome,” also known as syndrome X, is denned in the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATP-III) (E. S. Ford et al., JAMA, vol. 287 (3), Jan. 16, 2002, pp 356-359). Briefly, a person is defined as having metabolic syndrome if the person has three or more of the following symptoms: abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose. The criteria for these are defined in ATP-III.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “left ventricular hypertrophy” (LVH) as used herein includes three patterns of left ventricular hypertrophy that have been identified based on left ventricular mass index (LVMI=left ventricular mass (g) divided by body surface area (m\n2\n)) and relative wall thickness (RWT=2× posterior wall thickness/left ventricular end diastolic diameter). The three patterns means: concentric LVH which is typically exemplified by a left ventricular mass index of 144 and a relative wall thickness of 0.52; eccentric LVH which is typically exemplified by a left ventricular mass index of 136 and a relative wall thickness of 0.38; and concentric left ventricular remodeling which is typically exemplified by a LVMI of 93 and a relative wall thickness of 0.38. Normal LVMI is typically 85, and normal RWT is typically about 0.36. Patients with concentric left ventricular (LV) remodeling have a cardiovascular risk intermediate between those with normal left ventricular structure and those with left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne outcome of treatment of diabetes mellitus while minimizing cardiac hypertrophy or left ventricular hypertrophy may be a decrease in ventricular mass. Another outcome of treatment of diabetes mellitus while minimizing cardiac hypertrophy or left ventricular hypertrophy may be a decrease in the rate of increase of ventricular mass. Another outcome of treatment of diabetes mellitus while minimizing cardiac hypertrophy or left ventricular hypertrophy may be a decrease in left ventricular wall thickness. Another outcome of treatment of diabetes mellitus while minimizing cardiac hypertrophy or left ventricular hypertrophy may be a decrease in the rate of increase in left ventricular wall thickness.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “obesity” as used herein is a condition in which there is an excess of body fat. The definition of obesity is based on the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is calculated as body weight per height in meters squared (kg/m\n2\n). In Europe and the U.S.A., “obesity” means a condition whereby a healthy subject has a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m\n2\n, or a condition whereby a subject with at least one complication has a BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m\n2\n. A “subject at risk of obesity” means a healthy subject with a BMI of 25 kg/m\n2 \nor more but less than 30 kg/m\n2 \nor a subject with at least one complication with a BMI of 25 kg/m\n2 \nor more but less than 27 kg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe risks associated with obesity occur at a low Body Mass Index (BMI) in Asians, compared to that in Westerners. In Asian countries, including Japan, “obesity” means a condition whereby a subject with at least one obesity-induced or obesity-related complication, that requires weight reduction or that would be improved by weight reduction, has a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m\n2\n. In Asian countries, a “subject at risk of obesity” is a subject with a BMI of 23 kg/m\n2 \nor more but less than 25 kg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “obesity” is meant to encompass all of the above definitions of obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObesity-induced or obesity-related complications include, but are not limited to, diabetes mellitus, abnormal glucose tolerance, insulin-resistance syndrome, dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyperuricemia, gout, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, sleep apnea syndrome, Pickwickian syndrome, fatty liver, cerebral infarction, cerebral thrombosis, transient ischemic attack, orthopedic disorders, degenerative arthritis, lumbago, emmeniopathy and infertility. In particular, complications include: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, abnormal glucose tolerance, cardiovascular diseases, sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes mellitus and other obesity-related conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment of obesity and obesity-related disorders means the administration of the compounds or mixture compositions of the present invention to reduce or maintain the body weight of an obese patient. One outcome of treatment may be reducing the body weight of an obese patient relative to that subject's body weight immediately before the administration of the compounds or mixture compositions according to the present invention. Another outcome of treatment may be maintaining body weight previously lost as a result of diet, exercise, or pharmacotherapy. Another outcome of treatment may be decreasing the occurrence of and/or the severity of obesity-related diseases. The treatment may result in a reduction in food and/or calorie intake, including a reduction in total food intake, or a reduction of intake of specific components of the diet such as carbohydrates or fats; and/or the inhibition of nutrient absorption; and/or the inhibition of the reduction of metabolic rate. The treatment may also result in an alteration of metabolic rate, such as an inhibition of the reduction of metabolic rate or an increase in metabolic rate; and/or in minimization of the metabolic resistance that typically results from weight loss.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrevention of obesity and obesity-related disorders means the administration of the compounds or mixture compositions of the present invention to reduce or maintain the body weight of a subject at risk of obesity. One outcome of prevention may be reducing the body weight of a subject at risk of obesity relative to that subject's body weight immediately before the administration of the compounds or mixture compositions according to the present invention. Another outcome of prevention may be maintaining body weight previously lost as a result of diet, exercise, or pharmacotherapy. Another outcome of prevention may be preventing obesity from occurring if the treatment is administered prior to the onset of obesity in a subject at risk of obesity. Another outcome of prevention may be decreasing the occurrence and/or severity of obesity-related disorders if the treatment is administered prior to the onset of obesity in a subject at risk of obesity. Moreover, if treatment is commenced in already obese subjects, such treatment may prevent the occurrence, progression or severity of obesity-related disorders, such as, but not limited to, arteriosclerosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovary syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, degenerative arthritis, dermatological disorders, hypertension, insulin resistance, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and gallstone disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “atherosclerosis” as used herein encompasses vascular diseases and conditions that are recognized and understood by physicians practicing in the relevant fields of medicine. Atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease (also known as coronary artery disease or ischemic heart disease), cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vasodilatation diseases are all clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis and are therefore encompassed by the terms “atherosclerosis” and “atherosclerotic disease.” The composition of a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-obesity agent in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-diabetic agent may be administered to prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence or recurrence, where the potential exists, of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or intermittent claudication. Coronary heart disease events are intended to include CHD death, myocardial infarction (such as heart attack) and revascularization procedures. Cerebrovascular events are intended to include ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (also known as cerebrovascular accidents) and transient ischemic attacks. Intermittent claudication is a clinical manifestation of peripheral vessel disease. The term “atherosclerotic disease event” as used herein is intended to encompass coronary heart disease events, cerebrovascular events and intermittent claudication. It is intended that persons who have previously experienced one or more non-fatal atherosclerotic disease events are those for whom the potential for recurrence of such an event exists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCircadian rhythms affect physiological parameters. Physiological parameters include rest-activity, sleep-wake cycles, body temperature, rhythms in hormone levels, and oscillations in general physiology. When these parameters are out of synchrony with the daily clock, a circadian rhythm imbalance occurs which can affect physiology, performance on a variety of tasks and one's emotional well being. The present invention is useful, for example, in the prevention or treatment of conditions associated with circadian rhythmicity as well as mental and physical disorders associated with travel across time zones and with rotating shift-work schedules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the prevention or treatment of a circadian rhythm disorder in a mammal, including syndrome, shift-work sleep disorder, delayed sleep-phase syndrome, advanced sleep-phase syndrome, and non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for shortening the time of re-entrainment (return to normal entrainment of the circadian rhythms; synchronized to the environmental light-dark cycle) in a subject following an irregular shift in the sleep-wake cycle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for alleviating the effects of jet lag in a traveler. The purpose of this embodiment is to assist the body to adjust physiologically to the changes in sleep and eating patterns when crossing several time zones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method for resetting the internal circadian clock in a patient to match the patient's current activity/sleep cycle. For example, such a method is effective for shift workers changing from a day to a night shift or vice versa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a method for enhancing or improving sleep quality by increasing sleep efficiency and augmenting sleep maintenance. In addition, the present invention provides a method for preventing and treating sleep disorders and sleep disturbances. The present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition for enhancing or improving sleep quality and increasing sleep efficiency and sleep maintenance. The present invention is useful for the treatment of sleep disorders, including Disorders of Initiating and Maintaining Sleep (insomnias) (“DIMS”) which can arise from psychophysiological causes, as a consequence of psychiatric disorders (particularly related to anxiety), from drugs and alcohol use and abuse (particularly during drug and alcohol withdrawal stages), childhood onset DIMS, nocturnal myoclonus and restless legs and non specific REM (eye movement) disturbances as seen in ageing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following outcomes in a patient which are provided by the present invention may be related to improvement in sleep quality: an increase in value which is calculated from the time that a subject sleeps divided by the time that a subject is attempting to sleep; a decrease in sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep); a decrease in the number of awakenings during sleep; a decrease in the time spent awake following the initial onset of sleep; an increase in the total amount of sleep; an increase the amount and percentage of REM sleep; an increase in the duration and occurrence of REM sleep; a reduction in the fragmentation of REM sleep; an increase in the amount and percentage of slow-wave (for example, stage 3 or 4) sleep; an increase in the amount and percentage of stage 2 sleep; a decrease in the number of awakenings, especially in the early morning; an increase in daytime alertness; and increased sleep maintenance. Secondary outcomes which may be provided by the present invention include enhanced cognitive function and increased memory retention. “Method for enhancing the quality of sleeps” means a method that results in outcomes in a patient which may be related to enhancement in sleep quality, including, but not limited to, the outcomes correlated to enhancement of sleep quality as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is further useful for the prevention and treatment of sleep disorders and sleep disturbances including sleep problems associated with insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep apnea syndrome, narcolepsy, nocturnal myoclonus, REM sleep interruptions, jet-lag, shift workers' sleep disturbances, dysomnias, noctiphobia, night eating syndrome, insomnias associated with depression or with emotional/mood disorders, dysfunctions associated with sleep (parasomnias), as well as sleep walking and enuresis, as well as sleep disorders which accompany aging. Sleep disorders and sleep disturbances are generally characterized by difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep or in obtaining restful or enough sleep.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, certain drugs may also cause reductions in REM sleep as a side effect and the present invention may be used to correct those types of sleeping disorders as well. The present invention would also be of benefit in the treatment of syndromes such as fibromyalgia which are manifested by non-restorative sleep and muscle pain or sleep apnea which is associated with respiratory disturbances during sleep. It will be clear that the present invention is not limited to just sleep disorders and sleep disturbances, but is applicable to a wide variety of conditions which result from a diminished quality of sleep.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention and compositions thereof, or combinations of these and other drugs, are useful for treating and preventing these conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present invention, a subject mammal is preferably a human. Although the present invention is applicable for both old and young people, it may find greater application in elderly people. Further, although the invention may be employed to enhance the sleep of healthy people, it may be especially beneficial for enhancing the sleep quality of people suffering from sleep disorders or sleep disturbances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the compounds of the formula I, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominately found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of the formula I. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (\n1\nH) and deuterium (\n2\nH). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched compounds within the formula I, can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and/or intermediates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions according to the present invention may be used in combination with other drugs that may also be useful in the treatment, prevention or control of disorders, such as hypertension, hypertension associated with obesity, hypertension-related disorders, cardiac hypertrophy, left ventricular hypertrophy, and metabolic syndrome, obesity and obesity-related disorders. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefore, concurrently or sequentially with a composition according to the present invention. When a composition of the present invention is used concurrently with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the composition of the present invention is preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, the combination therapy also includes therapies in which the composition according to the present invention and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping dosage schedules. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the composition according to the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a composition of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of other active ingredients that may be administered in combination with a composition according to the present invention, and either administered separately or in the same pharmaceutical composition, include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) anti-diabetic agents such as (i) PPARγ agonists such as glitazones (for example ciglitazone, darglitazone, englitazone, isaglitazone (MCC-555), pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, troglitazone, BRL49653, CLX-0921 and 5-BTZD), GW-0207, LG-100641 and LY-300512;
